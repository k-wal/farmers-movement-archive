National civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and William Barber, joined multiple local faith leaders offering prayers and remarks outside the church that was largely destroyed when a white mob descended on the prosperous Black neighborhood in 1921, burning, killing, looting and leveling a 35-square-block area. Estimates of the death toll range from dozens to 300.  Barber, a civil and economic rights activist, said he was "humbled even to stand on this holy ground."  "You can kill the people but you cannot kill the voice of the blood."  Although the church was nearly destroyed in the massacre, parishioners continued to meet in the basement, and it was rebuilt several years later, becoming a symbol of the resilience of Tulsa's Black community. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.  As the ceremony came to an end, participants put their hands on the prayer wall along the side of the sanctuary while a soloist sung "Lift Every Voice and Sing." Traffic hummed on a nearby interstate that cuts through the Greenwood District, which was rebuilt after the massacre but slowly deteriorated 50 years later after homes were taken by eminent domain as part of urban renewal in the 1970s.  Monday's slate of activities commemorating the massacre was supposed to culminate with a "Remember & Rise" headline event at nearby ONEOK Field, featuring Grammy-award-winning singer and songwriter John Legend and a keynote address from voting rights activist Stacey Abrams. But that event was scrapped late last week after an agreement couldn't be reached over monetary payments to three survivors of the deadly attack, a situation that highlighted broader debates over reparations for racial injustice.  Disagreements among Black leaders in Tulsa over the handling of commemoration events and millions of dollars in donations have led to two different groups planning separate slates of events marking the massacre's 100-year anniversary. In addition to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial Commission, the Black Wall Street Legacy Festival scheduled a series of separate events over the Memorial Day weekend.  In a statement tweeted Sunday, Legend didn't specifically address the cancellation of the event, but said: "The road to restorative justice is crooked and rough - and there is space for reasonable people to disagree about the best way to heal the collective trauma of white supremacy. But one thing that is not up for debate - one fact we must hold with conviction - is that the path to reconciliation runs through truth and accountability."  On Monday night, the Centennial Commission plans to host a candlelight vigil downtown to honor the victims of the massacre, and President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit Tulsa on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/hundreds-gather-at-historic-tulsa-churchs-prayer-wall/articleshow/83126387.cms||---

IAF helicopters also were pressed into the fire-fighting operation to control the massive fire in Ghordi block of Udhampur district. According to police, “The fire broke out on Sunday night in Daya Dhar forests and later it engulfed a vast area due to high temperature. Hundreds of pine trees and undergrowth were damaged in the fire.” Initially, local volunteers from nearby villages, police and firefighters from the Forest Protection Force tried to control the blaze but could not contain it, following which help was sought from the IAF and the Army. Responding to a call from Udhampur deputy commissioner Indu Kanwal Chib for help, IAF deployed its helicopters to help douse the fire early on Monday morning. The exact reason for the fire could not be ascertained, but it is believed that the fire could have started after dry grass caught fire due to rising mercury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iaf-army-join-fire-fighters-to-douse-forest-fire-in-udhampur/articleshow/83125722.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Noted Pakistan journo Hamid Mir taken off air after anti-military remarks||ISLAMABAD: A prominent Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir has been taken off air indefinitely, days after making hard-hitting remarks against the country’s powerful military establishment following an attack by unknown assailants on Asad Toor, a journalist considered to be a strong critic of the army and its intelligence service, at his apartment in Islamabad. Mir, who had been hosting a popular talk show ‘Capital Talk’, on Geo TV for nearly two decades, himself broke the news on Monday, saying he was expecting the ban. “Nothing new for me. I was banned twice in the past. Lost jobs twice. Survived assassination attempts but cannot stop raising voice for the rights given in the constitution. This time I’m ready for any consequences and ready to go at any extent because they (a reference to army and ISI) are threatening my family,” Mir posted on Twitter. According to the Geo management, the anchorperson will remain part of the Jang Group, but is being sent on ‘leave’ and will not appear on TV for an indefinite period. The development drew sharp criticism from media persons and several journalists stepped forward to show solidarity with Mir. Taking to Twitter, Absar Alam, a senior journalist who himself was shot last month by an unknown person in the stomach near his house in Islamabad, said, “It’s shameful to threaten anyone’s family. If anyone has a complaint against Hamid Mir, that person should follow the legal path instead of resorting to unconstitutional and fascist acts.” Alam’s fellow journalists had blamed the military’s intelligence service for the attack. Journalist Asma Shirazi, in a tweet, said: “If Hamid Mir is taken off air or banned from doing program, more fingers will point towards the powerful establishment and the government while resounding the words that he said.” Meanwhile, Munizae Jahangir, another journalist, said, “The ban on Hamid Mir is a slap on those who profess to have a free media in Pakistan. Mir is undoubtedly the most popular TV anchor of Pak and he is being punished for speaking out against attacks on journalists.” The episode began last week when Pakistani journalist and vlogger Asad Ali Toor was attacked and threatened inside his Islamabad apartment by unknown men. Later, in a statement, information minister Fawad Chaudhary claimed that certain journalists in the past had blamed the military and ISI only to receive political asylum and immigration to foreign countries. Responding to Chaudhry’s claim at a protest outside Islamabad Press Club on Friday, Hamid Mir termed the minister’s remarks unfortunate. “I was attacked but I am still in Pakistan. Matiullah Jan was attacked once but he is also in Pakistan. Absar Alam is also present in Pakistan,” he added. “I would like to ask the minister why senior military officials like Gen Musharraf are living abroad?” Mir asked. The minister would not be able to answer as to who is funding Musharraf’s stay abroad or why most of the top intelligence officials get lucrative jobs outside Pakistan after retirement, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/noted-pakistan-journo-hamid-mir-taken-off-air-after-anti-military-remarks/articleshow/83126252.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||In post-pandemic Europe, migrants will face digital fortress||PEPLO: As the world begins to travel again, Europe is sending migrants a loud message: Stay away!  Greek border police are firing bursts of deafening noise from an armored truck over the frontier into Turkey. Mounted on the vehicle, the long-range acoustic device, or "sound cannon," is the size of a small TV set but can match the volume of a jet engine.  It's part of a vast array of physical and experimental new digital barriers being installed and tested during the quiet months of the coronavirus pandemic at the 200-kilometer (125-mile) Greek border with Turkey to stop people entering the European Union illegally.  A new steel wall, similar to recent construction on the U.S.-Mexico border, blocks commonly-used crossing points along the Evros River that separates the two countries.  Nearby observation towers are being fitted with long-range cameras, night vision, and multiple sensors. The data will be sent to control centers to flag suspicious movement using artificial intelligence analysis.  "We will have a clear 'pre-border' picture of what's happening," Police Maj. Dimonsthenis Kamargios, head of the region's border guard authority, told the Associated Press.  The EU has poured 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) into security tech research following the refugee crisis in 2015-16, when more than 1 million people - many escaping wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - fled to Greece and on to other EU countries.  The automated surveillance network being built on the Greek-Turkish border is aimed at detecting migrants early and deterring them from crossing, with river and land patrols using searchlights and long-range acoustic devices.  Key elements of the network will be launched by the end of the year, Kamargios said. "Our task is to prevent migrants from entering the country illegally. We need modern equipment and tools to do that."  Researchers at universities around Europe, working with private firms, have developed futuristic surveillance and verification technology, and tested more than a dozen projects at Greek borders.  AI-powered lie detectors and virtual border-guard interview bots have been piloted, as well as efforts to integrate satellite data with footage from drones on land, air, sea and underwater. Palm scanners record the unique vein pattern in a person's hand to use as a biometric identifier, and the makers of live camera reconstruction technology promise to erase foliage virtually, exposing people hiding near border areas.  Testing has also been conducted in Hungary, Latvia and elsewhere along the eastern EU perimeter.  The more aggressive migration strategy has been advanced by European policymakers over the past five years, funding deals with Mediterranean countries outside the bloc to hold migrants back and transforming the EU border protection agency, Frontex, from a coordination mechanism to a full-fledged multinational security force.  But regional migration deals have left the EU exposed to political pressure from neighbors.  Earlier this month, several thousand migrants crossed from Morocco into the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in a single day, prompting Spain to deploy the army. A similar crisis unfolded on the Greek-Turkish border and lasted three weeks last year.  Greece is pressing the EU to let Frontex patrol outside its territorial waters to stop migrants reaching Lesbos and other Greek islands, the most common route in Europe for illegal crossing in recent years.  Armed with new tech tools, European law enforcement authorities are leaning further outside borders.  Not all the surveillance programs being tested will be included in the new detection system, but human rights groups say the emerging technology will make it even harder for refugees fleeing wars and extreme hardship to find safety.  Patrick Breyer, a European lawmaker from Germany, has taken an EU research authority to court, demanding that details of the AI-powered lie detection program be made public.  "What we are seeing at the borders, and in treating foreign nationals generally, is that it's often a testing field for technologies that are later used on Europeans as well. And that's why everybody should care, in their own self-interest," Breyer of the German Pirates Party told the AP.  He urged authorities to allow broad oversight of border surveillance methods to review ethical concerns and prevent the sale of the technology through private partners to authoritarian regimes outside the EU.  Ella Jakubowska, of the digital rights group EDRi, argued that EU officials were adopting "techno-solutionism" to sideline moral considerations in dealing with the complex issue of migration.  "It is deeply troubling that, time and again, EU funds are poured into expensive technologies which are used in ways that criminalize, experiment with and dehumanize people on the move," she said.  The London-based group Privacy International argued the tougher border policing would provide a political reward to European leaders who have adopted a hard line on migration.  "If people migrating are viewed only as a security problem to be deterred and challenged, the inevitable result is that governments will throw technology at controlling them," said Edin Omanovic, an advocacy director at the group.  "It's not hard to see why: across Europe we have autocrats looking for power by targeting foreigners, otherwise progressive leaders who have failed to come up with any alternatives to copying their agendas, and a rampant arms industry with vast access to decision-makers."  Migration flows have slowed in many parts of Europe during the pandemic, interrupting an increase recorded over years. In Greece, for example, the number of arrivals dropped from nearly 75,000 in 2019 to 15,700 in 2020, a 78% decrease.  But the pressure is sure to return. Between 2000 and 2020, the world's migrant population rose by more than 80% to reach 272 million, according to United Nations data, fast outpacing international population growth.  At the Greek border village of Poros, the breakfast discussion at a cafe was about the recent crisis on the Spanish-Moroccan border.  Many of the houses in the area are abandoned and in a gradual state of collapse, and life is adjusting to that reality.  Cows use the steel wall as a barrier for the wind and rest nearby.  Panagiotis Kyrgiannis, a Poros resident, says the wall and other preventive measures have brought migrant crossings to a dead stop.  "We are used to seeing them cross over and come through the village in groups of 80 or a 100," he said. "We were not afraid. ... They don't want to settle here. All of this that's happening around us is not about us."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/in-post-pandemic-europe-migrants-will-face-digital-fortress/articleshow/83127579.cms||---

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat that taking into account the estimated production by domestic vaccine manufacturers Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Dr Reddy's Lab, the government expects "the entire eligible population to be vaccinated by the end of the year". The bench said, "Till date, we have not seen the vaccination policy document. What led the thinking in the government for dual pricing of vaccines? What is the rationale behind the Centre procuring the vaccines at a price while that for the states is higher, and even more for the private hospitals? Why has the government left it to the manufacturers to fix vaccine prices? Why are the states and even municipal corporations floating global tenders for procuring vaccines? Will it not lead to a skewed supply of vaccines to citizens based on which state they resided in?" These were among a host of questions that inundated the SG during the two-hour hearing before the bench which asked the Centre to file an affidavit within two weeks. The SG said vaccination for all will be free as the states have given a written commitment to this effect to the central government. Read AlsoGave some aid for clinical trials of Covaxin and Covishield, not R&amp;D: Centre to SCNEW DELHI: The Centre has informed the Supreme Court that no governmental aid, assistance or grant was made either for research or development of Covid-19 vaccines - Covaxin and Covishield - but some financial assistance was given for conducting clinical trials. In an affidavit filed in the apexJustice Bhat said, "Whatever be the affidavit, apart from justifying the policy decisions, the Union government must place before the court the policy document and the thinking behind it, including relevant file notings. Why did you abandon the 1978 policy decision for universal immunisation free of cost? The only issue staring at us at this point of time is vaccination." Justice Chandrachud said Article 1 of the Constitution says India is a Union of States. "When the Constitution so mandates, at a time of national crisis, the government of India should procure the vaccine and distribute them among the states rather than asking the states to fend for themselves. This could leave citizens residing in poor states in the lurch as those states cannot even procure the required quantity of vaccines," he said. Read AlsoAll citizens to get vaccine free: CentreNEW DELHI: In a late-night affidavit, the Union government on Sunday told the Supreme Court that differential pricing of vaccines by manufacturers for the Centre and the states or private hospitals would have no impact on the citizens who would be given the vaccine free of cost. The Centre said,The court appeared unconvinced as to why the 45+ population would get free vaccination through the Centre and why the states have to purchase the vaccines at a higher cost for the population in the 18-45 age group. Justice Chandrachud said, "In the 18-45 age group there are approximately 60 crore people. Of the vaccines meant for this group, 50% is going to private hospitals. Will 50% of the population in the 18-45 age group be able to afford the charges at private hospitals? Not at all. How do we consider marginalised sections, who are not able to fend for themselves, will get vaccinated?" The bench also raised the issue of difficulties faced by many in registering for a vaccination slot through the CoWin portal. The SG repeatedly said the government is alive to the dynamics of the situation and has tweaked several policy decisions to address difficulties faced by people and has started allowing on-the-spot registration at vaccination centres, besides permitting vaccination drives in housing societies and community centres. The SG said the mandatory registration is based on the rationale that the person taking the first dose of vaccine should be taking the second dose also and this requires details to be logged. "If the second dose is not taken, even the first dose goes to waste," he said. Justice Rao asked the Centre to give statistical data about urban-rural ratio in vaccinations carried out so far while wondering whether the present vaccination drive was more urban-centric. Read Also1. A missing link between vaccine production and your armIndia's actual vaccination rate  doesn’t seem to catch up with even the stated supply by the vaccine makers, let alone the demand. About 2.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines are produced a day on average, according to government declarations and data published by the vaccineJustice Rao said, "Vaccination is not going to rural areas. This needs urgent attention from the governments. The 25% of vaccines allotted to private hospitals would mostly cater to urban populations as private hospitals do not operate in rural areas. This gives an impression that the vaccination policy is excluding rural areas." The SG said the government is alive to the situation and "not oblivious to the ground situation". Justice Chandrachud said, "Is it possible for a migrant worker from a marginalised section from rural areas to register through CoWin? You shout a lot about digital India. But are you aware of the sharp digital divide in the rural areas? The policymakers must have ears to the ground and tweak the policy accordingly to try address problems faced by all citizens... Please smell the coffee and make suitable amendments to the policy decisions. It cannot be day-to-day ad hoc decisions by the authorities. There has to be a comprehensive policy framework which perhaps is lacking today." Exasperated by the rapid fire questioning and faulting of policy decisions, Mehta philosophically mused: "Whatever decisions taken by the executive could be replaced by the Supreme Court's wisdom." However, he assured the court that the necessary changes would be carried out in the policy and that the government would answer all queries to the satisfaction of the SC. Amicus curiae Jaideep Gupta and Meenakshi Arora too suggested universal free vaccination and pleaded with the court for a direction to the governments to keep all crematoria and burial ground facilities functional for a dignified farewell to all those who succumb to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jabs-for-all-by-december-says-govt-as-sc-quizzes-it-on-vaccine-policy/articleshow/83128579.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||Canada: Bodies at Indigenous school not isolated incident||TORONTO: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday it's not an isolated incident that over 200 children were found buried at a former Indigenous residential school.  Trudeau's comments come as Indigenous leaders are calling for an examination of every former residential school site - institutions that held children taken from families across the nation.  Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk'emlups te Secwepemc First Nation in British Columbia said the remains of 215 children, some as young as 3 years old, were confirmed this month with the help of ground-penetrating radar. She described the discovery as "an unthinkable loss that was spoken about but never documented" at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, the largest such school in the country.  "As Prime Minister, I am appalled by the shameful policy that stole Indigenous children from their communities," Trudeau said.  "Sadly, this is not an exception or an isolated incident,'' he said. ''We're not going to hide from that. We have to acknowledge the truth. Residential schools were a reality - a tragedy that existed here, in our country, and we have to own up to it. Kids were taken from their families, returned damaged or not returned at all."  From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died.  The Canadian government apologized in Parliament in 2008 and admitted that physical and sexual abuse in the schools was rampant. Many students recalled being beaten for speaking their native languages. They also lost touch with their parents and customs.  Indigenous leaders have cited that legacy of abuse and isolation as the root cause of epidemic rates of alcoholism and drug addiction on reservations.  Plans are underway to bring in forensics experts to identify and repatriate the remains of the children found buried on the Kamloops site.  Trudeau said he'll be talking to his ministers on Monday about further things his government needs to do to support survivors and the community. Flags at all federal buildings are at half-staff.  Opposition New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh called Monday for an emergency debate in Parliament.  "This is not a surprise. This is a reality of residential schools," Singh said.  "215 Indigenous kids were found in an unmarked mass grave,'' he said. ''Anytime we think about unmarked mass graves, we think about a distant country where a genocide has happened. This is not a distant country."  The Kamloops school operated between 1890 and 1969, when the federal government took over operations from the Catholic Church and operated it as a day school until it closed in 1978.  Richard Gagnon, Archbishop of Winnipeg and President of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, expressed "our deepest sorrow for the heartrending loss of the children at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School."  The National Truth and Reconciliation Commission has records of at least 51 children dying at the school btween 1915 and 1963. The Commission identified about 3,200 confirmed deaths at schools but noted the schools did not record the cause of death in almost half of them. Some died of tuberculosis. The Commission said the practice was not to send the bodies of the students who died at the schools to their communities. The Commission also said the government wanted to keep costs down so adequate regulations were never established.  "This discovery is a stain on our country. It is one that needs to be rectified," Opposition Conservative lawmaker Michelle Rempel Garner said.  Perry Bellegarde, chief of the Assembly of First Nations, has said while it is not new to find graves at former residential schools, it's always crushing to have that chapter's wounds exposed.  Sol Mamakwa, an opposition lawmaker with the New Democrat party in Ontario, called on the governments of Canada and Ontario to search the grounds of other former residential schools.  "It is a great open secret that our children lie on the properties of former schools. It is an open secret that Canadians can no longer look away from," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canada-bodies-at-indigenous-school-not-isolated-incident/articleshow/83128640.cms||---

At the outset, Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, told a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari that deliberations were still going on in the government and the final decision was likely to be taken in two days. The AG pleaded with the court to grant time till Thursday when the government will brief the bench about the final decision. Agreeing with the Centre's plea, the bench adjourned the hearing for Thursday but reminded the government about its last year’s decision of not holding the remaining papers due to the first wave of the pandemic. The court said the Centre could take its time in coming to a final conclusion but told the attorney general that the government must give reasons if it decides to hold the exams. CBSE and ICSE Boards had last year agreed to scrap the remaining papers due to Covid-19 and students were assessed on the basis of their performances in papers in which they had appeared. Referring to the SC's last year order on scrapping the Board examinations, the bench said the situation has not improved from last year and the government should keep that aspect in mind while taking decisions. "Take your time to make a final decision but you must give us reasons in case you decide to depart from last year's decision. There must be some good and cogent reason," the bench said. The court was hearing a PIL filed by an advocate who pointed out that Covid -19 situation in the second wave is more severe in comparison to last year and the Board examinations be scrapped and same criteria of grading and marking students be followed as was done last year. The petitioner pleaded that instead of deferring the Board exams, the court should direct the authorities to evolve an objective methodology for assessment of Class XII students and cancel the physical examination. "Because in view of the unprecedented health emergency and rising numbers of Covid -19 cases in the country, the conduct of examination (either offline/online) in upcoming weeks is not possible and delay in examination will cause irreparable loss to the students as time is the essence in taking admission in higher education courses in foreign universities. As per the UNESCO statistics for the year 2018, around 7.3 lakh students had opted for foreign universities to pursue higher education. Delay in declaration of result will ultimately hamper one semester of the aspiring students as admission cannot be confirmed until the result of Class XII is declared," the petition said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/give-good-cogent-reasons-if-you-decide-to-hold-class-12-board-exams-sc-to-centre/articleshow/83128872.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Not all states will heed them. There has always been a Lakshman rekha between the Centre and the states. Jawaharlal Nehru and B R Ambedkar had stressed on it.

Mamata was referring to the controversy caused by the central deputation order on Alapan Bandyopadhyay, who retired as Bengal chief secretary on Monday and chose not to accept the deputation, and the three-month extension granted to him by the Centre just days ago. “This is an act of political vendetta. I have never seen such a heartless and ruthless Prime Minister and home minister. They are now targeting Mamata Banerjee’s chief secretary and officers to attack her.

Macron told a news conference that "our priority in Mali is the fight against terrorism and the presence of our forces on the ground is not enough in this fight. It also requires the strengthening of stable and legitimate institutions."  France has more than 5,000 troops in Africa's Sahel region.  Macron's comments come a day after West African leaders suspended Mali from their regional bloc, the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, over what they said amounted to a coup last week.  ECOWAS called for a new civilian prime minister to be nominated immediately, a new inclusive government to be formed and the 18-month transition of power leading to February 2022 elections to be carried out, saying a monitoring mechanism will be put in place to assure this.  "Neither France nor its partners are committed to getting involved (in Mali) if the ECOWAS demands are not respected," Macron said.  Germany, which has several hundred soldiers taking part in the U.N. stabilization and European Union training missions in Mali, sees the need to continue those deployments, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in the joint news conference with Macron via videoconference.  She added, however, that there were "red lines" including the need to hold elections and for there to be no contact with Islamist forces, including by Mali's current president.  She and Macron had agreed to have a "very, very close exchange" about developments in Mali and "if there is a situation (...) in which we see red lines are crossed, then we will coordinate our actions closely."  A power vacuum amid a 2012 coup d'etat unleashed years of chaos in Mali and allowed Islamic extremists to seize control of northern towns. Ultimately, a French-led military operation ousted the jihadis from strongholds in 2013, but they have regrouped and since expanded their reach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/emmanuel-macron-suggests-france-may-pull-out-troops-from-mali/articleshow/83129269.cms||---

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his virtual address to the people on Sunday had lauded Deshmukh’s contribution and appealed to all sarpanchs in the state to draw inspiration in the battle against the pandemic while announcing “My Village Corona Free” initiative.

The village had not reported any Covid-19 cases from March 2020 to April 2021. “But in the first week of April, we had two Covid-19 cases but both the patients died. This triggered panic and many people started leaving their homes to live in their farms,” he recalled. At this stage, Deshmukh said he decided to involve all stakeholders and create awareness about fighting coronavirus. “My mantra was to be positive in outlook with confidence that we can keep our village free of coronavirus,” Deshmukh said.

Once supplies improve, the number of vaccinations per day will go up remarkably. We have to do it and planning is going on,” a senior official told TOI. While current estimates show that around 20 crore doses (around 10 crore of Covishield, 7.5 crore of Covaxin and 2.5 crore doses of Sputnik V) are likely to be supplied in July, this may further increase if imported vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna enter the market. “By August, we will have 20-25 crore vaccine doses per month. We are aiming to vaccinate 1 crore people every day,” said N K Arora, chairperson of the National Task Force on Covid-19 Vaccination. Read AlsoAfter Serum, BB cuts Covaxin dose price to Rs 400 for statesA day after Serum Institute of India (SII) announced a Rs 100 per dose cut in Covishield price for state governments, Bharat Biotech followed suit with a price reduction of Rs 200 per dose for Covaxin.The government is also working on adding more Covid-19 vaccination sites by utilising the entire network of 1 lakh child immunisation centres, mainly in remote areas. Officials said vaccinations would see an upswing from June itself as fear of infection has started subsiding with positive cases declining steadily, along with projections of increased supply during the month. Recently, the Centre had allowed walkin vaccinations for people in the 18-44 band, a move that is likely to significantly enhance vaccination numbers. The Centre has indicated that nearly 12 crore doses of anti-Covid jabs will be available in June, up from 7.9 crore supplied in May. While the Centre will provide 6 crore doses to states and UTs in June for inoculating those above 45 years along with health and frontline workers, an additional 5.8 crore doses will be available for direct procurement by states and private hospitals. While providing advance visibility of stocks and supplies to states, the Centre has asked states to plan vaccination schedules and slots accordingly and publish them||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-government-plans-1-crore-daily-vaccines-from-middle-of-july/articleshow/83127681.cms||Sushmi Dey

Biden invoked the iconic battles of history and joined them to the present as he implored Americans to rise above the divisions straining the union, which he described in stark terms.  The president was joined Monday by first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff in a somber ceremony at the Virginia cemetery's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which is dedicated to deceased service members whose remains have not been identified.  His face tight with emotion, Biden walked up to the wreath, cupping it in his hands in silent reflection, then making the sign of the cross. His eyes were wet. The gathered dignitaries and military families were hushed and solemn; the chattering of cicadas loud.  In remarks that followed, Biden called on Americans to commemorate their fallen heroes by remembering their fight for the nation's ideals.  "This nation was built on an idea," Biden said. "We were built on an idea, the idea of liberty and opportunity for all. We've never fully realized that aspiration of our founders, but every generation has opened the door a little wider."  He focused much of his speech on the importance of democracy, saying it thrives when citizens can vote, when there is a free press and when there are equal rights for all.  "Generation after generation of American heroes are signed up to be part of the fight because they understand the truth that lives in every American heart: that liberation, opportunity, justice are far more likely to come to pass in a democracy than in an autocracy," Biden said. "These Americans weren't fighting for dictators, they were fighting for democracy. They weren't fighting to exclude or to enslave, they were fighting to build and broaden and liberate."  But he suggested these ideals are imperiled.  "The soul of America is animated by the perennial battle between our worst instincts, which we've seen of late, and our better angels," he said. "Between Me First and We the People. Between greed and generosity, cruelty and kindness, captivity and freedom."  After the ceremony, the Bidens stopped by a row of gravestones in a cemetery where some 400,000 are buried in the gentle hills and hollows.  The Bidens held hands and strolled along the rows of Section 12, one of the primary burial locations of service members killed overseas and repatriated to the United States after World War II and the Korean War. They stopped to chat with several families visiting the graves of their loved ones or searching for them - one family came to find a great-uncle missing in action from the world war. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined Biden and Harris in the ceremony.  On Sunday, Biden addressed a crowd of Gold Star military families and other veterans in a ceremony at War Memorial Plaza in New Castle, Delaware. Earlier in the day, he and other family members attended a memorial Mass for his son Beau Biden, a veteran who died of brain cancer six years ago to the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-honors-war-dead-at-arlington-implores-nation-to-heal/articleshow/83129564.cms||---

ICMR to find out||PUNE: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), along with the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE), has launched a nationwide study to determine vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe Covid-19 infection. The study will be carried out at 11 sites across 10 cities. A senior scientist with the team said the research will assess real-world efficacy of the Covid vaccines. Read AlsoMaybe relook advisory barring repeat of RT-PCR on Covid positive patients: HC to ICMRNEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday suggested to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that it may need to re-look its recent advisory which said RT-PCR must not be repeated on an individual who tested positive by either Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) or RT-PCR. Justice Rekha Palli asked“It will track nearly 3,900 citizens. Of these, 1,300 will be Covid-positive people who were hospitalised after vaccination. The rest will be people who have tested negative (via RT-PCR), but have been vaccinated,” the scientist said, adding that the research will help determine true vaccine ability, especially since there have been reports of people testing positive (and even hospitalised with Covid) after inoculation. NIE director Dr Manoj Murhekar said the study will provide information on real-world vaccine effectiveness against severe Covid. The ICMR had recently asked all states to collect data of people hospitalised after vaccination, to lay the groundwork for research into efficacy. Experts have stated that post-vaccine Covid is mostly mild.

With 594,461 deaths, the US has been the worst-affected country, followed by Brazil with 461,931, India with 329,100, Mexico with 223,507 and Britain with 127,781 fatalities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the number of people, who have died directly or indirectly due to the pandemic, is up to three times more than what official figures suggest. WHO names Covid-19 variants The four coronavirus variants considered of concern by the U.N. agency and known generally by the public as the variants identified in UK, South Africa, Brazil and India have now been given the letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta according to the order of their detection. Other variants of interest continue down the alphabet. Indian economy shrinks by 7.3% in 2020-21India's economy, pummeled by the pandemic, contracted by 7.3% in the 2020-21 financial year, just before the country was hit by another catastrophic surge in infections. The economy grew at a 1.6% annual rate in the January-March quarter, according to figures released Monday by the government, but that recovery was stifled by a resurgence of infections in March. Japan to extend its emergency aid to IndiaJapan is extending its emergency aid of nearly USD 14.8 million, which includes additional medical supplies, to India to help it fight the pandemic, according to the Japanese foreign ministry. UK in early stages of 3rd Covid wave, warns Indian-origin scientist An eminent Indian-origin scientist advising the British government has warned that there are signs that the UK is in the early stages of a third wave of Covid infections and urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to delay the planned June 21 reopening of the country by a few weeks, according to a media report on Monday. Portugal's economy shrinks 3.3% after lockdownPortugal's economy shrank 3.3% in the first quarter from the preceding three months, as consumption and tourism were hit by a lockdown imposed in January, data showed on Monday. Finance minister Joao Leao, however, said more recent signs pointed to an upturn. To fight a surge in Covid-19 infections in mid-January, which at the time was the deadliest outbreak per capita in the world, Portugal imposed a strict three-month lockdown, which has since been gradually lifted. Global economic recovery needs green focus, South Korea summit agreesTop officials from 38 countries agreed on Monday that efforts to rebuild economies from the Covid-19 pandemic should be guided by green principles and seek to reduce global greenhouse emissions. The delegates adopted a declaration at the end of the 2021 Partnering for Green Growth and the Global Goals 2030, or P4G. Thailand reports record virus cases; Bangkok eases lockdownThailand reported a record number of new cases of Covid on Monday as the governor of Bangkok announced an easing of some restrictions in effect for more than a month. Thailand has been fighting to deal with a virus surge that began in early April in a group of nightclubs in Bangkok and has since spread around the country. Vietnam to suspend incoming international flights to HanoiVietnam will suspend incoming international flights to its capital Hanoi from Tuesday as part of the country's effort to contain a coronavirus outbreak, the government said. Vietnam has been restricting the amount of inbound international flights since the start of the pandemic. "The suspension will be in place until the end of June 7," the government said in a statement. Japan considers asking Olympic fans for negative Covid testsJapan is considering requiring negative Covid-19 test results or vaccination records from fans attending the Tokyo Olympics, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Monday, as a new poll showed public opposition to the Games remained strong. Foreign spectators have already been banned and game organisers are expected to make a decision next month on whether Japanese fans will be able to attend and under what conditions. Singapore to allow special access for more vaccine brandsSingapore's health minister said on Monday the city-state will allow access to other Covid-19 vaccines, besides the ones already approved, under a special access route (SAR) in order to enhance overall coverage. The SAR can be used for the supply of vaccines that are on the WHO's emergency use listing, Ong Ye Kung said. Singapore has so far approved vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna. Philippines extends curbs in capital, ban on inbound travel Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte on Monday prolonged partial coronavirus curbs in the capital and nearby provinces until mid-June to contain infections that have been decreasing since hitting a peak in April. Religious gathering remain capped at 30% of venue capacity while dining in restaurants can operate at 20% in the capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to at least 13 million people, and nearby provinces. Non-essential travels will remain prohibited. France opens Covid jabs for all adults in race against variantsFrance on Monday opened up Covid-19 vaccines to all adults, a week before Germany, as Europe races to avoid another wave of infections caused by new virus variants. So far, 25.4 million people have received a first shot of a vaccine, representing about 38 percent of the population and nearly one in two adults. Denmark to reconsider exclusion of J&J and AstraZeneca shotsDenmark's government on Monday asked the country's health authorities to reconsider a decision to exclude Johnson & Johnson's and AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shots from its vaccination programme over a potential link to a rare but serious form of blood clot. The move was prompted by a two-week delay in the Danish vaccination programme to September due to delivery of fewer Moderna and CureVac vaccines than expected, Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said. Time for pandemic treaty: WHO's TedrosWHO chief on Monday called for launching negotiations this year on an international treaty to boost pandemic preparedness, as part of sweeping reforms envisioned by member states. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, told its annual ministerial assembly that the U.N. agency faced a "serious challenge" to maintain its Covid-19 response at the current level and required sustainable and flexible funding. Earlier in the day health ministers agreed to study recommendations for ambitious reforms made by experts to strengthen the capacity of the WHO and countries to contain new viruses. The ministers from the WHO's 194 member states are to meet from November 29 to decide on launching negotiations on the treaty. Brazil to host Copa America after Argentina is strippedBrazil will host Copa America for the second consecutive time after Colombia and Argentina were stripped of hosting rights for the tournament, prompting local health experts to criticise the decision to hold the troubled event in one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. Alejandro Dominguez, the president of South American soccer body CONMEBOL, announced the move on Monday hours after Argentina was ruled out amid an increase in Covid-19 cases in the country. Colombia was removed on May 20 as street protests against President Ivan Duque rocked the nation. Victoria cluster swells to 51Australia's second most populous state of Victoria, epicentre of the country's latest coronavirus hotspot, reported 11 new cases of community transmission on Monday, taking the current cluster to 51.

The company said it was able to develop the emulsion-based formulation for the drug in-house in just three weeks and has a capacity to manufacture 10,000 vials per day, which will be enough to cater to nearly 6,000 patients per month. Celon Labs said though the company has been manufacturing Liposomal Amphotericin B since 2013, the unavailability of a critical ingredient — lipoids, which is sourced from Germany, created a production bottleneck. The ingredients in the injection include Amphotericin API, soyabean oil, egg lecithin and glycerin, the company said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/desi-co-develops-alternative-jab-for-black-fungus/articleshow/83130224.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

While the trials will currently include Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik-V, which currently have emergency use authorisation in the country, going forward the trials may also include jabs that are in the pipeline, senior officials said. Some studies in the UK and Spain have shown mixing of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines to be safe and immunogenic. However, officials in India maintain that though the concept is scientifically feasible, it cannot be allowed without adequate evidence and therefore, a study has to be conducted.

---||India||Supreme Court to look at sedition law with media rights in mind||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday expressed concern at the regularity with which sedition charges were slapped against print and electronic media for publishing views critical of the establishment and said it would decide the ambit of the colonial-era provision in the Indian Penal Code keeping in view the media's right to free speech and expression. "We are of the view that the ambit and parameters of the provisions of Sections 124A, 153A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, would require interpretation, particularly in the context of the right of the electronic and print media to communicate news and information, even those that may be critical of the prevailing regime in any part of the nation," a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat said. The court's resolve to more closely define the law on sedition will be widely welcomed given the perception that it can be a handy tool to silence dissent and political opponents and that the provisions should be invoked only in rare cases where there is a plot against the state or intent to harm national integrity. Quick Edit: Media freedom gets a thumbs up from SC, sedition thumbs downThis order came on petitions filed by Telugu TV channels TV5 and ABN challenging Andhra Pradesh police’s decision to suo motu lodge an FIR on May 14 under Sections 124A, 153A and 505 of IPC against them for broadcasting the views of YSRCP rebel MP Krishnam Raju, who was critical of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy's Covid-19 management policy. The court stayed any coercive action against the TV channels. Raju was made the main accused in the FIR and arrested on May 14. He was granted bail by the SC later as Army Hospital medical reports indicated that he could have been subjected to custodial torture. Times ViewSedition has become a tool, not only to settle political scores but also to curb freedom of expression. This newspaper has consistently campaigned against the rampant misuse of sedition provisions by governments and police forces. Hopefully the Supreme Court can finally put a stop to such misuse. It has quite rightly stayed the police investigation. The apex court’s observation that it would soon endeavour to define sedition for print and electronic media is also welcome. A free and fearless media is fundamental to democracy. Efforts to browbeat it by using a heinous charge goes against the very spirit of democracy and must be stopped.The TV channels, through advocates Vipin Nair and G Pramod Kumar, had also moved another set of petitions seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against AP police for violating the SC's April 30 order asking the DGPs of states not to take coercive action against anyone who put up critical social media posts against the government relating to Covid-19 management. The bench, after hearing senior advocates Shyam Divan and Sidharth Luthra, protected the two Telugu TV channels and their personnel from any coercive action by AP police on the basis of the FIR lodged against them for broadcasting Raju's critical remarks against Reddy. The petitioners accused AP police of violating the SC's April 30 order, which said, "It is with deep distress that we note that individuals seeking help on such platforms have been targeted, by alleging that the information posted by them is false and has only been posted on social media to create panic, defame the administration or damage 'national image'. We do not hesitate in saying that such targeting shall not be condoned, and the central government and state governments should ensure that they immediately cease any direct or indirect threats of prosecution and arrest to citizens who air grievances or those that are attempting to help fellow citizens receive medical aid." Issuing a contempt warning, the Justice Chandrachud-led bench had said, "If this does keep happening even after the current order, this court shall be constrained to use the powers available to it under its contempt jurisdiction. We also direct that all directors general of police shall ensure compliance down the ranks of the police forces within their jurisdictions." Listing the petitions for hearing after six weeks, the bench asked the AP government on Monday to file its response within four weeks. "Till the next date of listing, there shall be a stay on the respondents adopting any coercive proceedings against the two television channels which are the petitioners before the court, namely TV5 and ABN, as well as their personnel," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-stays-action-on-2-channels-to-decide-ambit-of-sedition-law-against-media/articleshow/83130514.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Rules protect rights of users, were framed because social media giants failed to do so: IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad||NEW DELHI:  IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasadhas been in the thick of things as the new guidelines for social media became a flashpoint for a showdown between the government and Twitter and WhatsApp over issues of privacy and free speech. He speaks to Sidhartha and Pankaj Doval on why the rules are not a bid to gag dissenting opinion but rather an attempt to protect the rights of social media users and ensure accountability from Big Tech. Excerpts:There is an impression that the government is playing nanny to social media. Why is it so, and why are social media companies angry with the government? I repudiate this question. The core issue is that these guidelines didn’t spring up suddenly. First, there are two Supreme Court judgements — the Prajwala case of 2018 regarding child pornography and the September 2019 case of Facebook versus the Union of India. In the second case, Supreme Court said that it is imperative that there is a properly-framed regime to find out the persons, institutions, and bodies who are the originators of such content messages… it may be necessary to get such information from the intermediaries. Also, in 2018, there was a debate in the Rajya Sabha on fake news where I had to give a commitment to frame guidelines. There have also been countless questions in every session of Parliament, and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu had set up a committee of parliamentarians that gave recommendations on the issue of child sexual abuse. In the present guidelines too, we went for the widest consultations possible. We got hundreds of comments and counter-comments, including from the stakeholders. Thus, please disabuse the impression that we are nannies. No, we are not. So why did the guidelines come? This is based on the demand of the people, directions of courts, and command of Parliament and its committees. If a distraught mother complains of revenge porn her daughter has been subjected to, should I ask them to go to America as Twitter says. If a woman complains of a morphed image, then what should I do? Today, it is not only political leaders who suffer criticism day in and day out, but also journalists, editors, judges and even businessmen who are trolled. Thus, focus of the rules is more on abuse and misuse of social media, not of use of social media. Victims of abuse must have a forum for redressal of their grievances. That’s the main core of the rules. Then why was there a problem with big social media companies? On February 25, we notified the new guidelines in the gazette, and gave the significant intermediaries a three-month period to comply, which included appointing officers for compliance, addressing grievances, and being a nodal person. Did we ask for the moon? Do you need to hold a UPSC-type IAS exam to recruit these officers? In fact, they ought not have waited for the rules. Grievance redress mechanism is there even in the print media, and broadcasters. On a more fundamental question: You will earn tons of money here, make good revenues here, have close to two crore Twitter users and nearly 100 crore between all the platforms combined. But to file a complaint, a user needs to go to the police or go to America where the name of the grievance officer is not even known. It seems they are in India only to earn money and not to be accountable to the Indian laws and constitution. I want to gently remind them that the days of East India Company are over a long time ago. India today is a sovereign country. They are welcome to do business in India, and help in the empowerment of our millions of users. Is the government averse to criticism? We don’t have any issue when anyone criticizes the government of India. Let them criticize Prime Minister Naredra Modi, let them ask questions. We firmly believe in that right. But give a voice to the users who are subject of abuse. We are out of it. Because of their refusal to do so, we have been constrained to initiate this legal process. You are having a pitched battle with Twitter? I say this to Twitter that you are an American company, and you have a huge user base here. But you are not giving any indulgence to your own users who are suffering here because of abuse. The who are you to give us a lecture on democracy? India’s democratic credentials are very, very well placed. The Constitution is there, an independent judiciary is there, and a robust media also. Also, we are accountable to the people. They do not have any proper office here, and do not even submit their numbers here. Why did they and other social media majors not comply with guidelines within three months? They just said that give us more time. All I can ask is whether freedom of speech bogey is a shield to delay (the new rules), and not to obey. Is it just a façade? I am saying this with a lot of responsibility. They are free to do business in India, earn profit, and enhance their user base. But they have to be accountable to the Constitution and laws of India. Having operations in India, but following the laws of America is plainly unacceptable to us. But they are worried about criminal liability and jail for their executives for non-compliance?I can only laugh at this suggestion. Their officer has to receive user complaint and thereafter dispose it off. Finally, this number need to be reported to the government every month. That’s all. The law kicks in only when you fail to ensure this. What about removal of safe harbour protection, or immunity from third-party content? Safe harbour gets removed only when the company doesn’t follow rules. If you have intentions to follow the rules, then there is no problem. Let me say emphatically that these rules are designed to empower users of social media, and are not meant to victimize the platforms. The rules give a voice to the victims of abuse. How much more time are they asking for?Some are asking for six months, other seek an extension of one year. Do you think Twitter has aligned with your critics when it says it shares the concerns of civil society in India over police action and the new rules? Are they a platform or a media group? You are a platform where you allow people to share views…how will you take a position that this idea is not to my liking but this (one) is. You take tough action when there is vandalism on Capitol Hill but when vandals and pro-terrorist elements invade Lal Quila, you don’t act. You show a part of Ladakh as part of China and we have to try for a fortnight to get it removed. When Singapore protests, its name is taken down when it is related to a (Coronavirus) variant. In India, we have to wait for a week. These double standard are not acceptable, the norms should be the same. This reluctance to have a mechanism for the users is a matter of deep concern. How long will you wait for Twitter to comply? You should leave it to the governing process as I don’t want to share it now. The law has already kicked in. It will not go indefinitely unpunished. Certainly, patience is not infinite. I want them to operate in India, I acknowledge that they have given a voice to the users of their platform in India and tusers can criticise the Prime Minister, me and the government. But, they have to follow the rules and laws of the country. WhatsApp has its own issues and says that their messages are encrypted, something that they have maintained for years. Ordinary users of WhatsApp have nothing to fear, and that’s a clear and categorical assurance from me. Which means people-to-people messaging, doctors to their patients, lawyers to their clients, journalists to their sources, we have no grievance. I am not the IT minister to make the life of Indians uncomfortable. We are seeking only limited information. Only when a message already in public circulation is giving rise to violence, impinging on the unity and integrity of India, depicting a woman in very bad light, or sexual abuse of a child, and when no other intrusive options are working, only then WhatsApp will require to disclose who started the nuisance. They are sharing it in the US, there was a joint statement by the Americans, the British PM. In their latest privacy policy, haven’t they said that they will share data with Facebook and other business entities? What happens to privacy? When FB shared data with Cambridge Analytica, was privacy respected? We fully respect Supreme Court judgment on privacy. But a terrorist, or a criminal or a corrupt person does not have Right to Privacy otherwise no police investigation is possible. The biggest campaigners of Right to Information have become the biggest campaigners of Right to Privacy! Privacy is the core element of an individual’s existence, namely your medical records, your matrimonial relationship, sexual preferences, your income, if you are not a public servant or a minor. We are not invading any element of privacy of WhatsApp when we are seeking information on a message that is already in circulation that resulted in an offence. One of the arguments put forward by WhatsApp is that there is a large volume of messages exchanged every day and it may be tough to maintain records. Aren’t Indian telecom operators and internet service providers maintaining records of such a large number of subscribers? If you have no intention to follow the rules, there are a hundred alibis. If you want to follow it, things will fall in place in a very simple way. They are technological giants. Without a privacy law is it legally possible to enforce these regulations? Privacy norms have been discussed by Supreme Court in great detail. I have already defined the core of privacy. These guidelines have been framed in exercise of the statutory powers of the IT Act. They are reasonable, proportionate and appropriate guidelines. Is this a pre-emptive move by some of the platforms to get the government to water down some of the provisions of the data protection law?We will seek to push the (data protection) Bill in the next session of Parliament. India is one of the biggest generators of data in the world. Therefore, we are keen that our data protection law is a fine beacon of protecting the rights of an individual’s consent and leading to good use of data. We don’t have any issue when anyone criticizes the government of India. Let them criticize Prime Minister Narendra Modi, let them ask questions. We firmly believe in that right. But give a voice to the users who are subject of abuse. We are out of it. Because of their refusal to do so, we have been constrained to initiate this legal process. We fully respect Supreme Court judgment on privacy. But a terrorist, or a criminal or a corrupt person does not have Right to Privacy otherwise no police investigation is possible. The biggest campaigners of Right to Information have become the biggest campaigners of Right to Privacy!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rules-protect-rights-of-users-were-framed-because-social-media-giants-failed-to-do-so-it-and-law-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad/articleshow/83128246.cms||Sidhartha

Sahni (35) was allegedly kidnapped by criminals from Khagaria-Bakhri road on Sunday when he was on way to supervise fishing activities in a pond near Gangur. His motorcycle was found abandoned near Soradih village on Sunday evening. He was a resident of Baluaha on the outskirts of Khagaria town. Khagaria SP Amitesh Kumar said a special police team led by sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Sumit Kumar was formed to trace Sahni. “His body was recovered from a deserted place between Bhadas and Saurahadih villages on Monday. The body bore external injuries. Prima facie the incident appears to be a fallout of business rivalry,” he said, adding raids are on to arrest the culprits. Earlier, Babloo Kumar, who was accompanying Sahni, had told the police that they were intercepted by a gang of armed criminals. The criminals forced them to sit in the car they were travelling in and dropped him at a deserted place. Babloo said the criminals left towards Gangaur with Sahni in the car. “What happened with Sahni later on is not known to me,” he told the police. SHO of Mufassil police station in Khagaria Ranjeet Kumar said he spotted the abandoned motorbike during routine patrolling. “Sahni’s body was handed over to his family members after an autopsy,” he added. Police have detained two people for interrogation in connection with the incident. Sahni’s wife Shivani told the police that her husband was assaulted a few days ago and threatened with dire consequences. “His life was under threat ever since he was elected secretary of the fisheries cooperative committee of sadar block in Khagaria district by defeating his rival Sikandar Sahni,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/secy-of-fisheries-co-op-committee-found-murdered-in-khagaria/articleshow/83125194.cms||Ramashankar

---||Business||Wise launches instant remittance from India||Mumbai: Wise (formerly TransferWise) a global remittance firm has launched its low-cost and fast international money transfer service in India. The launch will enable Indians to send money to 44 countries including the UK, the US, Singapore, Malaysia, the UAE and countries in the Eurozone. The service is available through a mobile application and web browsers. The company has cited a report by Alderson Consulting to claims that Wise’s prices for international money transfer are two times cheaper than banks and other providers. The company charges an upfront fee and transfers money at the interbank exchange rate. As a result, the fee for transferring Rs 50,000 to the US costs Rs 1,038 with Wise as against Rs 1,909 with banks after factoring in the exchange rate mark-up. The company is targeting the $18.8 billion remittance market out of India in FY20 of which travel and studies abroad accounted for 60% of transfers. Speaking to TOI, Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder of Wise said, “Across the world, 38% of the transfers that happen on Wise, take less than 20 seconds to arrive. It is not universal yet, but 60% of the time it happens in less than an hour we are getting a bigger share of instant transfers”. He added that the existence of instant transfers in the local market was a positive for the Indian market. Wise first enabled transfers to India in 2013, and the company most recently enabled Google Pay users in the US to send rupees to Google Pay users in India. In India, Wise has partnered with RBL Bank to facilitate remittances. The company serves over 10 million customers worldwide and processes around $6 billion in cross-border transactions per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wise-launches-instant-remittance-from-india/articleshow/83127387.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||‘Extension of lockdown to further reduce Covid cases in Bihar’||PATNA: People from different sections of the society on Monday welcomed the extension of lockdown in the state by another week, saying the curbs would further contain the spread of the virus. Hailing the government’s decision, Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha said rate of infections in the second wave was controlled to a great extent following the statewide lockdown for the last 25 days. “Continuation of lockdown for some time is very much desired for having a full control over the pandemic. The government has already announced some relaxations for shops and establishments, but offices and institutions should not be reopened in haste,” he added. Indian Medical Association’s acting president Dr Ajay Kumar has also welcomed the extension of the lockdown, but said the shops should have been opened in two different shifts (say, for two hours in each shift) to avoid crowding. “Officials should keep a constant vigil on marriages in urban as well as rural areas. Crowds at vegetable markets must also be controlled,” he said. Gajendra Jha, a Patna high court lawyer, expressed his concern at the delay in resumption of normal activities in courts. “Even bail petitions can’t be moved under the present condition. Besides, some small traders and businessmen are facing great hardships owing to prolonged lockdown. The government should also devise some ways for compensating their financial losses to some extent,” he added. Chief medical officer of Patna University Central Dispensary Dr Anil Kumar said proper arrangements for vaccination must be made during the period of lockdown so that a maximum number of people are vaccinated. Dilip Kumar Sharma, a kirana shop owner on Boring Road, said the timing of the shops has now been increased to facilitate shopping in a relaxed way without creating unnecessary crowds at the shops. “This would go a long way in checking the spread of infections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/extension-of-lockdown-to-further-reduce-covid-cases/articleshow/83126183.cms||B K Mishra

The patient, a 48-year-old man from Amra village under Manpur block, had symptoms of blackness and swelling around the eyes and was admitted at ANMMCH on Saturday evening. The patient is also diabetic and is undergoing treatment at the black fungus ward of ANMMCH. A separate ward has been made at the ear-nose-throat (ENT) ward of the hospital for treating black fungus cases. Corona ward nodal officer NK Paswan said, “At ANMMCH 200 vials of the injection used for treatment of black fungus are available. As per the direction of state headquarters, 50 vials have been sent to Patna, while 50 vials have been kept in reserve here. Demand for the medicine in tablet form has also been requisitioned.” Nodal officer at ENT ward RP Thakur said: "MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) test of the patient has been conducted. We have not applied any medication for fungal treatment so far and the patient has more than 70% relief from normal medication. His blood sugar level is around 400. In such a situation surgery can be done only when there is an emergency. The patient is under close observation and we are hopeful for his early recovery.” Meanwhile, in a significant development, the district has achieved recovery rate of 97.57. After 67 days, only eight people tested positive in the district. This includes five RT-PCR test of 1,186 and antigen test of 3,024.

---||Patna||Patna University not to conduct entrance tests this year due to Covid||PATNA: Patna University (PU) on Monday decided to abolish the practice of holding written tests for admitting students to its various undergraduate courses under conventional as well as self-financing modes. The decision was taken at a meeting of the PU’s academic council held here under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor (VC) Girish Kumar Chaudhary. Admission to the conventional and self-financing courses would be made on the basis of marks obtained in the Intermediate examinations conducted by CBSE, ICSE and BSEB. Even the viva voice in case of self-financing courses has been scrapped. However, it was made clear by the academic council that this provision is being made only for the current year. The VC said the academic council’s resolution would have to be endorsed by the syndicate after which it would be sent to the Raj Bhavan for obtaining governor’s assent to the transitory regulation to this effect. The academic council further decided to change the nomenclature of at least six courses in the larger interest of the students. The names of courses like MA/MSc in social work, music, personnel management and industrial relations (PMIR) would be changed simply to masters in social work, music and PMIR, respectively. It was also decided that the VC would write to the UGC to extend the time limit for the registration of PhD scholars from two years to four years in view of the university’s closure due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, the monthlong summer vacation in PU, along with all other universities in the state, ended on Monday. The new academic session would commence on Tuesday. The VC has directed the heads of departments and principals of colleges to resume online classes of UG and PG students as per their timetable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-not-to-conduct-entrance-tests-this-year-due-to-covid/articleshow/83126030.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Anti-fungal drug shortage worries Bihar residents||PATNA: It’s like a never-ending struggle for Covid-19 patients and their relatives. After Remdesivir and oxygen shortages, people are now running from pillar to post for anti-fungal drug Liposomal Amphotericin-B, a key drug to treat mucormycosis or black fungus amid a rapid rise in such cases. As hospitals are facing an acute shortage of this anti-fungal drug, the doctors are asking families of patients detected with the black fungus disease to arrange the drug from the market. The medical shops, however, claim that they are out of stock for the past few weeks as the number of mucor cases is increasing in Bihar and the fresh stock has not yet arrived. The shortage has also made way for illegal sales and black marketing. Kamal Kant (name changed) said his brother recently underwent surgery at a private hospital in Patna after he contracted the black fungus infection only a few days after he recovered from Covid-19. “The hospital management had told us that they don’t have the anti-fungal injection and asked us to arrange 80 vials of Amphotericin- B injection, but it isn't available there in the market. One tout was offering to sell it at Rs 20,000 per injection but we couldn't afford it,” he said. Dr Sunil Kumar, secretary of Indian Medical Association- Bihar termed ‘black marketing’ as a symbol of fashion in the state. "Two back fungus patients that I know personally are admitted at IGIMS but they did not receive the injection for the last two days as there is no stock available in the hospital. Earlier, Amphotericin- B injection was used to treat resistant cases of Kala Azar and patients who undergone kidney transplants. But the unprecedented rise in mucor cases has triggered the shortage of anti-fungal injection in the market as the demand has plunged,” he said. He added, “We have already requested the state government to arrange the injection otherwise people will face a shortage of the drug. We are still facing a shortage of common medicines like zinc and vitamin C.” Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association’s president PK Singh confirmed that there was an acute shortage of Amphotericin- B injection in the market. “The health department is managing the distribution of injection on their own that is why it is not available anywhere in the market. Only two companies are manufacturing this injection but the Centre has given licence to seven more pharmaceutical companies for its production,” he told this newspaper. Social media is flooded with SoSs for Amphotericin-B injection as people are desperately looking for help to save their dear ones struggling with the black fungus infection. “My brother-in-law is admitted at Ford Hospital in Patna and the doctors asked us to arrange Amphotericin-B injection, which is ideal for the treatment of mucor. His condition is very critical and he needs injection on a very urgent basis (sic),” Rajesh Kumar tweeted on Sunday. Deepankar, whose uncle Akhilesh Kumar, has been admitted at Ruban Memorial Hospital, said he needs 12 vials of the anti-fungal drug as the hospital runs out of stock. “I went to different medical shops even the wholesale market in Govind Mitra Road but failed to get it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/anti-fungal-drug-shortage-worries-residents/articleshow/83125813.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||Aim is to bring money transfer fees down as much as possible: Wise co-founder||Mumbai: Kristo Käärmann, co-founder and CEO, Wise (formerly TransferWise) came up with the idea of a cheap, speedy remittance service after he was overcharged by banks in the UK for sending money back home. Käärmann hails from Estonia, a country that has tasted success due to its decision to provide digital ID and access to government services from the late 90s. His company has been offering remittances to India from the West for nearly seven years now. In an interview with TOI, he speaks of how Wise’s decision to offer remittance services from India to international destinations through a partnership with RBL Bank will benefit remitters. Wise is now a decade old. How has it evolved? In most of the western world, remittances are conducted by banks. It does not look that expensive is that they take the real exchange rate and add 5%. For me, the solution at the time was to find a friend who was moving money in the other direction, and we moved money by not using the banks. At the time you want to make a transfer you have a friend who makes the opposite transfer, so we built what was TransferWise then and is now Wise. We now move money for 10 million people, and we are moving $7 billion a month across borders, besides, we are helping customers with a few more things in the same way they can use Wise for personal use cases. We, therefore, have expanded and are now operating in more than 50 countries and are happy that India has joined our network. Which are the major corridors for your remittances? The money is always flowing across the biggest countries – the Eurozone, the US, then you find India is a big economy. For people sending money, India is a big destination. Then there are Singapore, Japan and Australia. Since your transfers are enabled by using proprietary accounts at both ends how do you balance the payments into and out of a country? This is one of the reasons we are opening up transfers from India. We have been delivering funds to India for seven years but now we are enabling services for people and businesses in India. Over a larger scale what needs to happen is that the inflows and outflows need to be in balance and they are in balance. Personal transfers may be going only one way, but at a macroeconomic level they must balance, or the currency will crash. To be able to balance in our network, we have liquidity partners who can supply funds. What is the USP that Wise offers? The USP of Wise is always the same. The three things our customers are looking for is that when you move money it has to be cheap. When you do a transfer through Wise you get the same rate that you see when you search exchange rates on Google, we do not tamper with the exchange rate. But we do charge a fee and the fee is transparent. The biggest change wise has created in the world is creating transparency where the fees are not in the exchange rate. Our goal is to bring down the fees further. The other thing that customers care about is speed, so our goal is to increase the percentage of customers who receive their money in 20 seconds. Across the world, 38% of the transfers that happen on Wise, take less than 20 seconds to arrive. It is not universal yet, but 60% of the time it happens in less than an hour we are getting a bigger share of instant transfers. Finally, there is convenience as customers do not want to go to the bank branch. They want something that works out of the box, and this is the experience that customers should be looking for. What are the pre-requisites for you to enable a transfer in 20 seconds? There are plenty of things to get right for this to work. We must be able to deliver money instantly in India and that works because you have an instant payment system. In many countries now we are connecting directly to the central bank. The UK, Eurozone, Singapore just launched a connection to the payment system directly. That helps us to remove the middleman and access funds directly. How do you manage to participate in payment systems? We hold licences that in Europe they are called E-money institutions. We can service payments and hold people’s money. Customers hold more than $4 billion in their Wise accounts. Hopefully one day we will be able to issue those in India. They can hold multiple currencies and use them while travelling. For instance, when I use it in India, it uses Indian rupee balance and in Australia, it uses AUD balance. If I put euros in the account, there is no exchange. If I have to use rupees, either do the conversion myself or it can happen automatically. In India, making a payment in rupees, the account checks and then converts from euro or some other currency and converts using the real exchange rate. While we issue both Visa and Mastercard, they process payments in local currencies and there is no markup on the exchange rates. Do you partner with local banks? Do you allow integration of Wise with bank apps? We are partnering with domestic banks and everywhere we operate, we partner with domestic banks for money flows if we are not connected to the central bank payments. In many places, banks have chosen not to do international transfers themselves but use our services to give their clients and that is what they can do with these APIs where they build the wise experience in their apps. We have 13 banks using this feature, we do not have one in India, the closest is in Singapore and we will look at partnering Indian banks. India has some special laws on remittances requiring use cases to be specified. Also, there have been many online frauds.. Wherever we operate we have some local specifics, Indian customers using Wise will have a slightly different experience. There are questions on what the payment is for because we by regulations have to do this. Yes, it is slightly less convenient, but these are your laws, and we have to follow them. The second point of bad people on the internet, as long as money has existed there have been scams and fraudsters everywhere. Our job is weeding them out as we see them. Our strength is that we see so much international volumes going through our pipes, because of the visibility of the transfers, we probably have more information than anyone else to be able to catch these bad guys. The way to catch this is that one type of scam idea is tried many times locally and we have seen things as they happen elsewhere and can catch them. If we find something India-specific, we will address it in an India-specific way||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/aim-is-to-bring-money-transfer-fees-down-as-much-as-possible-wise-co-founder/articleshow/83127315.cms||Mayur Shetty

Speaking to the media, Singhal said the fungal infection has killed 14 people in the state. “While 97 people have been cured, 1,068 people are receiving treatment for the fungal infection in various hospitals across the state. The health department has identified 17 government hospitals for black fungus treatment. Apart from these hospitals, several private hospitals, empanelled under Aarogyasri scheme, are also attending to the black fungus cases,” said Singhal. The principal secretary added that the health department is conducting webinars to train the medical staff involved in black fungus treatment. “The training programmes would guide on treatment protocol, medication management, stock allocation, etc.” said Singhal. Singhal said that of the 14,924 Covid-19 patients receiving treatment for Covid-19 at private hospitals, 8,902 patients are covered under Aarogyasri. “This translates into 60% of the total patients at private hospital receiving free treatment under Aarogyasri scheme. It is 88.7% in Anantapur and 81% in Vizianagaram,” said Singhal. The principal secretary added that the curfew is giving good results and the public is cooperating with the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/over-1-1k-black-fungus-cases-in-ap-toll-at-14/articleshow/83126805.cms||---

One of them uses their car’s roof as the performance stage. Police took note and initiated a hunt for those responsible for the curfew-break dance on Monday. Police said that they are searching for the car based on the number plate seen in the video; it is from the GJ-27 series. It appears that the video was recorded in Ahmedabad city. The car is registered with the Vastral RTO. The video shows one youth dancing near the driver’s side of the vehicle. The others dance on the main road near a barricade. Police said the youths may have removed the barricade and then decided to dance on the road. Police said they have reasons to believe the youths come from the eastern part of the city. Police are using the number plate to trace and arrest these youths. The officials said that if these youths do not have licences, they will not only be booked under the IPC’s Section 188 (disobeying a public servant’s order) but also under the Motor Vehicles Act. This is not the first time that such a video has surfaced. In the past, several videos of birthday celebrations and of cake-cutting with swords during the curfew had gone viral. Police had made arrests in those cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/curfew-break-dance-cops-hunt-for-five/articleshow/83127960.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Plenty of traffic on road, but factories largely at a standstill for lack of hands||NEW DELHI: Very little work took place in manufacturing units on the first day of the relaxation of the Covid-19 lockdown. Though factories — and construction sites —were permitted to reopen from Monday, industrial areas wore a deserted look, with factory owners hobbled by their inadequate workforce, unavailability of e-passes for labourers who were willing to return to work and the lack of demand because the wholesale markets remain closed. “We do not know of a worker who has managed an e-pass,” said Diwakar Jain, who recycles iron scrap to produce sheets in Bawana Industrial Area. The e-pass portal didn’t accept applications for work pass till late on Sunday evening and many applications were pending on Monday. TimesViewMigrant workers form the bulk of the industrial force in the capital. Many have left for home during the long lockdown, so the very low attendance is understandable. The only way to ensure that they stay back is to give them sustained financial support during such periods. Without any such guarantee, the problem is unlikely to be resolved.Sunil Malhotra, who heads the Okhla Industrial Association and is co-chair of Delhi-NCR wing of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said non-issuance of e-passes was a big deterrent to work restarting. "The reopening period has begun but the passes have not been issued,” Malhotra said. “The applications’ status shows ‘Admitted but no approved’. How can anyone start operations like this? Nobody in our work area got an e-pass. After the migrants returned, we have just a quarter of our workers and even they can’t come to work. What a mess!" Jain, who is an executive committee member of the Bawana Chamber of Industries, said that in circumstances where there were no raw materials available, an acute labour shortage and hardly any demand due to wholesale markets being closed, the industries were unlikely to resume work. Around 14,000 industrial units in Bawana mostly produce plastic products besides automobile spare parts and household equipment. Factory owners are also bothered by the strict compliance norms. Manish Mangla from the Wazirpur Industrial Area pointed out, “The unlocking order states that raids can be carried out by monitoring teams and the Disaster Management Act will be invoked for violations. Why would an operator take the risk of being thus harassed? It is impossible to run our factories in such an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity.” A few industrial associations have also demanded the opening of wholesale markets. Raghuvansh Arora, who heads the Apex Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said, “For small and medium scale enterprises, production depends on demand from wholesale customers. Unless shops and markets open, it is futile for manufacturing units to operate.” He added that workers from NCR and neighbouring towns like Meerut and Panipat are available, but it will take a much longer time for workers from UP and Bihar to return. Shreesh Sharma, member of the Mundka Industrial Welfare Association and chair of the locality’s pollution control committee, managed to secure an e-pass. He is an exception when the larger manufacturing units have failed in getting bulk e-passes for 200-250 workers. Sharma also cited a unique problem. Many metal cutting units in Mundka need oxygen cylinders, but these aren’t available at the moment due to their deployment in hospitals and Covid centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plenty-of-traffic-on-road-but-factories-largely-at-a-standstill-for-lack-of-hands/articleshow/83127950.cms||Paras Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Vehicle ‘illegally’ towed away from riverfront||AHMEDABAD: Maninagar resident Pradeep Desai successfully fought a five-month legal battle to prove that towing of vehicles from the Sabarmati riverfront is not legal because no areas have been notified as ‘No Parking’ zones on either side of the river. His tenacity not to succumb to unlawful police pressure was such that he let his two-wheeler rust at Vasna police station for five months. Desai dragged city police to the Gujarat high court to get his vehicle back, which had been impounded by traffic police after a private towing vehicle seized it from the riverfront. The HC observed that Desai’s vehicle was impounded by police unlawfully and ordered its release, said Desai’s advocate, Kaivan Dastoor. According to case details, on January 6, Desai was driving down the riverfront road for some business purpose and stopped by to attend a phone call. He parked the scooter in front of the flower garden and while he was talking on the phone, a towing van arrived and insisted on seizing the two-wheeler. Desai protested, but lost the vehicle to the team of private persons contracted for towing. Desai dialled the police emergency number, but was told to settle the matter with traffic police. A day later, Desai filed a complaint of loot at Riverfront West police station. His complaint was forwarded to M-division police station, and was closed ultimately. On the other hand, traffic police insisted that Desai pay Rs 750 fine for parking in a ‘No Parking Zone’ and get his vehicle back but refused to issue a challan for the seizure from the riverfront. He refused to pay and decided to take the issue to the high court. On January 18, Desai approached the HC and demanded possession of his vehicle. He also received information under the Right to Information Act (RTI) from the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Ltd and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation that no area on either side of the Riverfront has been notified as a ‘No Parking’ zone and they have not put up any signage to this effect. Before the HC, the traffic police filed an affidavit and claimed that Desai had parked his vehicle in a ‘No Parking’ zone and hence his vehicle was towed away. To counter the traffic police’s claim, Desai placed the information received under RTI showing there is no such ‘No Parking’ zone notified by the authorities. After hearing this case, Justice Gita Gopi observed that the vehicle was in “unlawful” custody and ordered traffic police to release it immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vehicle-illegally-towed-away-from-riverfront/articleshow/83126968.cms||Saeed Khan

According to ECR chief public relations officer ( CPRO ) Rajesh Kumar, “About 5,600 railway employees have been infected by Covid -19 pandemic this time while 227 railway employees and their dependents have succumbed to the virus. The newly-launched app has proved a boon for majority of railway employees to get immediate medical assistance.” According to the CPRO, railway employees including their family members are seeking medical assistance through this app everyday. Railway emergency control in each division is also extending assistance to suffering railway employees with the help of ‘Sparsh’ which has provision for online registration with any railway hospital . Thereafter employees can select railway hospital of their choice located nearby for immediate medical help. “Railways is providing assistance like availability of Covid-19 vaccine, RT-PCR, HRCT, Covid profile, OPD treatment, routine medical advice and consultation with doctors online. This app also prevents patients from visiting railway hospitals during Covid -19 pandemic period. Instead they can seek medical advice online from railway doctors at anytime or they can get pre–allotted time with doctors concerned to avoid unnecessary waiting on the hospital premises,” the CPRO said . Even employees who require medicines, can findout whether the medicine is available in the hospital medical store or not. Besides, they also get a fixed schedule to collect their medicine from the store. In case of any test including Covid-19, appointment time for collection of sample is confirmed beforehand to patients through this app. Railway super specialty hospital at Karbhighaiya in Patna is listed under the select category of railway hospitals to seek medical assistance through ‘ Sparsh’, while other divisional railway hospitals are located at Danapur , Sonepur, Samastipur, Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction and Dhanbad in the ECR’s jurisdiction . “However, railways has declared Danapur railway hospital as Covid-19 dedicated hospital for railway employees and their dependents for treatment,” the CPRO said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/medical-help-app-for-railway-employees-evokes-good-response-7k-register/articleshow/83126035.cms||Kumod Verma

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has given a call for this protest across the country which was endorsed by the Bihar branch of the association on Monday. National president-elect of the IMA, Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh, said Ramdev’s remarks weakened the morale of thousands of doctors who have been tirelessly fighting against the deadly Covid to save innumerable lives. He said even after wearing black badges, the doctors would discharge their duties in government and private health facilities as usual. “Ramdev used offending language against the modern treatment, allopathy, which has been credited with treating many chronic and fatal diseases and building up a better and healthier environment in the country,” said Dr Singh said. The IMA president-elect said 149 doctors from Bihar have so far died in the two waves of Covid, the highest in the country. “At least 500 doctors have so far died in the country due to Covid. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi have also lost many doctors,” he added. IMA state secretary Dr Sunil Kumar said about 25,000 doctors of Bihar would join the protest by wearing black badges on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Bhagalpur chapter of Association of Physicians of India (API), has also condemned Ramdev’s controversial remarks against allopathy and modern medicine. Doctors associated with API have demanded legal action against Ramdev under appropriate laws in the backdrop of Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ramdevs-remarks-25k-doctors-to-wear-black-badges-today/articleshow/83125925.cms||VK Tripathi

Tejashwi alleged that Yadav’s bodyguard had thrashed some members of the Mahadalit community when they lodged their complaint with the MLA against waterlogging in their locality. The incident happened when Khemka was listening to Prime Minister’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ at the Mahadalit Tola on Sunday. One Sujeet Kumar had lodged a complaint with the SC/ST police station against the MLA and his bodyguard under relevant sections of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The MLA, however, rubbished the allegations levelled against him. “This is nothing, but a deliberate attempt to drag my name into controversy. This is being done out of political vendetta,” he said, adding fair investigation into the matter will unravel the truth. Tejashwi alleged that cases of atrocities against members of scheduled caste have increased in the state. Purnia SP Daya Shankar said the allegations against the MLA and his bodyguard were being verified. “Action will be taken against if the allegations are found to be true,” he added. Meanwhile, the BJP took a swipe at Tejashwi for reacting to the issue. “Why did he (Tejashwi) maintain silence when members of Mahadalit community were attacked at a village under the Baisi police station area in Purnia on May 19?” BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-slams-bjp-mla-for-assault-on-mahadalits/articleshow/83125234.cms||Ramashankar

In a recent communication, the RBI said that a majority of banks are yet to submit system audit reports certifying compliance to data storage norms even after three years since the issuance of the circular. It also said that many foreign banks have said that the audit norms did not apply to them and this was not acceptable. The central bank had asked banks to submit their compliance along with a plan of action on or before May 15, 2021. Sources said that recently, the banking regulator had a discussion with some of the foreign banks where it made its displeasure known. According to sources, several foreign banks have been unable to issue an audit report stating that all personal and non-personal transaction data which has been sent overseas for processing has been permanently deleted. Last month, the central bank barred American Express Bank and Diners Club from on-boarding new customers citing violation of data storage norms. The issue relating to data localisation is similar to the one that Google and WhatsApp had faced. What makes it challenging for banks is that RBI’s “on soil” data storage norms. These have a condition that payments data have to be stored “only” in India and no copy should exist outside the country. Many banks had responded to the RBI’s directive and said that much of their processing was centralised and it was not feasible to restructure global operations and create a separate hub in India. The RBI then clarified that while data can be stored only locally, it can be sent intraday for processing but should be deleted from offshore servers in 24 hours. Banks are required to provide a system audit report certifying compliance with the RBI rules. The audit has to be conducted by auditors empanelled by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In, in the ministry of electronics and information technology). The auditors study the IT infrastructure of the organisation and identify all the storage locations. The auditors also have to ascertain that data is being deleted from offshore servers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-slams-foreign-banks-on-data-rule/articleshow/83127510.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Patna||Patna hospitals see decline in admission of Covid-19 patients||PATNA: There has been a significant decline in the admission of Covid-19 patients across hospitals in the city, including private health facilities, after the state government imposed the strict restriction on May 5. The decline in hospital admissions can be attributed to the decrease in the daily count of positive cases in Bihar. The hospital admission of Covid patients has dropped by 40 to 50% compared to the peak period, which was during the first week of May. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, told this newspaper that during the peak time, more than 340 patients were admitted, but the number of patients has declined to 154, including 113 in Covid ward and 60 in ICU (36 on ventilator support). “About 50% drop was seen in admission when compared to figure of last 20 days. During that period, we added beds to admit more patients,” he said. He added, “Before the restriction and even in the first week of lockdown, our occupancy was almost 100%. Every day, the hospital used to get calls from people for admission. The enquiries for admission of Covid patients too have dropped sharply.” Not so long ago, there were no vacant beds for Covid patients in government and private health facilities while ambulances had to wait in queues outside the hospital's premises. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital- Patna (NMCH-P) said every day, they used to see 25-30 ambulances waiting in the queue to admit patients at any given time during the Covid peak time. “The situation started to improve after the lockdown and we are expecting that the situation may further improve by June-mid if the strict restriction will be followed,” he said. “In May first week, our admission of Covid patients crossed 400 while more than 50 infected patients were admitted daily. Now the single-day admission has declined to 6-8, which is a relief for the Covid warriors. The number of death due to Covid-19 has also declined. The shortage of oxygen was also resolved,” Dr Singh said. At the NMCH-P, the total admissions stood at 93 on Sunday, while 70 patients on oxygen and 15 in ICU. As many as 407 beds are vacant for Covid-19 patients. Similarly, the other private hospitals also heave a sigh of relief with low admissions in the Covid-19 ward as the overall positivity condition has improved in the state. Aditya Shekhar, administrative officer of Netaji Subhas Medical College and Hospital, Bihta said the rush of Covid patients at the hospital has come down to 40% when compared to peak time. “Only one or two Covid patients are coming for admission. The situation has improved only after the effective lockdown,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hospitals-see-decline-in-admission-of-covid-19-patients/articleshow/83126414.cms||Faryal Rumi

Acting on a tip-off, the officials intercepted two trucks on NH-139 under the Mehandia police station in Arwal district. The search of the trucks led to seizure of altogether 4,990 litres of IMFL. The trucks were heading for Saran district where the consignment was to be delivered. During interrogation, the drivers— Jantar Rai and Madan Dhari Rai—told police that they were assigned to take the truck from Aurangabad to Saran. However, they were not told about the consignment being transported. A senior official of the excise department said, “We are trying to gather more information about the liquor smugglers. The interrogation of the drivers will throw more light on the illicit trade thriving in the region in violation of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act 2016.” A sub-inspector of police posted at Mehandia police station said that specially designed boxes were made to dupe the probe agencies. The boxes contained cartons of liquor. “Had we not got specific information, the consignment would not have been seized,” he added. Arwal SP Rajiv Ranjan said the entire network of liquor smugglers would be smashed in the days to come. “We have intensified vigil on vehicles on NH-139 falling under Mehandia and Kaler police stations in the district,” he added. In another operation, the Vaishali police recovered liquor worth Rs 50 lakh from a mini truck under the Ganga Bridge police station area. The SHO of Ganga Bridge police station Sunil Kumar said that one person involved in the smuggling was arrested and an SUV was seized. Authoritative sources said that raids were also conducted in Begusarai and Purnia districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/liquor-worth-rs-1-5-crore-seized-from-arwal/articleshow/83125201.cms||Ramashankar

Presently, the city has 63 macro and 949 micro containment zones only. Moreover, the day curfew has been lifted the city from Tuesday as active Covid cases are now below the stipulated 600-mark. After the number of active cases declined below 600, senior officials of police, Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) and district administration have decided to lift macro and micro containment zones in areas (where no active cases were reported last week) after reviewing the status. As Sangam city reported less than 50 new Covid cases per day for the past five days, officials admitted that strict surveillance has yielded desired results. Statistics revealed that the number of macro containment zones has come down to 63 from 143 within a gap of five days — from May 26 to May 31 — while the micro containment zones have declined from 1,664 to 949 in the same period. The peak of macro and micro containment zones was recorded 294 and 9,527, respectively, on May 7. Inspector general of police (Prayagraj range) K P Singh told TOI, “The day curfew has been lifted in Sangam city from Tuesday as active Covid cases are now below the stipulated 600-mark. Economic activities will be allowed to begin outside the containment zones from 7am to 7 pm. The Covid curfew will, however, continue to persist on Saturday and Sunday.” The IG, however, cautioned that curfew would be imposed again if the Covid tally crosses 600-mark and appealed to the citizens to follow Covid protocols strictly or be ready to face the music. He added, “The 3T strategy of tracking, testing and treating has helped district authorities to check the spread of the deadly virus in the city. There has been a more than 94% decline in the number of active cases compared to the past month. The recovery percentage of the city is all set to cross 98% as more and more Covid infected people have recovered in the past two weeks, he added. Apart from Prayagraj district, neighbouring districts like Pratapgarh currently have 21 macro and 145 micro containment zones, followed by Kaushambi (one macro and 30 micro) and Fatehpur (61 micro containment) zones. In Prayagraj, duties of 20 gazetted officials, 39 station house officers, 96 sub- inspectors, 171 head constables, 220 constables and two companies of PAC are still deployed to maintain a strict vigil in macro and micro containment zone areas. Similarly, five gazetted officials and 81 police personnel have been assigned duties in containment zones in Fatehpur district. Moreover, 166 and 31 police officials would perform duties in containment zones in Pratapgarh and Kaushambi districts, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/macro-micro-containment-zones-dip-as-recovery-rate-goes-up-in-city/articleshow/83127658.cms||Kapil Dixit

Kotaiah, a native of Thinnelapudi village in Kota mandal, was hospitalised on May 22 after complaining of breathlessness and was admitted in the ICU with oxygen support. A few days prior to that, he was seen in a video discrediting ‘English medicine’ and claiming that Anandaiah’s herbal medicine was the best cure for Covid. Doctors said Kotaiah, who tested negative for Covid-19 recently, had a CT severity score of over 20 during the time of admission and later developed other complications. However, they also made it clear that the death was not due to Anandaiah’s medicine. While bemoaning his death, doctors said it could have helped had he got himself vaccinated and not stopped taking allopathy medicines. Kotaiah, who was administered the eye drops given by Anandaiah, had also developed severe eye infection which was diagnosed as chemical conjunctivitis. N Praveen Kumar, a Vijayawada-based ophthalmologist, said one of the ingredients in Anandaiah’s eye drop is the milk of Calotropis flower which is harmful to the eye. “There are around 25 other Covid-19 patients who took Anandaiah’s medicine and are admitted in the hospital mainly for chemical conjunctivitis,” a senior doctor at Nellore GGH told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/retd-teacher-who-declared-self-cured-by-herbal-eye-drops-dies/articleshow/83126879.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The Union government is currently allocating 590 MT oxygen a day. However, the state has got about 1,000 MT oxygen over and above its daily quota through oxygen express trains in the recent weeks. After a few weeks into the outbreak in Andhra Pradesh last year, hypoxia-related complications took the centre stage in disease management. Consequently, the state added oxygen lines to nearly 28,000 beds, apart from increased monitoring on patients’ oxygen saturation levels. But the state had not drawn more than 260 metric tonnes of oxygen on any given day during the first wave. But the daily consumption has crossed the 600-MT mark for several days during the ongoing second wave in May. However, at the peak of the first wave in September last year, only some 1,600 critical cases had required ICU facility, while some 7,000 patients were treated with supplemental oxygen. But during the peak of second wave, about 6,300 patients received intensive care and 22,000 patients were on oxygen beds for several days. The Centre is currently allocating 590 MT oxygen a day. The state has also got about 1,000 MT over and above its daily quota through oxygen express trains||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/from-peak-of-640mt-daily-o2-consumption-falls-to-490mt/articleshow/83126848.cms||---

Jyoti had hit the headlines last year for bringing her father to Darbhanga from Gurugram on a bicycle, pedalling about 1,100km, during the Covid-induced lockdown. The Darbhanga district administration has condoled the death of Mohan. Block development officer of Singhwara laid wreath on the mortal remains of Mohan and assured Jyoti of all support. Jyoti’s father used to drive an e-rickshaw at Gurugram. He had, however, become unemployed after surrendering his rickshaw to its owner following the nationwide lockdown in April last year. He had earlier sustained an injury in his leg, following which his 16-year-old daughter Jyoti had gone to the national capital to take care of her father. Faced with acute shortage of money, Jyoti and her father had started their perilous journey from Delhi on May 10 after buying a bicycle for Rs 500. They had reached their village in Darbhanga on May 16. Jyoti on Monday said his father was fine, but complained of uneasiness and vomited profusely in the morning. He passed away before being taken to hospital. On January 25 this year, Jyoti was conferred with Pradhan Mantri Bal Puraskar by PM Narendra Modi. She had got Rs1 lakh, a citation letter and a medal. The award was conferred to Jyoti and 32 other children for their achievement in different fields. Jyoti was also invited by the Cycling Federation of India for training, but she had refused the offer to continue her studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/father-of-cycle-girl-suffers-cardiac-arrest-at-home-dies/articleshow/83125783.cms||Binay Kumar Jha

The fourth casualty was Covid-positive and had co-morbidities, the hospital said. Paediatrics head of DMCH Dr K N Mishra, who is also the teaching hospital's officiating principal, scotched speculation that the deaths might be linked to MIS-C, short for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Siblings Pooja (12), Chandan (9) and Aarti Yadav (8) of Eathrwa village in Madhubani district died of complications caused by pneumonia, septicaemia and severe haemoglobin deficiency within 24 hours of each other, he said. “Before being hospitalised in a critical condition on Friday, the children's family had taken them to quacks,” he added. The youngest of bereaved father Rampreet Yadav’s four kids had died a fortnight ago. The Covid-positive child who died on Sunday was suffering from hydrocephalus and water had to be drained out of his brain last year. “The two-and-a-half-year-old boy was undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Patna and was referred to IGIMS or AIIMS-Patna. However, the family brought him to DMCH on Sunday as they are from Madhubani. The child was on ventilation even in the ambulance,” Dr Mishra said. DMCH superintendent Dr M B Sharma said the three siblings were admitted to the hospital around 4.30pm on May 28. “Two of them died the next day and the third child breathed his last on Sunday. The Covid positive child had died on Sunday,” Dr Sharma added. Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) chief and former MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav had tweeted about the four deaths at DMCH on Sunday night. Pappu, arrested on May 11 in a more than three-decade-old case, is undergoing treatment at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-siblings-among-four-kids-die-at-darbhanga-hospital-in-two-days/articleshow/83125695.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The diesel prices have gone up by Rs 4.20 per litre and petrol has become costlier by Rs 3.38 per litre in the city since the last 30 days. Branded or additive-laced petrol, commonly known as speed or premium petrol are being sold above Rs 100 per litre in the state capital. Ashok Kumar, proprietor of a petrol pump at Dak Bungalow roundabout, said the prices were being revised for three consecutive days after a gap of 3-4 days. “Though the prices of fuel are heading north, sales have drastically plunged by 75% due to the Covid-induced lockdown in the state,” he added. Since transportation costs of vegetables, fruits and other commodities depend on fuel prices, citizens are likely to feel the pinch while buying essentials. Even small increase or decrease in fuel rates has cascading effect on prices of essential commodities. Raj Kumar Jha, general secretary of Bihar State Auto Chalak Sangh, said only CNG- run autorickshaws are plying on roads these days as the rate of CNG is Rs 61 per litre. “Diesel or petrol-run autorickshaws are virtually off the roads due to the lockdown. We have information that some autorickshaw drivers have committed suicide in Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur and Purnia,” he said. Bhanu Shekhar Prasad Singh, president of Bihar Truck Owners’ Association, said even though diesel prices continue to rise in the country, they have not increased the transportation charges for essential items. “The way fuel prices are increasing, we will be forced to increase the transportation cost,” he said. D M Diwakar, an economist and former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, said the Centre is continuously increasing the taxes on fuel and directing the states to follow the suit in a bid to make up for the losses from other sources of tax generation. “It will not help the economy at all and only benefit the private sector players,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fuel-sales-decline-in-state-but-prices-continue-to-soar/articleshow/83125170.cms||Faryal Rumi

Presiding over a virtual meeting, Rudy issued instructions to remove encroachment from drains. Earlier in the meeting, Saran DM Dr Ramchandra Deore also explained the steps taken by the district administration to resolve the problem of waterlogging. “We have inspected the areas which are prone to waterlogging in the town and the municipal corporation is working to remove encroachments from drains and roads,” the DM said. Elaborating on steps being taken for removal of encroachments, Deore said, “Some shops have been constructed over Khanua Nala drain near Sarha Dhala. Steps will soon be initiated to dismantle these shops to enable the sanitation workers to clean the drain before monsoon.” The DM added that municipal commissioner and executive engineer of Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCo) have been asked to ensure immediate action in this matter. “Bihar State Housing Board (BSHB) has issued notices to vacate the dilapidated flats at Prabhunath Nagar,” he added. Altogether 25 drains will be cleaned before the onset of monsoon. “The Chhapra Municipal Corporation has been divided into seven different zones and quick response teams and officers have been deployed for each zone by the municipal corporation to ensure quick drainage of accumulated rain water,” the DM said. The meeting was also attended by Chhapra MLA Dr C N Gupta and mayor Sunita Devi among other officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/25-chhapra-drains-to-be-cleaned-before-onset-of-monsoon-says-dm/articleshow/83125301.cms||H K Verma

In several instances, the patients recovered from Covid-19 infection after a short hospital stay for complications drop dead suddenly at their homes. In other instances, the patients with no cardiac ailment history turn up with severe chest pain or drop in heart rate. Experts say Covid-19 patients are more vulnerable to thrombosis, myocarditis and heart failure. Dr Tejas Patel, senior interventional cardiologist and member of Gujarat Covid task force, said it is important to check D-dimer levels to prevent chance of heart attack due to hyper-clotting. “If a patient's D-dimer level is very high, he or she must continue blood thinners for two to four months after getting recovered from Covid-19 infection as thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and heart failure are frequently seen among Covid recovered patients,” he said. Experts especially red-flag myocarditis or simply inflammation of the heart walls as a significant and oft-reported complication. Dr Anish Chandarana, vice-president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said data collated from the private hospitals treating Covid and post-Covid patients indicated a high prevalence of myocarditis. “Myocarditis is more frequently seen in the second wave. Its prevalence can be 20 to 70% in patients according to some studies among Covid patients. In several cases it can turn fatal if not addressed timely. We thus recommend the patients showing any signs of distress to undergo troponin tests. If the level is high, the person may require intervention,” said Dr Chandarana. Dr Sameer Dani, senior interventional cardiologist, said that in simple terms myocarditis is generally associated with severe infection. "Its detection is generally done through Echocardiography or MRI of the heart,” said Dr Dani. He added they have witnessed a rise in the instances of patients coming with myocarditis. Dr Anil Jain, senior cardiac surgeon, said that Covid infection increases the risk of heart ailments due to the attack on the body’s immune system and formation of blood clots (thrombosis). “Post-Covid check-up of the heart can be life-saving especially for the patients with existing conditions and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension,” he said. Dr Jay Shah, a city-based cardiologist, said that the Cardiology Society of India (CSI) has flagged myocarditis as a risk factor. “It reduces the pumping capacity of the heart – leading to severe heart failure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/recovered-covid-patients-being-hit-by-myocarditis-can-turn-fatal/articleshow/83127063.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh recorded 35% of all Covid cases in May||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has accumulated nearly 5.91 lakh Covid-19 cases in May, equivalent to 35% of all cases that have surfaced in the state since the beginning of the pandemic in March last year. This placed an unprecedented pressure on the state’s health system in the first three weeks of May, with patients having to run from pillar to post to find oxygen and ICU beds.  However, things have started improving in the past week. From a few hundred vacant oxygen and ICU beds two weeks ago, the state had more than 7,700 unoccupied oxygen and ICU beds combined as of Monday. During the peak of the first wave in August last year, the state recorded about 2.95 lakh cases. The intensity of the spread continued even in September 2020 and went on to add 2.55 lakh more infections before the monthly caseload hit its low of 2,074 infections in February 2021. The early signs of a potential second wave emerged in the second half of March and it reached a point where it overwhelmed the state’s health system in May. The presumed peak of the second wave in May posed several new challenges to the state, right from oxygen supply chain management, emergence of hundreds of black fungus infections, and short supply of Amphotericin B for the treatment of the fungal infections. Preparing for the presumed third wave in the next few months, the state recently constituted a paediatric Covid-19 task force committee to advise and guide on technical and medical matters related to Covid-19 treatment and other protocols among the paediatric age group. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said the overall declining trend in terms of daily new Covid-19 infections and case positivity rate is very clear in the state. “The impact of curfew is clearly evident in the containment of the disease in the state. The state government has extended the curfew for 10 more days as it may further help in better Covid-19 management,” said Singhal. Andhra Pradesh has been displaying clear signs of a turnaround for the past week on all parameters of Covid-19 management, including hospital admissions, reproduction numbers, oxygen consumption, enquiries to 104 call centre, case positivity rate, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-recorded-35-of-all-covid-cases-in-may/articleshow/83126768.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Kochi||Govt can decide on objections: HC||Kochi: The Kerala high court on Monday said it is up to the central government to decide whether to accept the objections to the draft Lakshadweep town and country planning regulation or not. It is alleged that the new regulation would take away the land rights of the tribal community. A division bench comprising justices A Muhamed Mustaque and Kauser Edappagath made the observation in the judgment disposing of a public interest litigation (WP-C No. 11591/2021) filed by Mohammed Sadique of Kavaratti. He had sought 30 days more to file objections to the draft regulation in view of Covid-19. Lakshadweep administration’s counsel S Manu had submitted that it received 593 comments, suggestions, objections, etc, and they have been forwarded to the ministry of home affairs. In the judgment, the court said, “It is for the ministry to consider the suggestions, comments, objections, etc, as raised against the draft regulations. Nothing would prevent the ministry from entertaining any of the suggestions if it is worth consideration. It may not be proper for this court to direct the central government or the administrator to accept any suggestion or comments. However, in any system of governance, the government would be eager to consider any such suggestion which may ultimately enable the government to formulate their own decisions while granting approval of draft regulations. Therefore, it is for the central government to consider whether any suggestions, comments or objections to be made by the petitioner or any person have to be accepted or not after the expiry of the time in the notification.” Further, the court said the petitioner can forward his suggestions or comments to the administrator within two weeks and it should be forwarded to the central government. It is for the central government to consider whether such objection or comment is to be accepted or not, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-can-decide-on-objections-hc/articleshow/83126227.cms||---

They demanded that the needy lawyers be given a monthly grant of at least Rs 10,000. They pointed out that the state government had sanctioned a grant of Rs 10 crore to the bar council to help lawyers and that the Bar Council of Rajasthan from its own fund should contribute an equal amount to help those in distress. They also asked the bar council to seek help from the Bar Council of India for this.

---||Kolhapur||2 Solapur sarpanches, both just 21, make villages Covid-free||Kolhapur: Two young and determined sarpanches from Solapur district are earning praise for the way they single-handedly helped their villages beat Covid-19 after seeing death from close quarters. Komal Karpe and Ruturaj Deshmukh, both just 21, were elected sarpanches of their villages in January this year. Both science graduates were learning the ropes of the administration when the second Covid wave struck. Their efforts during the crisis and the remarkable turnaround of their villages in becoming Covid free has earned them praise from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Karpe led by example and used all resources at her disposal to make Antroli Covid-free after the village had seen 80 cases and 15 deaths during the second wave. Once she realised that misconceptions about vaccination were proving to be a stumbling block, she got her father (48) and grandmother (68) vaccinated. She also ensured that all eight elected members of the gram panchayat got their elderly relatives vaccinated. “The whole of last year I was thinking about what I would do if I became sarpanch. This January, after getting elected to the post, I started getting the villagers vaccinated,” Karpe said. She then turned to people from the village who are settled in cities and financially stable, urging them to donate so that they could give the villagers Covid safety kits, masks, sanitisers and thermal scanners, besides food to the needy. Her appeal got tremendous response. Finally, Karpe used the provisions of the Disaster Management Act to turn schools and vacant buildings into quarantine centres. “Everyone coming from outside were mandatorily quarantined for 14 days. With the help of ASHA workers, we screened all villagers and isolated those with symptoms. It was tough task chasing the virus with minimal logistical support. But the villagers cooperated and the youth set aside their political differences to volunteer in Covid-related work,” she told TOI. Antroli resident Samir Sheikh said Karpe was out on the streets most of the time. “She took care of everyone. Her dedication inspired villagers to cooperate. We had the highest mortality in the South Solapur tehsil. Now, for the last few days, we haven’t had a single case,” he said. Thackeray, in his speech on Sunday, said he would arrange an online programme with young sarpanches who have made their villages Covid-free. “Covid cases are still on the rise in the rural parts of the state though the overall cases are dipping. A young sarpanch like Komal can do it, why not others?” he said. Much like Karpe, Deshmukh too managed to make his Ghatane village Covid-free. In April, the death of a father-son duo rattled the villagers. Till then, there had been no Covid case in this tiny village that does not even have a primary health centre. When the deaths happened, the villagers started leaving Ghatane to live in small huts on their farms. “We asked them not to run away from the problem. Without waiting for anyone’s assistance, we started rapid antigen testing. We covered almost 60% of the residents and found a few villagers to be Covid positive. We then conducted contact tracing and sent the positive cases to the nearest Covid care centre at Mohol,” Deshmukh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/2-solapur-sarpanches-both-just-21-make-villages-covid-free/articleshow/83124372.cms||---

Addressing a presser, Fadnavis said, “Last week Supreme Court dismissed the state government’s special leave petition on reservation in electoral seats simply because it did not follow the court’s directive to set up a State Backward Class Commission and collect empirical data.” The government allowed the ordinance issued by the former government to lapse, he said. Fadnavis accused the MVA of doing nothing for 15 months other than seeking the next date for hearing. “I did not want to politicise the issue, but for every failure of this government, the previous government is blamed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fadnavis-blames-mva-govt-for-scrapping-of-obc-seats-quota/articleshow/83129621.cms||---

I never apologized for whatever happened there. But my statement was blown out of proportion and was made into a controversy,” he said, while speaking in the assembly. “If I had come out with a correction then it would have become another controversy,” he added. While participating in the debate on thanksgiving motion for governor’s address, opposition leader V D Satheesan said, “Kadakamapally Surendran expressed regret over the LDF government’s stand in the Sabarimala issue before the elections.” In March,Surendran had said during election campaigning that “the incidents that took place in Sabarimala over the women-entry issue should not have happened and it was most unfortunate.”  He also said the LDF government would implement the Supreme Cour’s final verdict on entry of women only after discussions with believers. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/didnt-apologize-on-sabarimala-kadakampally/articleshow/83126270.cms||---
---||Delhi||Boards’ Cancellation Gets Big Thumbs Up||New Delhi: Students, parents, principals and teachers on Tuesday heaved a sigh of relief after getting the news of cancellation of the Class XII Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) examination. While the anxiety regarding the exams has ended, students are now worried about how the assessment will be done. Many said they should be assessed on their performance in Class XII and no historical reference should be taken. However, a section of stakeholders, mostly parents, were worried that the cancellation of the exams may put these children at a disadvantage later in life. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia also expressed relief at the cancellation. Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Springdales School, said, “With this decision, the biggest uncertainty is over for everyone. This has been a sensible, parent and child-centric decision given the atmosphere that is prevailing today. CBSE will soon be coming out with the criteria for assessment as it has been holding consultation with principals and teachers on the matter.” Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, felt that the criteria for assessment should be on the lines of Class X. “I feel assessment should not be based on the results of classes IX, X and XI. Even in Class XI, the stream is new for students and they are still understanding and learning,” she added. Riya Mukherjee, a Class XII student of Delhi Public School, said, “The results of classes X and XI shouldn’t be considered. The final results should be based on the midterm, pre-board and practical exams.” She was happy that the results would be declared soon as she plans to go abroad. Darshan Ram, a student of Bluebells School International, was relieved as the university admission process would not be hampered. He hopes to study in Delhi University. “I believe the best thing will be a combination of our performance in Class XII throughout the year, predicted scores and internal assessment,” he added. However, DS Rana, vice-president of All India Parents Association Delhi, felt it would be a herculean task for CBSE. “How is the board going to ensure uniformity? What will be the checks and balances so that schools don’t indulge in unfair awarding of marks? My wife is a teacher. As soon as the announcement came, she was flooded with queries by students about how they would be assessed,” he added. Manoj Sharma, whose daughter is in Class XII, expressed shock and said this could lead to litigation. “Most students study seriously only when the board exams are round the corner. This feels like complete policy paralysis. I am worried about the future of these students,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/boards-cancellation-gets-big-thumbs-up/articleshow/83156440.cms||Shradha Chettri

The study authored by IMD’s director general Dr M Mohapatra and team states that there is an increasing trend in the tropical cyclones frequency over Arabian Sea, making the coastal regions highly vulnerable. Already, two back-to-back cyclones made landfall on both coasts of India in the last month. Cyclone Tauktae which passed along the west coast had led to a trail of devastation caused by heavy rains and winds before making a landfall in Gujarat. Close on its heels, Cyclone Yaas moved directly from the Andaman Sea into Odisha and West Bengal. While the coastal vulnerability due to extremely severe cyclonic storms continues over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region, there has been a decreasing trend in the category of depressions and cyclonic storms. However, in the west coast, just the opposite scenario has been unfolding. The region has been seeing an increasing trend in severe storms. The landfall of very severe cyclonic storms has increased over the Saurashtra and Kutch coast. IMD’s scientists analyzed satellite data from 1965-2020 to understand the frequency of genesis and landfall of different categories of tropical cyclones over the north Indian Ocean. According to the study, about 10 cyclonic depressions and five tropical cyclones develop over the north Indian Ocean during a year. Of this, 47% of cyclonic depressions intensify into cyclonic storms while 20% are in very severe category. There is a 69% probability for a severe cyclonic storm intensifying into the next stage of severity. IMD has already been issuing early warnings to state governments and has almost successfully marked the trajectory of most cyclones in the last few years. The frequencies of genesis and landfall of all categories of tropical cyclones are higher by about 3-4 times during post-monsoon than in pre-monsoon season over the Bay of Bengal but there has been no differences in such occurrences for both pre and post monsoon seasons. There have been strong protests by local residents seeking stronger sea-wall protection systems as coasts grow vulnerable to invading sea waters. These are low-lying areas and highly-populated, and the threat the people face has even become a political issue, leading to citizen-led political fronts contesting in the elections to both local bodies and assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cyclones-over-arabian-sea-more-frequent-imd-study/articleshow/83126305.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

As per official data, municipal limits of Aurangabad had Covid positivity rate of 11.54%. This would define the stand taken by the administration on relaxation of curbs. Till 9 pm on Monday, no official order regarding relaxation of curbs had been issued. Jagganath Kale, president of local traders’ body, said commercial establishments must be allowed to remain open from morning till 2 pm. “The fresh Covid cases have been declined to two-digit mark in Aurangabad, reducing the burden on health machinery. Shops have been closed till date even if rainy season has arrived. Besides financial losses, traders are worried that no pre-monsoon maintenance would ruin their shops and goods,” he said. Earlier in the day, Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan, police commissioner Nikhil Gupta and others held a review meeting to discuss the Break The Chain order issued by the government in the light of local situation of Covid-19. The closed-door meeting saw participation of different public representatives as well. Aurangabad district on Monday reported 216 fresh case of Covid-19, including 83 cases from the municipal limits, taking total number of active cases to 3,470. Meanwhile, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation and national-level NGO, Samdrushti Kshamata Vikas Anusandhan Mandal, on Monday held a dedicated vaccination drive for people with disabilities from the age group of 18 to 44 years of age. The drive, which was held ar Lahuji Salve Aarogya Kendra at Milind Nagar, saw 90 such citizens registering for the vaccination and 50 getting the first dose, said an official release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-traders-seek-lifting-of-curbs-cite-order/articleshow/83121213.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Monsoon expected to hit Rajasthan around June 20||JAIPUR: As the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday said the south western monsoon is likely to enter Kerala by June 3, Rajasthan is expecting monsoon winds to arrive June 20 onwards. Jaipur Met office stated that going by the average of past thirty years, there is a possibility that monsoon will enter from south western parts of the state and will cover the entire state July 1 onwards. IMD Delhi on Monday said that monsoon will arrive in Kerala on June 3. Earlier, the forecast was for monsoon to hit Kerala on May 31 but due to the effect of the cyclone, it got delayed. In Rajasthan, the pre-monsoon activity starts from second week of June. “During the second week of June, humidity levels will start rising. Also, humidity level of 90 per cent and above is always conducive for onset of the monsoon. With the arrival of monsoon in Kerala, it takes almost 17 days to reach Rajasthan via districts like Udaipur, Chittorgarh, Kota and Baran,” said an officer with the Jaipur Met office. Authorities stated that the state is likely to see first monsoon activity from June 20 onwards. “Everything depends on its further progression towards Vidarbha, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh,” said the officer. When contacted, Radhey Shyam Sharma, director, Jaipur Met office, said, “Going by the previous dates, we can only expect the arrival of monsoon around June 20 onwards. But it is too early to give a projected date. After its arrival in Kerala, its pattern would be studied properly.” Meanwhile, mercury continued to take an upward swing across the state on Monday and majority of the places witnessed rise in the temperatures. Bikaner remained hottest in the state where a minimum temperature of 44 degree Celsius was recorded. People in Jaipur woke up to a warmer morning as a minimum temperature of 29 degree Celsius was recorded. It was followed by comparatively lesser scorching afternoon as a maximum temperature of 40.2 degree Celsius was recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/monsoon-expected-to-hit-raj-around-june-20/articleshow/83128004.cms||---

Hussain, who died of a heart attack, was the tallest Muslim leader among the Barelvi school of Islam. His funeral procession started from his residence at Paharganj to the shrine of Maulana Ziauddin at Char Darwaja via Surajpole and Ramganj Chaupad. An eyewitness said over 2,000 persons attended his Nawaz-E-Janaza on the main road at Pahar Ganj. The news of his death spread like wildfire in the Muslim dominated areas in the city. Police too became active in the area anticipating huge turnout by deploying additional cover. Even barricading was put in place at some places to prevent people from walking with the procession. The family assured police that they would not allow the visitors to attend the funeral other than a few family members following Covid protocol. The inaction of police encouraged the crowd to swell in huge numbers and attended the procession grossly violating social distancing.

---||Delhi||DU supports move, no change in admissions||New Delhi: University of Delhi on Tuesday claimed that college admissions would be unaffected by CBSE’s decision to not conduct the Class XII board exams. DU vice-chancellor PC Joshi told TOI, “We will continue to admit students based on merit and consider the score under the assessment designed by CBSE.” Every year, most students who apply to DU are from CBSE and often the high marks influence the cutoffs set by colleges. Asked if CBSE results would affect the cutoffs, Joshi said, “It will all depend on merit. Earlier, we were planning to conduct admissions taking into consideration Class XII marks and Central Universities Common Entrance Test. However, now that things have changed and CBSE and other boards have taken fresh decisions, we will also modify the admission process.” IP College for Women principal Babli Moitra Saraf welcomed the decision to cancel the exams. “The decision is in favour of students. We have a continuous rigorous assessment system, so there is no need to endanger the lives of students, teachers and support staff during exams. My sympathies are entirely with the students and teachers. I’m sure the system is robust enough for students to get on with their career,” she said. SP Aggarwal, principal of Ramanujan College, said the decision to not conduct the board exams would help DU. “Now, we can conduct admissions early as results will be out relatively sooner,” he added. Asked if the new assessment could affect the colleges cutoffs, he said it would depend on the criteria set by CBSE. Anju Srivastava, principal of Hindu College, said, “It’s good that the exams have been scrapped given the current circumstances. There was some confusion over DU conducting entrance exams for admissions. But we will in all probabilities go with our system of merit-based admissions.” Rajeev Gupta, chairperson of admissions at DU, said, “Delhi University fully supports the decision taken by the Centre to cancel the CBSE board examinations in view of the pandemic. The varsity also feels that the health and safety of students is of utmost importance. We look forward to the decision taken by CBSE regarding the declaration of results.” Ambedkar University Delhi, in a statement, said it was a timely and welcome decision by the government to not conduct the board exams. This would help the university complete its admission process and begin the next academic session in time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-supports-move-no-change-in-admissions/articleshow/83156516.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Price rises as sea water in ponds kills fish||KOLKATA: After distress sale of washed-away fish from fisheries (bheris) in the aftermath of cylcone Yaas, prices have started soaring as supplies dipped in the market. While fish consignments from Andhra Pradesh are yet to be restored to pre-Yaas level, ingress of saline water in sweet water ponds in South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore, which killed a large number of fish, dried up local supplies. Traders said the demand-supply gap was likely to widen in coming days. Markets in the city saw a dearth of fish on Monday, with demand far exceeding the supply. The prices suddenly jumped by Rs 100-150 per kg across varieties. “It is mainly because of the shortage. The supply line from Andhra Pradesh is facing problems. The series of diesel price rises also hit transportation and escalated prices,” said Amar Das, a fish vendor at Lake Market. Buyers had to shell out double the money for the Bengali household staple. “I had difficulty finding small variety fish. Finally, I paid double the price for what I got after much effort,” said Gourango Sarkar, a retired central government employee at Parnashree. Preeti Ghosh also faced similar problem at Sinthee Market, where she complained, “fresh fish had vanished”. Explaining the “disappearing fresh fish”, Bijon Maity, secretary of Fishermen’s Association, Kakdwip, said, “So far, the fish from ponds and tanks catered to 70% of the demand, while 30% was met by sea fish. But after saline water flowed into ponds during the cyclone and the day after, lakhs of fish died, changing the scene. Now, there is a serious scarcity and the demand-supply gap will widen further.” “ It is going to take months to drain saline water out of ponds and let rain water fill the places up. Only then, can fish be cultivated there. The crisis will persist till then,” said Raghu Gayen, whose fishery in Phalta has been washed away. Nine of 18 ponds belonging to Tarasundor Haldar, a fish cultivator at Namkhana, have been washed away. “I have lost a few lakhs of fresh fish. Even during Amphan, I had managed to safeguard all my ponds. At least 100 families are dependent on this fishery,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/price-rises-as-sea-water-in-ponds-kills-fish/articleshow/83126304.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

District collector Shekhar Singh will review the situation and grant relaxations if the positivity rate drops further. As per Singh’s order, all shops — barring medical stores and fertilisers and seeds shops — will stay shut. The shops that are allowed to operate too can do so till 3 pm. However, banks are allowed to function considering the demand from the farmers. Speaking to TOI Singh said, “The positivity rate is around 18% and oxygen bed occupancy is around 60% here. In both these aspects, the district is below the parameters fixed by the state government to impose strict restrictions such as sealing district borders. We are, however, continuing with the lockdown imposed a week ago. There will be restrictions on the movement of people. We will continue with this till there is an improvement in Satara district’s Covid situation.” Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhari has eased some of the local restrictions. The district had been under a lockdown till May 31. Currently, the positivity rate has come down to around 13%. Chaudhari said: “We are going to implement the earlier ‘Break the Chain’ order. We are allowing the essential shops and vegetables supply to open till 11 pm. However, the restrictions on movement of citizens will continue except for emergency medical purposes.” In Kolhapur district, the state government’s Covid restrictions will continue. The essential shops will remain open for a restricted time. None of the three districts have allowed the non-essential single shops to function as they are yet to bring the positivity rate below 10%. Kolhapur adds 1,615 cases Kolhapur reported 1,615 fresh cases and 40 deaths on Monday while Satara added 1,872 cases and 35 Covid deaths.

Sources said Saini was questioned 3pm to 7pm. Others who were questioned included special DGP rank officers Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota and Rohit Chaudhary. It is learnt that SIT would question other police officers, including suspended IG Paramraj Singh Umranangal, on June 7 in the case. In compliance of the Punjab and Haryana high court, the state government had on May 7 constituted the three-member SIT, comprising Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal and DIG Faridkot range Surjeet Singh to probe two FIRs (dated Oct 14, 2015, and Aug 7, 2018) in connection with the Kotkapura police firing incidents. In April, the high court had quashed the probe conducted into the case by the earlier SIT comprising then IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh and ordered the constitution of new SIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sit-quizzes-ex-dgp-for-4-hrs/articleshow/83128058.cms||---
---||India||Delhi HC calls Central Vista ‘vital’, junks PIL as ‘motivated’; fines petitioners 1 lakh||NEW DELHI: Stressing that the Central Vista is an “essential and vital” project of national importance, the Delhi high court on Monday dismissed a PIL and instead slapped a 1 lakh fine on the petitioners for seeking to stop the construction activity during the pandemic, reports Abhinav Garg. The HC accepted the Centre’s stand that all Covid-related precautions have been taken to protect the workers engaged on the project site from the viral infection, and noted that “we see no reason to stop the work” since these workers are staying onsite during the curfew in compliance with DDMA guidelines. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said “challenge to the ongoing construction activity with regard to one particular project, is a pointer to the ill-intent and lack of bonafides of the petitioners in filing the present petition” pointing out that the legality of the project was already upheld by the Supreme Court in January. Once the SC gave its nod, the work has to be completed within time-bound schedule, the bench noted, adding that “construction activity of this essential project or of a project of national importance cannot be stopped especially when the conditions imposed by the order of the DDMA are not flouted or violated”. The HC also rejected the stand of the two petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi that the work is not “essential activity”. It underlined that the “project in question is of vital importance and essential and has a direct nexus with the main project, namely, Central Vista Project.” By no stretch of imagination, the HC observed, can it be said that “Central Vista Project (which is the main project) or Central Vista avenue redevelopment project is not an essential project. The Central Vista avenue redevelopment project, which is a subset of the main project, is equally important and essential as the main project”. It said once a court is satisfied that workers are staying at the site and all facilities have been provided by the contractor, “Covid-19 protocols are adhered to and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is being followed, there is no reason for this court to stop the project”. The bench also took note that petitioners casually argued that the time limit can be extended. “Such kind of arguments cannot be accepted by this court,” the HC said, noting that “we are of the view that this is a motivated petition preferred by the petitioners and not a genuine PIL. In view of that, the petition is dismissed with costs of Rs 1 lakh to be deposited by the petitioners with the Delhi State Legal Services Authority within four weeks from today.” The court agreed with the argument of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the public interest touted by the two petitioners is “very selective” as they ignored other construction works that are going on in the vicinity. The bench noted that several other agencies like CPWD, NBCC, DMRC, PWD, IICC and DDA are undertaking construction projects in Delhi and said “it is obvious that petitioners have selectively chosen only one project which is of national importance, at a vital place where Republic Day celebrations are held in Delhi and is a part and parcel of the larger project, namely Central Vista Project”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-hc-calls-central-vista-vital-junks-pil-as-motivated-fines-petitioners-1-lakh/articleshow/83131694.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Aurangabad||Sena MLA gets 6-mth RI for assault on cop, secures bail too||Aurangabad: The court of additional sessions judge Shridhar M Bhosle here on Monday convicted and sentenced Shiv Sena's sitting MLA and former MP Pradip Shivnarayan Jaiswal to six months’ rigorous imprisonment for assaulting a head constable at the Kranti chowk police station on May 21, 2018 during the Raja Bazar communal riots. Jaiswal, who represents the Aurangabad central assembly seat, had then gone to the police station, demanding immediate release of two men who were arrested from the Gandhi Nagar area for rioting and other charges. Judge Bhosle said, "It is worth to note that the accused (Jaiswal) is an MLA. Moreover, he also was a Member of Parliament. Thus, he is one of the persons who also has a role to enact laws and, therefore, more responsibility is upon him to obey the law of the land. However, from the facts as stated above to get the accused persons, who were in custody in respect of communal riot, released, he committed the said act. Needless to say that no one is above the law. Therefore, considering the nature of offence and the knowledge of the applicant as a lawmaker, in my considered opinion this is not a fit case where an accused can be released on probation." Soon after the sentencing, the judge granted Jaiswal default bail to enable him to appeal in the higher courts. "In case of a conviction where the punishment given is of less than three years, the convict gets default bail till the appeal period,” public prosecutor Avinash S Deshpande told TOI. When contacted, Jaiswal told TOI, "I respectfully accept the court's verdict in the case against me. However, we will move an appeal before the Bombay high court soon." Shiv Sena spokesperson and MLC Ambadas Danve said, “We respect the court of law and are confident that he (Jaiswal) will get justice from the appellate court.” On May 21, 2018, Jaiswal was booked by the police under sections 353 (assaulting or obstructing public servant), 504 (causing intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 427 (mischief) of the IPC after he ransacked the Kranti Chowk police station while demanding release of the two arrested. The court acquitted him from the charges of causing intentional insult and mischief but convicted him on the other two counts. It gave six months’ rigorous jail for the assault charge and six months’ simple imprisonment for the criminal intimidation charge. Both sentences are to run concurrently. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 2,500 each on both counts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sena-mla-gets-6-mth-ri-for-assault-on-cop-secures-bail-too/articleshow/83124516.cms||Mohammed Akhef

On Monday, the father of the two youths lodged a named FIR at the Phulian police station of Bhilwara in which he has accused seven persons of abetment to suicide. Police in the primary investigation suggested that the inclination of one of the deceased towards his cousin sister was the primary reason for suicide. According to police, Kailash Bairwa (23) hanged himself from a tree on Thursday. “It was learnt that his younger brother Banwari Bairwa (21) under the influence of alcohol said he was in love with his cousin sister. So, Banwari asked his younger brother not to get into such talks and not to dare say that he was in love with cousin sister. This led to a scuffle among them. Also, the real brothers of the girl asked Kailash and Banwari to stay away,” said Bhagirath Singh, station house officer of Phulian Kalan village on Monday. Irked with the family scuffle, Banwari committed suicide on Thursday. “Thereafter, Kailash Bairwa ended his life by consuming pesticide at home.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said that these were pre-monsoon showers and were likely to continue through the week. The official date for the onset of monsoon in the city is June 11. Starting from around 10am on Monday, it rained in Bandra, Santacruz, Malad, Kurla, Goregaon, Chembur, etc. In Andheri, there was a steady shower for around two hours which gradually receded. The rainfall recorded by the IMD Santacruz observatory from 8.30am-5.30pm was 48.2mm which falls in the moderate rainfall category as per the IMD classification (15.6mm up to 64.4mm-moderate rains). However, through the day skies continued to be cloudy. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist (IMD) said that the south-westerly winds were persisting leading to such conditions. Meanwhile, for the rest of the week, the IMD has said that light rains are likely on all days till Friday. In parts of Thane and Raigad there could be thunderstorms with lightning and rain at isolated places on Tuesday.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Annual fee boost for private schools||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Monday allowed private unaided schools in the capital to levy the annual charges and the development fee from students who have been since 2020 paying only the tuition fee. The court set aside a Delhi government order that barred the schools from collecting these fees beyond the first lockdown period and deferred it till their physical opening. Justice Jayant Nath held that Delhi government had no power to indefinitely postpone the collection of annual charges and development fees by the private unaided schools as it would unreasonably restrict their functioning, allowing schools to retrospectively charge fees from last year. However, taking note of unused facilities during online classes, the high court said there would be a deduction of 15% from the fees charged since the schools had been saving some money as they were physically shut. The court cited a Supreme Court ruling in this regard. While the directorate of education (DoE) of Delhi government does have powers to prevent commercialisation of education and profiteering, “generating a reasonable surplus to augment its facilities and for other such purposes is a legitimate act which cannot be faulted with”, the judge added. Quashing the notifications of April and August 2020, the court said the revised amount could be paid by students in six monthly instalments from June 10. The relief came on a plea filed by Action Committee for Unaided Recognised Private Schools, a group of 450 schools. Appearing for it, advocate Kamal Gupta argued that restricting the collection to certain heads/amounts was illegal and without any authority or jurisdiction. The association maintained that DoE had a limited jurisdiction to regulate the fees, that too only to prevent commercialisation and profiteering. Seeing merit in the stand, the court noted the unaided schools were “clearly dependent only on the fees collected to cover their salary, establishment and all other expenditure” and any regulations or orders “which seek to restrict or in-definitely postpone their powers to collect normal and usual fees... is bound to create grave financial prejudice and harm to the schools”. In the absence of commercialisation of education or exploitation, “DoE cannot indefinitely cut down the established fees or restrain a said school from collecting a portion of the existing fees”, it added. The court included safeguards inserted by the Supreme Court in its verdict on school fees. SC had said schools couldn’t debar any student from attending online or physical classes or withhold exam results and students’ name for Board exams over non-payment of fees/arrears.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/annual-fee-boost-for-pvt-schools/articleshow/83126399.cms||Abhinav Garg

Factors such as blocked roads due to fallen trees and power failure contributed to the loss. Goa Dairy’s administrative committee chairman Durgesh Shirodkar said that several milk vans were stuck mid-way and milk could not reach the sale booths. “Sale dipped to about 70% on Monday. Also, around 20,000 litres of raw milk collected by village-level societies got spoiled due to delay in transportation,” Shirodkar said. Goa Dairy usually sells around 54,000 to 56,000 litres of milk daily, On May 17, only 37,724 litres were sold, he said. The dairy supplies milk on 36 routes across the state. But access on most of these was blocked due to fallen trees. The lack of electricity added to the woes of the dairy as a number of retailers reduced earlier orders or bought just limited stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-dairy-suffers-loss-of-rs-1-5cr-due-to-cyclone-tauktae/articleshow/83128046.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Prior to its arrival, the pre-monsoon showers were strong over most parts of the state. Skymet said that by and large, all parameters have satisfied the required threshold, essentially the rainfall and depth and speed of westerly winds over southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining equatorial Indian Ocean. However, it added that in the absence of any major monsoon trigger, the onset may be slightly mild. Conditions are favourable for its further advancement to more parts of the south Peninsula and east central Bay of Bengal. Timely progress is expected over northeast India. The formation of cyclonic circulations on either side of the coastline in the first week of June will push and strengthen the monsoon current. However, IMD on Monday said that southwesterly winds are also likely to strengthen further gradually from June 1, resulting in likely enhancement in rainfall activity over Kerala. Hence the monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place around June 3. It warned of squally weather (speed reaching 40-50kmph) likely along and off Kerala coast. Fishermen are advised not to venture into these areas. Heavy rainfall (7-11 cm in 24 hours) is very likely at one or two places in Kerala till June 2. Thunderstorms with lightning accompanied by gusty wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph are very likely at one or two places till June 4. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/monsoon-has-arrived-says-skymet-imd-differs/articleshow/83126333.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At the event, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, along with experts Amit Sen and Shelja Sen, spoke to around 10,000 participants about the need to adopt new parenting approaches to improve the emotional well-being of children. Calling the parenting technique in the country “archaic”, Sisodia said, “Adopting new approaches is significant to improve the emotional well-being of children, especially in times of Covid crisis. A new normal has emerged, and our old ways will not work. Our children, who used to have many social interactions, are at home now. In such a time, when they have been home for 1.5 years, parents have been facing new challenges to deal with the situation at home,” said Sisodia. Sisodia added that the parents needed to adopt habits of mindfulness and learn to be more understanding. “In fact, mindfulness practices in Happiness Classes have played a crucial role in easing mental stress of children and parents alike.” While Dr Shelja Sen and Dr Amit Sen gave suggestions on parenting, they said parents should organise mindfulness, meditation, yoga and stress-buster activities at home with children. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/time-to-adopt-new-parenting-approach-sisodia/articleshow/83156592.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was waylaid by some assailants who forcibly bundled him into a car and sped away. Based on the complaint by his family, an FIR was registered against seven named accused, including his political rival Saurabh Chaudhury, the main accused in the case. Two of the named accused, Chaudhury’s wife and mother, have been arrested. The others are absconding, police said. “Five teams have been formed to trace the culprits,” said Bulandshahr SSP Santosh Kumar. He added that following a tip-off, police raided the homes of two of the culprits and dug out illegal weapons buried in the ground. The two had alerted their families to bury them. “A country-made pistol and 10 cartridges were recovered from the house of one of them and 10 cartridges from the other,” the SSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/newly-elected-bdc-member-abducted-from-market-family-blames-political-rival/articleshow/83124533.cms||---
---||Meerut||Meerut: Hospital cut oxygen of patients, led to 20-30 deaths||MEERUT: The administration in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut is probing allegation that a private hospital admitted four times more patients than it was allowed during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and supplied them with inadequate oxygen leading to “25-30 deaths” every day. The allegation was made by Devendra Kumar, an insider who has been working with the hospital for the last 11 years. Taking the accusations seriously, district magistrate K Balaji has ordered a probe by a panel. “We have constituted a team of additional district magistrate (ADM, administration) and assistant chief medical officer (ACMO) which will look into the allegations,” he said. Attempts to contact the owner of the hospital went unanswered. In his video statement, Kumar alleged that the hospital was getting limited oxygen cylinders which were meant to cater to the need of its fixed quota of 50 patients. “District magistrate had authorized the intake of only 50 Covid-19 patients. So we were getting our quota of 300 oxygen cylinders. But the hospital admitted 193-194 patients between April 10 and May 15. And for all of them, we would have required at least 800 cylinders every 24 hours. So -- to compensate for this-- the usual pressure of 4.1 was reduced to 1.5, resulting in 25-30 deaths daily,” Kumar said. Kumar also claimed that the hospital management threatened him “against sharing this with anyone outside”. “I kept quiet for some time. But when they continued doing this, I spoke to the hospital owner. But he misbehaved and threatened me,” Kumar said. Meanwhile, the family members who lost their loved ones in the hospital corroborated the claims of staffer Kumar. “I got my mother admitted in the hospital on April 21 and she died a week later. On the night of April 25, they had announced that just 10 minutes of oxygen was left and attendants should shift their patients to another hospital. A ruckus had ensued and attendants asked why they admitted patients when they did not have required capacity,” Ashutosh Johri (30) said. His mother, Santosh (57), died on April 28. “Most of the fatalities occurred between 3 and 5 in the night,” Johri claimed.

---||Kolkata||Artists’ forum supports move to shoot from home||Kolkata: The West Bengal Motion Picture Artists’ Forum on Monday accused Swarup Biswas, president of the Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI), of trying to create a rift between artistes and technicians. The 3,500-member forum supported the Welfare Association of Television Producers’ decision to go ahead with shoot-from-home and urged the chief minister to allow vaccination of artistes. Actor Shantilal Mukherjee, joint secretary of the forum, told TOI, “Producers said on Sunday they would shift out of Bengal to shoot if this resistance to shooting-from-home continues. This made us insecure.” He claimed, “His (Biswas’s) source of income doesn’t depend on this industry. Artistes and technicians will suffer if work moves out. We protest his demand to abstain from shoot-at-home.” Biswas said, “Let them go ahead with shoot at home. We are preparing a statement, which is being signed by heads of all guilds. It is unfair to say I am acting arbitrarily.” Mukherjee refuted Biswas’s claim of the forum’s non-cooperation with FCTWEI’s Covid test on floor. “We had some questions but got no reply,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/artists-forum-supports-move-to-shoot-from-home/articleshow/83126344.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

For this purpose, it will first conduct a study by collecting details from other states about the measures taken by them. Gehlot announced it while addressing the healthcare workers, anganwadi workers and panchayati raj institutions on the World No-Tobacco Day through a virtual platform. Gehlot said that Covid-19 mostly affects lungs of the people. In such a scenario, those who smoke are at a higher risk of getting lung infection if they get infected with the virus. Also, tobacco consumption increases risk of cancer. Tobacco or any sort of addiction is injurious to health. He said that the state government is taking all possible measures to discourage tobacco use. During previous tenure of Congress government, 65% of tax on tobacco products was imposed which was highest in the country. Now, the state government is planning to formulate a policy to discourage use of tobacco products in the state. Health minister Raghu Sharma said that centres across the states have been set up for helping people to get over tobacco addiction and their treatment. Also, restrictions have been imposed on the sale of tobacco products within 100 yards of educational institutions and hospitals. He said that the state government has imposed ban on e-cigarettes and hookah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-plans-policy-to-discourage-sale-and-use-of-tobacco/articleshow/83128097.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: HC extends all interim orders till Aug 2||Prayagraj: In view of the present situation of Covid-19 pandemic, the Allahabad high court on Monday extended all its interim orders passed by the high court at Allahabad and as well as at Lucknow, all the district courts, tribunals, etc., over which this court has power of superintendence till August 2. The court passed this order when it was apprised that the situation has still not improved and all the courts including the district courts, tribunals as well as the High Court are working in virtual mode with limited capacity. Hearing a PIL, a division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and Justice Prakash Padia directed the registry of this court to give wide publicity to this order “so that the litigants may know about the order and do not rush to court for different relief covered by these directions”. Earlier, this court had on April 24, while keeping in view the second wave of corona pandemic, had extended all its interim orders till May 31. On Monday, before the expiry of the previous order, the court directed that the earlier detailed order passed on April 24, 2021 will continue till August 2. Thereafter, the court directed to list this case on August 2 for the next hearing. Elaborating the interim orders, the court directed that the criminal courts in the state of Uttar Pradesh, which granted bail orders or anticipatory bail for a limited period, which are likely to expire on or before May 31, shall stand extended till August 2. Besides, any orders of eviction, dispossession or demolition, already passed by the high court, district court or civil court, if not executed till the date of passing of this order shall remain in abeyance for the period till August 2. In addition, the state government, municipal authorities, other local bodies and agencies and instrumentalities of the state government shall be slow in taking action of demolition and eviction of persons till August 2. The court further directed that any bank or financial institution shall not take any action for auction in respect of any property or an institute or person or party or anybody corporate till August 2. The court, however, made it clear that in case of extension of interim orders as per the present order, if any undue hardship and prejudice of any extreme nature is caused to any of the party to such proceedings, the said party/parties would be at liberty to seek appropriate relief by moving appropriate application before the competent court, and the general direction issued by this order shall not be an embargo in considering such application and deciding the same after affording an opportunity of hearing to all the parties to said case. Similarly, the state and its functionaries will also be at liberty to file appropriate applications in respect of particular cases for necessary directions, the court added. Keeping in view the importance of this order, the court also directed its registry to upload this order on official website of the high court and all district courts, tribunals, judicial and quasi-judicial authorities of state of Uttar Pradesh over which this court has power of superintendence. Besides, the court also directed that this order be also uploaded on the official website of additional solicitor general (ASG), advocate general (AG), chairman of the Uttar Pradesh State Bar Council, all the respective Bar associations and special public prosecutor (SPP).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-extends-all-interim-orders-till-aug-2/articleshow/83127669.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Environmentalists cry foul over haphazard dredging of rivers||KERI: Wildlifers and environmentalists claim that the laid norms were not followed properly while desilting and dredging of rivers. Water resources department has been undertaking such works as per the requests of villagers to check flooding during the monsoon. At many places, excavators are pressed into service and the work is carried out haphazardly. This has caused an irreparable loss to the ecosystems. Assavari Kulkarni, a botanist from Honda in Sattari, told TOI that during dredging and desilting works, species of sherni plants that protect the riverine course as well as beds have degraded. Sherni plays an important role in minimising the destructive role of the floods. It enriches freshwater ecosystems too. The department has been carrying out such works for over a decade. However, all these works have been carried out without having a scientific approach, allege environmentalists. Instead of focusing on catchment area treatment and watershed development activities, the WRD officials feel that dredging and desiltation will help in minimising floods. Subodh Naik, a post-graduate in Geography said, “Dredging and desiltation carried out without following environmental norms have affected fish breeding habitat and created problems for aquatic life. Siltation is a natural phenomenon. Heavy rainfall, deforestation, construction of dams and encroachment on flood plains are posing a threat leading to erosion of the riverbed and gradual reduction in flood plains.” Amrut Singh, a wildlifer said, “It has been noticed that whenever desiltation work is going on, contractors remove boulders, pebbles and sand that is indeed playing a significant role in maintaining natural flow of the water and the course of the river too.” A retired WRD engineer said on the condition of anonymity that for river rejuvenation, there is a need for geological and hydrological study. “Recharge pits, contour trenches and eco-friendly check dams, if planned properly will help in protecting and conserving rivers. Unscientific dredging and desiltation has been posing a serious threat to rivers and its ecosystems.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/environmentalists-cry-foul-over-haphazard-dredging-of-rivers/articleshow/83128092.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Later, it was found that the clip of Parsa Shukl village under Dharamsinghwa police station limits in Sant Kabir Nagar district was uploaded on social media about a week ago. In the clip, three sons could be seen burying the body of their father with the help of an excavator, reports said. The clip also showed the three men, wearing gloves, burying things like bedsheets and some packets in the pit along with the body. “The incident took place about eight days ago. The video clip went viral on Sunday. The family of the deceased didn’t inform the police about the incident. However, we are looking into the matter,” Dharamsinghwa police told TOI on Monday. Village head Triyoganand Gautam said, “A 60-year-old man Hindu of the village, who was Covid positive, died a week ago. We offered help to the family of the deceased to perform last rites of the body as per customs and tradition, but his three sons refused. They buried the body with the help of an excavator. No traditional rituals were followed in his final rites.” When the three men were asked about the development, they said as they were not sure of Covid protocol, they buried the body of their father in the ground so as to check the infection spreading in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/family-buries-body-of-covid-19-victim-belongings-with-excavator/articleshow/83127648.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Over 5,000 hospitals, schools lack fire NOC’||AHMEDABAD: There are more than 5,000 buildings housing hospitals and schools which do not have fire no-objection certificates in 156 municipalities across Gujarat despite efforts on part of the authorities in last six months to ensure that fire safety norms are followed. There are 1,393 hospitals including 377 Covid-19 hospitals which were found without having fire NOC, and 2,883 schools that are lacking the certificates. These details were placed before the Gujarat high court on Monday by regional commissioners from six fire regions covering 156 municipalities. The details furnished by the authorities also revealed that besides 5,138 hospital and school buildings without fire NOC, there are as many as 9,187 structures in these towns which do not possess valid Building Use permission. Among them, there are 2,392 hospitals, 2,944 schools and 3,851 industrial units. The high court had sought details of compliance of the Fire Safety Act in response to a PIL filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal who has demanded proper implementation of the law after eight Covid-19 patients were killed in a fire incident in Shrey Hospital in August 2020. The authorities have informed the HC that all owners and office-bearers of buildings that are required to obtained fire NOC were given notice by issuing public advertisements after the HC orders and then issued notices individually when they did not comply with public notice. However, they also clarified that efforts of issuing notices are only with intention to seek implementation of the fire safety norms, “but without taking any coercive actions so as to avoid any harassment to the public at large, more particularly in view of the present prevailing unprecedented and precarious situation”. The state government has submitted that 100 fire officers have been trained and deployed to assist the buildings to meet minimum requirements of fire prevention and to conduct awareness programmes. There are 300 more fire officers who are being trained at present for this task. The government has also said that when it was learnt that hospitals, which were converted into designated Covid hospitals overnight, lacked fire NOCs, instructions were issued to all fire authorities to undertake inspection to take certain proactive measures to ensure fire safety. Training of on-duty staff and stand-by fire crew members has borne positive results, as there were nine incidents of fire in Covid hospitals in May, but they resulted in minor damage to properties with no loss of life. The HC is likely to take up hearing on this issue on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/over-5k-hospitals-schools-lack-fire-noc/articleshow/83128120.cms||---
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Video of cops dumping body in loader viral, probe ordered||KANPUR: A probe has been ordered into a video clip in which two police constables can be seen dumping a body in a garbage loader in Mahoba district in presence of their senior. The two cops can be seen holding, swinging and trying to dump the body onto the truck, but later changed their mind after being instructed by their senior. They later lifted the body and put it on the garbage truck. The incident took place outside the district hospital on Saturday after which its video went viral on social media. In the video, three policemen, including two constables, a sub-inspector and the driver of the loader, were purportedly seen trying to dump the body, packed in a black colour polythene bag, in a garbage vehicle. Later, their senior (sub-inspector) instructed them to not dump the body but lift it and then load it on the vehicle. Ram Karan Kushwaha, a native of Mohalla Swami Das in Kharela town, was staying with his elder son Deepak in Delhi. On Friday, when he fell ill, he returned to his native place. The same day when his condition deteriorated, his son rushed him to the district hospital but he died before he could get treatment. His body was later shifted to a mortuary. Deepak told reporters, "His father used to work as a labourer in Delhi. As he was unwell, me and my father returned to our village on Friday. The same day when his condition deteriorated, we rushed him to the district hospital, but before he could be treated, he succumbed to his illness." Police sources, however, blamed the man's kin for giving inhuman treatment to him. "The family initially refused to take possession of the body after the post-mortem was done at the district hospital. The cops on duty somehow persuaded his son who reached the hospital with a garbage vehicle of Kharela nagar panchayat and then carried out the last rites. His son arranged for the garbage loader to transport the body," the police sources further said. Additional SP Mahoba, Rajendra Kumar Gautam, meanwhile, said, "I have instructed the circle officer Charkhari Umesh Chandra to investigate the case and submit a report within 24 hours." The deceased, who was suffering from cold and cough, was denied entry into his house by his family members when he reached his village from Delhi on Friday, local sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/probe-ordered-after-video-showing-cops-dumping-body-in-garbage-loader-goes-viral/articleshow/83127578.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Registration for vaccine to start at post offices too||PRAYAGRAJ: At a time when vaccination is deemed to be vital for preventing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic along with the safety norms, preparations have been intensified by the government machinery to ensure that no one gets left out during the ongoing vaccination drive. However, one problem that is being faced by the common man, including those of the Sangam city, is in regards to getting registered for ensuring a slot for vaccination. The problem could be gauzed by the fact that all the vaccination centres are facing this problem as people are coming directly to vaccination centres and demanding that they be registered on the spot and vaccinated. To overcome this problem, the postal department has come forward to lend its helping hand to register those who want to get themselves vaccinated. The Community Service Centers (CSC) at the head post office of Prayagraj would start the registration process from June 1. The same facility would commence at the Kutchary post office in a couple of days. Besides, the post office located at Manjhanpur and Bharwari along with around 15 others would start extending this vital service to the users within the next fortnight. “We know that there are cases wherein people find it difficult to get themselves registered for vaccination and our CSC’s would help them with all the technical know-how and our staff here at GPO would register them for vaccination, starting from June 1," said Senior Superintendent of Post (SSP), Sanjay D Akhade. The official informed that the user will have to visit with his or her Aadhaar card between 10 am-4 pm and the postal staff member would get the user registered for vaccination. SSP further informed that in the coming two weeks, this facility would come up at other post offices of the city so that more and more people can get registered. He also said that special arrangements have been made at all the four post offices, two each at Prayagraj and Kaushambi, so that all the norms especially that of social distancing is followed while people turn up to get themselves registered. FOR BOX (IF NEED BE) The SSP, Sanjay D Akhade informed TOI that RBI has opened the window for procuring the ‘sovereign gold bond’ of the government. “The window is open from Monday (May 31) to June 4, during this period anyone can purchase ‘paper gold’ at the rate of Rs 4,699 per gram”. The ‘gold’ is in form of a bond or certificate on which the holder gets an annual interest of 2.5 per cent. After the locking period of five years is over, one can liquidity bond and he or she would get the then present rate of gold along with the 2.5 per cent interest. Any individual can purchase ‘gold’ from 1 gram to 4 kilogram, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/registration-for-vaccine-to-start-at-post-offices-too/articleshow/83127670.cms||---

He also performed the bhoomipujan of an underpass that will link the domestic and international terminals of the city airport to Western Express Highway. The first phase (20 km) of the Metro, between Dahanukarwadi and Aarey (18 stations) is slated to open in October while the entire corridor is expected to be thrown open in January next year. While Metro 2A is 17.5 km long, Metro 7 that runs between Dahisar and Western Express Highway metro station has a length of 18.6 km. The maiden trial run began from Akurli Metro station after Thackeray flagged it off by in the presence of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and ministers Eknath Shinde and Aaditya Thackeray. “The pace of work may have slowed down due to the lockdown but we have not stopped execution of infrastructure works,” Uddhav Thackeray said. Metropolitan commissioner R A Rajeev said, “These Metro lines will help reduce vehicular congestion by 25%.” Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar credited former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh for laying the foundation of infrastructure growth in Mumbai. An MMRDA spokesperson said that the trial of a prototype 6-car Metro train will be conducted on Line 2A (Yellow line) and Line 7 (Red line) at different speeds, after which the 6-car train will be handed over to the commissioner of railway safety for inspection. By October this year, 10 Metro trains will be made available and are slated to be thrown open for public commute on this stretch -- Dahanukarwadi to Aarey, via Dahisar on both lines. The Metro lines were sanctioned by the Fadnavis-led government in 2015 and the bhoomipujan had been performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Currently, one Metro line (Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar) is operational in the city. After the bhoomipujan, MMRDA will begin construction of an elevated road and vehicular underpass to connect the two terminals of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport to help improve access from Western Express Highway to the airport.

---||Mumbai||Shiv Sena wants borders of 30 electoral wards changed||MUMBAI: Even as the State Election Commission (SEC) on Monday told the BMC that the civic polls can be held as per schedule in 2022, Shiv Sena leaders are keen on a rectification of electoral ward boundaries. A senior Sena leader said that once they get clearance from the party leadership, they will make a formal request to the BMC for rectification in certain electoral wards whose boundaries were modified in 2017. According to senior Sena leaders, a section of sitting and former corporators have identified around 30 electoral wards where boundaries were modified before the 2017 BMC elections and which reportedly damaged the Sena’s winning prospects and favoured the BJP. According to senior civic officials, the BMC administration notifies electoral wards based on population estimates. The Congress has already demanded fresh delimitation of electoral wards ahead of the 2022 BMC elections, alleging that delimitation or redrawing of ward boundaries was done in 2017 to favour the BJP. “A full delimitation exercise was carried out in 2017, so right now, we are not seeking fresh delimitation of wards. We have identified around 30 seats where the Sena lost due to modification of boundaries. Boundaries were allotted in such a way that some Sena corporators won by huge margins, while in neighbouring seats, we lost by huge margins. Voters were split in an abrupt manner,” said a former Sena corporator who is working on the Sena’s rectification efforts. “Delimitation usually takes place once every 10 years, and it is an elaborate process. But rectification can take place as and when required and a short process of inviting suggestions/objections at the local level is needed for that. This can be done at the level of the BMC. We are discussing this issue with senior leaders in the party and will make a request to the BMC about it once we get approval from the top leadership,” a senior Sena functionary said. There are currently 227 corporator wards in the BMC. Officials said delimitation or redrawing of ward boundaries is done to balance voter population equally among the wards. Officials said that as per the 2011 census, population growth in the suburbs and a drop in the island city were taken into account while redrawing electoral wards in 2017. Each ward had a population of around 54,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-wants-borders-of-30-electoral-wards-changed/articleshow/83129759.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Goa||Goa gears up for rainfall, increase in intensity to set monsoon tone||Panaji: While a circulation in central Arabian Sea was obstructing the advance of the southwest monsoon over Kerala, local meteorologists are hoping that favourable wind conditions will persist in facilitating its transit to Goa. The monsoon — delayed by two days over the southern state — is likely to commence on June 3. It takes about four to five days for the seasonal system to reach Goa, but it depends on the intensity of the system in its onward movement. During the last 24 hours till Monday morning, there was fairly widespread though light to moderate rainfall across Goa. A circulation over the east Arabian Sea off the Karnataka coast is likely to produce more than moderate rainfall over Goa on June 1, which is likely to be good news for the state’s farmers. “Circulation in Karnataka is keeping the winds over Goa south-westerly and this is likely to enhance rainfall activity during next few days,” Rahul M, scientist, India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji said. The other system in the central Arabian Sea that was hindering the progress of the southwest monsoon disappeared on Monday morning. Light to moderate rainfall is due to south-westerly winds that are persisting. IMD, Panaji, has forecast the possibility of heavy rainfall only in isolated places on June 1 and thunder showers on the next three days till June 4. During last 24 hours till Monday morning, Pernem recorded the highest rainfall of 44.8mm, Mormugao 14mm, Sanguem 12.4mm, Quepem 11mm and other centres on a lesser scale. The figures of Valpoi, Old Goa and Margao were not available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-gears-up-for-rainfall-increase-in-intensity-to-set-monsoon-tone/articleshow/83128138.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Rogue antibodies to blame for recurrent fever?||NEW DELHI: While new Covid cases have reduced significantly in Delhi, hospitals said they were now getting several cases of post-Covid complications. The most concerning among them was recurrence of fever after being symptom-free for weeks, they said. “Some people even saw new onset breathing difficulty, abnormal behaviour and confused state,” they added. According to Dr Neeraj Nischal, associate professor, department of medicine, AIIMS, though there were multiple hypotheses to explain the phenomenon, it was too early to reach a conclusion. “Most patients who come with recurrent fever or new onset of breathing difficulty post-recovery have a history of moderate to severe Covid-19,” he said. Nearly 20-30% of patients coming for follow-up after recovering complain of recurrent fever with varying period of being well, in some cases three to four weeks, said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonology and critical care, Apollo Hospital. “The use of steroids is warranted when the symptoms persist, but both the doctors and the patients are reluctant to use them due to fear of black fungus,” he added. Dr Shamsher Dwivedee, chairman, neurosciences division, VIMHANS, who heads the hospital’s Covid taskforce, also said that he came across recovered patients with complaints of unexplained brain fog, abnormal behaviour, dizziness or confused state after being symptom-free for over a month. “Treatment involves administration of steroids as it suppresses auto-antibody formation,” he said. “Covid-19 impairs the immune system in people with moderate to severe symptoms. One of the hypotheses behind the recurrence of symptoms after a significant gap is, when the immune system reboots, auto-antibodies are created. They are not able to differentiate between a friend and a foe and start attacking the organs leading to inflammatory response,” explained Dr Dwivedee. Dr N K Mehra, eminent immunologist and former dean of AIIMS, said the auto-antibodies cripple the Type-I interferon that prevents virus replication by activating numerous genes. “The rogue antibodies, as we refer to them, could push the innate immune system into a hyperactive state and the adaptive immune system into a depressive state. In a healthy state, it is the opposite,” he explained. It is advised that people who had moderate to severe Covid should remain watchful for recurrence of symptoms or the onset of new ones and seek timely medical intervention. “In most cases, the symptoms subside on their own.

From setting up safe homes to arranging food for those who have been undergoing treatment at city’s government-run hospitals, these organizations are now busy reaching out to the patients in large numbers. On Monday, Ramakrishna Mission opened a safe home at Belur Polytechnic College for the needy residents of Bally and Belur. The 50-bed safe home will have doctors, nurses and other paramedics round the clock to take care of the patients who show mild symptoms but could turn critical. According to Swami Divyanandaji, secretary of Saradapith, necessary medical equipment and apparatus will be kept in the home to check their oxygen and for other treatment. Patients here will be given a non-veg protein diet as recommended by physicians. Bharat Sevasram Sangha, too, has kept a Covid care ward open for critical patients at its hospital located in Joka. But with the growing need for taking care of those Covid-positive patients who don’t have space for proper isolation at home, the Sevasram Sangha recently opened a safe home in Garia. Swami Biswatmanandaji, secretary of Bharat Sevasram Sangha, said regular efforts were on to look after the conditions of the patients. Here, too, patients were being given a protein non-veg diet. Keeping in mind the large number of patients who have been undergoing treatment at city’s government hospitals, Iskcon Kolkata has set up three community kitchens on Gurusaday Dutta Road and in Dum Dum and New Town, and engaged volunteers, who have been serving food at state-run health facilities. According to Radharaman Das, vice-president Iskcon Kolkata, the organization served food to 10 government hospitals and more number of places could be brought under their service. Khicdi, pulao and stuffed aloo were being distributed. Gaudiya Mission, Bagbazar, is also extending help to patients who need food for themselves and their families. The mission has set up a kitchen on the premises of its Bagbazar temple to cook high-protein vegetarian dishes. According to Bhakti Sundar, Sanyasi Goswami Maharaj, president of Gaudiya Mission, they were distributing 300 food packets to patients at NRS Medical College and Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/religious-institutions-bail-out-cov-patients-with-safe-homes-food/articleshow/83126405.cms||Saikat Ray

All standalone shops — essential and non-essential, barring a few categories — can now function between 7 am and 2 pm.“As Nashik’s weekly Covid positivity rate has dropped below 10% and we now have more than 40% oxygen beds vacant, the district is out of the red zone,” district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal said on Monday. After reviewing the Covid scenario with district collector Suraj Mandhare, NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav, ZP CEO Leena Bansod, commissioner of police Deepak Pandey, district superintendent of police Sachin Patil, the guardian minister appreciated the citizens’ and the administration’s efforts in lowering the number of active cases, the positivity rate and increasing the recovery rate. “From June 1 till June 15, the norms have been relaxed. All essential and non-essential shops (outside of malls) can remain open from 7 am to 2 pm. Barring restaurants and liquor shops, all shops can operate. All wedding halls, parks, theatres, education institutes will, however, remain closed,” Bhujbal said. He warned that a rise in the number of cases or irresponsible behaviour would again call for stricter curbs. “The standalone shops will have to shut by 2 pm. Only essential services — medical stores, government offices etc. — will remain open. The restriction on gathering of more than four people will continue,” said Mandhare. The collector said the weekend restrictions would come into force at 2 pm on Fridays and will continue till 7 am on Mondays. Liquor and food, including sweets, will have to be home-delivered, the order signed by the DMA chairperson (collector Suraj Mandhare) said. He said the organised vegetable and fruit marketplaces would remain closed, but vendors can ply their businesses in a scattered manner to avoid overcrowding. He has warned that the establishments that fail to obey the Covid norms would be penalized Rs 5,000 for the first offence and complete closure till the withdrawal of Covid notification. Individuals would be fined Rs 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/strict-curbs-eased-across-nashik-district-from-today/articleshow/83121311.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Student groups, relief teams provide food, med care to Cov, Yaas victims||Kolkata: As Bengal fights the second wave of Covid along with the damage caused by the storm surge during cyclone Yaas, people from different sections of society are lending support to help those in distress. Eksathe Banchbo, an initiative led by students and youths, has been checking the oxygen saturation levels of sum residents near Patuli. “The 40 families in the slum do not have any pulse oximeter. So our volunteers are checking their health parameters and keeping a track of their oxygen saturation levels daily. We are also distributing masks and sanitisers, and spreading awareness about Covid,” said Kamalesh Roy, who studies chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. The pulse oximeters have been provided to them by Kolkata Foundation. Eksathe Banchbo has also opened a community kitchen in Muriganga, Sagar Island, where meals are being provided to 500-odd people, who are among the worst hit by cyclone Yaas. Given the drinking water crisis in the Sunderbans owing to saline sea water rushing in, the group is distributing bleaching powder, lime powder and water purifying solutions. They have also been giving out baby food for the 1,500 kids there. Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team has been providing cooked food to residents of Shola, Rasulpur and Digha in Contai, East Midnapore. Medical camps are also being organised to combat epidemic and endemic diseases. Around 8,000 people have benefited in the past four days. The team members are providing milk powder, biscuits, molasses, beaten rice to 2,000 cyclone victims of Tushar Khali, Atapur and Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas. In South 24 Parganas’s Namkhana, they are serving cooked food to 1,000 cyclone-hit people. In Kolkata, AMURT has also been sanitising markets and police stations. . Kankurgachi Unique Club has started providing free meals to Covid patients as well as the needy since last week, catering to around 70 people in Kankurgachi, Phoolbagan, Maniktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Lake Town, Salt Lake and New Town. “It’s our responsibility towards society,” said club member Ramen Sadhukhan. Zeeshan Majeed is reaching free oxygen cylinders to Covid patients, who can’t afford it. “They can call on our helpline for free oxygen cylinder. Prescriptions and Aadhaar cards are mandatory for getting this facility,” said Majeed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/student-groups-relief-teams-provide-food-med-care-to-cov-yaas-victims/articleshow/83126535.cms||Dipawali Mitra

Cabral said that it is a 24-hour, 365-days system. One such machine has already been commissioned at the electricity department, Panaji, and the remaining 12 will be installed in the next three months, he said. The minister said that even after the department started accepting online payments, there was a demand from the people for physical payment facilities. Four such machines were installed at Panaji, Margao, Ponda and Mapusa four years ago, but they were non-functional, he said. To educate the consumer on the working of the machine, a video has been uploaded on the electricity website, the minister said. He said that if a consumer pays more money then it will be adjusted in the next bill. “I don’t think such a system will be in existence in India and it took around a year to put it in place. Once the payment is made, the machine will generate the slip of payment received,” he said. Cabral said that on Statehood Day they have laid foundation stones for two 33/11 GIS substations at Navelim in Margao and Altinho in Panaji. Cabral said that to ensure that consumers do not face problems, they have decided to have a GIS substation at Campal. He also said that three GIS substations were inaugurated at Sal, Karaswada and Campal. The minister also said that 260 houses will be brought under a solar power-based electrification programme for rural households in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-set-up-13-machines-to-allow-24x7-power-bill-payment/articleshow/83128170.cms||---

N Ashwani Kumar, appearing for Anandaiah, said the drug manufactured by the petitioner is an ayurvedic medicine and his client is a traditional practioner of Ayurveda. He further stated that there was no commercial motive behind the medicine and it’s distributed free. Government pleader Chintala Suman countered the arguments, saying that the medicines were not safe and he should not be allowed to make and distribute the same. The bench, however, said it did not agree with the submissions of the government pleader as they lacked substance and proof. At this juncture, Suman told the court that the government has approved the distribution of the herbal medicine except for the eye drops. Ashwani Kumar said eye drops were vital in the treatment as they boost oxygen saturation. After hearing the arguments, the court asked the petitioner’s counsel to wait till Thursday and directed the government to place the report on the efficacy of Anandaiah’s eye drops by June 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-asks-govt-to-submit-report-on-anandaiahs-drug-by-june-3/articleshow/83124633.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Varanasi||Expert: Calling mucormycosis a black fungus infection scientifically incorrect||VARANASI: Banaras Hindu University's (BHU) microbiologists, who have confirmed 123 cases of mucormycosis in the past 45 days, opine that terming it as black fungus infection should be discouraged as it is scientifically incorrect. “The fungal infections being noticed amidst Covid menace is mainly ‘Rhinocerebral mucormycosis’ while black fungus has already a scientific name — phaeohyphomycosis,” said associate professor in microbiology laboratory of the Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University (BHU) Deepak Kumar. Explaining further why calling mucormycosis as black fungus is incorrect, the microbiologist said, “Black fungus is scientifically called ‘phaeohyphomycosis’, an infection caused by dark-walled fungi in different categories. Clinically, they cause a different spectrum of illness.” “It may be noted that mucormycosis is an invasive, opportunistic fungal infection usually seen in immunocompromised patients, and particularly in the cases of uncontrolled diabetes, prolonged steroid intake or other immunosuppressive conditions,” he told TOI on Monday. Kumar added, “The clinical condition in mucormycosis, which is currently detected in Covid recovered patients, originates from the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, extends to the palate, pharynx and orbits, producing facial and orbital pain, visual loss and swelling, generalized pain and headache related to the involvement of the sinuses.” “This clinical entity of mucormycosis is not new to medical science has occurred in diabetic patients with ketoacidosis, patients who received a solid organ transplant, those with prolonged neutropenia, or patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/expert-calling-mucormycosis-a-black-fungus-infection-scientifically-incorrect/articleshow/83127624.cms||---

With this, cops found at least Rs 58 lakh fake currency notes from the accused which could be one of the biggest haul of the fake currency notes from an individual in recent years. Police officers said that a team of Mansa police searched a flat of the accused Santosh Raval in Sargasan in Gandhinagar from where the cops found fake currency notes worth Rs 23.80 lakh in denomination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 currency notes mainly. Inspector Jatin Prajapati of Mansa police station said that Raval told them in primary questioning that he had printed the fake currency notes at his flat in Sargasan after which police searched his residential premises and found fully printed notes and also may printed on one side with high quality printers and paper. Police had on Saturday caught Raval, a resident of Panchalpura-Khadat village in Mansa taluka of Gandhinagar, where he was moving on his scooter. On inquiring with him, cops found that Raval had cheated a large number of people between 2016 and 2017 in Ponzy schemes and as they wanted their money back, he started printing fake currency notes. Police officers said that Raval had taken loans from a bank and he was planning to deposit fake currency notes in the bank to repay his debt. A police officer said that Raval told cops that he started printing fake currency notes from last month only, but his claims need to be verified. A team of Gandhinagar police has been searching in Raval’s native village in Panchalpura-Khadat about the printing of fake currency notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ficn-of-rs-24l-value-seized-from-accuseds-house-total-now-rs-58l/articleshow/83128171.cms||---
---||Nashik||Rs 445cr of Rs 2,780cr crop loan disbursed in Nashik||Nashik: Banks have already disbursed Rs 445 crore worth of agriculture crop loan against the target of Rs 2,780 crore for 2021-22. The amount is almost double the disbursement of Rs 233 crore during the corresponding period last year. The district administration on Monday reviewed farm loan distribution and appreciated the good start. However, they cautioned the banks against auctioning farmers’ lands for recovery of loans during the ongoing pandemic. “The banks should provide loans to all farmers who come to them seeking help. The banks’ efficiency in loan disbursement will help ensure that the farmers do not fall in private moneylenders' debt traps,” district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, who reviewed the meeting, said. “Farmers should pay the interest and revise their crop loan with upper limits, thus ensuring that their credibility goes up. But in case a farmer is unable to do so, the bank should refrain from auctioning the land in the current troubled times,” he said. “The banks have disbursed Rs 445 crore. During the past financial year, crop loan disbursement was Rs 3,052 crore — the highest so far in the district,” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said. Lead Bank manager Ardhendu Shekhar said the banks were successful in loan distribution last year despite Covid restrictions. He said they have decided to exceed the targets this year too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rs-445cr-of-rs-2780cr-crop-loan-disbursed-in-nashik/articleshow/83121392.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Goa||Counselling first, marriage later: Goa bid to cut divorce||PANAJI: In a bid to combat rising cases of divorce, the Goa government is set to introduce mandatory counselling for couples before marriage registration. This counselling, which will be conducted by the state, would “explain the concept of marriage” to couples before they are allowed to enter into wedlock, law minister Nilesh Cabral said. Cabral said the counselling would be done immediately after the first signature and would be conducted through the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development (GIPARD). “If any religious institutes want to join in the pre-marriage counselling, then they are also welcome,” he said. “The certificate of completion of counselling (from GIPARD) would be compulsory for the second signature. It has come to our notice that the number of marriages is equal to the number of divorces in the state, and that is the reason we have taken this step to explain the concept of marriage to couples,” he said. Under Goan law—the uniform civil code—the first signature is the couple’s declaration of intent to marry before the civil registrar. The second signature before the same authority, after 15 days of the first signature and within three months, is the formal marriage registration. Cabral also said that couples are filing for divorce within six months to two years of marriage but didn’t produce any data to back the statement. He also said through counselling, the state government will explain the responsibilities of marriage to the couple. Asked whether most divorces take place because of clashes with in-laws, state registrar-cum-head of notary services Ashutosh Apte said the government will try to help the bride and groom improve themselves and promote understanding between their in-laws, and understand the nature of the family “to develop them to live in society”. Cabral said Goans, who have settled outside the state or country, used to face difficulties to register their marriage in Goa. Now, to streamline the marriage registration process for Goans who live outside the state, the state government has decided to give power to the district registrar, who will issue permission to register their marriage in Goa, thus nixing the need to go to court. Cabral also said the state government has decided to start a citizen-friendly facilitation centre and helpline in all talukas to help people who are not well-versed with online technologies. The minister added that it has been decided to go cashless at registration offices. “We will not take cash at sub-registrars’ offices. We have kept a POS machine for payment, and online payments will also be accepted,” he said. He also said that the government has decided not to accept physical applications for duplicate copies of documents such as sale deeds. “The entire system will be put online,” he said. Cabral also said that they have also decided to go paperless within the department, to help the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-pre-marriage-counselling-cert-must-before-goa-wedding/articleshow/83128182.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Kolkata||2 crore lost as cops detect hacking at more Kolkata ATMs||KOLKATA: The gang that extracted nearly Rs 40 lakh from three ATMs of a private bank by intercepting the two-way encrypted messaging and data transfer between an ATM and its bank servers and manipulating it to prompt ATMs to spew cash, had also extracted around Rs 1.6 crore more from seven-eight unguarded ATMs that had the same software and were vulnerable to the Man in the Middle (MiTM) hacking. “The losses due to MiTM so far stand at Rs 2 crore. The amount may go up if hacking is detected at more ATMs,” a detective department officer said. Probing the Rs 40 lakh loss recorded from three ATMs at Cossipore, Jadavpur and New Market, investigators have now found out that other ATMs of the same bank located in Bowbazar, Behala, Phoolbagan and Beniapukur were also hacked. While the ATMs at New Market and Cossipore were targeted on May 14, the fraudsters targeted the Jadavpur and Bowbazar ATMs three days later. The Phoolbagan and Behala ATMs were targeted on May 19. The company that handles cash and the ATM machine maintenance for the bank believes that at least two other ATMs in Beniapukur area were hacked on May 22. Cops say the accused — CCTV footage shows two persons cracking the ATMs between May 14 and May 22 — hail from outside Bengal and that the gang had stayed in Kolkata for 15-20 days during which they carried out the operation. It took the hackers 15-20 minutes to break into system and then they hung around for up to an hour, withdrawing Rs 5-20 lakhs from the ATMs by swiping the ATM cards upto 90 times. The accused withdrew between Rs 5-20 lakh at a given point of time. The bank fraud section investigating the case says there are too many uncanny links of the modus operandi used here and that used by fraudsters at Faridabad in the NCR region a couple of months ago. “The police there managed to arrest some. There are several others who are still on the run in that case. The handiwork of these fugitives cannot be ruled out,” said an officer. Joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma said the cops have some leads and are confident of cracking the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2cr-lost-as-cops-detect-hacking-at-more-atms/articleshow/83126568.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Seven varsities to get Centre of Excellence tag||AHMEDABAD: The state government has given the in-principle approval to seven institutes — six private universities and one autonomous university — to be tagged ‘Centre of Excellence’ (CoE). With this new status, these seven universities will be able to not only conduct admissions on their own by setting up their admission committees but will also be able to determine their fee structures independently. They will be exempted from the centralized admission process and the purview of the Fee Regulatory Committee (technical). The in-principle decision to grant the CoE status to these universities was taken in a high-level meeting on Monday at chief minister Vijay Rupani’s residence in Gandhinagar, said sources aware of the development. “The vice-chancellors of the seven universities were present in the meeting chaired by the chief minister,” a source said. The seven institutes are Nirma University, Ahmedabad; Ahmedabad University; Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT), Anand; Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU), Gandhinagar; Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar; Marwadi University, Rajkot; and Cept University, Ahmedabad. The meeting was attended by, among others, education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama; minister of state for education Vibhavariben Dave; and principal secretary for higher education Anju Sharma. “The chief minister said that an action plan will be prepared to ensure the creation of world-class infrastructure, high-tech and student-friendly classrooms, and laboratories at these institutes,” a government statement said. “This will result in improved standards of teaching, research, innovation and startups, and international-level exchanges.” The source said that the heads of the seven universities will meet within a week with Chudasama to prepare the action plan after studying India’s and the world’s Top 10 universities. They will submit the report in two weeks, the media release said. The proposals by the seven universities was being considered by a high-level committee constituted for CoE for the past one-and-a-half years, said sources. On Monday, the state government decided to give its nod ahead of the college admission process that will soon begin for the academic year 2021-22. “Institutes such as Nirma, PDEU, and DA-IICT have been conducting 50% of the admissions on their own,” said an office-bearer of one of the seven universities. “They and the other shortlisted universities can now take charge of the entire admission process.” The government’s decision has led to apprehension among some experts that the seven universities may hike the fees in the near future. Also, there is concern about the quality of admissions. The admissions for technical courses are carried out by the Admission Committee for Professional Courses. Now, the seven universities will be able to do that on their own. The CoE website says that the tag implies a college, institution, or private university with quality education, path-breaking research, innovative teaching, and quality extension services. The website says that such institutes give high employability to their students and foster the entrepreneurial spirit. A CoE can also be an institute of strategic or security-related importance as notified by the state government. Or, the website adds, it can be an Institution of Eminence deemed university by the University Grants Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/7-varsities-to-get-centre-of-excellence-tag/articleshow/83128186.cms||---

The construction of the wall was opposed by locals who termed it a violation of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. Cabral said that the final information gathered by the environment department will also show whether this is a new construction or a wall already existed there. As of now the department has received a preliminary report on the wall, he said. The final report will be ready after the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) carries out its inspection, Cabral said. The minister added that if it is a case of CRZ violation he will ensure that it is “taken care of”. “If it is proved to be wrong, action will be taken and there is no doubt about it,” Cabral said. He, however, sought time to have the matter scrutinised thoroughly before making any outright statements on the construction of the Vainguinim beach wall. GCZMA had issued a showcause notice recently to the party, stating that the entire zone is designated as a no-development zone, being within 100m and hence no construction is permissible. “The allegedly illegal construction is highly detrimental to the coastal and riverine ecosystem,” the notice had stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/decision-on-wall-after-final-report/articleshow/83128176.cms||---

The number of such Covid-free villages is steadily increasing. In these villages, we have asked the health workers to increase health awareness among the people to lead a hygienic life,” he said. “The CM has underlined the road map for the Covid-free state that starts with a village. There are 889 Covid free villages and our primary plans will be to ensure they never get infected again,” said Khsirsagar. Underlining how the plans would be executed, the ZP president said conducting test will be intensified in the villages where Covid patients were still found and in the Covid-free villages, efforts will be taken to monitor health by way of regular health surveys. The president has also asked the health authorities to increase the vaccination so that the people are protected against the infection in the forthcoming period and be vigilant about Covid symptoms among children for early intervention.In the case of other villages, where Covid patients are found, testing tracking and treating patients will be stressed on. He said he would ask the gram panchayats (GP) to undertake a cleanliness drive and a plan for the isolation of the patients. “The best part is that the GP can set up their own isolation centre if there was an appropriate number of patients, through government funds. But in other cases , we have asked the local elected representatives, organisations to contribute in facilities that can provide relief to the people,” he said. He also said he will conduct the meeting of the administration and draw up plans to ensure Nashik rural gets covid-free status at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/zp-takes-measures-to-make-villages-covid-free/articleshow/83121378.cms||Abhilash Botekar

By April-end, the recovery rate had stood at 87%. A month later, it stood at 96% — more than 9.7 lakh of the 10.13 lakh people who tested positive for the virus so far have recovered. As per data released by the district health office, since May 13, the number of recoveries per day has been consistently higher than the number of new cases. In fact, as per the data, only six days in May — all of them prior to May 13 — had higher daily cases than recoveries. Health officials said recoveries in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits surged to 97% and 96%, respectively, while the rural areas too reported a steady increase in discharges, pushing the recovery rate to 93%. “There has been a rise in discharges and a steady drop in new cases over the past month. On some days in May, the city recorded almost twice as many daily recoveries as fresh cases.,” Sanjeev Wavre, deputy head of PMC’s health department, said. PMC’s recovery rate of 97% was also slightly higher than it was on January 30, before the start of the second wave. Wavre said the administration will continue to enforce containment measures. “We are also revising the micro-containment zones as per requirement,” he added. Pimpri Chinchwad has witnessed similar trend — a rise in recoveries and a drop in new cases — with daily cases dropping to under 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrs-recovery-rate-climbs-to-96-up-9-in-one-month/articleshow/83128204.cms||Sarang Dastane

The last time Goa witnessed high pre-monsoon rain was in 2006, while the highest recorded pre-monsoon rainfall was in 1961. The quantum of rainfall in the past could have been higher as the India meteorological department (IMD) has increased the number of rain gauge stations in recent years. “The total rainfall during the pre-monsoon season (March, April and May) this year is 394.3mm, which is the highest since 2006. In 2006, the total rainfall was 591.9mm,” Rahul M, scientist at IMD, Panaji, said. In a rare phenomenon, the southwest monsoon had arrived on May 26, 2006 in Kerala and had swept over Goa within just two days. “That year, there was significant rainfall from May 28 and extremely heavy rainfall reports over Goa for four days between May 28 and 31,” the scientist said. The year of Goa’s Liberation was a watershed year too, as the rainfall recorded during the pre-monsoon months added up to 662.2mm. The following year, 1962, recorded 386.3mm of rain, while 359.3mm was recorded in 1990. In 1961, Goa had received a total of 4,313.6mm of rain during the course of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-years-pre-monsoon-was-goas-3rd-highest-in-71-years/articleshow/83128231.cms||Paul Fernandes

He administered the drugs under the pretext that it would cure her illness. The accused, Chandrakant Gaikar, confessed to the Panvel city police that he killed the victim, a domestic help he was in a relationship with for the past six months, because she was forcing him to marry her. Gaikar said he didn’t want to marry the victim because she had a serious ailment. The victim’s body was spotted by some local villagers lying on the roadside near Koli-Kopar village near the proposed international airport on May 29, said senior inspector Ajay Landge. “We received a call from the village sarpanch about an unidentified body of a woman being found. Prima facie, we registered an accidental death case. However, while inquiring, a driver Ramesh Thombare (36), residing in Nanoshi village of Panvel taluka, identified the deceased woman as his sister and hinted at murder,” said Landge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-ward-boy-kills-lover-with-drug-overdose/articleshow/83128331.cms||George Mendonca

---||Nashik||100 students going abroad to get vaccinated today||Nashik: The Nashik district administration has planned to vaccinate around 100 students, who will be travelling abroad for studies, on June 1 at Kalidas Kala Mandir in the city. Vaccination is mandatory for those students who are going abroad for studies. Hence, as a special cause, the district administration has decided to get these 100 students vaccinated at NMC’s auditorium, Kalidas Kala Mandir. The district administration will supply 100 doses of Covishield to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and then the vaccine will be administered to the students. But the students concerned will have to bring related documents. “We have already started preparations for administering vaccines to those students, who are going abroad to study. The vaccination programme for the students will begin at noon on Tuesday,” said Ajita Salunke, the assistant superintendent officer of NMC. At present, vaccination for the age group of 18-44 years has been stopped by the state government at all government centres due to the lack of vaccines. In Nashik city, two private hospitals — Apollo and Sahyadri — have started vaccinating beneficiaries from all age groups including the 18-44 years age group. The vaccination did not take place in the district on Sunday due to the holiday but started on Monday. Of the total 200 vaccination centres across the district, 114 centres were functional on Monday. Around 10,818 beneficiaries above the age of 45 years were given first and second shots of vaccines. In Nashik city, 26 of the 29 vaccination centres were operational on Monday. As many as 3,761 beneficiaries were given the vaccine on Monday. NMC officials said they will continue to give vaccines until there is a stock of vaccine. 2 oxygen plants at Bytco hospital Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav on Monday inaugurated two pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants at Bytco hospital. These two PSA oxygen plants have been set up by the Nashik Information Technology Association and three other social organisations under Corporate Social Responsibilities at the cost of Rs 40 lakh. The capacity of these two PSA plants is around 68 jumbo cylinders of oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/100-students-going-abroad-to-get-vaccinated-today/articleshow/83121870.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Goa||Canacona civic body sees unrest over devpt works||Poinguinim: Resentment is brewing among councillors of Canacona Municipal Council’s ruling panel. Claiming that developmental works are nil, seven ruling councillors, including chairperson Mario Simon Rebello, said they are unhappy that the municipal administration and BJP government are neither doing anything to bring about developments, nor are they supporting the ruling panel. Addressing reports, the councillors alleged that both the chief officer and municipal engineer are not cooperating with the council for any developmental works. “Hence, we find it difficult to run the council in such a situation,” they said. They said that though some members of the panel are Congressmen who joined the BJP-supported panel, they are not receiving support from the administration. The members warned that they would pull out of the panel if things did not improve within the next two months. Everyone is aware that elections are a few months away, and so, considering BJP’s attitude, we may be forced to rethink our stand, Rebello said. Chaudi councilor Ramakant Naik Gaonkar, who is a three-time councillor, alleged that some are unhappy that there is a BJP council in Canacona. “I feel the same forces are trying to break our panel and form an anti-BJP council,” he said. Gaonkar said that there are three BJP leaders in Canacona, all of whom work in different directions. He alleged that even Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes does not work to bring about any development in the CMC. “Our chairperson, despite approaching him (Fernandes) several times, doesn't appear to bring in any sanctions for the proposed works. We seven councillors have pledged to be together till the end of this tenure, and if this present situation continues, we will be forced to take a stand against BJP in the next two months or so,” Gaonkar said. Devbhag councillor Sara Naik Desai said she was contemplating approaching the court. When TOI contacted Fernandes, he said that his government cooperates with all sections of society, irrespective of caste and class. Reacting on the development in the CMC, he said that if there was any specific developmental work that was not done, there was always room for including it. “Rather than creating fissures, I think the councilors need to cooperate with the government. Within two months how much developmental work can someone expect, and can projects be taken up simultaneously in all twelve wards?” he said. When contacted, chief officer Uday Prabhudesai told TOI that he had no comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/canacona-civic-body-sees-unrest-over-devpt-works/articleshow/83128180.cms||---

On Sunday, when the lake’s waters were being released, a large number of villagers gathered as usual to catch the sweet water fish. However, this year, they were left disappointed at the meagre catch. Bicholim taluka’s Kolam lake is very well known. A section of farmers from this area depend on its water for their rabi crop and plantations. Post monsoon, water is stored in the lake by constructing a bandhara. The farmers then use the water over the year. Prior to the onset of monsoon, the bandhara is removed and the lake is cleaned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/karapur-locals-carry-out-annual-cleaning-of-lake/articleshow/83128189.cms||---
---||Delhi||How home delivery brought happy hours for Maha||By: Anoothi Vishal New Delhi: From high end wines to new craft gins, well-made Belgian-style ales and more, a subset of millennial drinkers in the Capital, active on the social media and conversant with global trends, have been gravitating to more discerning drinks at their home bars through the pandemic months. Therefore, the policy to permit home delivery of alcohol will tap into a discerning market that is only growing. Last year, the demand for pricey wine for home consumption was at an all-time high, according to Madhulika Dhall of La Cave chain of wine stores. “All my top labels like Gaja and Cakebread wines were sold out in the initial months of the lockdown,” she said, pointing to the emergence of informal wine clubs in Delhi and Gurgaon, where intimate groups of 4-6 meet for gourmet, home-delivered meals over a bottle of heavyweight wine. The big change in this social behaviour was more men taking to wine in what was earlier regarded the bastion of ‘Scotch’ and chicken tikka. The increased exposure to social media by a generation forced to stay in is responsible for a thirst to know what one is consuming. Top mixologist Nitin Tiwari of Together at 12th in Gurgaon claimed that his Instagram following rose from around 12,000 to 1,52,000 in about a month of the current lockdown after he started doing short videos on topics like, what is a single malt or what is the origin of the margarita or why do we swirl wine. “Earlier my posts were directed at the bartending community before I realised that when regular people drink at home, they are more curious about the details,” said Tiwari. Pankaj Balachandran, industry veteran, said, “Lockdowns allowed people to experiment with beverages; creating their own infusions, syrups, kombucha, etc, was just the beginning. With access to alcohol delivered at your doorstep, this trend is going to explode.” Last year, as a pandemic measure, Maharashtra allowed home delivery of alcohol through retail stores. According to many in the business, sales grew on the back of this consumption. “The consumption of quality and high priced wine was higher in 2020-21 than the previous year when sales were mostly through restaurants,” said importer Vishal Kadakia of Wine Park, bearing out observations that when people consume alcohol at home, they tend to buy higher quality and costlier stuff. Ravi Gurnani, director of York winery (which merged with Sula this year), had once revealed that small wine and craft spirits makers benefited from home delivery because “customer stickiness” is greater. Tapped Flight, a subscription-based curatorial enterprise launched in Pune by Bhakti Mehta, Nevil Timbadia and Saumya Khona, is one such beneficiary. Launched in September last year, the number of its subscribers has grown and the trio facilitates the delivery of 650-1,000 litres of craft beer in 14 different styles from 4-5 breweries to their subscribers every month. “We have seen new people come to the platform … the curiosity was always there but with delivery, there came accessibility,” said Mehta. In Delhi, while the delivery format is not clear yet, Shifa Rastogi, marketing head, Bee Young craft beer, said it would nevertheless be a “shot in the arm” for the craft liquor category because it makes the product available online for a much larger clientele. Through the pandemic, the craft category has been exploding with at least 12 gins (mostly distilled in Goa), a few rums, whiskies and beers entering the higher end market in the last year and a half. For most of these, distribution is a challenge, requiring deep pockets and the muscle to take on the MNCs. Online retail and delivery may help this niche category. But even liquor majors are serious about the at-home segment. “The change in guidelines comes at a great time,” exulted Anmol Gill, head of customer marketing, Bacardi India. “We already began last year on elevating home experiences for consumers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-home-delivery-brought-happy-hours-for-maha/articleshow/83156821.cms||---
---||India||Twitter must comply with India’s new IT rules: HC||NEW DELHI: Social media platforms, including Twitter, have “no choice” but to comply with India’s new Information Technology Rules for digital media, the Delhi high court said Monday. “Unless the rules have been stayed, they have to follow them,” Justice Rekha Palli said, while issuing a notice to the Centre and Twitter seeking their stand on a lawyer’s plea that claimed the US company failed to comply with the rules that came into force from February25. Twitter assured the court it had complied with the rules and already appointed a resident grievance officer, adding it would file its response to the plea. But the Centre disputed the claim. The petitioner said the grievance officer had not been appointed according to the rules. The HC said it would examine the issue once the replies were in by the next date of hearing in July. The petitioner, Amit Acharya, through advocate Akash Vajpai sought a direction to the Centre and Twitter to ensure compliance with the IT Rules whose clause 4(C) says that every Significant Social Media Intermediary has to appoint a Resident Grievance Officer, who shall be responsible for its functions. Every SSMI (significant social media intermediary) is also required to develop a mechanism for receipt of complaint in relation to violation of any provision under the aforesaid rule and will provide a ticket number through which every complainant would be able to track the status of their complaint, as per the rules. These also specify it is the responsibility of the company’s officer to provide reason for any action taken or not taken while disposing complaints, the petitioner said, pointing out the IT rules came into force on February 25. The Centre had then given three months to every SSMI to comply with these Rules. "At this juncture, it is also important to mention Twitter has not only failed to appoint the Resident Grievance Officer but has also not appointed Nodal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer," according to the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-must-comply-with-indias-new-it-rules-hc/articleshow/83130953.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu to activate village-level committees to prevent child marriages||CHENNAI: The state social welfare and women’s empowerment department is all set to crack down against child marriages. With a report of Child Rights and You (CRY) indicating high instances of child marriages in certain pockets of the state, minister P Geetha Jeevan has instructed officials to take stringent legal action including booking the family members and relatives of the victims of child marriages. “We have asked district social welfare officers (DSWO) to take stringent legal action in all cases of child marriages. We have asked the stakeholders and police department to act swiftly to put an end to such practices,” Geetha Jeevan told TOI after holding a review meeting with senior officials in her department and police on Monday. Child Rights and You (CRY), a non-governmental organisation, published a report recently saying that child marriages had increased by 40% in 10 blocks and 72 tribal villages in Salem, Dharmapuri, Ramanathapuram and Dindigul districts. In 2020 May, 98 child marriage cases were reported in these districts, as against 60 cases reported during the corresponding period in 2019. In 2020 alone, 318 child marriages were reported in CRY-operating areas in the four districts, said an official, citing the report. “We have asked district-level officers to activate village-level child marriage prohibition committees to act against the illegal practice. Collectors will review child marriage cases periodically,” added the minister. She also directed the DSWOs to submit status report of pending cases. Owing to poor awareness among tribal people, they do not consider child marriages as illegal. “The poor socio-economic condition of families is another reason for such practices continuing even today,” said a senior official in the social welfare department. Sensitisation and bringing about an attitudinal change among tribal people are prerequisite to put an end to such practices, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-to-activate-village-level-committees-to-prevent-child-marriages/articleshow/83128218.cms||---

Health officials said a 62-year-old woman from Veerampattinam on the outskirts of the town was the latest victim of black fungus infection. The woman died on Monday, not responding to treatment, at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer). A week ago, a middle-aged man from Puducherry died of black fungus infection at a private hospital. Earlier, three patients from Tamil Nadu died of the infection in Puducherry. At present, 35 patients, mostly from Tamil Nadu, are undergoing treatment for the infection at Jipmer and India Gandhi government medical college and research institute (IGMC) in Puducherry. Health officials urged patients, particularly those with diabetes recovering from Covid-19 infection, to keep a tab on the blood sugar level as they are prone to black fungus infection. They said Covid-19 patients under home isolation and treatment under oxygen support must use distilled water for humidification. Similarly, patients, who were on steroids while undergoing Covid-19 treatment are also prone to black fungus infection. They said black fungus is not a communicable disease. They said symptoms of the infection include headache, numbness in the face, radiating pain in cheeks, nasal block/ nasal discharge tinged with blood/black pigments, redness, pain and swelling of the eye, drooping of eyelids/ double vision, toothache, fatigue and fever and loss of consciousness. They urged patients with these symptoms to approach hospitals for treatment immediately. Lieutenant governor (additional charge) Tamilisai Soundararajan on Monday told reporters that the administration has declared black fungus as a notified disease under the Epidemic Act. She claimed that the government has been taking all necessary measures to create awareness among the public on the infection. Tamilisai said the incidence of Covid-19 infection has started to come down in Puducherry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/black-fungus-toll-rises-to-5-in-pondy-3-victims-from-tn/articleshow/83128270.cms||---

---||Kolkata||CBSE schools keep XII students in exam mode||KOLKATA: Though the summer break is on, children who are due to appear for their CBSE XII this year, have not been allowed to let their guard down. At a time where there is uncertainty over whether the exams will be held or not, schools are tense that students would start taking it easy and lose touch with their preparations. So special routines have been set and teachers are not only connecting with the students through these classes but are also catching up with everyone beyond class hours. Most of the classes that are being scheduled now are problem-solving sessions where children are being made to solve test papers in given time frames. Teachers say that while children are often ready with the answers and they know their work, they are faltering while putting it down in pen and paper mode. Hence, they are being made to submit written assignments. Birla High School has even scheduled an exam for the class XII children in online mode, which is almost a repeat of the mock exams that they have already written. The exams started on May 24 and have been following a strict exam room pattern with in-camera invigilation. “We were scared that children would get lax if we lose touch with them over a summer break. So we decided to keep them in the study mode through the exams which are on now. Teachers are being able to pay full attention to the children because they do not have to teach other classes during the break,” said Loveleen Saigal, principal of Birla High School. The school has otherwise given a summer break from May 17 to June 14 for the other classes. There is no summer break for the CBSE XII students of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, though for the other classes a vacation has been announced from May 13 to June 9. “We have noticed that a large number of children have already lost interest in the exam process due to the pandemic situation and also because there is so much talk about cancellation of the exams. We just cannot let these young minds wander away till the time the court, the Centre, and the Board take a final call on this,” said Meena Kak, director of the school. Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School said that for all the teachers the break is non-existent as far as the outgoing class XII children are concerned. “Children are posting their doubts and teachers are clearing them even beyond scheduled hours. We have to create this exam feel for the children to be on their toes. We might also hold another round of exams after a final call is taken about whether the boards will finally happen,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-schools-keep-xii-students-in-exam-mode/articleshow/83135112.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

In between his online classes, Arvind Kumar realised that his grandmother needed someone to carry essentials to her because she was home bound in the midst of the pandemic. He soon realised that there were hundreds of seniors who needed help. So started Cycle Soldiers, a band of young students and professionals who are spending time in between online classes and work for home, to cycle essentials to people. Arvind had posted a request on social media for volunteers and within days an army was formed. Be it medicines, grocery, vegetables or anything else, you just have to call any of the eight volunteers and tell them where to buy from and how much is needed. The rest is taken care of at no extra charge. Permissions have been secured from all police stations in the south Kolkata. “The officers-in-charge have happily helped. We started with the Rabindra Sarobar where OC Jayanta Mukherjee was the first to give us permission,” Arvind said. Others in the team are Yashvardhan Gupta, an undergraduate from University of London, Noumaan Anwer, an undergraduate from St Stephen’s College, Vishalakshi and Rajdeep Mantha, masters in art design and technology and LLB student respectively, T K Radhakrishnan from ITC Infotech and author-poet S S Kumar. Seniors like Charu and Vilas Pradhan of Jodhpur Park are dependent on the Cycle Soldiers, while Nirlay Kundu from Boston often asks the team to deliver things to his elderly father in Dhakuria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cycle-soldiers-ride-to-seniors-rescue/articleshow/83126627.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

There were about 19.34 lakh students who had enrolled for Std IX with the Maharashtra State Board Of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education in 2019-20. Of these, nearly 18.31 lakh students passed and were promoted to Std X while 24,107 students failed. However, for the secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) board exam, at least 2.5 lakh fewer students had enrolled, data released by the state education department for 2019-20 shows. When the dates for registration for the SSC board exam were announced, about 16 lakh students filled the online forms. Educators said the drop in numbers was the effect of migration due to the lockdown in 2020. After Covid cases spiralled in the state, schools across the state began conducting lessons online. Lockdown robbed many people of their jobs and they gone back to their home states leading to a fall in enrolment. Commissioner of education Vishal Solanki said a survey to identify children who have dropped out of schools was conducted during the year for those in the age group of 6 to 14 years of age studying in Stds I to VIII. “As many as 25,000 students were reported to have dropped out,” Solanki said. Secretary of the Principals’ Association in Pune, H M Gaikwad, said, “A majority of these students who have not registered are from poor families where parents have gone back to their home towns or villages due to lack of opportunities in cities, and hence the education of their children was discontinued. Not many of these parents are keen to enrol the students back in school where they come back and prefer to engage their children in some work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-2-5l-state-board-students-quit-schooling-after-std-ix-last-year/articleshow/83128259.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Ramadoss, in a statement issued on Monday, pointed out that the previous AIADMK government provided Rs 2,000 relief in two installments of Rs 1,000 each to the workers under unorganized sector and differently-abled people. He insisted that the DMK government should provide Rs 1,000 per week as lockdown relief to the workers of these people. Meanwhile, PMK youth wing president Anbumani Ramadoss appealed to the state government to lend a helping hand to people who are desperate to quit smoking. In a statement issued on Monday, he said the government must establish a ‘Comprehensive cessation service’ to help smokers to kick the habit. Anbumani urged the Union and state governments to launch efforts like banning indirect advertisements to promote tobacco products, banning smoking in public places, hike tax on all tobacco products and regulate the sale of tobacco products including cigarettes among others to reduce the use of tobacco products by people. He said tobacco kills more than 80 lakh people globally and 12 lakh people in India every year and presently 130 crore people are addicted to tobacco worldwide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pmk-wants-covid-dole-for-differently-abled-people/articleshow/83128283.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Cops register case against MLA, 50 others for pre-wedding event crowd||PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad police on Monday registered a case against BJP’s Bhosari MLA, Mahensh Landge, his brother and 50 others on the charge of violating Covid norms during the pre-wedding ceremony of the legislator’s daughter at Bhosari village on Sunday evening. Video clips of people gathering at the event had gone viral on various social networking sites, following which the Pimpri Chinchwad police swung into action on Monday afternoon. The Bhosari police registered a case under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The police also invoked relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act and Maharashtra Covid Rules against Landge and others. When contacted, Landge said, “All the 50 people who attended the pre-wedding ceremony, known as Mandav Tahala, are my family members. No one outside the family was present at the function. All the family members have received Covid vaccine. We had done their RT-PCR tests a couple of days ago and the reports were negative.” The MLA said, “Sunday’s event was a small family ceremony. Very few people attended the wedding on Monday afternoon in Alandi. The police registered the case after the video clips went viral. I will pay the fine to the police or appropriate authorities for the violation.” The police said the video clips showed a large number of men dancing to the tunes of music in front of Landge’s house located at Bhorsai Gaonthan. Senior inspector of the Bhosari police Shankar Awatade said, “Though it was a private ceremony, the Covid rules do not allow gathering of five or more people at a venue. The persons who attended the function are seen dancing close to each other.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-register-case-against-mla-50-others-for-pre-wedding-event-crowd/articleshow/83128274.cms||---
---||Goa||May was Goa’s deadliest Covid month, with average of 48 deaths a day||PANAJI: With 1,481 deaths, May has not only been the state’s deadliest month since Covid-19 struck, it also recorded more fatalities than the rest of the months put together. The month began with more than 100 deaths every two days, and with the Goa association of resident doctors flagging the issue of oxygen shortage at Goa Medical College (GMC). The grim daily death count reached an all-time high of 75 on May 11, and began to decline slowly only after the high court ensured that systems were put in place for uninterrupted oxygen supply to GMC, and that critical patients were not left waiting while their oxygen arrived on agricultural tractors. Until this time, the government denied any shortage, and it even took seven more days for it to announce a statewide curfew even after neighbouring states had already announced lockdowns. Only on the high court’s direction did the state reluctantly and belatedly close its borders for those without a Covid-negative certificate, but continued to seek relaxations, which were turned down by the high court. All this while, Goa was battling a “very very contagious” mutant strain, and the case positivity rate was more than 50%. The government was questioned by the high court about why it couldn’t solve the oxygen issue despite a cabinet, IAS officers, technicians and others. “After the high court’s intervention, things have gotten better. Everything has been streamlined. The government was made accountable and they also realised the need for a lockdown,” a GMC doctor said. Bicholim-based activist Ramesh Gauns said that it’s a tragedy that hundreds of youngsters lost their lives thanks to the government’s mismanagement due to the chief minister and health minister not seeing eye to eye. The state wouldn’t have been hit so badly if the government had got its act together on time, he says. “The government should have sought help from expert researchers and prepared for this wave, but instead, the chief minister and health minister were playing political games, and the people of Goa suffered.” He also highlighted the poor implementation of restrictions during the current state-wide curfew. When the state had no solutions, it should have sought help, citizens say. Activist and parish priest of Chicalim, Fr Bolmax Pereira, also attributes Goa being hit badly to the state’s administrative failure. “It’s sad that many local bodies had to declare their own preventive measures of imposing lockdowns without the express directions of the government that seemed to have its priorities misplaced,” he said. “The present government dispensation utterly failed in its responsibility. For reasons best known (to them), health decisions came from a one-man army, and we saw the differences between the CM and health minister go public, which was ridiculous.” The South Goa advocates’ association’s plea for an inquiry to be conducted into the deaths due to the oxygen shortage at GMC, and for compensation to be paid to their families, is being vociferously opposed by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/may-was-states-deadliest-covid-month-with-avg-of-48-deaths-a-day/articleshow/83128279.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Delhi||SC stays GST exemption on imported O2 concentrators||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed a 10-day-old Delhi High Court order quashing GST imposed on oxygen concentrators, imported for personal use or received as gift from abroad, while terming the levy as violative of right to life of patients. Referring to the explosion of Covid-19 cases in Delhi and shortage of oxygen and oxygen concentrators, an high court bench of Rajeev Shakkdher and Talwant Singh had ruled that “imposition of IGST on oxygen concentrators, which are imported by individuals and are received by them as gifts for personal use, is unconstitutional”. The high court had also termed the levy on individual importers as violative of right to equality as the state and its agencies were exempted from GST on imported oxygen concentrators. Arguing for the Centre, which challenged the HC order before the SC, attorney general K K Venugopal said the HC completely overlooked the logic behind exemption of GST on oxygen concentrators imported by the government and its agencies, which were to give the machines free of cost to the poor and needy. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah agreed with the AG and said the HC appeared to have missed the purpose behind the GST exemption given to the state and its agencies in import of concentrators. “Individual concentrator importers, or those who are receiving these items as gifts, cannot be compared to the poor and needy,” the bench said. Venugopal told the SC that at the 43rd meeting of the GST Council on May 28, a decision was taken to constitute a group of ministers to scrutinise the need for “further relief to Covid-19 related individual items immediately”. The group of ministers is to submit its report by June 8. “Unless the high court judgment is stayed, the group of ministers cannot decide the issue relating to exemption from GST to oxygen concentrators and other items related to Covid care,” he said. Justice Chandrachud reminded the AG that he had promised to the SC during a hearing in another case to bring to the notice of the GST Council possible exemption of the levy on wheelchairs. The AG reassured the judge that exemption of GST on wheelchairs would also be considered by the GST Council in its meeting this month. The bench stayed operation of the high court judgment and posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-stays-gst-exemption-on-imported-o2-concentrators/articleshow/83156926.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Delhi||BJP, Congress take turns to target govt over excise rules||New Delhi: Both Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress targeted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for the amendment of excise rules, which now allows home delivery of liquor through mobile applications or web portals. The opposition parties alleged that the government failed to provide relief to people affected by the pandemic but is now preparing to deliver liquor at their doorsteps. The Delhi government said that the L-13, which allows home delivery, is an existing licence that has been amended. A government spokesperson said that till date, no licence for L-13 or home delivery of licence had been issued. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said, when the government should have tried to improve health and medical services, it was busy finalising doorstep delivery of liquor. He alleged that the government did nothing even as people did not get oxygen or doctors’ help while recuperating at home. Gupta alleged that the Delhi government failed to stop black marketing of oxygen, medicine or such items but was quick in deciding about how to have liquor delivered at doorstep. He also said that AAP talked of liquor prohibition in other states but was serving that in its own backyard. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Ch Anil Kumar said that it was shocking that at a time when experts were working tirelessly on how to control the Covid-19 pandemic, chief minister was preparing the ground to make Delhi “Nashe Ki Rajdhani” by making liquor available through online and a mobile app. Calling the move by the Delhi government ‘retrograde’, he said this would destroy the youth, who he alleged were already languishing without jobs and any source of livelihood, and parents were struggling to pay the fees of their wards. He said the government had failed in controlling the current wave of the pandemic and its Corona App could not provide any hospital bed for critical patients or oxygen to those gasping for breath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-congress-take-turns-to-target-govt-over-excise-rules/articleshow/83156855.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Finding tough to pay even tuition fees: Parents||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court order on Monday allowing private schools to collect the annual and development fees for the 2020-21 and current academic sessions has put parents in a quandary. For many of them, pandemic and the lockdown have led to income losses and paying the arrears along with ongoing session fees will be very difficult for them. Their only hope lies with a reversal of the order, with Delhi government planning an appeal. When the lockdown was imposed in 2020, Delhi’s Directorate of Education (DoE) had instructed schools to charge only tuition fees, not the annual and development fees. Citing financial difficulties, an association of private schools had moved court. Rajesh Advani, whose child studies in south Delhi’s Laxman Public School, told TOI, “Because businesses, professions, jobs, even salaries were affected by the pandemic, many parents took a year to pay even the last academic session’s tuition fees. The second lockdown has created a lot of additional financial pressure. Also, almost every family I know has been affected by Covid and there were big medical expenses. In my own case, three family members were infected. Somehow, schools are not considering these financial burdens of the parents.” Realising the parents’ position, a source said that Delhi government is going to appeal against the high court order. As it is, the Delhi Parents’ Association already worries that the court order could led to students dropping out. Aprajita, president of the association, said, “The judgment gives a free hand to private schools in collecting fees and could force thousands of students to discontinue their studies since they will not get transfer certificates without paying the arrears. The court’s observation that the schools can consider students’ position on a case-to-case basis means nothing.” S K Bhattacharya, president of Action Committee, an association of private schools, assured that the institutions would consider the hardship of the parents. “Every school will, in its own way, try to reduce the burden of the parents by giving them time and permitting payment of arrears in instalments as directed by the high court,” claimed Bhattacharya. “The judgement is very balanced because the schools had been affected by the lack of funds. In the court order, it has also been recognised that the state government has no power to reduce the school fees. Moreover, the verdict observed that the source of power of the government to impose such restrictions hadn’t been disclosed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/finding-tough-to-pay-even-tuition-fees-parents/articleshow/83126715.cms||Shradha Chettri

The meeting that lasted around two hours was also attended by minister for finance and human resources PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan, besides senior government officials including the chief secretary and finance secretary. “It was more a meeting to brief the new government about the current fiscal situation, since the chief minister was busy handling the Covid situation and related reviews. We did not expect any decisions nor asked for any decisions. It was just a briefing for the chief minister on the state of finance, fiscal situation and what the scenario and prospects are like,” a source in the state government said. “The briefing covered a variety of issues including the Centre–state fiscal issues and the finance commission recommendations. A new government should be aware of what the finance commission has recommended and how much the state will get and also the shortcomings in the recommendations,” the source said. The new government too has its own planned social welfare measures and a slew of poll promises to fulfil. The briefing will help them understand where the state stands as far as its fiscal position is concerned and to make decisions accordingly. “This is all part of the budget-making process. We have a month or two to work towards it. The process needs to be initiated. The chief minister showed keen attention and heard us out with rapt attention. He was very pleased and asked a few questions. Overall, it was a very good discussion,” a senior official said. From the finance department perspective, the team had the opportunity to explain things. “The focus was more on structural issues like tax:GDP ratio, the interest payments and the behaviour of various other items. With the fight against Covid on, this is the time for us to find finances by re-prioritising and making it available for the battle against the pandemic. Such works cannot be affected due to any shortage of funds,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cm-chairs-review-of-state-finances/articleshow/83128344.cms||D Govardan
---||Chennai||Sasikala trying to create confusion; no chance of her returning to AIADMK, says K P Munusamy||CHENNAI: A day after V K Sasikala’s phone calls to her supporters surfaced, AIADMK deputy coordinator K P Munusamy on Monday accused the leader of attempting to create confusion within the party. He ruled out any possibility of Sasikala returning to the AIADMK. During the phone calls to AIADMK and AMMK cadres, Sasikala assured them she would return to politics and take over the party and nurture it the way former chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa did. Sasikala's associates told TOI there were a flurry of phonic calls from AIADMK partymen even on Monday, urging her to take over the reins, pointing to the “humiliating defeat” the party suffered in the assembly election under the “dual leadership” of O Panneerselvam and Edappadi K Palaniswami. Addressing reporters in Krishnagiri, Munusamy said Sasikala had no links with the AIADMK, and none of the partymen would fall prey to her designs. “She makes such statements only to create confusion in the rank and file. Her designs will not succeed. None of the partymen spoke to her. Instead, she called up the AMMK cadres,” the AIADMK leader said. Munusamy was the first to have revolted against Sasikala when the latter took over the reins of the party after Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016. Stepping aside from politics during elections following the intervention of ‘intermediaries’ served no purpose, the Sasikala camp felt. The close confidante of Jayalalithaa had made 25 to 50 calls a day last week to supporters who had written letters to her after she was confined to her T Nagar residence. The purported ‘leaked’ telephone calls indicated the leader’s arrival on the political scene to ‘set right the party.’ Expressing disappointment over the infighting, she was heard saying she would not be a mute spectator when the party nurtured by them, was coming apart. “There were calls like a labour wing leader of the AIADMK in a Central district requesting her entry soon. But Chinnamma (Sasikala) chose not to speak to anyone today,” said a source. The plan was to speak to 45 supporters on Monday and the list was kept ready. Munusamy said Sasikala should step aside for Jayalaltihaa’s “soul to rest in peace”. The EPS camp is firm on not re-inducting Sasikala into the party. But OPS’s keenness to get her on board against the backdrop of the power struggle between him and EPS, has been a major talking point in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sasi-trying-to-create-confusion-no-chance-of-her-returning-to-aiadmk/articleshow/83128311.cms||Julie Mariappan

The daily average fresh cases kept hovering in the same bracket till about a week into the enhanced restrictions. “Once the lockdown entered the second week, we got around two to four fresh cases each day. This is the first time no fresh cases got reported since mid-April,” said an officer. The cops, however, refuse to let the guard down. “We still have 99 active cases in the force out of the 593 cases reported during the second wave. Seventeen cops are still in hospital and six have passed away,” said the officer. He added that with the restrictions extended till June 15, “the force would ideally like to bring down the number of active cases to a single digit.” “The fact that there was no major law and order duty in the city has also helped us break the chain to a certain extent,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. The cops reiterated that while the decline in cases is appreciable, the Covid measures need to be strictly followed at all police units. “Until the two rounds of vaccination is over for the 3000 odd cops who are yet to receive the jabs and even beyond it till the kin of cops get completely vaccinated, the Covid SOP will remain important,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-new-cov-case-in-city-police-force-in-2-days/articleshow/83126700.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Mentally not in the right space for June test: Delhi University students||NEW DELHI: Conducting examinations has become a bone of contention between educational institutions and students. Even as a debate is raging over holding the Class XII board exams, Delhi University and other institutions have announced that exams will be conducted in June. As a result, students have taken to social media saying they are not mentally in the right space for exams. However, the institutions have cited a delay in the academic schedule from last year and explain that final-year students need to pass out to apply for higher studies or get a job. Ayush Mondal, a second-year political science student at Delhi University whose exams are slated from June 7, said, “Many students are suffering from mental health issues after losing their relatives to Covid-19. In our college, Ram Lal Anand, two faculty members lost their lives. I come from West Bengal where cases are still high. There are a lot of network issues, especially after the cyclone Yaas. The last time, I had to travel from Bankura to Durgapur to give the online Open Book Examination.” Rajyalakshmi, assistant professor of sociology at Janki Devi Memorial College, said, “The last few weeks have been tough on students and their family and friends. Many are scared and tense. The university should reconsider its decision by postponing exams or assessing students on their past performance.” Associate professor Pankaj Garg said, “The situation is not yet normal, and conducting exams will not be ideal. IIT-Kharagpur and IIT-Goa are conducting an internal assessment to avoid pressuring students to prepare for the exams.” A survey conducted by Lady Shri Ram college students, which was endorsed by the students’ unions of St Stephens, Hindu, Hansraj, and other colleges, revealed that over 66% of students were unhappy with the exams starting on June 7. However, DS Rawat, DU’s exam department head, said, “The survey had very few final-year students. We conducted practical exams in May, which witnessed over 98% attendance. This proves that many students, especially those in the terminal years, are ready for exams. Many have jobs lined up and others are planning to study abroad and need their results soon. We cannot have students at a disadvantage. Also, UGC doesn’t allow passing students without an exam.” SPK Jena, professor of applied psychology, said, “Most students want to give the exams to finish their academic life in bachelors and move ahead. Over the past couple of weeks, the number of students undergoing mental health counselling has also reduced.” Arbab Ali, a master's student at Jamia Millia Islamia, said, “Many students who have lost family members are being forced to suppress their grief and focus on cramming for exams. The announcement of exams is not right as Covid-19 cases are still high in states like Bihar and UP from where many Jamia students come from. Ignoring these afflictions, announcing the exam shows the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the administration.” However, Jamia controller of exams Nazim Jafri said, “Exams are necessary for the academic year and for students to apply for higher studies or employment opportunities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mentally-not-in-the-right-space-for-june-test-du-students/articleshow/83137759.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Jinxed Posta flyover demolition may start by middle of June||KOLKATA: Demolition of the Vivekananda flyover will finally commence this month, five years after a 40-m section of its deck slab collapsed and killed 26 people on March 31, 2016. The city traffic police has given permission to pull down parts of the flyover. The work, slated to begin by June 15 with the demolition of the shortest span on Strand Road, is likely to be completed in four phases by August-end. “Permission has been granted for the first phase demolition. The implementing agency has asked for around two weeks to start dismantling work. By then, traffic management plan will be firmed up,” said an officer. The go-ahead was granted after a joint inspection led by top KMDA officials, including CEO Antara Acharya, on Saturday. Police are keen to get the work started when the city is still under the enhanced restrictions and vehicle movement is less. The implementing agency has said it will complete the first phase of dismantling in two months. The three other phases will see sections of the flyover from Ganesh Talkies to Girish Park; Posta crossing to Ganesh Talkies; and finally the portions at the intersections including Posta being pulled down. KMDA officials said a detailed traffic diversion plan will be chalked out in consultation with traffic police. The agency will be using diamond cutters, heavy duty lifting machines, trestles, earth movers and other modern equipment to cut through steel and concrete and dismantle the flyover while ensuring stability of the rest of the flyover. The Howrah Bridge traffic guard has completed a feasibility study around the Strand Road stretch. A trial run is likely to be carried out soon. Kolkata traffic police has also suggested a week-long awareness campaign to make people aware of the project before actually commencing with the work on ground. “We will withdraw parking allowed on a 200-m stretch of Strand Road so that the agency can begin its work. This will have an impact on Posta area. Alternative parking sites have to be identified to unload trucks. We have initially decided that work will happen only at night. However, we might have to block a portion of Strand road as it might not be possible to remove machinery and debris from the spot every night,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jinxed-posta-flyover-demolition-may-start-by-middle-of-june/articleshow/83126712.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Chandigarh||Privatisation is not a panacea for all ills: HC||Chandigarh: Terming that privatisation is not a panacea for all the ills, the Punjab and Haryana high court in its detailed order of staying privatisation of UT electricity department said the proposed action is in direct conflict with the nation's agenda of “Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas”. A division bench of Justice Jitendra Chauhan and Justice Vivek Puri in the order on May 28 questioned the UT’s undue hurry to hand over a profit-making department to a private entity, especially when the whole world is grappling with a deadly virus. “We feel privatisation is not a panacea for all the ills and privatisation with blind motive of so-called efficiency falls flat as this department is not only profitable but also time and again matched the high standards of customers’ satisfaction and has a big role in maintaining the City Beautiful,” the order said. Not accepting UT and Centre’s stand of ‘Atamnirbhar Bharat’, the division bench said, “The engineering wing of the administration is akin to public sector undertakings (PSUs) created by the government to make a self-sufficient nation and to become the master of our own destiny. While inaugurating the Bhakhra Nangal Dam in October, 1963, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru christened it as 'the temple of modern India'. The philosophy behind establishing the same was to end India's dependence on the rest of the world. If the argument on behalf of the respondents is to make India 'Atamnirbhar Bharat', we are at a loss to understand that what can be more 'Atamnirbhar' than an institution made in India, by Indians, operationalized by Indians, creating jobs for Indians and enriching the Indian state with its profits. We also feel that the idea establishing such wings is an egalitarian one with the aim to include those sections of society that need a helping hand. The philosophy of inclusion, as envisaged by Dr.Ambedkar in the Preamble, also included the concept of 'Economic Justice'”. The order further said, “To achieve this ideal of the Constitution as wished about by one of the greatest makers of this country, especially in such precarious times that we live in, it becomes imperative upon the administration to safeguard such institutions that protect the security of the livelihood. They provide a security net for the society to fall back upon, for the poorest of the poor to dream a better future, for the person at the end of the line to be aspirational so that he too can be part of the Indian dream. All this indicates a social motive and not a profit motive. Surprisingly, there is no reference in the petition or in the reply with regard to stakeholders, who happen to belong to lowest strata of the society like the Scheduled Castes, Backward Classes, OBC etc. The proposed action of privatization is in direct conflict with the nation's agenda 'Sab Ka Saath Sab Ka Vikas.” “When the whole world is grappling with the deadly virus, when there is no oxygen, no ICUs, a long queue at the cremation grounds and no place in the hospitals, the undue hurry on the part of the administration to hand over the profit-making department to the private entity at this stage of the history and in this situation of crisis faced by the entire mankind, seems to be misplaced” High court||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/privatisation-is-not-a-panacea-for-all-ills-hc/articleshow/83124846.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Over 19 lakh students had appeared for the Std IX school-level exams from Maharashtra last year. However, the data for 78,643 students is missing from the SARAL software, which stores the administrative and academic data of all schools and their students, including their report cards. The education department demands about 130 types of information from schools. Every student and school is accounted for in SARAL, eliminating cases of fake students and underperforming schools covering up for them. Now, in the absence of specific data in the software, schools face a problem of computing the SSC marks for these students as the result is based on combining the marks of both the years. The state government said the schools have been told to work out the marks for these students by checking their records and retrieving their home assessments. The education department has sought reasons for the lack of information in the software. On Friday, the Maharashtra government announced that the assessment of Std X students this year would be based on a combination of performance in Std IX and X.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/marks-of-nearly-80k-std-ix-state-board-students-missing-from-online-database/articleshow/83128349.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

It was difficult for me to wake up within 2-3 hours and rush to the grocery store. We relied on delivery apps like Dunzo, spending extra money on delivery charges,” said Satish Ghunte, a resident of Viman nagar.While citizens are happy with the extension of the closing time for essential shops, they said they will continue to take advantage of the delivery services and refrain from going out as much as possible till the pandemic situation is under control. Prakash Choudhary, a grocery shopowner from NIBM, said, “The extension of the deadline will help with the work at the shop, such as taking stock, organising inventory, doing the books etc.”The traders selling non-essential commodities have welcomed the civic administration’s decision to allow the shops to function. “The decision has come as a huge relief for us as the shops were closed for almost two months,” the traders said.Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP), said, “We held a meeting with the municipal chief on Monday morning and explained to them the hardships faced by the traders. The traders will follow all necessary measures at the shops.” Pitaliya said that the traders were also hoping for further extension of timings of shops in days to come.Sachin Nivanhgune, president, Pune District Retailers’ Association, said the extension of shop timings will help in better planning for home deliveries and also reduce customers’ rush. “The shops used to see huge rush between 10am and 11am,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/relaxations-come-as-a-huge-relief-for-citizens-and-shopkeepers-alike/articleshow/83128356.cms||Sarang Dastane

A grim Gyanved Singh said soon after performing panchayat elections duty, his daughter-in-law, Tinki Badhoriya (41), a shiksha mitra , was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection. Due to lack of proper treatment, she died on May 10. Five days later, her husband, Harvendra Badhoriya (42), breathed his last. The couple is survived by their sons, Vidit, 12, and Virat, 10. Wondering how he and ailing wife will take care of the children, Gyanved Singh said, “I used to be a small farmer. Now. I am too old to work in the fields. My wife is a cancer patient. So far, we have not received any help from the authorities.” District president of Uttar Pradesh Shiksha Mitra Sangh said, “The grandparents are old and have health issues. They have no source of income. We have requested the district administration to help the family in distress.” When district magistrate Prabhu N Singh's attention was drawn to the matter, he assured all possible help for the family. “We will ensure kids who lost their parents do not suffer.

While the city masses are desperate to get a jab, vaccine hesitancy among the rural population is proving to be a stumbling block for health department officials. According to an official, it’s necessary to vaccinate the maximum number of rural people before the third wave of Covid. So, the health department has started employing new steps like on the spot vaccination and asking vaccinated persons to convince others in order to ramp up the vaccine drive. The Rajkot district health department has started an initiative to visit ‘faliyas’ or housing clusters and shopping complexes in order to increase vaccination percentage. The health officials visit ‘faliyas’ and whoever is ready to take the jab is vaccinated immediately on the spot. The health officials’ team vaccinated 1,000 people in 40 villages on Saturday with this initiative. “We selected those villages where our team faced resistance for the vaccination,” Manish Bhanderi, district health officer, told TOI. “Our vaccination centre is around 8-10 kms away from these villages. We experienced that people used to get convinced for vaccination when our team visited their houses, but none of them turned up at the centre the next day. So, we decided to visit their ‘faliyas’ and give on the spot vaccination to whoever we can convince,” Bhanderi added. The vaccination for 18-45 years age group is yet to start in Rajkot rural area. Health department officials claim that their teams have so far vaccinated about 60% of the 45-plus rural population as against the target of 90%. To ramp up the vaccine drive, officials are also taking help of villagers who had got vaccinated. They are asked to convince others to get the jab. Apart from visiting ‘faliyas’, the health officials also went through shopping markets, fruit shops and ‘mohallas’ for the on the spot vaccination initiative which was started on Friday. There are eleven talukas in Rajkot district and health officials plan to visit all the remote villages where vaccination is not done. The Rajkot rural district has so far reported 14,434 Covid cases while 573 patients are undergoing Covid treatment at present. Post-Covid symptoms monitoring started The rural health department teams have also started monitoring Covid-19 patients as well as those who have recently recovered from the infection. The teams are visiting positive patients to check their sugar levels and other parameters. “There are many cases where people got diabetes after recovering, so it’s necessary to control their sugar levels to avoid post Covid complications. We are also trying to diagnose mucormycosis cases in early stages. We are teaching them to maintain nasal hygiene and have also been distributing betadine which works as antiseptic.” Bhanderi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/on-the-spot-jabs-in-villages-to-counter-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/83124911.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Mumbai||Uphold decision to cancel SSC exams: Maharashtra govt to HC||MUMBAI: If students took SSC examination in the physical format, they would be exposing themselves to risk of Covid-19 infection, the state government told Bombay high court, urging it to uphold its decision to cancel the exams. Responding to the high court’s questions raised on May 20, on a petition challenging cancellation of the exams, the state referred to the third wave predicted in July/August and the increased risk posed to children between 10-18 years. As on May 30, over 5.7 lakh children were affected with Covid-19, of which four lakh were between the ages of 11-20 years, it informed. The state’s reply said the decision to cancel “was and is taken” giving primary consideration to the lives of students, examiners, teaching/non-teaching staff and many involved in conducting the examination. Some 16 lakh students have enrolled for the SSC exams which would have been spread over a month and “student and parent would be required to travel 9-10 times from his residence to the place of examination.” “Obviously this transportation and movement of not only the students, but the members of the staff (around four lakh) and the persons accompanying them would expose them to the pandemic,” it added. The reply said Class XII exams were kept in abeyance and it was thought fit that they “were a relatively more important milestone in the education of the student as their future careers depend upon the same.” The state asserted that Class X and XII exams cannot be compared and the decision of holding or not holding the exams cannot be uniformly applied to both. “There would not be any debate that a student from Std 12 would be more matured, independent, socially aware, bodily and mentally fit as compared to a student of Std 10...It is like comparing an apple with cheese only because both are edible,” the state said. The reply said though the Std IX final exams could not be conducted, written exams and internal assessment of Std IX are required to be considered for evaluation of Class X students. Also, since SSC exams have been cancelled, it has become necessary to hold CET “to draw up a common merit list” to judge students from SSC, ICSE and CBSE boards. The matter will be heard on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/uphold-decision-to-cancel-ssc-exams-maharashtra-state-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/83134970.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Schools seek more time to conduct internal evaluation of SSC students||MUMBAI: Schools have sought time from the state to conduct internal assessment of Class 10 students in each of the six subjects. After the state announced last week it would declare SSC results by June end, schools have been told to expedite the 20-mark internal assessment. However, school authorities said even if there was no second wave of Covid-19, it would have been difficult to declare results by June end. “The internal assessment of students was to take place between May 21 and June 10, after the SSC exams concluded,” said a principal, adding as exams were cancelled in April, internal assessments were put on hold. “We now need time to get the students to submit their assignments and to conduct oral examinations,” the principal added. As per the state’s formula to assess Class X students, 50% marks have been allotted to Class 9 results, while 50% marks are for Class 10 performance – 30% for written tests and 20% for orals and assignments. Schools said while a sizeable number of students are away in their native towns and not reachable, others have said they need time to prepare for the orals and projects. “My son has been off his books for over a month. He needs time to prepare for his Hindi and Marathi orals,” said a parent, whose daughter studies in a Malad school. Parents say online pre-board exams should be considered. “Children have not taken their class exams seriously as they were looking at appearing for the boards. Many students pull up their socks only closer to the exams,” said a parent from Bandra school. While teachers have been directed to begin tabulating marks from Tuesday, several of them are in their native towns too. Shivnath Darade, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad, said they have written to state education minister Varsha Gaikwad that work on tabulating marks should begin after June 14 when schools reopen. The state is still to issue guidelines and dates for submission of the tabulated marks. As per the state directive, each school must set up a seven-member results committee headed by the principal and six subject teachers. The subject teacher will tabulate the marks and submit it to the class teacher, who will hand over the final marks to the principal. It will then be sealed and submitted to the state board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-schools-seek-more-time-to-conduct-internal-evaluation-of-ssc-students/articleshow/83128393.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Kolkata||BJP leader’s son, local resident injured in Kolkata's Behala road rage; one arrested||KOLKATA: At least two persons were injured in a case of road rage on Monday morning after their respective vehicles got involved in a minor accident. The incident was reported from the Biren Roy Road East near Behala Chowrasta. One of the injured was identified as Aditya Dalmiya, the son of BJP leader Baishali Dalmiya. The other victim — Parijat Laha — too was injured, claimed his wife and aunt who were accompanying him in the car. The police later arrested Laha under bailable sections. A separate FIR has been lodged against Aditya, too. Witnesses — some pharmacists and rickshaw pullers present at the spot — though identified Aditya and his driver as the primary instigators, a charge later vehemently denied by Aditya. Cops said that while Aditya carried injuries on his face and stomach and had his car smashed, Laha too sustained minor injuries. His wife alleged that she was assaulted even as their aunt — a septuagenarian, who was on her way to hospital — was reportedly threatened “We are investigating the case from all angles. The investigations are not over with one arrest. We have lodged bailable sections against Laha. Hence he was released on bail,” said a senior divisional officer from southwest division. According to local residents and police sources, the incident took place around 10.30 am. The family of Laha, a local resident, was on their way to a private hospital in south Kolkata along with his wife and son. Travelling with them in the same car was Kalyani Roy, the aunt of Laha, who needed to consult a doctor. According to witnesses, the car entered Biren Roy Road east from Behala Chowrasta crossing and was on its way towards the James Long Sarani crossing when it came to face the car Aditya was travelling in from the opposite direction. A minor collision took place and the two sides blocked each other’s path, getting into a heated argument. “I saw drivers of both vehicles then come out. It was the occupants of Aditya’s car who began assaulting Laha and his wife. A few cops on duty at the crossings informed seniors and intervened. Laha tried to flee at this point but Aditya’s driver caught hold of him and assaulted him again,” claimed Samir Bhattacharya, a local pharmacist. A few rickshaw pullers at the spot too agreed on the chain of events. Cops brought the two sides to the police station along with two vehicles. By then TMC-turned-BJP leader Baishali Dalmiya had reached the spot. She claimed that her son was held by his throat and assaulted by Laha’s family members. Senior divisional officers said they are investigating the case by recording statements and looking at CCTV footage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-leaders-son-local-resident-injured-in-behala-road-rage-one-arrested/articleshow/83126745.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

She said that till now, 41.8 lakh people had been administered the first dose and 12.2 lakh people both doses, with more than 54 lakh total vaccine doses administered. She further said that those in the 18-44 category would be due for their second shot of Covaxin this week, but the Delhi government was yet to receive the requisite stock. “Right now, the vaccination for the youth is being carried out only in private hospitals, and at exorbitant prices, as we have shared with everyone previously. But the vaccination drive for 45+ is still in operation,” she said, adding there is no need for online registration for those above 45 as there are walk-in centres established all over Delhi. She said the vaccine stock for those above the age of 45 years was more than 4.4 lakh doses, out of which 47,310 Covaxin doses were available on Tuesday morning. “We are using Covaxin doses only as of the second dose since many people were due for their second dose,” she said, adding there were 3.9 lakh doses of Covishield available which, as per the average vaccination speed, would last for 19 days in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-vax-for-youth-till-june-10-atishi/articleshow/83156965.cms||---

This is because the weekly Covid-19 positivity rate in the rural areas was 17.4% for the week ending May 28. We have to bring the cases down and efforts are on,” Deshmukh said. “The daily positivity rate has dropped to 13.8% in the rural areas. We hope that the cases will reduce this week because of the ongoing restrictions,” he said, adding that a review meeting would be held at the end of the week to assess the situation in the rural areas. The state government has empowered the district local authorities to take a call on relaxations. Only areas with a positivity rate below 10% have been allowed to operate essential and non-essential shops from 7am to 2 pm. The state has also told the local authorities to review the situation n their respective areas on a weekly basis and take necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-in-rural-areas-to-stay-till-june-15/articleshow/83128368.cms||---

The accused officials were identified as P Mahalakshmi, DEE, and Y Vijay Kumar, sanitary field assistant of GHMC Circle-1, Kapra. The accused were caught red-handed when they demanded and accepted Rs 20,000 bribe at Mallapur X Roads in Nacharam from the complainant, A Srinivas of Mallapur, to let his mother, A Salamma, continue to work as a sweeper of GHMC. “Salamma got the contract sweeper job in April 2021 on compassionate grounds after her husband’s death. The accused officials asked her for bribe to let her keep the job without causing any trouble,” an ACB official said. As per the instructions of the accused, Salamma’s son Srinivas met them near Yadgiri function hall at Mallapur and handed over Rs 20,000 bribe to Vijay Kumar as per Mahalakshmi’s instructions. Kumar, in turn, gave the bribe to Mahalakshmi and she kept the amount in the car seat next to her,” an ACB official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-ghmc-employees-trapped-by-acb/articleshow/83126813.cms||---
---||Patna||Lockdown extended till June 8 in Bihar, curbs eased||PATNA: The Bihar government on Monday extended the Covid-19 lockdown by another week till June 8, but it also relaxed some of the restrictions to facilitate more business activities in the state. CM Nitish Kumar announced the lockdown extension on Twitter soon after chairing a meeting of the high-powered crisis management group (CMG), comprising senior members of his cabinet and the state’s top bureaucrats. “Given the Covid-19 infection, a decision has been taken to extend the lockdown by a week, till June 08. However, some additional relaxations are being made for business and trading activities. People are requested to wear masks and maintain social distance,” Nitish said in a tweet posted in Hindi. The Nitish government had first imposed the lockdown on May 5 for 11 days and later extended it till May 25. Again, the lockdown got pushed till June 1. And, now it has once again been extended till June 8. The existing guidelines under the lockdown-3 will come to end on June 1. “The new relaxations announced under lockdown-4 would come into effect from June 2, and they would remain in effect till June 8,” a notification issued by the state’s chief secretary Tripurari Sharan reads. As per the new guidelines, all shops and business establishments dealing in essential items such as grocery, vegetables, fruits, meat and fish, dairy products and public distribution system (PDS) items have been allowed to remain open from 6 am to 2 pm. Earlier, these shops were allowed to open only for four hours between 6 am and 10 am. All other shops and establishments, which were hitherto totally closed, have been allowed to remain open on alternate days, and the respective district magistrate (DM), has been asked to finalize a roster for different categories of shops. Moreover, all shopkeepers have been asked to ensure the availability of sanitisers for use by customers. They have also been asked to follow norms of social distancing by drawing white circles on the ground within which customers would have to stand while waiting for their turn. “Failure to comply with these guidelines would invite penal actions,” the home department’s additional chief secretary Chaitanya Prasad said while briefing media persons after the CMG meeting. All government offices will remain open on all working days till 4 pm with only 25% attendance. Government offices related to essential services such as administration, police, power and water supply, fire services and disaster management will work as it has been working during the previous phases of the lockdown. All non-government offices will continue to remain closed. Similarly, all schools, colleges, coaching and training institutions will continue to remain closed. Religious places will also continue to remain closed to devotees. Shopping malls, cinema halls, gyms, stadiums, clubs and swimming pools would stay closed. The restrictions on the number of people who could attend wedding ceremonies, Shradh events and funerals remain unchanged at 20. Ban on DJ and marriage parties would continue.

---||Agra||ANM among 2 women health staff booked for discarding 29 syringes with Covaxin in Aligarh||AGRA: Aligarh police has booked two women employees, including an auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), of an urban primary health centre in Jamalpur after an inquiry report revealed that one of them was responsible for discarding 29 syringes filled with Covid vaccine without administering them to the beneficiaries. Besides the ANM, the centre's medical officer incharge was booked for hiding the facts from her seniors. The health department has already cancelled the contract of the ANM, identified as Neha Khan, and transferred the medical officer incharge Dr Aarfeen Zehra to Harduaganj community health centre and stopped her two salary increments. Other staff members have also been replaced with the new ones. Chief medical officer (CMO) BP Kalyani told TOI that the reason behind discarding the vaccines is still not clear. He said, apparently, she did not administer the vaccines to the recipients even after filling the syringes. However, during the inquiry the ANM has claimed that she was “mentally upset” on that day. On Sunday, police registered an FIR against the ANM and the PHC incharge Dr Zehra under sections 203 (giving false information respecting an offence committed), 176 (omission to give notice or information to public servant by person legally bound to give it), 465 (forgery), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC and section 4 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and section 3, 4 of The Epidemic Disease Act at Civil Lines police station. According to the FIR, the incident took place on May 22, when the vaccination of 18-44 years was taking place at the PHC. According to the CoWin portal record, 200 beneficiaries were administered Covid vaccines. However, 22 syringes filled with Covaxin were later found thrown away near the centre on the same day. The inquiry, conducted by two additional chief medical officers — Dr MK Mathur and Dr Durgesh Kumar — found that the data was uploaded on the portal without administering the vaccine doses to the beneficiaries. During the probe, Khan said that she had administered only 15 vaccines, but in a recorded telephonic conversation between her and another employee of the centre she had claimed that she vaccinated at least 70 people. Dr Zehra was aware about this incident but she neither took any action against the ANM nor informed any of her seniors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/anm-among-2-women-health-staff-booked-for-discarding-29-syringes-with-covaxin-in-aligarh/articleshow/83121900.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Pune||Govt denies, but many claim CoWIN ‘auto-booking’ is on||Pune: There are now many browser plugins or extensions that claim to “automate” slot bookings on CoWIN. Cybersecurity experts have warned that these programmes have an obvious and unfair advantage over humans trying to get slots “the normal way”. The health ministry has rejected the possibility of automated bookings, insisting that CoWin OTP and Captcha cannot be bypassed. But many users who’ve tried these plugins are now claiming in social media posts that they helped get vaccine slots — even filling the Captcha code before booking. The Captcha code was introduced by the Centre to ensure a human, and not an automated programme, is booking slots via CoWIN. Sumit Kar, a Kolkata-based software developer, said newly circulated browser extensions by some developers are also decoding the Captcha code on CoWIN, without any human intervention. “On CoWin, the Captcha is generated with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) which has the information of the actual Captcha that needs to be entered. This is how developers have been able to decode it. A bot would take less than a microsecond to decode and enter the correct Captcha. For a human, it would take at least 20 seconds,” Kar said. In Pune, one user said a browser extension let him book a slot without human intervention. “It automated everything, even entering the Captcha code. It booked a slot for me,” the user said.  Hospitals in Pune said these extensions or programmes may be the reason why their slots are being booked within seconds. “It seems there are users who have automated bulk bookings. There’s no other way to explain how 300 slots are getting booked within seconds,” said Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic. Bhote said the state should allow walk-ins for the 18-44 group with appointment slots every two hours. “We have high demand from corporates, but they are not getting slots,” he said. An official from the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management to combat Covid-19, said reports of apps automating vaccination bookings are “anecdotal and bogus”. The official said, “We have been monitoring IP addresses from where bookings are being done. We can say with confidence that such things are not happening. When you have high demand and short supply of vaccines, slots are bound to go within microseconds. There are numerous people trying to book slots simultaneously, with the CoWIN portal recording 45,000 concurrent hits per second. If there are 10 slots open at a time, how many microseconds would it take for them to be booked?" RS Sharma, head of the CoWIN platform, had earlier said (in a PIB statement) the system has undergone meticulous security testing. “No scripts can bypass OTP verification and Captcha to automatically register an individual,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-denies-but-many-claim-cowin-auto-booking-is-on/articleshow/83128429.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||BJP: Why death rate in Delhi 5 times higher than national average?||New Delhi: Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta on Monday claimed that the death rate in Delhi was five times higher than the national average and alleged that the actual figures had been concealed. Addressing mediapersons along with Leader of Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and MP Ramesh Bidhuri, Gupta claimed that Delhi topped the list of states having the maximum deaths per million. Citing a report of reference and data website Worldometer, he claimed that at present the death rate per million in the world was 455 and 234 in India. But if one looked at the May 30 figures, it was 1,207 in Delhi. While Delhi’s Covid fatality rate is 1.69%, in Odisha it is 0.35%, 0.33% in Kerala and 0.13% in Bihar. The Delhi health bulletin issued on Monday showed 24,151 deaths so far. Gupta claimed that data of the municipal corporations in the last week of April showed about 700 people were cremated or buried, but Delhi government reported 450 deaths. Between April 1 and May 17, 16,593 Covid-19 victims were either cremated or buried in crematoriums and cemeteries of the three corporations. But Delhi government data showed only 11,061 deaths. The BJP functionaries asked that despite spending Rs 44.2 crore on the health sector, why did the system crumble and why it was not improved after the first Covid wave in anticipation of a second wave. Ramesh Bidhuri alleged that despite a warning by the Centre, Delhi government didn’t pay heed and the situation went beyond control leading to 35,000-36,000 fatalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-why-death-rate-in-delhi-5-times-higher-than-national-average/articleshow/83126870.cms||---
---||Pune||PMC’s first drive-in inoculation site launched in Hadapsar||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation launched the region’s first ‘drive-in vaccination’ centre, out of a Hadapsar auditorium’s parking lot, on Monday. “People with disabilities and those unable to stand in queues will benefit from this drive. Citizens also will not have to stand in line for vaccines during the monsoon season,” said MLA Chetan Tope, who initiated the drive. The drive-in programme in Hadapsar was held at the Vitthal Tupe Patil auditorium. Its parking space was used to accommodate cars. Beneficiaries can drive up, park their cars and get their jabs — while sitting in their vehicles. After vaccination, recipients will have to wait 30 minutes in their cars for observation. “This is a first by the PMC. The civic body is making all efforts to provide vaccines to as many people as possible. We're also considering more drive-in vaccination sites,” said Suryakant Deokar, immunization officer of PMC.In Mumbai, the BMC held a drive-in vaccination programme on May 4 at a parking lot in Dadar. Hundreds turned up. The civic body went on to announce that six more drive-in sites would be set up soon, especially for people in the 60-plus beneficiary group.Besides Pune and Mumbai, many other cities and regions in the country — Gurgaon, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Noida — have started drive-in vaccination centres to boost coverage in the urban areas. A few local governments have tied up with private startups to organise the drives.Experts have urged the Centre and state governments to consider vacant open spaces such as stadiums for the setting up of vaccination centres. Worldwide, countries have turned such sites into vaccine hubs where people can stay in their cars and get their jabs. These sites have improved vaccination experience, especially in regions where shortages have led to long queues. In Pune on Monday, the Congress party said the BJP has so far failed to get a green signal from the central health ministry to procure vaccines. “A private firm is ready to give Pune 25 lakh doses, subject to approval from the ministry. Members of the BJP approached the ministry a fortnight ago. But an approval hasn't come yet,” said Congress party member Mohan Joshi. Joshi urged union minister Prakash Javadekar, who hails from Pune, and MP Girish Bapat to push for vaccine procurement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmcs-first-drive-in-inoculation-site-launched-in-hadapsar/articleshow/83128408.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||New firm to be hired for sanitation||Chandigarh: The municipal corporation (MC) house meeting on Monday decided to issue a fresh tender to hire a new company for sweeping and sanitation work in southern sectors of the city. The decision came after BJP councillors were divided and Devinder Singh Babla of Congress opposed an extension to the private company engaged for the job. Earlier, a team of officers, led by joint municipal commissioner, tabled its report, suggesting the MC should go in for a fresh tender after the company completes its five-year tenure in the next few months. The report said new technologies could be explored and the move might be financially viable for the civic body. But while discussing the issue, many councillors backed an extension owing to the firm’s “good job”. Some councillors said there was no need to hire a new company during the pandemic. A few others pointed out the new company might sack employees, which would hit their lives at this time of crisis. But many councillors of BJP and Babla opposed any kind of extension. This group felt a new tender could bring a better financial deal to the MC. The current company could also apply. Heated arguments broke out but after a long discussion, it was finally decided that the MC would go for a fresh tender. The company has been charging between Rs 50 to 55 crore annually for sweeping and sanitation work in the southern part of the city, according to records of the sanitation department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-firm-to-be-hired-for-sanitation/articleshow/83124930.cms||Deepak Yadav

The 49-year-old Swaminarayan temple at 61, Chakraberia Road (North) has not been allowing any congregation by devotees because of the pandemic. On Monday, the temple opened its doors to 400-odd people for the camp. Many of them were the devotees who used to come to pray at the temple regularly earlier. Many of the recipients said that they had been eager to take the vaccine but they were unable to book a slot. Some of them did not know how to get themselves registered with the Co-Win portal while some others did not have smart phone and internet connection for the registration. Preparation for the vaccination drive to facilitate these people began weeks ago by BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha. And the temple was registered in Co-Win as the vaccination site. “Our Guruji used to tell us that in the joy of others lies our own. We firmly believe in that motto and have undertaken this service to humanity during the pandemic,” said Sadhu Amrutcharitdas, administrative in-charge for public relations at BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir Kolkata. Not only did the Sanstha offer the doses at a concessional rate of Rs 500 but the temple also bore the entire cost of vaccination for those who could not afford it. The temple authority has also been involved in the distribution of ration to the poor during the Covid-induced restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bhowanipore-temple-opens-doors-for-mass-inoculation-400-take-jab/articleshow/83126833.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Officials said the shortage will impact drives on Tuesday as well. A PMC official said the few Covishield doses now left will be used to vaccinate students headed abroad for education, in drives scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. “We received nearly 350 registrations from such students. Their vaccination is scheduled to held at the Kamala Nehru Hospital. The students need not worry about availability,” the official said. He added that on Tuesday, for the 45-plus group, the PMC will hold only Covaxin drives across 15 vaccination centres. “Those who have taken their first dose of Covaxin before May 4 will be able to get their second dose at these designated 15 vaccination sites,” the official said. In PCMC areas, civic officials said they will have Covishield and Covaxin drives at 33 and three centres respectively. Rajesh Patil, PCMC chief, said the civic body is exploring ways to improve vaccination coverage. But he added that they’re still dependent on supply from state and Centre. “Vaccine drives by private hospitals have eased some of the burden on us. But we have to streamline supply,” Patil said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “We are expecting a bigger combined batch of more than 1 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin this week. If that number lands, it will boost coverage in the region for a week,” he said. Vaccine drives in the region continue to have some momentum, largely thanks to big programmes by private hospitals for the 18-44 age group.  On Monday, 19,673 people were vaccinated in the district across public and private sites. A total of 13,268 beneficiaries were from 18-44 category.

Accordingly, all standalone essential and non-essential shops are allowed to operate from Tuesday between 7 am and 2 pm. Earlier, the essential shops, like grocery stores, were allowed to stay open only till 11 am. However, shops in malls or shopping complexes are not allowed to operate yet. Restrictions are also still in place for hotels, eateries, liquor and sweet shops. They can continue with parcel services. The industrial associations have also welcomed the reopening of non-essential shops. They said that during the period of strict restrictions, the traders had suffered immense losses and reopening the shops would enable them to recover some of the losses. They said they will be observing all Covid-appropriate behaviour at their outlets. “Non-essential shops like cloth and garment shops have been closed for the past two months. Allowing the non-essential shops to operate is a positive decision,” said Digvijay Kapadiya, the president of Nashik Retail Cloth Merchants’ Association. “It is also a practical decision. Meanwhile, it is the duty of all shopkeepers to observe Covid-appropriate behaviour,” added Kapadiya. The Nashik Jewellers’ Association has also welcomed the decision. “The non-essential shops will reopen after almost two months. But more clarity is needed on the opening of standalone shops.

The hospitals have also asked the state chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to put some weight behind for faster procurement.“We shall be collectively placing an order of about 15,000 doses of Covishield. These small set-ups decided to join hands when the vaccine manufacturer declined to cater to the purchase order of fewer than 3,000 doses,” said Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India.“Most of these small set-ups participated in the vaccination drive prior to May 1, when the Centre opened vaccination for people above 18 years of age and asked private hospitals to approach manufacturers on their own for vaccine supply,” Patil said.Ramkrishna Londhe, the president of the state chapter of IMA, said, “We shall certainly support small nursing homes/hospitals in procuring the doses from Serum Institute of India.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/small-centres-join-hands-to-resume-vax-administration/articleshow/83128462.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The ACB officials said the case related to a demand of Rs9 lakh from the representatives of a private company, which was given a contract to install fitness equipment in public gardens. It had raised bills against the same with the municipal council. “The money was demanded by the supervisor on behalf of the CEO to clear the bills,” an ACB officer said. A team headed by ACB superintendent of police Rajesh Bansode and deputy superintendent Suraj Gurav arrested Poshetti. “We have arrested him. Further inquiry is on in the bribe demand case,” said deputy superintendent of police Shrihari Patil. Patil said “The garden supervisor contacted the company officials and demanded a bribe of Rs9 lakh to clear the bills. The company officials approached the ACB and the demand was verified. However, while accepting the bribe from the company’s official on Monday afternoon on the premises of the council, the garden superintendent became suspicious and ran away.” Patil said “The company was given a contract to install fitness equipment in the public parks located in Talegaon Dabhade. The company completed the work and submitted the file for payment when garden superintendent demanded the bribe at the behest of the CEO.” A case was registered against the duo with the Talegaon Dabhade police station later in the evening. In another case, the ACB on Monday arrested Shivaji Mahadu Gavhane (56), a cooperative officer with the office of assistant registrar of cooperative, for demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 15,000 from a private money lender at Shirur to renew money lending licence. According to the ACB, the money lender has a license to lend money and the cooperative registrar renews the licence. In order to renew the licence, Gavhane demanded bribe of Rs 20,000, but settled down for Rs 15,000. The private money lodged a complaint with the ACB. Earlier on Monday noon, the ACB arrested a lawyer near the Family Court at Shivajinagar for demanding a bribe of Rs 10,000 from his client. “We have arrested lawyer Harikishan Shriramji Soni (39),” said deputy superintendent of police Shrihari Patil of the ACB. Patil said “Soni’s client is fighting a case in the family court and could not afford the fees of the lawyer. Thus, the government appointed Soni as his lawyer from the district legal services authority and paid the fees to the appointed lawyer. Thus, Soni cannot ask for money from the client.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ceo-of-talegaon-dabhade-civic-council-held-on-bribery-charge/articleshow/83128500.cms||---

The general manager of DIC, Nashik, Santosh Gavli said that the decision on re-starting oxygen supply to the industries is expected. The supply of oxygen to industries was stopped about one-and-a-half months back to meet the rising demand for medical oxygen. But with the drop in demand for oxygen, industries want the supply to be restored. “Industries have been demanding resumption of oxygen supply. As many as 209 industrial units have submitted their demand of 838 cylinders per day. We have submitted the detailed reports about the oxygen requirement of the industries to district collector Suraj Mandhare. The decision in this connection is expected shortly,” said Gavli. Over 90% industrial units have started operations after 12-day closure due to severe restrictions from May 24. But several industrial units, which require oxygen to start the manufacturing process, are yet to start due to lack of oxygen supply. The operations at over 1,000 industries across the district have been badly affected due to lack of oxygen. Of these, 500 industrial units have stopped production, while production in the remaining 500 industrial units have been affected by 50-60%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-industries-want-o2-supply-restored-write-to-district-admin/articleshow/83122055.cms||Tushar Pawar

The curfew will remain applicable in the state till 6 am on June 8. Meanwhile, some relaxation with regard to the opening of shops has been extended by the state government. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal told TOI, “This time, we have allowed the grocery shops to open for two days in a week. The grocery stores will open from 8 am to 1 pm on June 1 and 5. Similarly, stationery shops have also been allowed to open on June 1.” He added that fruits, vegetables and fair-price ration shops and fish and poultry shops will continue to open for three hours a day each day of the week. “The daily count of Covid-19 infections has gone down considerably but we cannot take chances, therefore, the decision to extend the curfew by a week has been taken. We are confident of the number going down further in the next few days,” the minister added. A seven-day quarantine has been made mandatory for migrants returning to their native villages in a quarantine centre outside the village. Thereafter, they would be allowed inside the village only if they have no symptoms of Covid-19. The movement of attendants of patients has been allowed during the curfew but they need to produce a copy of the doctor’s prescription. Banks and other financial institutions are allowed to remain open from 10 am to 2 pm each day. The provision of RT-PCR negative report – not more than 72 hours old – continues to remain mandatory for people entering Uttarakhand from other states. For funerals, a gathering of 20 people is allowed and only four persons are permitted during ash immersion. Only those people will be allowed for ash immersion who produce a negative RT-PCR report. Also, the attendees of the funeral must not exceed 50% occupancy while travelling in a vehicle. The number of wedding attendees in Uttarakhand remains capped at 20 (including bride and groom) and the RT-PCR test reports continue to be mandatory for all guests. Notably, the first Covid curfew in Uttarakhand had commenced from May 11 and has thrice been extended by a week each time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-curfew-in-uttarakhand-extended-by-another-week/articleshow/83122073.cms||Kautilya Singh

The mass vaccination drive that will be organised on the campus by IIT Teachers Association from Friday will include rickshaw pullers, canteen employees, security guards, vegetable and fish mongers and other workers in shops at the Tech Market, maids and support staff. Though the jab is free in government facilities, there is a shortage in the supply of vaccine and long queues discourage people to visit these facilities to get the jabs. Total 3,000 people are expected to be vaccinated during the drive that will go on for a few days. The drive will happen at the Gymkhana, the students’ activity centre of the institute, said registrar Tamal Nath. IIT Kharagpur has 700 faculty members, most of whom are in the 45 plus age group and have been vaccinated for free in government facilities. They feel that since they got the shots for free, it is their duty to extend a helping hand to others in the IIT Ecosystem. Faculty members are also paying for research scholars who are still on the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iit-kgp-profs-to-pay-for-vax-drive-on-campus/articleshow/83126843.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Pune||ICMR begins real-world study of vaccine efficacy||Pune: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), via the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE), has launched a nationwide study to determine vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe Covid-19 infection. The study will be carried out at 11 sites across 10 cities. A senior scientist with the research team said the research will assess real-world efficacy of the Covid vaccines. “It will track nearly 3,900 citizens. Of these, 1,300 will be Covid-positive people who were hospitalised after vaccination. The rest will be people who've tested negative (via RT-PCR), but have been vaccinated,” the scientist said, adding that the study will help determine true vaccine ability, especially since there have been cases of people testing positive (and even hospitalised with Covid) after jabs. Dr Manoj Murhekar, director of the NIE, said the study will provide much-needed data on real-world vaccine effectiveness. The ICMR had recently asked all states to collect data of people hospitalised after vaccination, to lay the groundwork for research into efficacy. Experts have stated that post-vaccine Covid is mostly mild. But they said a real-world study would certainly help put minds at ease. The 11 sites picked for the ICMR-NIE research are all hospitals, including facilities in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Odisha, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. This research, experts added, will determine if vaccine efficacy is influenced by factors such as age, prior Covid infection, number of doses administered and virus variants. Much of the current information on these factors relies on anecdotal evidence. Clinical trials help us understand if the vaccines work. Effectiveness studies determine their real-world capabilities, especially against variants such as B1617 (currently reported in over 50 countries), one expert said. Epidemiologists who are part of the initiative said the study is critical because there hasn’t been a real-world assessment of the shots yet. Dr Subhash Salunke, the state’s technical expert on Covid, had called for a similar study after he tested positive despite being administered both doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-begins-real-world-study-of-vaccine-efficacy/articleshow/83128521.cms||Nisha Nambiar

All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson Dasoju Sravan demanded that the state government increase the upper age limit to 44 years for the jobless youth to be eligible for government employment in the state. Referring to a recent notification issued by TSPSC for filling up of posts in veterinary university, Sravan said the upper age limit was fixed at 34 years. If the same rule is followed in the upcoming job notifications, lakhs of youth will be deprived of employment. While Telangana statehood movement had kept youth away from competitive examinations, even in the last seven years of TRS government tenure, no major job notifications have been issued. “About 11 years of productive life has been wasted by the youth.

Dr Manoj Verma, general secretary, PMHS, Uttarakhand, said, “On Tuesday, all doctors — both government and private — will work with black bands on their arms to demand the arrest of Baba Ramdev. His statement has badly hit the morale of doctors.” The PMHS association has also urged all healthcare workers to boycott Patanjali products. Notably, several doctors' associations, including the Indian Medical Association (IMA), has given a call for a nationwide protest against the remarks made by Ramdev on allopathy and allopathic doctors. Meanwhile, Dr Ajay Khanna, secretary, IMA, Uttarakhand, said, “We will observe June 1 as ‘black day’ by wearing black bands. Ramdev must be booked for his derogatory remark against doctors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/govt-docs-to-work-with-black-bands-to-support-imas-protest-against-ramdevs-remarks-on-allopathy/articleshow/83124992.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Pune||Stress on investing in public transport to keep vehicular pollution in check||Pune: Civic advocacy group Parisar has urged civic authorities to invest in infrastructure for cycling, walking and affordable public transport, after the Indian Institute of Tropical Metrology’s (IITM) SAFAR programme found that vehicular pollution causes around half the PM 2.5 pollution in the city. The report by SAFAR, which tracked the “emissions inventory” in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad for 2019-20, shows that vehicular emissions contributed to 45.6% of all PM 2.5 emissions to the city’s air, and 25.2% to the PM 10 count in the atmosphere. The PM 2.5 count was far ahead of the next biggest contributor- industries, at 24.4%- despite the heavily-industrial surroundings in the Pune region. SAFAR’s report further added that PM 2.5 pollution increased by up to 70% in 2019-20, over a baseline of 2012-13, in Pune. Of that, transportation was once again the biggest contributor, increasing at the precipitous 91% in seven years. Parisar, speaking about the report and its letters to the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies, stated that a lack of a transit-oriented development model “is pushing people towards personal vehicles, especially two- and four- wheelers”. Parisar coordinator for air quality Sharmila Deo said, “We need to see how transportation is being looked at. There should be vast improvements in the city’s bus transport network. We should disincentise the use of private vehicles by not entirely focusing on just making more roads and more flyovers. That also means enforcing the parking policy passed by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).” Deo added that PMPML should be strengthened and subsidised, with best practices borrowed from other cities as well, rather than depending on the fixed-route transit model like the Metro. “Of course the Pune Metro is being built and operationalized, but how many commuters will shift to it? The PMPML network should be expanded, as it is a much cheaper option. Politicians often speak about the PMPML running on losses and it requiring subsidies. But subsidizing PMPML is a good policy to ensure good public transportation. We also could look at policies like those in Chennai, where the state government has made commuting on city buses free for women,” Deo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stress-on-investing-in-public-transport-to-keep-vehicular-pollution-in-check/articleshow/83128628.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Kolkata||Kolkata records wettest May in a decade||KOLKATA: This May has been the wettest in Kolkata in at least a decade, rainier than even May 2020 when cyclone Amphan had lashed the city with a devastating effect. Kolkata received 390.3 mm rain last month —more than triple the normal mark of 124 mm. A cumulative effect of squalls — that have been rare this summer — and cyclone Yaas, that didn’t cause a deluge on the day it struck but led to a heavy shower the day after, have led to this unusual weather pattern, said weathermen. In May 2020, Kolkata had received 383 mm rain, largely due to Amphan. But this May had a dry build-up with barely any thunderstorms in March and April. “This time, March and April have been unusually dry. Generally, Kolkata and adjoining areas receive 4-6 thunderstorms during the period. But this year, we had three squalls in May, preceding cyclone Yaas but none in the preceding two months,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. He added that May, being the warmest of the summer months, generally sees thunderstorms generated by the heat. “Once the temperature crosses 35 degrees and moisture flows in from the sea, norwesters strike and pull the mercury down. This year, we had around three of them but all have been very mild with wind speed barely crossing 45 km/hr to qualify as a squall. So, they couldn’t really pull the temperature down till Yaas struck on May 26,” added Das. Back-to-back cyclones and the residual moisture left by them were responsible for the heavy rain in May over the last two years, said weathermen. “Generally, when a cyclone strikes, the following two days also witness heavy rain. For instance, this time, we had almost thrice the volume of rain a day later than we had on the day of the cyclone. It is the moisture which causes the heavy downpour. Amphan had caused almost 200 mm rain while Yaas triggered almost 100 mm rain a day later,” explained Das. Big systems contribute to heavy rain in May which is usually a dry month, said an atmospheric science expert. “It is also a month of cyclones and we have seen the three most devastating ones hitting the eastern coast in May since Aila in 2009. But cyclones have got nothing to do with squalls drying up, which happened this time,” he said. According to KMC, the city received the heaviest rain on two days during the month — May 11 and May 27. On May 27, Behala received 150 mm rain, while Thanthania recorded 157 mm on May 11. Meanwhile, Kolkata received 3.7 mm rain on Monday, triggered by a cyclonic circulation in north Bengal adjoining Bihar. Strong southerly wind is carrying the clouds to south Bengal districts, said deputy director-general of meteorology Sanjib Bandopadhyay. “Kolkata will remain cloudy and see light rain over the next two days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-records-wettest-may-in-a-decade/articleshow/83126875.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two 21-year-old sarpanches make villages Covid-free||MUMBAI/KOLHAPUR: Young leaders are leading the fight against Covid-19 in rural Maharashtra. Two 21-year-old sarpanches, youngest in the state, from Solapur district, became overnight stars after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised them for their efforts to make their villages Covid-free. The government also focused attention on making villages Covid-free as the rate of infection is higher in rural areas. Komal Karpe, sarpanch of Antroli village, brought the village out of the grip of Covid-19. After keeping the 2,200-odd villagers safe in the first wave, the second hit hard after the first case was detected in March. “There was panic in the village. People were refusing to get tested. We formed a group with the help of local police, gram panchayat members and anganwadi sevikas to ensure testing and tracing was done,” said Karpe, a BSc graduate in Botany. The village, which had 80 cases and 15 deaths, does not have a single case for two weeks. It set up a centre at the zilla parishad school, and all coming from outside were kept quarantined for 14 days. “There was no entry for outside vendors, a janata curfew was imposed twice, and essential shops were shut. Goods were delivered at the doorstep with villagers’ help,” said Karpe. For LLB student and Ghatane village sarpanch, Ruturaj Deshmukh, the last two months were not easy. “We had our first case in April, people started to move from the village to farms. We had two deaths from a family. There was panic,” said Deshmukh. The village started a ‘Be Positive and Covid Negative’ campaign. Detailed guidelines were readied for villagers and people from outside. “We screened all 1,500 villagers, and symptomatic people were tested. There was resistance to get tested initially,” said Deshmukh. People from outside were quarantined for at least three days and villagers stepping out for work, especially to crowded talukas, were tested with antigen kits every three days. “Villagers roaming around without masks were fined Rs200,” said Deshmukh, and the village does not have any case since May 10. Vaccinations continue to be the priority for the young village heads who are battling misconceptions and myths. “People were reluctant. I started with my family, vaccinating my father (48) and grandmother (68). I could not take the jab due to the age limit,” she said. Deshmukh said they vaccinated 45% people aged above 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-two-21-yr-old-sarpanches-make-villages-covid-free/articleshow/83128690.cms||Bhavika Jain

Bathinda-based lawyer Harpal Singh Khaara, while releasing CCTV footage, had demanded Sukhpal Sran to be included in the case. He said Sran had visited Granthi Gurmail Singh continuously for two days, May 19 and 20, and made the granthi do the controversial ardas at the gurdwara of Bir Talaab village in Bathinda district. Granthi Gurmail Singh on May 20 had made an ardas while praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for declaring to made a Dalit as chief minister of Punjab and also demanded release of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim from jail. Gurmeet Ram Rahim is in jail in rape and murder cases. Going by the ardas, Khaara had made a complaint and a case was registered against the granthi, whose wife Rajpal Kaur is the village sarpanch. National Commission for Scheduled Castes chairperson Vijay Sampla had sought a report from Bathinda DC and SSP. Police confirmed that Sran had been nominated in the case under conspiracy charges. Sran, when contacted, said, “I have been implicated in the case on political considerations. We are with Dalits. Due to this, we have to pay. Complainant in the case has hatched a conspiracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-pb-secy-booked/articleshow/83128685.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Liquor shops open all days, non-essential on weekdays||PUNE: The Pune and the Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies on Monday issued identical orders giving more relaxation from the curbs introduced under the state’s “break the chain” policy to curb the spread of Covid-19. From Tuesday, all essential shops will remain open from 7am to 2pm throughout the week and non-essential shops from 7am to 2pm on weekdays. Liquor shops will keep the same timings but remain open throughout the week. An extension to the shop timings has also been given. Shops can remain open from 7am to 2pm, instead of the earlier 11am deadline declared in the previous orders. The increased shop timings will also be effective for essential shops that will operate throughout the week. Citizens will be allowed to venture out till 3pm. After that, they can travel only for valid reasons or medical and essential work. Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP), said the orders of keeping the liquor shop open on weekends, but keeping other non-essential shops closed, “gives wrong precedent”. He said, “If the decision to allow liquor shops on Saturday and Sunday has been taken just to generate revenue, it will send a bad social message. Other non-essential shops also give revenue to the government. The order should be changed and all non-essential shops should be allowed to remain open on weekends.” Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said the order has been issued with the state government’s directives giving authority to local self government for making changes in the “break the chain” policy. The changes can be made at the local level, depending upon the conditions. Factors such as bed occupancy and positivity rate have been considered before giving the relaxations. Yardsticks of more than 40% bed availability and less than 10% positivity rate were kept in mind for introducing the relaxations. The state, in its order, has given 10 municipal corporations, including PMC and its Pimpri Chinchwad counterpart, a status of “separate administrative units” for taking the decision pertaining to Covid relaxation. As per the data of district administration, the positivity rate in PMC areas was around 6.5 %. The Covid dashboard Monday showed out of the total allocated 13,743 beds in the PMC areas, 8,616 were vacant. Nearly 62% beds were available in the PMC areas. The positivity rate in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits 7.6 %. Out of the 10,493 hospital beds in the PCMC limits, nearly 72% (7,646) were vacant. In the previous directives in April and May, the PMC had allowed online and on-call delivery of food to homes. All online food delivery apps were permitted. Home deliveries were allowed till 11pm. Restaurants, hotels and bars could give home deliveries. E-commerce companies are allowed to deliver even non-essential items. The PMC had allowed house helps, cooks, caregivers and drivers and others to visit homes between 7am and 10pm. All these relaxations will continue. “The orders have been given in accordance with the sections of The Disaster Management Act, 2005 and The Epidemic Disease Act 1897,” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar commissioner said in the order. He said the conditions would be reviewed in the next 10 days for changes, if required. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said they have managed to bring down the positivity rate and the overall Covid infection spread across the twin towns.“We will be conducting the review meeting regarding the next step of preventing the spread of the infection,” he said.

BJP, however, claimed that the AAP government had not released due funds. “The high court has decided to auction the properties of the corporations to pay the employees,” Pathak claimed. “The corporations have not been paying salaries to its employees, be it teachers, doctors, nurses, sweepers, for the past two years. Today, the court has decided to auction MCD’s properties, disturbed by BJP’s actions and its inhuman nature,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor asked Pathak “to stop shedding crocodile tears as municipal employees understand that their salaries get delayed due to biased delay of non-release of funds by the Kejriwal government.” He claimed that the three corporations had paid their employees salaries as well as they could after the government had released the first-quarter funds in mid-May after a delay of 46 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pathak-targets-bjp-over-arrears-of-corpn-staff/articleshow/83126910.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: New mom back to work comes under train chasing robber||MUMBAI: Days after a Dombivali woman resumed work following a maternity break she was crushed to death under a local at Kalwa while chasing a phone robber. Vidya Patil has three young daughters and had resumed work to support her family financially. The robber, Faizal Shaikh, was nabbed from Mumbra on Sunday after investigators tracked down his location. Shaikh, 31, is a history sheeter. Vidya was employed in the cargo section of a company at Andheri. On Saturday, she was headed to her Dombivali residence after work. She got into the second class compartment of a local from Kurla. Two other women travellers were in the coach with her. Times ViewYet again, a history-sheeter has accessed railway premises when travel restrictions are on and committed a serious crime against a woman. While the railway police acted swiftly and nabbed him within 24 hours, a life has been lost. The case must now be fast-tracked and stringent punishment be given to act as a deterrent. But a burning question is how do criminal elements gain access to railway premises when locals are operating only for essential workers? Security checks must be upped at stations.Around 7.45pm, just as the train started to move from Kalwa station, an unknown man got in. He tried to snatch Vidya's phone but she put up a fight. As he rushed to the door dragging her along and jumped off with her handset, Vidya followed. But while the robber landed on the platform, Vidya fell on the tracks as the train had already left the station by then. She was crushed under the wheels and died instantly, police said. The entire incident occurred over eight to 10 seconds. After Vidya's fall, one of her co-travellers, Dipti Jaidevkar, dialled the railway helpline and reported the incident. Police rushed to the spot and examined her bag to look for clues to her identity. They found a company ID card and dialled her employers who put them on to her family. "What puzzles us is how does a robber make his way into a railway station and carry out a crime during lockdown when only essential workers are permitted to travel? Vidya's three daughters will never be able to feel their mother's embrace again. The youngest daughter, Pari, is only seven months old. Vidya had resumed work so that her children could have a bright future," said Vidya's brother-in-law Kamlakar. Vidya's husband, Dnyaneshwar, is an electrical contractor. Mumbai: New mom crushed to death under local train while chasing phone robber"When we were handed Vidya's body on Sunday, it was completely mangled. Her daughters, Purva, 9, and Megha, 6, were asking why she did not come home on Saturday. We had to break the news gently to them. Nobody should go through the trauma that the family is facing. We want the strictest possible punishment for Shaikh," Kamlakar added. "When we checked CCTV footage from Kalwa station that day, Shaikh was found travelling to Kalwa in a train just like any other passenger. He surveilled passing trains for sometime before zeroing in on his target," DCP MM Makandar said. The police started tracking the location of the stolen phone and found it in Mumbra early on Sunday, when Shaikh turned it on for just a few minutes. A team went to Mumbra and through information provided by locals, tracked down Shaikh. He has been booked for culpable homicide and robbery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-mom-back-to-work-comes-under-train-chasing-robber/articleshow/83129930.cms||Nitasha Natu

The centre’s medical officer incharge was booked for hiding the facts from her seniors. Chief medical officer BP Kalyani told TOI that the reason behind discarding the vaccines is still not clear. He said she did not administer the vaccines even after filling the syringes. During the inquiry the ANM has claimed that she was “mentally upset” on that day. According to the FIR, the incident took place on May 22, when the vaccination of 18-44 years was taking place at the PHC. According to the CoWin portal record, 200 beneficiaries were administered Covid vaccines.

---||Pune||Maharashtra: 9,928 minors in Ahmednagar tested Covid positive in May||NASHIK/PUNE: As many as 9,928 children and teenagers under 18 tested positive for Covid-19 in Ahmednagar in May, said district collector Rajendra Bhosale. Of them, 89 were aged up to 1 year, 3,052 between 1 and 10 and 6,787 between 11 and 18 years, report Ranjan Dasgupta & Nisha Nambiar. But Bhosale said the mortality rate in this age group is less than 0.5%. “The recovery rate is robust,” he said, adding that the district had around 86,000 positive cases in May. Sachin Solat, member of the district paediatric task force, said the figures were not alarming. As far as children and teenagers getting infected in the district were concerned, “The number was around 11.5% of the total Covid cases registered in May in the district, which is acceptable. There is nothing unusual about it,” he said. According to Solat, over 96-97% of the children and teenagers infected in May were asymptomatic. Citing an example, he said that of the 350 Covid patients presently undergoing treatment at the civil hospital, only six were aged under 18. Solat said the bulk of the cases were from the rural parts of the district, where the infection had spread. “These children and teenagers have got the infection from elders in the family who were initially infected. We must remember that there are hundreds of joint families staying together in one home, where the infection can spread easily,” he said. Bhosale said the coronavirus in the second wave of the pandemic was extremely virulent. “But a section of teenagers who got infected were lax in not following the restrictions imposed by the district administration and moved around in public places without adhering to Covid safety protocols,” he added. State paediatric task force member Dr Aarti Kinikar said the panel had taken note of the high number of children and teenagers getting infected in Ahmednagar and was working to ascertain the reasons behind it. “The task force will meet on Tuesday in Mumbai, where the Ahmednagar issue will be discussed,” she added. The authorities were unable to immediately provide data of children and teenagers getting infected in the district in March and April. Ahmednagar city NCP MLA Sangram Jagtap said the administration had started preparing for the third wave keeping children in mind. “The administration has started meeting paediatricians in the district to discuss what needs to be done in cases where children get infected in large numbers. We have also requested private hospitals in the district to start preparing Covid wards for children. The administration will soon inform the state government about its requirement of medicines and other things to treat children infected by Covid,” he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-10k-minors-in-ahmednagar-test-ve-in-may/articleshow/83128700.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Dehradun||Top Bollywood singer says no doc in village hosp for 13 years||Dehradun: For more than a decade, and through two waves of Covid-19, the lone hospital at Nagthat that catered to 50 villages in Jaunsar Bawar, a remote hilly area about three hours from Dehradun, has been out of bounds. Part of what used to be a Canadian Red Cross Society hospital is now a run-down guest house and the rest is locked away. In the village, few have been tested for Covid-19, no one has been vaccinated and if they did need medical help, there wouldn’t be any — there is no doctor. “The doctor’s room has been locked away since 2008,” said Bollywood singer Jubin Nautiyal, who visited Nagthat on Sunday with hopes of organising a Covid-19 testing drive. He grew up in Jaunsar Bawar. “The villagers told me that they have been waiting for a doctor for over a decade. The building is big enough to run a small hospital but I found no staff and half of the rooms were locked. Those which were open had broken furniture lying around.” It was not always so. “The hospital was built in 1999 with funds from the Canadian Red Cross Society. It had one doctor and a few pharmacists till 2008,” said Dr MS Ansari, general secretary of Indian Red Cross (Uttarakhand). Healthcare facilities were scarce, worse still in remote areas like Jaunsar Bawar. So, one hospital would have to do for thousands. “When it was functional, it would look after the medical needs of about 15,000 people across 50 villages,” said Jaipal Singh, gram pradhan of Nagthat. Then, in 2008, the doctor who served at the hospital retired and a replacement was never hired. The same happened for other medical staff. “New ones were never appointed. Now, there are a few midwives, peons and a driver on the payroll. Their salaries continue to be paid by the Canadian Red Cross Society,” said Dr Ansari. “When the first wave of Covid-19 hit, in March, I wrote to the director general (health) to deploy a doctor here since the Red Cross already pays for the upkeep of the building. But I never heard back.” An Uttarakhand Red Cross Society official added that their counterparts in Delhi have been reminded about the condition of the hospital several times but no one has done anything about it. Over the years, healthcare access was something Nagthat crossed off its list. When Nautiyal got there for testing, the hesitancy he saw was astonishing. “There are about 4,000 people in the village. Only 12 agreed to be tested,” he said. “In the initial days of the first wave, those who tested positive would be taken away for isolation. They were scared of that. Word never reached them that the protocol has changed. That’s how cut off they are. They are not comfortable being tested and do not want to be vaccinated. Had there been a functional hospital here, they would have access to a doctor and more faith … If they can’t run it, I will.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/top-bollywood-singer-says-no-doc-in-village-hosp-for-13-years/articleshow/83125076.cms||Ishita Mishra

The police had initially detained the businessman and allowed him to go after questioning. The suspect was given notice to cooperate with the investigation when needed. “The girl had visited a grocery store to buy ice cream on the night of the incident. On returning home, she told her mother the suspect grabbed her by the hand and molested her,” senior inspector Shankar Khatke said. The girl swallowed some liquid detergent in her mother’s presence, around 10am the following day. “Her mother rushed her to a private hospital; her condition is reported to be stable. Her mother later approached the police,” Khatke said. “The girl left no note on why she took this step. We registered a complaint relating to molestation on Sunday. We detained the suspect but allowed him to go after questioning because this was a bailable offence,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bizman-booked-after-girl-tries-to-end-life/articleshow/83128692.cms||---

Sunil Bhandari, state president, NHM Contract Employees’ Organisation, Uttarakhand, told TOI that the human resource department at the NHM recently issued a letter related to the loyalty bonus amount. "The bonus amount sanctioned for employees was not even half the amount sanctioned for us by the Centre," said Bhandari. “According to the letter issued by the Government of India in January 2021, the staffers who have completed 3 years shall be given a loyalty bonus of 10% and those who have completed 5 years are to be given a 15% loyalty bonus. However, NHM Uttarakhand provisioned for just 4.5 % loyalty bonus for those with 3-year experience and those with 5 years of work experience were given 6.75% loyalty bonus,” said Bhandari. Notably, more than 4,500 contractual employees work for NHM Uttarakhand. These workers will go on a two-day 'home isolation', starting Tuesday. "Not just those working on the desk but those involved in essential services will also join the strike,” added Bhandari. When contacted, Sonika, mission director of NHM Uttarakhand, didn't respond, despite repeated calls and messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/contractual-nhm-workers-to-go-on-two-day-strike-against-low-loyalty-bonus/articleshow/83122251.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Delhi||No Time For Centre To Fight With States: CM||New Delhi: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said this was not the time for the Centre to fight with state governments, but combat Covid-19 together. He spoke this in reaction to a news report of the sudden transfer of West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay,Tagging a news report regarding the bureaucrat’s transfer, Kejriwal tweeted on Monday morning, “This is not the time to fight with the state governments, but to fight corona together with everyone. This is the time to help the state governments, to make vaccines available to them, to work with all the state governments and work as one as Team India. The whole life is left for fights and politics.”Later, after inaugurating a free-of-cost walk-in vaccination facility for journalists and their families of all age groups (18-44 years and 45+) at DDU Marg along with deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Kejriwal told reporters, “I believe that this is not the time to do politics. This does not suit the central government. I appeal to the Centre to realise that this is the time to fight corona together as Team India.”Kejriwal said around two months ago the Centre had announced that the states should float tenders for acquiring vaccines. However, not a single state or political party had been able to procure vaccines on their own despite trying their best.“It has become apparent that the states cannot procure vaccines on their own and the central government has to do it. The states should be held responsible if and when they are not able to make proper arrangements to administer the vaccines after the Centre has procured, produced and supplied them,” said the CM.Talking about the availability of Covaxin, Kejriwal said, “If we do not vaccinate people at a faster pace as soon as possible, how will we ensure inoculation for all people to protect them from the novel coronavirus? I hope that the second dose will be administered as soon as possible when Covaxin is made available.”“Vaccination is the need of the hour to protect oneself from the novel coronavirus. I appeal to all the journalists to come here and get themselves vaccinated for free,” said Kejriwal after inaugurating the facility.Addressing the issue of black fungus cases, the CM said, “There are 300 cases of mucormycosis in central government hospitals and around 650 in Delhi government hospitals. However, the supply of injections is low. We had last received 1,000 injections the day before yesterday. Each patient needs to be given 3-4 injections every day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-time-for-centre-to-fight-with-states-cm/articleshow/83126958.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||Environmentalists decry U'khand cabinet’s decision to exclude Hemkund Sahib, Ghangaria & Lokpal temple from purview of Valley of Flowers eco-sensitive zone||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand cabinet's recent decision to request the Centre to remove Hemkund Sahib, Ghangaria and Lokpal temple from the purview of Valley of Flowers Eco-Sensitive Zone has attracted sharp criticism from environmentalists who point out that the area within a 10-kilometre radius around any national park is tagged under an eco-sensitive zone, according to a government directive in 2011, and thus, the state government’s proposal violates environmental laws. Kumaon-based historian and activist Shekhar Pathak told TOI that the decision indicates that there is no political willpower to save the fragile Valley of Flowers landscape. “In 1977, a professor of the Garhwal University told Indira Gandhi, the then-Prime Minister, that if she visits the Valley of Flowers, an air-strip will have to be constructed in the ecologically-sensitive area and that may cause damage to the region. After finding the concerns of the professor genuine, Indira Gandhi cancelled her trip,” he said, adding that “things are much different now.” “The incumbent government is relentlessly damaging the Himalayas – even more than what the Chinese are doing to the Kailash Mansarovar. We need political will to save the Valley of Flowers which is not just the state’s natural heritage but a world heritage site recognised by UNESCO.” If the state's recent decision gets the Centre's nod, three villages – Bhyundar, Pulna and Pandukeshwr – of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve forest division will be removed from the purview of the eco-sensitive zone of the Valley of Flowers. Notably, Bhyundar village is nearly four kilometres away from the Valley of Flowers, Pulna is approximately 10 kilometres away and Pandukeshwar is about 14 kilometres away. Incidentally, the Uttarakhand government, in 2015-16, had sent an official proposal to the Centre to categorise the area within the 10-kilometre radius of the Valley of Flowers under an eco-sensitive zone. Subsequently, the proposal was also put up for public comment on a Union ministry's portal but no call could be taken as the state government had requested the Centre to put the matter on hold till it sends a fresh proposal. As a consequence of this back and forth, the eco-sensitive zone of Valley of Flowers has not been demarcated till date. The recent cabinet decision, say government officials, has been taken to facilitate infrastructural works related to basic amenities — like construction of roads, toilets, laying of electric and water pipelines — in the region. Narenderajeet Singh Bindra, vice-president of Gurdwara Sri Hemkund Sahib Management Trust, which manages the Hemkund Sahib shrine, also concurred that the area is fragile and needs the intervention of modern technology to ensure that its ecology is not disturbed. “We do understand that it is an ecologically-fragile area. Therefore, the government should build a ropeway up to Hemkund Sahib just like European countries have done for their remote areas so that pilgrims and tourists have easy access to the spots and livelihood of the locals is not affected.” Meanwhile, Amit Kanwar, director of Valley of Flowers national park, refused to divulge any details relating to the proposal and said, “The final call regarding it will be taken by the Government of India.” Incidentally, the proposal comes almost a year after it was highlighted by TOI that over two hectares of the reserve forest area of Ghangaria -- which is barely 400 meters away from the Valley of Flowers’ entrance -- had been encroached upon by around 50 locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/environmentalists-decry-ukhand-cabinets-decision-to-exclude-hemkund-sahib-ghangaria-lokpal-temple-from-purview-of-valley-of-flowers-eco-sensitive-zone/articleshow/83122286.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Ludhiana||Day 1 of relaxations: Fewer traffic jams, happy shopkeepers||Ludhiana: On the first day of 5pm closing time on Monday, traders and food business owners heaved a sigh of relief. However, confusion prevailed among some city shopkeepers, who came to know about the Sunday orders of extending closing time only a day later. As people got more time to shop, traffic snarls were not the same as last week and were witnessed only at a few places, including the Railway Station Road. The number of people thronging the markets, too, was not as high as when the closing time was early, especially when it was noon. However, some things didn’t change, like a handful of people roaming without masks.Due to drop in coronavirus cases, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma had on Sunday announced several relaxations for shopkeepers and traders, especially those in the food business. According to the new orders, shops, private offices and other establishments can now remain open till 5pm instead of 3pm from Monday to Friday. Food outlet owners, who were allowed to make home deliveries till 9pm, have been permitted to do so on weekends too. Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, “We are grateful to the administration for accepting our demand and are happy with the closing time of 5pm. We came to know about the orders of the DC on Monday as these were issued after 10.30pm on Sunday. However, shopkeepers were able to manage the operations well.” Food business owners were happy to be allowed to do home deliveries on weekends. Bhupinder Singh Basant, senior vice-chairman of Punjab Traders’ Board, said, “We are thankful to the DC and the government for allowing home deliveries throughout the week till 9pm. It will give a new lease of life to our businesses. We have also suggested to the chief minister to allow this relaxation in all other districts of Punjab as well so that the hotel and restaurant industry, which has suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, can be revived.” Terming the change in timings as a big victory for traders, Gurdeep Singh Gosha, president of Business Bachao Morcha, said, “Ever since the lockdown came into effect, we have been demanding that the closing timing of the shops and offices should be 5pm. We tried our best and finally the administration woke up to the woes of the shopkeepers and traders. The result of extending the timing is fewer jams and no crowding in markets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/day-1-of-relaxations-fewer-traffic-jams-happy-shopkeepers/articleshow/83125089.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Delhi||NE riots: No bail for man accused in three cases||New Delhi: A man accused in three alleged cases of ransacking of shops and rioting connected to the February violence in northeast Delhi has been denied bail on the ground that there was a probability that he might “flee from the hands of justice” or try to threaten the witnesses. “Accused/applicant is stated to have been involved in riots taking place in the North East district in relation to the CAA and NRC protest...Also, this court cannot lose sight of the fact that the accused has been imputed with serious allegations,” said metropolitan magistrate Anamika. The accused, Tinku, sought bail on the ground that he had been implicated in these cases and since the investigation was over, it would serve no purpose if he continued to be in jail. The allegations in these cases pertained to causing damage to shops, personal property and looting of goods. In one of the cases, the rioters allegedly looted articles of his sewing machine repair shop and damages to property were estimated between Rs 12 and 13 lakh. In the other case, it was alleged that Tinku was involved in the damage caused to the rented home of the complainant on February 24, 2020 whereas the third case had similar allegation of ransacking carried out by rioters on February 25, 2020 causing a loss of Rs 8-10 lakh to the complainant. The defense counsel argued that his client had been in judicial custody from September 1, 2020 onwards and he deserved bail as a matter of right. The special public prosecutor, on the other hand, opposed the bail applications on the ground of seriousness of the charges against the accused and relied on his “previous involvement report” filed by the investigating officer. The order took into account the report. “As per his report, there are independent witnesses who have witnessed the commission of crime. It is further pertinent to state here that the accused is involved in about 45 other similar and serious offences,” the court noted. The court held that the accused was not entitled to bail at this stage and dismissed his plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-no-bail-for-man-accused-in-three-cases/articleshow/83127049.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

"Our livelihood is dependent upon tourism. We have been able to earn hardly any money since April. It is now becoming very difficult to take care of our families.

Vinod Lal, another local rickshaw operator, is going through a similar financial crisis. “I am trying to find employment as a daily wage worker to somehow feed my family but there is hardly any work opportunity due to the lockdown,” he said. In a similar vein, Asaram, a cobbler, said, “I open my vend for a few hours in the morning but there is very little work as people are not venturing out.

---||Delhi||Aim not to save vax, but lives: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal hits back at Manohar Lal Khattar||NEW DELHI: Retorting to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s comment that the national capital was exhausting its vaccines too soon, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that he aimed to save people’s lives, not vaccines. Khattar had accused Kejriwal of playing politics over inoculation, while claiming that Delhi was receiving more vaccines than other states. He further stated that Kejriwal was “doing drama” by saying that all the city’s inoculation centres were going to be closed because of lack of vaccines. “You are getting more vaccines than the other states. Even we can administer two lakh jabs in one day and exhaust our stock. But we know how much stock we are getting. If we keep administering 50,000-60,000 doses to people daily, our work will keep going on,” CM Khattar had said. In response, Kejriwal tweeted on Monday: “Khattar Sahib, only vaccines can save people’s lives. The sooner they are administered a vaccine, the more people will be safe. My aim is not to save the vaccine, but to save people’s lives (sic).” Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said even BJP president JP Nadda had made condemnable statements. “Every time CM Arvind Kejriwal begins work towards helping people and managing the Covid-19 crisis, BJP functionaries, instead of following the lead, start attacking him and try to stop his good efforts,” he added. “To hide their own failures in Covid management, BJP functionaries keep making false statements. When the nation was reeling due to a high number of Covid-19 cases and needed immediate help, the BJP government was more interested in managing their image and conducting elections. Kejriwal wants to vaccinate all citizens before the third wave. Instead of following suit, BJP functionaries are making false and deplorable statements,” said Sisodia. Reacting to Sisodia’s comments, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said, “It’s sad to see Delhi government and AAP doing insensitive politics. Nobody is stopping the state government from demanding vaccines for Delhi, but they should stop playing with the sentiments of people with two-faced politics.” “When it was time to talk to Indian vaccine manufacturers, AAP functionaries were busy criticising the Centre. After failing to arrange for vaccines, they are playing politics of confrontation with private hospitals by questioning their quota. Despite AAP raising questions on the vaccine quota, the CM and his ministers are inaugurating vaccination camps of private hospitals,” added Gupta. In a statement, AAP said, “It’s appalling that every day BJP leaders indulge in abusing CM Arvind Kejriwal even in this hour of crisis rather than working for the people. What is the crime of the CM? That he asked for oxygen when there was a shortage in Delhi? The CM is now asking for vaccines. Is it a crime to ask for vaccines? All BJP members abuse him day in and day out. Right from the BJP president, everyone calls him names. We urge BJP to stop making excuses, provide vaccines and stop this name calling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aim-not-to-save-vax-but-lives-kejriwal-hits-back-at-khattar/articleshow/83126983.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Heavy pre-monsoon showers inundate several areas in city||Pune: Double-digit pre-monsoon rain lashed the city on Monday, triggering tree-fall, power disruption and waterlogging in several areas. Shivajinagar recorded 15.1mm rain, Lohegaon 38mm and Pashan 32mm from afternoon till 5.30pm on Monday, the India Meteorological (IMD) data showed. Though the volume of rain was moderate, it rained continuously for a couple of hours. A car was completely damaged after a heavy tree fell on it near Kedari petrol pump in Wanowrie on Monday afternoon during the rain. Also, power supply was disrupted for half-an-hour after a tree fell on a transformer in the Patwardhan Baug area near Mhatre Bridge. The Pune city fire brigade received five emergency calls in the afternoon and evening about trees falling and waterlogging. Only one call of waterlogging was recorded at a housing society near Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagraha in Kothrud. No one was injured in these incidents. A fire brigade official said, “Fire tenders went to the spot and cut down the branches and trunks of the trees to clear the roads for vehicular movement. Our team also went to the housing society in Kothrud and removed water from its parking lot using heavy duty pumps.” Milind Alate, a resident of Asawari Apartments on Paud Road, said “Our society is located opposite to the Kothrud Kachra Depot. The depot is like a small hillock and rain water flows from there to the housing society. On Monday afternoon, the entire parking area was filled with about seven-foot-high water.” Alate said, “We reported the matter to the PMC authorities and they rushed to the spot. They opened the drainage chambers and then the water receded. We need some solution to this problem as it happens regularly. The PMC must provide some vent to water.” Anupam Kashyapi, the head of the weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Parts of Konkan could receive isolated heavy showers during the current 48 hours, while chances of heavy spells in isolated locations in Madhya Maharashtra during this period have not been ruled out. These are pre-monsoon showers caused by moderately strong westerlies pumping in copious moisture from the Arabian Sea, coupled with high afternoon heat.” Kashyapi said Pune’s air was nearly saturated with moisture on Monday afternoon/evening, with relative humidity touching 75% in the morning hours and further increasing to 95% around 5.30pm. Kashyapi said with westerlies pumping in moisture, the high day temperatures of around 34-35°C in parts of the state, especially scattered locations in Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra under the influence of moisture incursion, are causing local instability. “There is also wind convergence over south Konkan-Goa and Madhya Maharashtra, which may intensify from Tuesday or Wednesday, causing rainfall intensity to increase,” he said. The proportion of thunder clouds also increased gradually on Monday, from afternoon to early evening, over Shivajinagar and Lohegaon, said Kashyapi, causing the rainy spell here. Pune city has a forecast of partly cloudy sky becoming generally cloudy towards afternoon/evening, thundery activity, lightning and light to moderate rain for Tuesday, followed by a light rain forecast till June 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-pre-monsoon-showers-inundate-several-areas-in-city/articleshow/83128745.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Booze bizmen want restrictions eased||Ludhiana: Claiming massive losses due to the lockdown, liquor contractors and retailers in the city are asking the administration to extend operation timing of vends and also allow them to run shops on weekends. Businessmen are reporting only 25-35% sales due to the lockdown and adding to their woes are the restrictions on marriage functions, which are responsible for 90% of the wholesale business. Nandi Gupta, a liquor contractor, said, “Liquor trading groups are suffering massive losses of about Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh per group per day in Ludhiana. Our sales have dropped to mere 25%, and be it contractor, wholesaler or retailer, everyone is suffering. We are paying all expenses from our pockets. Sale of liquor from vends starts only after 6pm and with these being allowed to operate only till noon till last month, how much sales could we have done?”“Besides, the biggest customer base in the city is of industrial labour and they are also not being able to buy liquor these days as factories are operating till 7pm or 9pm due to no restrictions on them. Moreover, on Sundays, when workers and other customers have a holiday, they can’t purchase liquor as vends are closed,” Gupta added. Sanjeev Kumar, general manager of a liquor company, said, “The ongoing lockdown restrictions have dealt a severe blow to the alcohol trade in Ludhiana. Due to a cap on marriage and other functions, the wholesale liquor sales were already at an all-time low, and then retail sales too have plummeted due to early closing time. Weekend lockdown has hit us badly, as these two days generated maximum business. Due to all these factors, sales in Ludhiana have been reduced to 25-35% of the normal, which is not even sufficient to bear the salaries of the staff. We request the administration and the government to allow shops to operate till 9pm and on weekends else many vends and wholesalers will have to shut shops.”Another city trader, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Financial condition of traders like me who own one or two vends is deteriorating due to a huge decline in sales. As of now, we are managing to pay rent, salaries and other expenses from our savings and by borrowing money from others. If we are not allowed to operate till 9pm throughout the week and curbs on wedding functions are not lifted, we will not be able to survive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/booze-bizmen-want-restrictions-eased/articleshow/83125156.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Delhi||First batch of Sputnik vaccine after June 20: Delhi CM||NEW DELHI: The capital is likely to receive the first consignment of the Russian vaccine against Covid-19 — Sputnik V — next month, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Monday. “Sputnik will probably offer vaccines after June 20. They will start the vaccine’s production in India from the month of August. They are importing the vaccines right now, and they will allot a section of their imported vaccines to the Delhi government,” Kejriwal told reporters. The Drugs Controller General of India has granted permission for restricted emergency use of Sputnik V with certain conditions. The Delhi government has been demanding that all internationally available vaccines against Covid-19 should be allowed and brought to the country to inoculate the maximum number of people possible. On Wednesday, May 26, Kejriwal had told reporters that “the manufacturers of Sputnik V have said that they will supply the vaccine but talks are going on as the quantity is yet to be decided.” He had said that the Delhi government was still communicating with representatives from the manufacturers of Sputnik. He had said that Delhi government’s officials had a meeting with people from Sputnik on May 25. “They are willing to give the vaccines but still, talks are going on about the quantity,” Kejriwal had told reporters on Wednesday at the launch of Delhi’s first drive-through vaccination centre at Vegas Mall in Dwarka. Kejriwal had also said that “vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer have declared that the trial for their vaccines is complete and they are also suitable for children.” “But these vaccines have not been given permission to be administered in our country. I believe the Centre should not delay this and all available vaccines should be allowed to be used in our country,,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-batch-of-sputnik-vaccine-after-june-20/articleshow/83127009.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Engineer turns ‘Milk mama’ for infant who lost mom to Covid||Nagpur: The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us the worst in so many ways – right from children losing both their parents in a day to mothers losing their life just before delivering baby. But there have also been stories that inspire us to believe in humanity and love. One such story is of Sunit Narayane, a 29-year-old software engineer. Between April 11 and May 10, Sunit had made it a routine to wake up early in the morning, collect an ice box and ride a bike from his Sitabuldi residence all the way to Manewada. From there, he used to go to Jafar Nagar – another corner of the city. Sunit’s job was to collect bottles of breast milk donated by lactating mothers living in Manewada and Jafar Nagar for a newborn who had lost his mother to Covid-19. The baby used to stay with a family on Wardha Road, another corner of the city. “I never thought it as a big deal. In fact, I never gave a second thought when I came to know that I need to do this work,” said Sunit, who believes he was the ‘chosen one’ to become ‘Milk mama’ for the newborn. On April 8, a 32-year-old woman died after fighting Covid-19 for three weeks at Kingsway Hospital. But doctors did not let her motherhood die. They performed a perimortem caesarean section and a premature baby boy was delivered just moments before she breathed her last. The newborn was allergic to infant formula. After efforts put in by relatives and sources in hospital, three lactating mothers decided to donate their milk for the newborn. But the question was, who will collect the milk from them? “Earlier, one of my friends was appointed by the family and the treating hospital for this task. But in the next two days, my friend told me that his father was Covid-19 positive and he won’t be able to do the work anymore,” Sunit, who lost both his parents in the childhood, told TOI. He lives with his maternal grandparents. “I immediately offered to replace my friend. It was an instant decision,” he said. The infant’s family readily agreed to Sunit’s proposal. But there was another obstacle. “The breast milk needs to be kept safe at the right temperature. My friend used to deliver the milk in a car with AC on, so that the temperature could be maintained. I don’t know driving. So, I decided to get an ice box.” “I used to collect the milk twice a day from the lactating mothers. There was no scope to miss or delay the supply as I was always concerned about the baby,” he said. The Covid-19 surge had reached the peak in April and people were hesitant to allow strangers in their houses. Sunit said he followed every Covid-19 precautionary measure and the families of donor mothers were kind enough to allow him visit them. The ‘Milk mama’ doesn’t feel he has done something great and also doesn’t seek any attention. “I believe I was chosen for it. Such connections are divine,” he said with a smile. In mid-May, the baby left Nagpur to live with his father in Thane. He is getting breast milk from kind donors there too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/engineer-turns-milk-mama-for-infant-who-lost-mom-to-covid/articleshow/83098058.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

However, the amounts are yet to reach the account of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML). So, at this moment, we cannot pay MNGL. We have faced such a situation earlier as well but the PMPML has always ensured payment to MNGL. Once the amount comes into our accounts, we need to first disburse the salaries of our staff and then pay MNGL,” PMPML’s chairman cum managing director, Rajendra Jagtap, told TOI1. The issue cropped up last week after the MNGL wrote a letter stating that the supply of CNG would be stopped for the PMPML from June 1 until the latter cleared their dues of Rs53 crore. “It is now the discretion of the MNGL whether they want to keep supplying CNG to the PMPML. We will definitely pay them once the amount is credited into our account. One must remember that we are presently catering to emergency services only,” Jagtap said. An official with the MNGL told TOI that talks with the PMPML were still on and things looked positive. “We will come up with some solution for sure. However, they must pay our dues without any more delays,” the official said. The transport body officials said, if one takes away the interest amount which has to be paid, the PMPML had to pay the MNGL Rs32 crore. Another PMPML official told TOI that talks were on with the MNGL. “The PMPML gets paid for its monthly operational losses by both corporations. We have written a letter to the MNGL authorities about the financial problems but haven’t heard from them until now. However, talks are going on and we are hopeful that a consensus will be reached and that CNG supply will not be halted,” the senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cng-supply-unlikely-to-be-halted-immediately-pmpml-in-talks-with-mngl/articleshow/83128775.cms||Joy Sengupta

People can call the helpline to seek advice from doctors. The party has claimed that it constituted a panel of 30 doctors, who were providing free-of-cost advice to people. “Our helpline is receiving 2,000 calls daily and 40 dedicated volunteers attend the calls round the clock. The helpline is getting calls not only from the plains but also from remote areas in the hills, where there is an acute scarcity of doctors and healthcare services,” Jugran said. Seeing the success of this campaign, the party is considering increasing the number of volunteers and doctors so more people can avail the helpline. AAP leaders also claimed that party volunteers have delivered medicines and medical equipment to remote places which are difficult to access.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-37k-dialed-aaps-doctor-helpline-in-ukhand-in-2-weeks-claims-party/articleshow/83122429.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||Centre will give Delhi only a tenth of doses needed for youth in June: AAP||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Monday said the capital would receive Covid vaccines for those in the 18-44 year age group from June 10 and only 5.5 lakh doses would be available for the entire month. Delhi government’s free vaccination centres for this group have been closed for more than a week due to shortage of vaccines.“Delhi will now get vaccine doses for the youth from the central government on June 10,” Atishi said. While 5.5 lakh vaccines will come for June, at least 50 lakh doses are needed in total for the youth in Delhi, she said, urging the central government to make the doses available soon. “The youth will move out of their home once the unlocking process begins,” she pointed out.Atishi said more than 25,000 doses of Covaxin and 83,970 doses of Covishield were received on Sunday evening for frontline and healthcare workers and above 45 years old, taking the total vaccine stock in Delhi to 4.8 lakh for the 45+. Atishi said four days’ stock of Covaxin and that of 20 days for Covishield were now available.“Delhi government has decided that the doses of Covaxin will be used only for the second dose. There are a lot of people in the category who are more than 45 years of age who have taken the first dose of Covaxin more than a month ago,” the MLA said.“Vaccination is the only way to stop the third wave. It is a worrisome issue that if the third wave comes and it has more cases than the second wave, it will be very difficult for the city of Delhi to cope with it,” Atishi said. “People will be saved from this and the spread of disease as we will be able to reach herd immunity if vaccinated on time,” the Kalkaji MLA added.Atishi said BJP leaders were saying that if the vaccine was less, the states should vaccinate at a slow pace. “With folded hands, we would like to say that we want to get the vaccination drive done as soon as possible and the central government should provide the vaccines, too, at the earliest,” she said.On Saturday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had accused the central government of “vaccine mismanagement”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/centre-will-give-delhi-only-a-tenth-of-doses-needed-for-youth-in-june-aap/articleshow/83127028.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Jaiswal, who represents the Aurangabad central assembly seat, had then gone to the police station, demanding immediate release of two men who were arrested from the Gandhi Nagar area for rioting and other charges. Soon after the sentencing, the judge granted Jaiswal default bail to enable him to appeal in the higher courts. “In convictions where the punishment given is of less than three years, the convict gets default bail till the appeal period,” public prosecutor Avinash S Deshpande told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-sena-mla-gets-6-month-ri-for-assault-on-cop-in-police-stn/articleshow/83128782.cms||---
---||Delhi||Opposition parties and activists creating false narrative: Hardeep Singh Puri||NEW DELHI: Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri slammed opposition parties and claimed they had roped in activists for creating a “false narrative” around the Central Vista project. Sixty former bureaucrats who have raised objections to the project were also the target of the minister’s ire as he dubbed them “padhe likhe murkh” (educated fools). Citing the Delhi High Court order which dismissed a PIL against ongoing works on the Central Vista Avenue or Rajpath, the minister said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority never put a ban on construction activities and his ministry in its affidavit had submitted how construction works were going on at 12 different sites in Delhi. He said the revamp of Rajpath will be completed by November this year. While addressing a press conference, Puri referred to the letter written by former civil servants to the PM and him. He said they have mentioned that the new Parliament building is being constructed because of superstitious belief that the old building is unlucky. He said, “yeh padhe likhe murkh hi nahin hain (they are not only educated fools), they are a disgrace.” The minister said people are quoting their own figures that the Central Vista project would cost Rs 20,000 crore, which has no basis and were also linking the project to the pandemic. He said linking the project to pandemic has no meaning. “The total cost of the projects currently under construction — the Parliament building and the Central Vista Avenue — is around Rs 1,300-odd crore. The government has allocated Rs 35,000 crore for the Covid vaccination programme in the country. If need be, more will be allocated. There is enough money,” he added. Puri asked how the government could stop work every time there is a problem. The minister said the Central Vista redevelopment project is not a “vanity” project as alleged by the opposition parties, but a “necessary” project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oppn-parties-and-activists-creating-false-narrative-puri/articleshow/83127041.cms||---
---||Dehradun||No vaccines left at Mussoorie’s only govt-run centre for 18-44 age group||Mussoorie: The only government-run vaccination centre for the 18-44 age group in the hill town, the Municipal Post-Graduate college, has suspended vaccination since Sunday owing to the non-availability of vaccines. There are an estimated 5,000 workers and their family members in the age group of 18-44 living in Mussoorie. They are employed in the local hotel industry, schools, at construction sites and as rickshaw pullers. But just about 100 of these workers have managed to get the first dose of Covid vaccine so far. Local residents are also angry at the closing down of the centre. “This was the only government centre in the town and was offering just around 150 to 200 vaccinations per day and now even that has been shut down,” said Soban Singh, a resident. R P Badoni, president of the Mussoorie unit of All India Trade Union Congress, added, “A poor worker cannot afford to pay Rs 900 for vaccination at a private hospital. This centre was their only hope and now this has also shut down.” Vaccination for the 18-44 age group has been a cause for concern for the residents of Mussoorie. They have been complaining that despite repeated attempts, they are not able to book slots as they get filled up within minutes of opening. To make matters worse, a lot of people from Dehradun and Rishikesh are booking their slots in Mussoorie. In light of this situation, the union has demanded that vaccination for the workers should be without online registration so that the hotel and shop workers, rickshaw operators and construction labourers are able to get vaccinated. Speaking to TOI, Dr Yatendra Singh, chief medical superintendent of the sub-district hospital (civil hospital) said that the vaccination centre has been temporarily closed due to non-availability of vaccines. “We hope to resume vaccination soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-vaccines-left-at-mussoories-only-govt-run-centre-for-18-44-age-group/articleshow/83122475.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Delhi||This May Was Coolest In 13 Years||New Delhi: Delhi recorded its coolest May in 13 years with both the average maximum and minimum temperatures staying below normal on most of the days of the month. After a spate of western disturbances and nine rainy days and due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae and Cyclone Yaas, the monthly average maximum temperature was recorded at 37.5 degrees Celsius in the city. Before this, it was lower in May 2008 at 37 degrees Celsius. The average minimum temperature was recorded at 23.2 degrees Celsius, which was lowest since 1967. In May 1982, the mercury had dipped to the same level. Though May is known for sweltering conditions, no heat wave was recorded this year. Four heat waves had swept the city in May 2020. A heat wave is declared when the maximum temperature is 45 degrees Celsius or above or when the maximum temperature is at least 4.5 degrees above normal. The normal temperature around this time of the month is 40.4 degrees Celsius. The average maximum temperature reported in May was two degrees below normal. The mean minimum temperature recorded in the same month was 2.6 degrees below normal, according to data of India Meteorological Department (IMD). Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “As many as six western disturbances impacted the region in May this year and the temperatures remained lower than normal on most of the days of the month. Both cyclones had an effect on the weather in the region. Under the influence of Cyclone Tauktae, the city recorded the highest rainfall ever. Due to the impact of Cyclone Yaas, the easterly winds led to a drop in the temperature.” IMD data shows that the maximum temperature mostly hovered around 40 to 46 degrees Celsius in the second half of the month last year. However, the day temperature remained below the 40-degree mark on most days during the same period this year. This May broke many records as highest single-day rainfall was recorded at 119.3mm on May 19. It surpassed the all-time record of 24-hour rainfall of 60mm recorded in 1976. Besides, Delhi received nearly seven times more rainfall this month than normal. The city recorded 144.8mm rainfall in May this year while the normal for the month is 19.7mm rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-may-was-coolest-in-13-years/articleshow/83127085.cms||---
---||Delhi||Vaxing eloquent: Private schools, colleges in Delhi inject energy into fight||NEW DELHI: Even private schools and universities are now opening up their premises for setting up vaccination centres. This is proving to be invaluable with residents having reservations about visiting hospitals to get the jab. Mount Abu Public School has collaborated with Fortis Hospital for providing vaccines to the 18+ category. The facility will be provided at the school’s Shalimar Bagh branch from Tuesday onwards. Only Covidshield vaccine is available here. To get vaccinated, people just have to get themselves registered on CoWin. “It will be on a first-come, first-serve basis as slots are not being allotted. Registration, however, is a must,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of the school, which had earlier sent a proposal to the hospital for setting up the vaccination centre. Arora further stated, “We really need to speed up the inoculation drive. We had space and the required facility so we thought why not extend the services. We need to come forward and support the government.” She said vaccine beneficiaries might feel safer on the school premises. “I also preferred a government dispensary over a hospital when I had to get the shot. We have already spread information about the vaccination centre via local residents’ welfare associations,” added Arora. Mount Carmel School, Dwarka and GD Goenka School, Vasant Kunj had recently transformed their premises into Covid care centres. Even at Delhi University’s Lakshmibai College, the Covid-19 vaccination drive is under way. However, the centre at the college is only for the 45+ age group due to shortage of vaccines. Lakshmibai college was among the first to set up a Covid care centre equipped with oxygen, doctors and nurses. “Doctors attached with the centre during Covid care are also available for post-Covid OPD from 10 am to 1 pm at the health and wellness centre of the college. We are providing online yoga sessions too. For physiotherapy sessions, patients can take an appointment and visit,” said Pratyush Vatsala, principal of Lakshmibai College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaxing-eloquent-private-schools-colleges-inject-energy-into-fight/articleshow/83127056.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Mumbai||BMC asks Dadar, Mahim housing societies to opt for paid vax||MUMBAI: The BMC’s G North ward has written to housing societies asking them to facilitate paid vaccination drive within their premises, and said it will help them tie up with private players. The G North ward, which has several high and low rise buildings in its jurisdiction, covers parts of Dadar, Mahim and Dharavi. If any society makes an application to the local ward office, the camp for society members will be organised by private hospitals. The ward war rooms, which were activated last year to help allocation of hospital beds for covid patients, could also be contacted for more clarity, said a letter which was sent out to societies over the weekend. Assistant municipal commissioner of the ward Kiran Dighavkar said they had a meeting with private hospitals on how it could be worked out. “At least three hospitals have shown interest in vaccinating society members in case they apply to us. However, the camps can only be organised in the later half of June when these hospitals are expecting fresh vaccine stocks as current stocks will be used up for those who have already registered,” he said. Currently, in many high-rise housing societies and large complexes across Mumbai, vaccination drives are being aggressively carried out with private hospitals charging around Rs 1,000 per dose or more in some cases. Local corporators from the area said they had received several requests from residents who were ready to pay for such camps but were unable to get in touch with major hospitals who have vaccine stocks. Shiv Sena corporator Vishakha Raut said, “A meeting with the ward office will be held on Monday and we are working out the modalities now.” Meanwhile, Dadar resident Bhagyashri Kelkar, a member of citizen forum in G North ward said many are finding it very difficult to get an online slot on CoWin. Besides, vaccination at civic centres for persons between 18-44 years has stopped completely, but people are eager to get the jab. “However, holding camps in smaller buildings would be neither practical or economical as the number of residents may be lesser. In such a scenario, if the entire lane comes together for the camp, it can be organised in either a college or school as they are shut because of covid restrictions. Also, in smaller buildings, many senior citizens may have already taken their vaccine doses,” Kelkar said. In the first week of May, the BMC had already issued detailed guidelines for vaccination sessions to be organised at housing societies by private covid vaccination centres (PCVC) having sufficient number of willing beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-asks-dadar-mahim-hsg-societies-to-opt-for-paid-vax/articleshow/83128807.cms||Richa Pinto

The bank is awaiting the central bank’s nod for its proposed merger with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB). Till the end of the previous fiscal, Rupee Bank’s total deposits stood at around Rs 1,294 crore, while its accumulated losses were at around Rs 627 crore. Till the end of March, the bank added that it had paid out around Rs 367 crore to needy depositors under the hardship scheme implemented when the bank went into administration. A state government enquiry into financial mismanagement and other charges against the bank’s former employees has now been completed, but the report is awaited. The bank said it was also looking at other revival options, with cooperation from its high-value depositors. The administrators also warned of a negative impact on depositors in case of liquidation. “Other than a negative net worth of around Rs 550-600 crore, RBI has not noted any adverse remark about the bank’s working. We are exploring opportunities to revive the bank, including private investments and mergers, or as a small finance bank, but that would be done with the cooperation of high-value depositors. While most depositors will be covered by insurance and will get their money back, the small number of high-value depositors will be adversely affected, and many of them are senior citizens,” said Sudhir Pandit, the administrator of Rupee Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rupee-bank-gets-three-month-extension/articleshow/83128816.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||India||Can place vaccine plan for scrutiny but SC mustn’t try to state policy: Government||NEW DELHI: Exasperated by the Supreme Court’s intense questioning on Covid-19 vaccine pricing, phased vaccination process and suggestions to improve the policy framework, the Union government on Monday said the policies were open for judicial scrutiny but the court must not step into policymakers’ shoes. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta repeatedly said the government was aware of the dynamics of the pandemic situation and kept in view the ground realities in taking decisions in larger public interest. But this did not stop a barrage of questions from a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat, which also suggested tweaking of the policy framework. Read AlsoDon’t book people for seeking help on social media: Supreme Court to copsWarning state governments against booking people for making distressed social media posts on scarcity of oxygen, essential medicines and beds for Covid-19 patients, the Supreme Court on Friday said state police and DGPs would be hauled for contempt of court for any clampdown on citizens for airingWhen the court suggested a particular way of universal vaccination — that the Centre should procure vaccines for all citizens and distribute it among states — the SG said in a lighter vein, “I (the Centre) do not have experience of running the administration. If the court has, then it should go ahead and frame policies which the Centre will implement. If we (all present in the courtroom) were to make a policy decision, then things could have rolled out that way. The executive’s policy decisions can surely be replaced by the court’s wisdom.” However, he stood firm that the policy domain was a no-go zone for the judiciary. The bench said, “We are not framing any policy... but there has to be some flexibility. We expect some resilience on the part of the government to listen to what the Supreme Court is saying. Hearing in the SC is a forum for dialogue. Voices from across the spectrum can be heard and the views can be taken into consideration by the government.” Justice Chandrachud said the vaccination policy could not be changed on a daily basis and there has to be a comprehensive framework based on which challenges posed by dynamic situations could be tackled. The SG said he has been repeatedly conveying that the government is always open to suggestions and that its policies are not cast in stone. “We have tweaked the policies as per the demands of the situations during the pandemic,” he added. Times ViewAt the heart of the fascinating exchange between the Supreme Court and the Solicitor General lies a hard question: Why has India become an exception to the global norm of free vaccination? That’s the question which must be honestly addressed and answered.The bench acknowledged the government’s work and referred to the foreign minister’s visit to the US for a dialogue on vaccine partnership. It “shows the sensitivity of the government”, Justice Chandrachud said. Mehta was quick to add that the PM has spoken to many heads of states for vaccine partnership. But the initial period of hearing saw the court questioning the Centre’s policy. Justices Chandrachud, Rao and Bhat said the policy of the 1970s on universal immunisation programme was followed till May 1, when those in 45-plus age group were vaccinated free of cost. “Why should the court not direct free vaccination of all citizens?” “Why was the policy changed after May 1 when vaccination was opened to the 18-45 age group? Why was there a three-tier pricing of vaccines — one for the Centre, another for states and still another for private hospitals?” Justice Bhat said. Justice Chandrachud questioned the mandatory Co-Win registration and said, “How does the government expect a migrant worker to register and earn a slot when educated and IT-literate people are finding it difficult to register? The government must have its ears to the ground to understand the reality.” Justice Rao said the court could not stop the government from changing policy decisions, even though it could examine the rationale and validity of the new policy. He and Justice Bhat also asked whether the vaccination was urban-centric with few vaccines reaching rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/can-place-vaccine-plan-for-scrutiny-but-sc-mustnt-try-to-state-policy-government/articleshow/83132498.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Pune||Petrol price on fire, citizens stoprefilling vehicle tanks to the brim||Pune: Kedarinagar area resident Sanjay Datre (46) was not surprised on finding the price of a litre of petrol crossing the Rs100 mark on Monday. A plumber by profession, Datre said it has been more than three months now that he had stopped filling the tank of his two-wheeler to the brim. “I came to know about petrol crossing the Rs100 mark on Monday morning as I rode into a filling station. But I was not surprised. It has been months that I am buying petrol worth Rs40 to Rs50,” he told TOI. Unlike Datre, the new petrol price high was a shock for Dilip Holkar, who has been driving to his workplace in Pune, around 70km from his home in Khedgaon, for over a year now. “The situation is becoming extremely difficult. With a monthly income of Rs15,000, I was spending around Rs8,000 each month on petrol. Following the latest hike in the price, I will end up spending at least Rs9,500. I will be left with less than Rs5,000 to support my family.” Undri resident Ravindra Chitre (49) said, “I have been living in Pune for 20 years and have never seen petrol costing so high. I have to pick up and drop my wife to Hadapsar— a distance of around 15km — where she works in a hospital. I lost my job around six months ago, and my wife is now the only earning member in the family. The conditions are such that she is planning to walk at least one way of her daily travel — either to workplace or home.” Food delivery men, who move around across the city throughout the day, are in a fix too. “It has been more than a year that the petrol tank of my vehicle has been full. There are a few filling stations that provide us with petrol on credit. But they too are becoming impatient, as we are failing to repay on time,” a food delivery executive said. Petrol retailed for over Rs100 a litre in Pune city for the first time on Monday. Diesel, too, retailed for Rs 90.71 a litre, again an all-time high price.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/petrol-price-on-fire-citizens-stoprefilling-vehicle-tanks-to-the-brim/articleshow/83128861.cms||Joy Sengupta

But when the victim’s kin staged a protest, the police booked two more brothers in the case.The four brothers are Amit Kumar, Ravi, Arvind and Subhash of Sanjay Gandhi Colony. The victim has been identified as their neighbour, Karan Yadav, a labourer. Ravi Kumar, brother of Karan, said in his police complainant, “Karan used to play cricket with a group of boys. On Sunday, he had a spat with one of the accused over the game. Thereafter, around 9pm, Karan went for a walk. When he reached near Gopal Mandir, the accused came there in a car. I was near the spot at the time.” “The accused started fighting with Karan. Ravi held Karan from his arms and Amit hit him with a baseball bat. They fled after leaving Karan in a pool of blood,” he added. Ravi Kumar took Karan to a hospital. He was referred to CMC Hospital, where doctors declared him dead. Ravi Kumar alleged that after the incident, Arvind came to their house and threatened them against lodging an FIR. They nabbed him, tied him with a tree and handed him over to the police. However, the police set the accused free after some time, he said.“We gave a CCTV footage to the police which showed the four brothers at the murder spot. But the cops registered the case only against two brothers. Therefore, we staged a protest,” he added.

A total of 86,887 doses were administered, of which 64,610 were given in the private sector and 20,448 in the public. It means as much as 74% was paid vaccination, while the free centres could give only 26% shots. Public vaccination centres not just continue to grapple with shortage of doses, but also Co-Win glitches. On Monday, commotion broke out at JJ Hospital where over 90 people were turned away due to a glitch in Co-Win that allowed them to book a slot for the first dose of Covaxin. On reaching the hospital, they were told that the session was created by mistake and that the hospital didn’t have Covaxin to spare for first shots. Advocate D M Galani, who was among the people who had to return without vaccination, said if the session was created by mistake, it should have been cancelled. “Worse, when I tried to reschedule, Co-Win gave me an appointment for December 2022,” Galani said. A senior official from JJ said the session was created by mistake and before they could cancel, people had booked appointments. “We spoke to the BMC too, but they said we have no choice but to cancel the whole thing. We offered people to take Covishield, but most refused,” he said. The hospital is administering Covaxin only as a second dose. Meanwhile, a civic official said they had around 15,000 doses to sustain the drive on Tuesday. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said Mumbai is expected to receive some doses in the next few days. The BMC said the number of private hospitals administering vaccines has jumped to 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-records-highest-no-of-jabs-in-1-day-chaos-at-jj-due-to-app-snag/articleshow/83128919.cms||---
---||Chennai||Why Covid-19 battle is harder in Tamil Nadu’s villages than in its cities||Athimathayannur village near Karamadai in rural Coimbatore is the latest to join the list of villages that have barred outsiders. The reason: 34 of the 59 people who were tested in this village turned Covid positive two days ago. The health department has now collected samples from more than 100 villagers and the results are awaited. As TN’s cities, such as Chennai and Coimbatore show signs of Covid numbers stabilising, there seems to be no let-up in cases in rural areas. Instead, there is a spike in the villages. There are scores of villagers recording high number of Covid-19 cases every day in several pockets of Anaimalai, Pollachi, Karamadai, Annur and Sulur in Coimbatore district. Even tribal pockets are not spared. The lack of adequate health infrastructure in these pockets has led to the disease spreading fast, with severe cases having to move to cities to get the required medical attention. Last week, more than 50 people tested positive in Thalavadi, a village nestled in the Western Ghats in Erode. "A fortnight ago, my father tested positive. We had to take him to Sathyamangalam which is 60km from here. As his condition worsened, we had to take him to Erode, another 100km away to get him an oxygen-equipped bed,’’ says P Mahendran, a grocery store owner in Thalavadi. When they don’t get beds or the condition of patient turns critical, they bring them to Coimbatore. But the challenge is absence of transportation. Mahendran says many of his neighbours and relatives took their Covid-infected family members on motorcycles, mini trucks or autoricksshaws to Sathyamangalam. As cases surge in other rural districts, patients flock the urban centres for treatment which are sometimes more than 100km away. Salem hospitals see a steady flow of patients from far flung districts like Villupuram and Kallakurichi, besides Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri. "Covid positive villagers have no option but to come to Salem for treatment," said Salem collector S Karmegam. Right now government hospitals in rural areas either have a handful or no beds that are oxygen-equipped. Despite huge spike in the locality, Mettupalayam government hospital has only 10 oxyden-equipped beds and two ICU beds.  Government hospitals in Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri and Namakkal, which continue to report high caseloads, are no different. On May 1, the four urban centres in TN — Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy — accounted for 8,325 Covid cases, nearly 43% of the total cases in the state. But on May 31, cases in these districts have come down to 7,898, only 28.2 % of total cases in TN, a sign of growth in Covid-19 cases in rural and semi-urban districts.  Within Madurai, Coimbatore and Trichy, there was a spike in rural cases. A fortnight ago, rural areas of Coimbatore district accounted for only 30% of the total cases, but now it is about 45%. Compared to the first Covid-19 wave in Madurai, where the city recorded 80% of the cases, the second wave is seeing a rise in cases in the villages, with more than 40% of the new cases being reported from the rural areas. Except for Coimbatore and Tirupur, districts that have high positivity rate are those which are largely rural. This trend was not unique to Tamil Nadu and is seen across the country in the second wave. Health experts point out that the return of a large number of people ahead of the lockdown to villages was one of the reasons for the spread.  Less awareness and non-adherence to safety protocols such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing the aggravated the situation.  "Reluctance to visit hospitals at an early stage, which resulted in spread by the time individuals were tested, made it worse,’’ said a senior health officer. Delayed testing too led to the rural spike. A 39-year-old farm worker from Payampattu village in Villupuram district said that his 30-something neighbour succumbed to the disease because of delay in testing and treatment. All the districts that showed a high case fatality rate — Vellore, Kanyakumari, Tenkasi and Dindigul were largely rural. As the virus has slowly spread to villages, considered safer at the beginning of the pandemic, health officials face a tougher challenge. In the Nilgiris, for instance, the health officials had a tough time locating tribals who tested positive. After the results came, the tribals fled the hamlets fearing hospitalisation. Deputy director of health services, Madurai, Dr K V Arjun Kumar said they were conducting door-to-door surveys in villages to identify and treat cases early. More than a dozen mini Covid care centres have been set up in Madurai. State health minister Ma Subramanian said the government was aware of the need to step up rural health infrastructure and has been doing it on a war footing. In Trichy’s Manapparai hospital has been equipped with 70 oxygen beds. But, the pandemic-hit villages still have a long, difficult Covid battle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-covid-19-battle-is-harder-in-tns-villages-than-in-its-cities/articleshow/83131170.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: New water source discovered near Nainital to recharge supply||NAINITAL: A new water source has been discovered at Balia Nala near Nainital, which experts believe can be used to supply around 8 million litres per day (MLD) of water to the lake town, relieving the load on Naini Lake, which is currently the town’s only source of drinking water. Officials involved in study of the area believe the water oozing out from Balia Nala is causing recurrent landslides in the area. If the water is tapped, the landslides will reduce and Nainital’s water problem will also be solved. A committee has been formed comprising scientists from IIT Roorkee, officials of Jal Sansthan, Peyjal Nigam, irrigation department as well as the municipal corporation to chalk out plans to access and supply water from Balia Nala. Executive engineer of Nainital irrigation division, HC Singh told TOI that first, a tube well would be built at the site to tap the water. “The future course of action will be decided based on the committee’s recommendations,” Singh added. Estimates based on geophysical investigations suggest that around 6-8 MLD of water can be extracted from the source. “At present, around 8 MLD water is supplied to Nainital town every day from the Naini Lake. This dependence has, over the years, caused the water level in the lake to deplete severely, especially in summers. The lake is heavily dependent on rains for its recharge and therefore in summers, the water level depletes to zero or even negative. We expect the new source will completely or at least significantly reduce our dependence on the lake,” Singh further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-water-source-discovered-near-nainital-could-replace-naini-lake-as-main-source-of-drinking-water/articleshow/83122638.cms||Prashant Jha

Details are also being collected by an NGO to build a case for vaccination based on UN refugee documents. Sabber Kyaw Min, Rohingya Human Rights Initiative director, said that while ration was distributed in the camps during the first wave last year, no such distribution was taking place during the current lockdown. “It was leading to immense hardship among the community. The distribution has now been started by UNHCR,” he added. Without any of the listed documents, refugees from Myanmar, Afghanistan and Pakistan are ineligible for vaccines and facing social stigma in addition to economic woes. Min said their efforts to use refugee documents hadn’t been successful yet. The number of Burmese refugees has increased after the recent political upheaval in Myanmar. Ruata Fanai, chairman of Chin Refugee Committee, said UNHCR had also started ration distribution among this community. “It has scheduled a meeting this week to find out a plan for vaccination based on UNHCR documents.” Most of the 3,200 registered Chin refugees work as factory and domestic workers, and labourers, and live in Vikaspuri, Budhela, Hastsal, Chanakya Place and Uttam Nagar. “No one is able to find any work,” Fanai said. The city has around 800-900 registered Rohingya refugees, mostly in camps along the Yamuna in Madanpur Khadar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/distribution-of-ration-to-refugees-resumes-vax-data-being-compiled-too/articleshow/83127131.cms||Paras Singh
---||Delhi||Central govt’s order puts paid to Delhi RWAs’ plans to vaccinate all||NEW DELHI: Many residents welfare associations (RWAs) in the city had either started or were planning to start Covid vaccination camps in association with private hospitals after informing the district administrations. But the Centre’s recent order permits near-to-home camps by RWA offices, group housing societies, community centres and schools/colleges to vaccinate only senior citizens and differently abled people. Members of societies and RWAs argued that these camps sought to avoid the rush at government centres, cover maximum people in an area and simplify things for those unable to find CoWin slots due to the limited supply of jabs at government hospitals. Around 60 RWAs have now written to the lieutenant governor to allow these camps for the welfare of residents. TimesViewThe policy of allowing only senior citizens and disabled could be driven by vaccine shortage exigencies, but it lacks common sense. Applying a scheme to only one part of the family is unlikely to satisfy either the residents or benefit the hospitals. Maybe a rethink is required here.In a letter issued by the additional secretary of the Union health ministry on May 29, it has been specified that apart from four options — government set-ups, private hospitals, workplaces and near-to-home camps for senior citizens and differently abled — no other option under the National Covid Vaccination Programme will be allowed, said Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjiwan Vihar RWA. “The development has raised our concern as the vaccination drive had already started in our colony and received great response from locals,” she said. The RWAs, in their joint letter to the LG, said most of the residents were even willing to pay for their staff, including guards, household workers, drivers and garbage collectors, to ensure safety of all. “Many RWAs have prepared a list of 18 years+ beneficiaries with details through Google forms. Associations are ready to arrange space, support staff, vaccine storage facility and other requirements. If free vaccination camps are being held in government schools, paid camps can be held in residential colonies in association with RWAs,” said Anil Sahai, secretary of Geetanjali Enclave RWA. The RWAs that were carrying the drive till Friday have put it on hold and are waiting for a clarification from the district magistrate’s office. “While we are ready to make all arrangements, including ambulance and health workers, we will need a nod from the LG’s office,” said Makhija. Household workers usually find it difficult to go out to a vaccination centre or clinic and are often not motivated enough to do so, said Sushmita Bakshi, president of Nizamuddin East Colony Association. “They also find it tough to understand the registration process on CoWin. With RWAs conducting vaccination camps, their employers explain the importance of vaccination and are often ready to bear the expenses,” she pointed out. The RWAs also have several volunteers to help those coming for the vaccination, Bakshi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-govts-order-puts-paid-to-rwas-plans-to-vaccinate-all/articleshow/83127098.cms||Vibha Sharma

This move will provide an opportunity for vaccination at the workplace to over 60,000 employees of various stakeholders working at the Delhi airport.For this, DIAL has tied up with Manipal Hospital to inoculate the frontline airport staff of airlines, cargo business, ground handling agencies, air traffic control, etc. It has set up the vaccination centre at the arrival forecourt of T1. All staff who are over 18 years of age can register themselves and take the Covishield vaccination at this centre.Aviation has been identified as a priority sector and those working at airports a priority group for vaccination. “The Delhi airport and its staff have been on the forefront ever since the outbreak of the pandemic. All airport staff, including that of stakeholders, worked round-the-clock to ensure the airport remains operational. They provided much-needed support to the country and the countrymen during the lockdown. We are launching the vaccination drive for these Covid warriors who are part of the airport’s ecosystem to save them from this dreaded virus. We hope this will help them in protecting themselves and their families from this pandemic,” said CEO-DIAL Videh Kumar Jaipuriar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/igi-starts-vax-centre-for-staff/articleshow/83127078.cms||---

---||India||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan writes to 11 non-BJP CMs to press Centre on jabs||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday wrote to 11 CMs of non-BJP ruled states seeking a united effort to press the Centre to procure Covid-19 vaccines and ensure free universal vaccination. “Wrote to 11 CMs in the spirit of cooperative federalism. Quite unfortunate that Centre absolves itself of its duty to procure vaccines, ensure free universal vaccination. United effort to jointly pursue our genuine demand is the need of the hour, so that Centre acts immediately,” Vijayan tweeted. In his letter, the CM said statements to the effect that the responsibility to provide vaccine entirely falls within the realm of the states defy the very basis of the cooperative federal system. “The Centre should procure vaccine needed by the states and distribute them free of cost.This will be more cost effective as well,” Vijayan said. He said vaccine manufacturing companies are engaged in looking for financial gains by exploiting the scarce-supply situation and foreign pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to enter into agreement with the states for procuring vaccines. Noting that India has public sector pharmaceutical companies which are capable of taking up vaccine production, the CM said the government should take necessary steps to ensure that intellectual property rights and patent laws and conventions do not stand in the way of manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine, which should have the status of a public good. “Options like compulsory licensing should be explored by the Union government,” he said. Vijayan said if the burden of procuring vaccine is left to fall entirely or even substantially on the states, their fiscal situation will be in dire straits. “Fiscal strength of the states is an essential part of a healthy federal setup. If the states’ finances are hamstrung, federalism itself will be weakened and this will not augur well for a democratic polity like ours. Further, this will impede the efforts for early building of herd immunity,” he said. Vijayan said herd immunity will be effective only when a substantial section of the population is vaccinated. As on date, only 3.1 per cent of the people have been administered two doses of COVID-19 vaccine, he said. Attacking the Centre’s alleged stand that the states should resort to their own measures to procure Covid-19 vaccine, the CM said, “At this juncture, when the nation is passing through the second surge, it is quite unfortunate that there appears to be an attempt by the Centre to absolve itself of its bounden duty to provide adequate supply to the states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-writes-to-11-non-bjp-cms-to-press-centre-on-jabs/articleshow/83132516.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra poll panel gives go-ahead for BMC polls in February 2022||MUMBAI: The state election commission (SEC) on Monday gave a go-ahead to hold civic polls in the city in February 2022 and asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the civic body with the largest budget in the country, to begin preparations keeping in mind Covid-19 protocols. The SEC has asked the BMC to begin work on delimitation of electoral wards based on population estimates or rectification of wards redrawn in 2017. There are 227 electoral wards, of which 97 are currently represented by the Shiv Sena, 83 by the BJP and 30 by the Congress. Demarcation of wards based on population should ideally take into account the latest Census data. However, no fresh data since the 2011 Census is available to carry out a full-fledged delimitation exercise. Hence, it is likely that a rectification process to redraw some ward boundaries will be carried out. This will ensure that population sizes of different wards do not vary sharply and discrepancies in voter lists are ironed out. The SEC has also asked BMC to prepare new voter lists based on those used for the 2019 state assembly elections. “We had a discussion with the BMC officials and we have asked them to begin preparation for the BMC elections as per schedule in February 2022. We have asked them to begin work on the delimitation process but since the last delimitation exercise was done as per the 2011 census and no new census data is available, a rectification process may be carried out,” said state election commissioner UPS Madan. Madan said Covid-19 protocols will have to be followed during “preparations” and “fresh instructions” will be issued “as and when required based on the Covid pandemic situation,” Madan said. An SEC official said while a lottery for reserving wards for women and SC/STs will be undertaken later this year, the quota for OBCs will be affected by the Supreme Court order which rejected the state’s review petition on upholding reservation to OBCs in the local bodies. One of the fallouts of the Covid crisis is that officials have been directed to make arrangements to increase the number of polling booths. There are around 7,900 designated booths now which the BMC may need to increase to 11,500 in order to reduce crowding. Each booth is meant for 1,400-1,500 voters. "We have also been asked to ensure Covid appropriate norms are followed while making arrangements in the due process," said the official. Prior to the 2017 BMC elections, on October 3, 2016, a lottery for reservations was held for the 227 wards and the delimitation of wards was officially announced. While 50% among these are reserved for women candidates, there is parallel reservation for scheduled caste, scheduled tribe and OBC category candidates among women in these seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-poll-panel-gives-go-ahead-for-bmc-polls-in-feb-2022/articleshow/83128991.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A delegation of farmers on Monday met the SDO of Pusad Dr Vyenkat Rathod and submitted a memorandum of demands addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar. The farmers have demanded instructions to Nafed for enhancing the procurement limit to 17 quintal per acre. Last year, Nafed had procured jowar at Rs2,600 per quintal from the farmers. “There is a procurement centre in Pusad tehsil of Yavatmal and the procurement has started at Rs2,600 per quintal with the maximum limit of three quintals per acre. As a matter of fact, the farmers produce 17-20 quintals per acre. They will have to sell the remaining quantity to private traders who have slashed the rate to Rs1,500-Rs1,600 per quintal,” said Jadhav. Jadhav pointed out that farmers are not given any assistance for crop damages caused during the last season. “They are not even paid any money from the crop insurance scheme. The farmers are trapped in debt and also facing acute financial crisis. The annual annewari of Yavatmal has been finalized at 47 paise and hence the farmers are entitled for government schemes and financial assistance,” he said. Jadhav warned that farmers’ suicides may escalate, so government should order Nafed to procure the entire jowar produce from farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shetkari-sanghatana-demands-more-procurement-of-jowar-per-acre/articleshow/83127109.cms||---

The total number of Covid-19 cases in the state now stands at 5,78,351 while the death toll stands at 3,281. As many as 3,464 patients were declared recovered on Monday, taking the total number of recoveries in the state to 5,40,986. Telangana’s case fatality rate, however, has remained steady at 0.56 per cent while the recovery rate improved to 93.5%, having dropped to around 82 per cent a month back. The number of active containment zones across the state stood at 97 of which 13 are within Hyderabad. Following the state health department’s directive to PHCs, increasing their testing targets, as many as 87,110 samples were tested across the state.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Civic works stuck as cement mixing plants grind to a halt||SECUNDERABAD: The ongoing state lockdown coupled with the departure of migrant labourers has led to a halt in operations at several ready-mix concrete plants. As a result, several civil projects within GHMC’s Secunderabad zone have slowed down to a snail’s pace.Furthermore, the oncoming monsoon which is estimated to enter Telangana in another week has raised concern among civic body officials over the completion of sanctioned projects. These projects, in which, concrete mix is an essential component, include building of retaining walls on open drains and culverts, strengthening of bund segments of open drains, widening and laying of CC roads in by-lanes, and other projects like building walkways in parks and compound walls. Many of these operations have ground to a halt. It is estimated that works worth around ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore have stalled within the GHMC’s Secunderabad zone. For instance, in Malkajgiri circle, most open drains (nalas) are widened in preparation for monsoon. For this, building retaining walls is an essential requirement to prevent the overflowing of sewage water into adjacent habitations while bund areas also need to built up after de-silting operations. “Similar works were supposed to have been started by the civic body in other circles too,” a senior GHMC engineering offical from Malkajgiri circle told TOI. While civic body officials had completed the tender process for civil works proposed by the engineering wing some months ago, operations have stalled as a result of the severity of the pandemic within Greater Hyderabad and its peripheral areas. Moreover, not many contractors had come forward due to a shortage of workers, according to another GHMC official. A shortage of concrete mixers which contractors used to procure from various ready-mix plants. Most workers at such plants belong to states such as Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Maharashtra, of whom many have left for their native places. “Soon after the Telangana government announced the first phase of the lockdown last month, several migrant workers feared a continuation of the same for months and left the city. As a result, ready-mix plants are now facing a severe shortage of manpower and have no other option but to shut down operations,” Chandra Reddy, an owner a one such readymix plant, told TOI. He added that due to the halt in operations, large-scale supply of concrete mix to civic bodies and housing projects had been affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/civic-works-stuck-as-cement-mixing-plants-grind-to-a-halt/articleshow/83127576.cms||---

The medical records department at the hospital is reeling under the infection for a while now. “Unfortunately most of the staff in MRD are infected with Covid, including the medical records officer. A staffer has also succumbed to Covid-19. We are facing tough time,” said Dr M Raja Rao, superintendent Gandhi Hospital. As most severe cases reach the Gandhi Hospital which is the nodal centre for Covid-19 treatment, they are usually brought in a state of panic. In such an emergency situation, whatever name or details the person accompanying the patient gives is taken for records. Many a times these records are not crossed checked with relevant documents at the time of admission and final death certificates issued have small errors like the wrong spelling of a person’s name or an incorrect date of birth, said an official. This can cause problems for family members who want to claim life insurance and other such policies, explained a hospital source. “My cousin brother was brought here from Warangal in early April but passed away after a week of treatment at Gandhi Hospital. We managed to get a certificate after a lot of delay but the name is wrongly mentioned as Srikanth. We have requested for a correction and are still waiting for it,” said a victim’s relative. “Some cases are pending because of the small corrections as requested by their family members for their insurance and other reasons. However, I have instructed that all death reports be uploaded to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) without any delay,” Dr Raja Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pleas-for-death-cert-pile-up-as-records-dept-hit-by-virus/articleshow/83127530.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: GHMC switches over to digital tokens for vaccination||HYDERABAD: After receiving several complaints about ineligible people getting vaccine jabs in the ongoing drive for potential ‘superspreaders’, civic officials, who were earlier distributing vaccination tokens by visiting stalls, are now enrolling them in the state government’s vaccine portal and generating e-coupons. The pilot project commenced in GHMC Serilingampally circle and Khairatabad zone and officials said they plan to extend the initiative to other parts of the city too. “In this method, after identifying the beneficiaries by visiting their outlets and shortlisting the beneficiaries, their details are entered on the portal following which the beneficiaries receive text messages that serve as ecoupons for free vaccination. This e-coupon will be checked by GHMC staff at the vaccination centre,” an official said. The drive was held successfully across the city for the third consecutive day. On Monday, 24,897 persons were administered the vaccine in GHMC limits. The civic body has decided to vaccinate around three lakh people as part of the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-switches-over-to-digital-tokens-for-vax/articleshow/83127514.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Students going abroad throng vax sites, BMC waives quota||MUMBAI: Three designated vaccination centres for students headed overseas opened on Monday with hundreds vying for the barely 50-odd doses reserved at each of the facilities. As crowds swelled, the centres were eventually told to ignore the quota and vaccinate everyone who turned up. By the end of the day, 987 students had got the shot.  BMC plans to send a proposal to the Centre to relax the 12-week gap between two Covishield doses for such students since many may be scheduled to fly out by early August. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said they have verbally communicated to the Centre and plan to send a proposal in the next few days. “We want to be able to give the second doses before students have to leave the country to join their courses,” he said. Kakani said the proposal to the Centre will be finalised by Wednesday. Minimum duration between doses could be brought down to 28-42 days, but it’s being deliberated upon. A parent pointed out that government will have to relax the gap of 84 days since the US does not offer Covishield. “If our students fly out without the second dose, they will not be fully vaccinated. Some of the universities have asked students to be fully vaccinated before they join college.”  BMC had announced that three centres–RN Cooper in Juhu, Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli and Rajawadi in Ghatkopar–would be vaccinating 50 students each. Many students along with parents queued up 4am onwards. All three centres had at least 400-500 people standing in queue. Many coming from outside Mumbai were turned away. Neha Boradia, a parent from Powai, said over 400 had landed at Rajawadi. “Some were waiting since 4 am, some claimed they would return at midnight to join the queue for Tuesday," she said, adding that she left in 15 minutes worried she would get infected in the crowd. Another parent said students with admission documents should be allowed access at any centre, be it public or private. Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of Rajawadi Hospital, said 325 students received shots there. Cooper vaccinated 327. Cabinet minister Aditya Thackeray had estimated that beneficiaries from the city would be around 2,000 before the drive. BMC has tweeted that there would be 500 slots for students on Tuesday, including 200 each at Cooper and Kasturba and 100 in Rajawadi. NMMC has also decided on a similar drive on June 1 for students going abroad. It will be at Meenatai Thackeray Hospital, Nerul through walk-in registrations from 9am to 5pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-going-abroad-throng-vax-sites-bmc-waives-quota/articleshow/83129004.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: No terrain too rough for Seethakka to reach out to Covid-hit tribals||HYDERABAD: After covering nearly 500 villages and distributing food and other essentials in Mulug district in the first wave of Covid-19, local MLA Danasari Anasuya is again striding into remote thandas and villages to hand over relief material to tribals affected by the second wave of pandemic. Many of these far-flung villages and thands in Mulug assembly constituency do not have access and Anasuya, popular as Seethakka, an alias she assumed when was underground, reaches out to the tribals on bullock carts, motorbikes and some times on foot to hand over the ration material. A month shy of turning 50, the Congress MLA distributed provisions to 250 families on Sunday. Apart from essential items like rice, dal, salt, vegetables and oil, she also gives packaged food, fruits and blankets to the tribals. Seethakka says she knows the difficulties of the tribals — she herself belongs to the Koya community. The MLA sets out early in the day along with her team to reach the farthest corners of the ST reserved constituency, which shares borders with Chhattisgarh. Apart from carrying ration kits and essentials, she also packs provisions for Covidaffected patients and families. “I am ready to take any risk to make them happy,” she says. Last year, pictures of the MLA carrying the essentials herself and walking in the hot sun and rocky terrain had gone viral. Seethakka travels by car but once into the forest areas, she falls back on a two-wheeler by riding pillion. The real test begins when there is no pathway to reach the remote tribal hamlets. Some of the hamlets can be reached only on a bullock cart. And she gets into the bullock cart with provisions, stops by at the hamlets, talks to the tribal families and hands them over the ration. “I am worried about the welfare of tribals. Food and shelter are important. They should be taken care of in all the circumstances,” she told TOI. Seethakka’s mother herself has been infected with coronavirus. “With a heavy heart, I go to serve my people. The moment I see my mom in the evening, I feel relaxed,” she tweeted on Monday after completing her journey to a tribal village. On Monday, she went to Dharmaram village in Marripeda mandal where a girl was allegedly raped and killed. “I went there to console the family. It was a horrendous crime. The culprit should be given the harshest punishment,” the MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-terrain-too-rough-for-seethakka-to-reach-out-to-covid-hit-tribals/articleshow/83127672.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||Ineligible people being vaccinated instead of us, claim ‘super spreaders’||Hyderabad: While the state government has identified over 7.5 lakh potential ‘super-spreaders’ from the city and launched a special Covid-19 vaccination drive for them, many allege that their names are being replaced by ineligible people at the vaccination centres. Some even claim that, despite falling under one of the nine categories — as listed by the government — they are being denied tokens to take the jab. Said P Dharmesh, a kirana shop owner from Banjara Hills: “Though I was issued a token by the GHMC staff after a physical inspection of my shop, when I turned up at the centre, I was told I couldn’t get the shot. While waiting there, I saw at least two people from my area who I know do not fall under any of the nine categories, walk in and get the vaccine for free.” Dharmesh said he was denied the jab for not carrying his Aadhaar card. “When the civic staff visited the shop, they took all details (including Aadhaar), asked us to carry just the token to the centre. Nothing was said about Aadhaar,” he claimed. Some also claimed that they are being denied the shot, for not carrying additional documents to the vaccination centre despite being issued tokens. Incidentally, GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar had issued memos to two senior officials last week after some people, who were not eligible, were administered the shot. The memos, seeking an explanation from the officers, were served soon after chief secretary Somesh Kumar visited a vaccination centre in Goshamahal circle. The government had instructed GHMC to identify people and distribute tokens to only those belonging to nine categories — vendors in rythu bazaars, fruit, vegetable and flower markets, kirana shops, LPG delivery staff, fair price shop dealers, petrol pump workers, auto and cab drivers, liquor shops and non-vegetarian markets. Yet, in some divisions, it was also found that several ineligible people got vaccinated as Sanitary Field Supervisors (SFAs) distributed the tokens without verifying IDs. While officials admitted to a certain level of misuse happening on ground, they said they were insisting on double-checking people’s credentials only to plug this gap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ineligible-people-being-vaccinated-instead-of-us-claim-super-spreaders/articleshow/83127390.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Ludhiana||Policing runs in their blood||Ludhiana: From serving the British Imperial Police to securing borders of Baramulla district during 1962 India-China war to fighting terrorism —policing is not just a profession or a passion, but an inheritance for Kapurs.Ludhiana deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Ashwani Kapur, 55, who was recently inducted into IPS, is the third generation in police services. His grandfather, Lala Diwan Chand Kapur of Gujranwala, Pakistan, was 6 feet tall and a football player. He had joined the police force as a constable and went on to head the Fingerprint Bureau during the British Raj. He was posted at police headquarters in Phillaur at the rank of inspector. On June 3, 1931, he was awarded the British Imperial Service Medal. In 1932, he took premature retirement and died at the age of 57 in 1936. Lala Diwan Chand Kapur’s four sons—Roshan Lal, Mohan Lal, Heera Lal and Harbans Lal—were also in police services. Heera Lal also wrote several articles for newspapers on ‘Films incite criminality in youth’, ‘Human rights and custodial reforms’ and ‘Rising crime and personal protection’, among others. “Roshan Lal was the eldest brother of my father Harbans Lal. He retired as the superintendent of police. My uncle Mohan Lal worked in the executive clerical line in Punjab Police and Heera Lal retired as an assistant commissioner of police from Delhi in 1989. My father Harbans Lal joined Punjab Police in 1952 as an assistant sub-inspector and in 1980s he was inducted into IPS. Due to a heart stroke, he died in 1990 when he was a deputy superintendent of police with Chandigarh Intelligence Wing. All of them were awarded with the President’s Police Medals for meritorious services,” said Ashwani. In early years, Harbans Lal served at Punjab Raj Bhavan from 1959 to 1962. “In 1962, when the India-China war started, the Border Security Force (BSF) was not founded then. Several Punjab Police personnel were sent to Jammu & Kashmir back then for securing the borders. My father was also sent there and he was posted at Baramulla till 1969, after which he returned to Punjab. In 1974, he was promoted as a deputy superintendent of police. Till his death, he worked at the Chandigarh Intelligence Wing,” he added. When his father died, Ashwani was practising at the Punjab and Haryana high court. He left the practice and joined Punjab Police as an assistant sub-inspector. Soon thereafter, he faced and encountered terrorists. “On February 25, 1992, when I was posted at Fatehgarh Sahib, we received information that two terrorists had kidnapped a man in Dadiana village and were demanding a ransom from the family. While searching for him, we reached field areas where the accused were hiding in a room. Before we could act, the terrorists started firing from inside. We fought back and called more forces, including the Army and the CRPF. The cross-firing went on from 4pm to 8am and both the terrorists were killed. Following this, in 1993, I was promoted as deputy superintendent of police,” he said. Ashwani received the President’s Police Medal for meritorious services in 2010, DGP Disc in December 2010, another DGP Disc in June 2011, CM’s medal for devotion to duty in 2012 and CM’s medal for community policing in 2016. In 2018, Ashwani joined as Ludhiana DCP. On June 27, 2019, the DIG (Ludhiana range) and the commissioner of police were out of the city when violence broke out in Ludhiana Central Jail. The jail superintendent, too, was on leave. Ashwani, who was the senior-most official in the commissionerate, handled the situation. “I had never thought of joining the police services as my passion was to pursue a career in law. But destiny had other plans. Maybe, policing is in my blood,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/policing-runs-in-their-blood/articleshow/83125323.cms||Payal Dhawan

Rangarajan said they took the decision to keep the temple closed for another 10 days following a request from the police. Appealing to devotees, he said: “We cannot take the risk in the lockdown and allow the devotees. The GO issued by the government says devotees should not be allowed to worship during the lockdown period...” Earlier, Rangarajan, in a short video which went viral, hadsaid devotees will be allowed between 6 am and 12 noon from June 1.After a few minutes, another video shot by the priest was released to clear doubts among the devotees on the temple’s opening.

---||Chennai||‘Traceability an aid to authorities, not a conclusive proof’||As the government and messaging platforms like WhatsApp lock horns over tracing messages, professor V Kamakoti of IIT-Madras, who had suggested cryptographic methods to enable traceability without breaking encryption, says his methods could help strike a balance between privacy and security. In 2019, after a PIL was filed before it, the Madras high court directed the academician to submit a report on the methods one can use to trace originator information on WhatsApp. The computer science professor, who is also a member of the national security advisory board, proposed two methods. While the original PIL now stands transferred to the Supreme Court, and is awaiting hearing, Sindhu Hariharan speaks to the professor about his solutions to the ongoing standoff and WhatsApp’s response to his ideas. Q: What is your take on the present standoff between messaging platforms like WhatsApp and the government? Why is traceability important?Privacy is important. But in today’s world, we also need a fair balance between privacy and security. There should be some accountability for any wrongdoing that happens via messaging platforms. Traceability will be an aid to investigating authorities and not a conclusive proof. It may also help act as deterrence to crime and fake news on digital platforms. Q: What are the methods you suggested in your technical report earlier in 2019 to solve this issue?I had suggested two solutions for the WhatsApp message originator traceability problem. The first one involved adding originator information with every message i.e. WhatsApp encrypts both the message and its originator details and each recipient decrypts both the message and its originator. Thus, all recipients know who is the originator of that forwarded message. In the second method, the various users receiving the said message will not know who is the originator of the message as that information is encrypted with a public key and the corresponding private key will be with WhatsApp. Q: Which method do you recommend now given the digital landscape and circumstances?In my opinion, WhatsApp can consider implementing the second proposal to comply with government regulations. In this method, the final control lies with WhatsApp. They can assess the government request and decide to offer support to the government on an issue. Further, this also doesn’t intend to trace the full path of the message and all users involved and identifying the originator is a "pass" feature rather than a "trace" feature.Q: Activists and WhatsApp had responded earlier that changing the architecture of messaging apps to enable traceability will undermine the right to privacy and freedom of speech. What is your response to this?Any platform of such a scale can be potentially used for the spread of rumours or fake news. The suggestions I have given strike a balance between privacy and national security. It’s not that WhatsApp has to give the information demanded by the government at any cost; they will have their own checks and balances and appellate procedures. Today, WhatsApp has many attributes to its messages since the time it launched originally, for instance, they show messages that have been forwarded many times. As I said earlier, when a message passes from A to B to C to D, I am only interested in knowing the origin and the intention is not to trace its path.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/traceability-an-aid-to-authorities-not-a-conclusive-proof/articleshow/83131174.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Officials convert government school into Covid care unit for tribals of Nallamala forest||HYDERABAD: After the tribal hamlets in Nallamala forests started reporting positive cases, forest staff of Amrabad tiger reserve along with a corporate hospital have transformed a government residential school in the area into an isolation centre. After scouting for a place to set up the centre for a week, hospital authorities and forest staff have decided to convert Telangana Social Welfare Girls Residential School and College into an isolation centre, where people with Covid-19 are now admitted to. The decision to set up an isolation centre came after it surfaced that locals, especially those residing in tribal hamlets of the forest, were isolating in the fields due to lack of facilities. “The idea was to help both tribals and non-tribals who reside in the area get access to a decent isolation centre. Those who live in the forest reside in small, thatched huts were isolating themselves in the fields if they contracted infection. While the idea to set up the isolation centre was first floated by the corporate hospital, the forest staff along with a few local representatives pitched in to get permissions from the health department,” said Amrabad forest divisional officer (FDO) Rohit Gopidi. The district medical and health office responded immediately and extended the required help, the FDO said. The facility currently has 30 beds and three emergency beds, is manned by two doctors and four nurses who work in shifts. “The main objective of setting up this unit is to break the chain. Most people who reside in the forests are not fully aware of the infection and therefore end up spreading the virus to family members and other locals. To create awareness and encourage people to isolate themselves at this centre, we have also started making announcements in the villages,” said Padmini Reddy, a local representative who has been working with Apollo Hospitals to make arrangements at the isolation centre. Besides beds, all basic necessities, including food and medicines, are also provided at the centre, she added. Forest staff and local representatives had faced initial setbacks with people not willing to work as support staff for cleaning and other activities. However, officials said that Achampet MLA G Balraj had been instrumental in mobilising staff for the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-convert-govt-school-into-covid-care-unit-for-tribals-of-nallamala-forest/articleshow/83127656.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Ahmedabad||Gold shines bright with 11% price surge in 2 months||Ahmedabad: Continuing its gradual rally, gold prices edged higher on Monday to settle at Rs 50,700 per 10 gram. Riding on global factors, gold has delivered a handsome 11% return over a two-month period since March. Yellow metal price surged by Rs 4,900 against Rs 45,800 per 10 gram on March 31 in the Ahmedabad market, according to estimates by bullion traders.“Even though gold price shot up in line with rise in Covid-19 cases as India saw the second wave of infections, the reasons for gold price surge had more to do with global cues. As the US dollar depreciated, investors moved towards gold as safe-haven investments. This coupled with rising uncertainty over slow-paced recovery of global economy caused prices to surge,” said Haresh Acharya, director of India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA).With surge in prices, jewellery demand has taken a major hit. Jewellers blame it on the cancellation and deferment of weddings, which usually drive sale in big volumes. “Steadily rising gold prices have surely deterred buyers. Moreover, with the second wave of Covid infections, overall spending has gone down drastically as people set aside emergency funds for health purposes,” said a jeweller from the city.Overall, the demand has sustained due to demand for gold coins and bars. “Bullion demand has helped jewellers sustain since the time businesses resumed. The saving grace is that most people who had placed orders for wedding jewellery have not cancelled. This has prevented revenue loss for jewellers,” said Jigar Soni, president of Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).Analysts suggest that gold prices are bound to go up in the days to come. As a result, demand is expected to take a further hit. While demand for physical gold took a hit, the uptakes for the latest tranche of sovereign gold bonds were significantly good, said industry players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gold-shines-bright-with-11-price-surge-in-2-months/articleshow/83129030.cms||Niyati Parikh

NGT also pulled up HMDA and irrigation department for not coming up with independent reports on Ameenpur lake. It directed the chief secretary as well as PCB to file reports on implementation of its orders. Some of the lakes were found to be dry due to obstructions caused in inlets and outlets and due to improper maintenance of them, NGT said PCB, in its report submitted to NGT on May 26, said that it inspected19 water bodies, including Ameenpur Pedda Cheruvu, to ascertain the water quality and the source of contamination. NGT observed in the judgment that the photograph produced along with the report submitted by PCB show the manner in which the water bodies were maintained and their pathetic conditions. “Of 19 water bodies, seven water bodies are in dry condition as there is no water, three are falling under class-B,” as per the CPCB water quality criteria. Of the remaining nine water bodies, eight were in Class D and one in Class E category. “During the inspection of these water bodies, it was observed that the contamination was due to discharge of sewage or surface run-off from the nearby residential areas. No industrial discharges were observed,” PCB added in the report. PCB had earlier issued notices to the local bodies of nine water bodies directing them to take necessary measures and submit action plan to control pollution. Ameenpur Pedda Cheruvu analysis report had indicated that its water quality was Class D category. During inspection, it was observed that domestic sewage from nearby residential area was entering the lake. “There are 10 industries located in the upstream of Ameenpur Pedda Cheruvu. The board reviewed these industries and directions were issued not to discharge any waste water outside the premises. They were also directed to provide IP cameras to monitor discharges into drains,” PCB said. The board had also issued notice to the Ameenpur municipality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngt-orders-hmda-and-pcb-to-protect-ameenpur-lake/articleshow/83129026.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Notification for council pro tem chairman likely on June 3||HYDERABAD: With the MLC elections getting delayed and both chairman and deputy chairman of the state legislative council retiring in a couple of days, the government has shifted its focus on appointing apro tem chairman till the new chairman is elected. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan is expected to issue a notification on June 3 naming the pro tem chairman of the elders’ house on the recommendations of the leader of the house. Generally, pro tem speaker for the assembly is appointed immediately after the general elections to administer oath to the newly-elected members and till the speaker is appointed. But in the legislative council, such a situation never arises as only a few members get retired in a year. However, appointment of pro tem or interim chairman is unavoidable now as both chairman Gutta Sukhender Reddy and deputy chairman Neti Vidyasagar are retiring on June 3 along with four members and the Election Commission of India postponing the elections due to the pandemic. Officials said a senior member will be appointed as pro tem chairman. Going by the seniority, two MLCs — D Rajeshwar Rao and V Bhoopal Reddy — are the senior most, serving their third term. While Rajeshwar Rao was nominated under the governor quota, Bhoopal Reddy was elected to the council under the local authority constituency of Medak. Both are serving as MLCs since 2007. “A senior member being nominated as pro tem chairman is only a convention but it is not mandatory. If the government wants, it can pick up another senior member also. For instance, AIMIM MLA Mumtaz Ahmad Khan acted as pro tem speaker in the present assembly. If the government wants, present AIMIM MLC Syed Aminul Hasan Jafri, who has been member of the council since 2010, can be nominated as pro tem chairman,” an official said. Meanwhile, the ECI may release a notification for the MLC polls in the last week of June and hold elections in mid-July. Sources in the government said the ECI had postponed bypolls in various states due to a surge in Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/notification-for-council-pro-tem-chairman-likely-on-june-3/articleshow/83129034.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: May ends with max Maharashtra toll, daily deaths lowest since April 5||MUMBAI: The number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra dropped by a third from April to May, but the number of deaths went up 87% in the same period. A similar picture emerged in Mumbai, where cases in May were a fourth of the April cases, but deaths increased by 17%. Due to tests almost halving in the state and Mumbai on Sunday, Maharashtra added 15,077 cases, the lowest since March 15 (15,051), and 184 fatalities. The toll was the lowest in 56 days since April 5 (155). This took the total caseload to 57.5 lakh cases and 95,344 deaths. In Mumbai, 666 cases were reported on Sunday, the lowest daily caseload since February 23 (643). Deaths too dropped below 30 (29). The case tally and toll in Maharashtra were 17.8 lakh and 14,164 deaths, respectively, in April as compared to 11.4 lakh cases and 26,531 deaths in May. The state has added 6,207 previous deaths to the cumulative toll in May, making it the deadliest month so far since the outbreak of the pandemic. “Although the cases are on the decline in most parts of the state, deaths will continue to be high for the next few days,” said an official. For Mumbai, the tally drastically dropped from 2.3 lakh in April to 57,371 cases in May. Deaths increased from 1,479 in April to 1,723 in May. “The increase could be explained by the fact that deaths increase a fortnight or 21 days after the peak in the number of cases,” said a BMC official. The ebbing of the second wave is obvious in big cities like Mumbai and Pune but in parts of Maharashtra the infection is still raging. “There are at least 10 districts in Maharashtra where spread is still happening at a worrisome pace. Hence, we need to unlock slowly and in a decentralised manner,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid. “We have to vaccinate the maximum number of people in the next three months as the third wave, if it occurs at all, could occur between September and October,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/may-ends-with-max-maharashtra-toll-daily-deaths-lowest-since-apr-5/articleshow/83129055.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Fungus hits mild Covid cases too||VADODARA: It is widely accepted that Covid-19 patients who have had long ICU stays, were heavily dependent on oxygen or had severe infection are vulnerable to mucormycosis, the deadly fungal infection. But a study of 100 mucormycosis patients has revealed that even those who had mild Covid and whose oxygen dependence was low also developed the fungal infection.  The study has also reveals that overuse of steroids can lead to MM while smokers are more prone in Gujarat that counts for highest number of MM cases in the country.  “My observation of 100 patients has revealed a strong association of mucormycosis with steroids. Of the 100 patients, 99 patients had taken steroids. There was just one patient who had not taken steroid during Covid-19 treatment and yet developed MM,” said Vadodara-based infectious disease specialist Dr Hiten Kareliya.  Eight patients who were already suffering from autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and mixed connective tissue disease were already taking steroids for their illness since long.  “Their steroids were not discontinued during Covid-19 treatment and later they developed mucormycosis,” he said.  Of the 100 black fungus cases, 81 were male while 19 were female. A majority of these patients – 75 % - were from outside Vadodara while 25 % were from the city.  A majority of these patients – 59 – did not require ICU care during Covid while 16 patients required ICU care for only three days. There were 25 patients who were critical and required to be in ICU for more than three days for their Covid treatment.  “Even the oxygen requirement of 57 out of 100 patients was less than 4 litres while 25 were on BI-PAP and 18 required more than four litres oxygen during Covid treatment. This means even those who had mild Covid got mucormycosis,” said Kareliya. Of the 100 patients analysed, 73 were smokers while 27 were non-smokers. The number of tobacco chewers and those who did not chew tobacco was the same while a majority of patients – 85 – were non-alcoholic.  “It reveals that smokers are not just prone to Covid-19, which is well-established but even prone to this infection. It can be because of poor oral hygiene or poor respiratory functioning,” he said.  A majority of patients had diabetes as associated illness. Of the 36 % patients who had diabetes, 19 % also had high blood pressure along with diabetes. Interestingly, the rare fungal infection has not hit too young and too old as a majority of mucormycosis patients were seen in middle age group. Of the 100 patients, there were 11 patients in 30-40 age group, 38 patients in 40-50 age group, 33 in 50-60 age group, 22 in 60-70 age group and just 6 above 70 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fungus-hits-mild-covid-cases-too/articleshow/83125529.cms||Prashant Rupera

Weathermen said the city and its suburbs may receive late evening or night showers due to convection between June 2 and 5. This is due to the convection in the interior regions of Tamil Nadu, supported by moisture laden easterly winds, during the evenings and the activity shifting to coastal areas later in the night. While the IMD has revised the onset date for southwest monsoon to June 3, private forecasters and bloggers said strong westerlies, one of the conditions for the monsoon, may set in by June 7. The IMD has forecast maximum and minimum temperatures to hover at 40C and 28C for the next 48 hours with the city and the suburbs mostly having cloudy skies, meteorologists at the agency said Chennai and surrounding areas may receive spells between June 3 and 5.  “There are good chances of rainfall in Chennai in the second half of the week. This will be mostly convective rain which may start in the interiors of the state and move to the coastal areas in the night,” said N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD. “This is because westerlies are not strong. So the land heats up during the day and by afternoon the easterlies enter bringing the moisture. This results in convection,” he added. On Sunday night, the city received surprise showers. Chennai, which is part of the rain shadow region, does not receive rain from the southwest monsoon but gets rain when there is a break in the wet spell in other parts of the country. The city receives an average 434.1mm rainfall in the June-September season, which is 31% of its annual rainfall. Meteorologists said at present several atmospheric conditions required for the onset of the monsoon has not been met. Puviarasan said westerlies should be at 4.5km altitude, rainfall is needed in 60% of the stations in Kerala for two days and the outgoing longwave radiation should be low. Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather said after the cyclones on the west and east coast, there is no significant system or trigger to pull the monsoon winds. Further, a cyclonic circulation over east central Arabian sea is also restricting the westerlies. The private forecaster, however, announced the arrival of monsoon on May 30. However, some IMD experts said it may be a shallow onset of southwest monsoon on June 3. Weather blogger Pradeep John said Chennai may cross its average rainfall for June. “Between June 2 and 5, Chennai has the possibility of good spells,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-likely-to-get-a-wet-spell-this-week/articleshow/83131191.cms||U Tejonmayam

Based on a specific tip-off, an ATS team raided a house in Bharuch on Sunday and nabbed Sheikh, who is originally from Juhapura in Ahmedabad, they said. Sheikh was staying in a house at Al Moqam Society on Dahegam Road in Bharuch from where he was nabbed, said an officer. During preliminary questioning at ATS headquarters here, Sheikh confessed to having looted Rs 1.5 crore from a person in the Santej area of Ahmedabad around eight months ago with the help of accomplices, the officer said. In his primary questioning, Sheikh told ATS officers that he had concealed some weapons at his house in Juhapura. After this ATS officers searched his home and found a pistol, a country-made gun and two knives from the glovebox of his scooter. Sheikh has been active in the world of crime since 2013 and is named as an accused in more than 25 complaints at various police stations of the state, including in Ahmedabad, the officer said. He was mainly involved in crimes like extortion, loot, assault and criminal intimidation, he said. The last complaint against him in Ahmedabad was lodged in April when he threatened to kidnap a citizen’s son and demanded Rs 50 lakh in extortion money. Of the over 25 FIRs against Sheikh, he was shown as “wanted” in some of them, the ATS officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ats-nabs-man-wanted-for-25-felonies/articleshow/83129048.cms||---

This is in contrast to 2020 when rentals plunged due to an exodus, sparking landlords to offer discounts to woo tenants. A year on, apartments complexes have largely not been vacated and with demand for housing between January and April up, residential rentals have risen to pre-Covid levels. Stakeholders say residential rentals have not fallen since September 2020 unlike commercial rentals that have been hit following business establishments shutting down. An online real estate portal has found that the movement of people from Chennai to their hometowns has marginally impacted the occupancy rate in the city, but the situation is better on the outskirts. TNRERA registered real estate agent Mohan Kartha said many people were holding on to their apartments. “They do not know the environment of prospective new flats and neighbours. I know of cases where tenants are re-negotiating with landlords to continue in the same flat,” he said. K Chandrasekar of a city based property management services firm, which maintains about 500 rental properties in the city including about 100 on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), said the demand for 2 BHK flats remains stable. “Not even one property that we maintain got vacated on OMR and the situation is same in the rest of Chennai. The reason being tenants believe the current lockdown is a temporary phenomenon,” he added. In 2020, OMR was the worst hit in the residential rental segment. Online real estate portal NoBroker.com said the average movement to the city outskirts was 18% early this year and rose to 35% in April. “Family tenants moved to the outskirts for larger living spaces and less crowded environment, after things returned to normalcy in February-March,” it said in an email.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/residential-rentals-still-high-in-city-suburbs/articleshow/83131190.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

It is tradition of the BJP to arrange meeting with national president if any MLA or MP or former MLA and MP join the party. Unlike the regular practice to speak to media after the formal meeting, reportedly both parties remained silent. Though the meeting was to happen by evening, it got delayed as Chugh, who was in Punjab, reached Delhi late. Clarity on Eatala’s resignation from TRS was expected after this meeting. The former health minister was to meet home minister Amit Shah, sources said he had video call meeting with him as later was not well.

Kalawad MLA Pravin Musadiya had sought to know in the recent session of the Gujarat assembly how many manual scavengers are yet to be rehabilitated. He also asked by when the government intended to complete rehabilitation of manual scavengers. In his written reply, the social justice and empowerment minister said there are no manual scavengers left to be rehabilitated. Parshottam Vaghela of the voluntary organisation Manav Garima said that as recently as February-March this year, his organization identified around 50 spots in Ahmedabad city where people continue to defecate in the open. “Safai (sanitation) workers are forced to manually pick up human excreta from these spots on a daily basis,”said Vaghela, whose organisation has been working with sanitation workers across the state. “The right to a dignified life is being denied to safai workers. Manual scavenging is also a caste issue. The government should stop hiding the figures on manual scavenging in the state,” said Kantilal Parmar, a dalit activist. He asked that if as the government claims in the assembly all manual scavengers have been rehabilitated, why are forms for rehabilitation are still being distributed. Those working for the rights of safai workers contend that civic bodies have outsourced the task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-manual-scavengers-left-to-rehabilitate-govt/articleshow/83129059.cms||---

In between his online classes, Arvind Kumar realised that his grandmother needed someone to carry essentials to her because she was home bound in the midst of the pandemic. He soon realised that, like his grandmother, there were hundreds of seniors who needed help. So started Cycle Soldiers, a band of students and young professionals who are spending time in between online classes and work-from-home, to carry essentials to people on cycles. Arvind had posted a request on social media platforms for volunteers. Within days, an army of youth was ready. Be it medicines, grocery, vegetable or any other need, you just have to call any of the eight volunteers and tell them where to buy from and how much is needed. The rest is taken care of at no extra charge. Permissions have been secured from all police stations in south Kolkata. “The officers-in-charge were helpful. We started with the Rabindra Sarobar police station where OC Jayanta Mukherjee was the first to give us permission,” said Arvind. Some key faces in the team are Yashvardhan Gupta, an undergraduate from University of London, Noumaan Anwer, an undergraduate from St Stephen’s College, Delhi, Vishalakshi and Rajdeep Mantha masters in art design and technology and LLB student respectively, T K Radhakrishnan from ITC Infotech and author-poet SS Kumar. Senior citizens like Charu and Vilas Pradhan of Jodhpur Park are totally dependent on Cycle Soldiers. So is the case of Nirlay Kundu who lives in Boston who often requests the team to deliver essentials to his elderly father in Dhakuria. Another lady on Parashar Road gets her essentials delivered through the team and the orders are placed from London by her son. It started with homoeopathic medicines for SK Roy, another elderly at Jodhpur Park but has recently graduated to a gas cylinder. “We are not saying no to anything and at any time of the day,” said Arvind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kolkatas-cycle-army-delivers-essentials-to-the-elderly/articleshow/83132535.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Dehradun||Committee set up to identify land for international airport between Doon & Haridwar||Dehradun: Uttarakhand tourism minister Satpal Maharaj on Monday set up a committee to scout for land to construct an international airport between Dehradun and Haridwar. Besides, the state tourism secretary was asked to examine the procedures required for the construction of an international airport and the district magistrates of Dehradun and Haridwar were directed to help the department in the process. According to rules, the proposal to construct an airport is forwarded to the aviation department after zeroing in on the land. The committee set up by Maharaj will find out the land space to develop a five-and-a-half-kilometre-wide airstrip for the international airport. “Tourists from all across the world will be able to directly land in the state when Uttarakhand gets its international airport. This will not just boost tourism but also create employment opportunities for people in the state,” said Maharaj. He added that several big passenger airlines will be operated from the proposed international airport and the officials have been asked to look for land keeping this in mind. Notably, Uttarakhand has already received in-principle approval to develop the Pant Nagar and Jolly Grant (Dehradun) airports as international airports. According to the initial plan of the government, the runway length of the Doon airport would be increased to 2,765 metre in the first phase. When that happens, Airbus A-321 and A-320 planes would be able to take off from the airport with 172-to-180 passengers on board. In the second phase, the government plans to increase the runway length to 3,500 metres. At present, the airport has a 2,140-metre-long runway which allows airlines to carry 130-to-140 passengers per flight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/committee-set-up-to-identify-land-for-international-airport-between-doon-haridwar/articleshow/83123010.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘97% +ve minors in Ahmednagar asymptomatic’||NASHIK/PUNE: Sachin Solat, a member of Ahmednagar’s paediatric task force, said there was nothing alarming about almost 10,000 children and teenagers testing positive for Covid in the district in May. “The number was around 11.5% of the total Covid cases registered in the month in the district, which is acceptable. There is nothing unusual about it,” he said. According to Solat, over 96-97% of the children and teenagers infected in May were asymptomatic. Citing an example, he said that of the 350 Covid patients presently undergoing treatment at the civil hospital, only six were aged under 18. Solat said the bulk of the cases were from the rural parts of the district, where the infection had spread. “These children and teenagers have got the infection from elders in the family who were initially infected. We must remember that there are hundreds of joint families staying together in one home, where the infection can spread easily,” he said. District collector Rajendra Bhosale said the coronavirus in the second wave of the pandemic was extremely virulent. “But a section of teenagers who got infected were lax in not following the restrictions imposed by the district administration and moved around in public places without adhering to Covid safety protocols,” he added. State paediatric task force member Dr Aarti Kinikar said the panel had taken note of the high number of children and teenagers getting infected in Ahmednagar and was working to ascertain the reasons behind it. “The task force will meet on Tuesday in Mumbai, where the Ahmednagar issue will be discussed,” she added. The authorities were unable to immediately provide data of children and teenagers who got infected in the district in March and April. Ahmednagar city NCP MLA Sangram Jagtap said the administration had started preparing for the third wave keeping children in mind. “The administration has started meeting paediatricians in the district to discuss what needs to be done in cases where children get infected in large numbers. We have also requested private hospitals in the district to start preparing Covid wards for children. The administration will soon inform the state government about its requirement of medicines and other things to treat children infected by Covid,” he added.

In Dahod district, family members of an elderly man and a woman, who were no more, got messages regarding their vaccination on Sunday. The first incident came to light when Naresh Desai, son of Natwarlal Desai received a message that his father had been vaccinated. Natwarlal Desai had passed away at an age of 93 years in 2011 when Covid-19 was unheard of. He would have been a centenarian now. It also came to light that Natwarlal Desai’s name did not figure in the list of persons vaccinated on Monday. The message was also received at around 8.50 am on Sunday even before the vaccination began. A probe was ordered in the matter and primary details have revealed that the PAN number of the deceased man was same as his granddaughter who had been vaccinated. “We have sought details from the income tax department in this regard,” said Dahod district collector Vijay Kharadi. But the officials are still looking into how the deceased man’s name figured in the message instead of his granddaughter’s. They expect to get more details by Tuesday. The second such case came to light in Limdi town of Zalod taluka in the district. Here Nipul Sharma received a message on Sunday that his mother Madhu Sharma (72) was vaccinated. The woman had died on April 15 due to a heart attack. Nipul said that his mother received the first dose of the vaccine on March 2 and had the heart attack around the time for the second dose. “She died and never took the second dose,” he said adding that he inquired with the local government hospital and was told that no vaccination was happening there. Dahod chief district health officer Dr R D Pahadiya said that the officials were looking into the Limdi incident. “We are trying to ascertain the reason behind the message,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dead-citizens-vaccinated-in-dahod/articleshow/83125609.cms||---

Despite being attacked, the cop, Ashwani, showed exemplary courage and with the help of his two colleagues stopped the criminals from fleeing. The duo had committed four snatchings in the area on Monday morning, thereby creating panic among people. DCP Usha Rangnani said two snatched mobile phones and the bike used in the crime have been seized. Ashwani underwent surgery and is recuperating in a hospital. The policemen had been informed on a wireless flash about bike-borne snatchers being spotted on road number 51. Ashwani was accompanied by constable Mukesh and ASI Mangeram.

The accused, Mohammed Sameer and Shiva, are aged 19 and involved in dozens of cases. In another operation, a 24-year-old man was found running a snatching racket along with his mother, cousin and brother-in-law. The accused, Ashish, and his friend, Arjun, had carried out nine snatchings in Dwarka south and north, five of them being committed within the past four days. The two used to say “goodbye” to their victims after snatching their gold chains. “Ashish has 45 cases registered against him. His friend, who is currently absconding, has been booked under MCOCA and has 105 cases lodged against him,” said DCP Santosh Meena. The accused was nabbed by a team comprising inspector Rakesh Dadwal, SI Mukesh and head constable Praveen Yadav. After visiting the crime spots, the cops collected footage from over 50 CCTV cameras. The bike was found stolen from Rohini. Ashish was arrested from his cousin’s house in Dabri. A receiver of stolen goods, Avinash, was arrested too. Police have found bills that suggest the accused had mortgaged the jewellery with a pawn shop. Ashish revealed that he had handed over 4-5 snatched chains to his cousin, Kajal, and 2-3 chains to his mother, Gajna. They are also absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cop-sustains-multiple-fractures-but-helps-nab-2-armed-snatchers/articleshow/83127319.cms||---

The situation is favourable to resume economic activities. Though chances of cases and weekly TPR increasing slightly cannot be ruled out when markets reopen, it will be no major cause for worry. However, all should continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1st-time-during-pandemic-more-recoveries-than-new-cases-on-all-days-of-month/articleshow/83125647.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Dharmarajan, who is an RSS activist, and the driver are the complainants in the case. Satheesh had also reportedly told the police that he had booked the room for Dharmarajan and his driver as per the direction from the BJP district leadership. He had also claimed that he did not have much details as he had taken charge as the office secretary only a couple of months ago, the SIT sources said. Police have arrested Sahalesh, Saphalesh, Sajith and Bipindas in connection with the stabbing of the BJP activist Hiran in front of a vaccination centre at Thrithallur. The stabbing incident was allegedly a sequel to the disputes among the local cadres of the BJP in that area against the backdrop of the highway heist case. One of the groups had reportedly alleged through social media platforms that some of the BJP leaders were involved in the highway heist case, which was contested by the rival group members in the party. In another development, the BJP OBC Morcha state vice-president Rishi Palpu has filed a police complaint that the party district general secretary K R Hari has abused him and threatened to finish him. In his complaint given to the SHO of the West police station, Palpu alleged that his Facebook posts related to the highway heist case seemed to have provoked Hari. Palpu said he had not referred to anyone personally in his social media post but has only condemned the murder attempt taken place in connection with the heist case. BJP state president K Surendran has suspended Palpu from the primary membership of the party for “violating the party discipline”, pending inquiry. Meanwhile, Hari denied the allegations levelled by Palpu and alleged that the latter was raking up these issues as he has been suspended from the party. Hari, however, conceded that he had spoken to Palpu, asking him to withdraw his ‘anti-party’ posts as per the directive of the state leadership, but had never threatened him. The SIT has launched raids in the house of some of the arrested accused in the case as part of the efforts to recover the money looted in the highway heist case. Police had already recovered about Rs 1.5 crore. As per reports, Rs 3.5 crore was looted in the incident that happened near Kodakara on April 3, a couple of days before the assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/highway-heist-case-triggers-schism-in-bjp-thrissur-unit/articleshow/83125650.cms||T Ramavarman

Nearly 26 districts meet the positivity criterion, but only 20 meet both criteria and are eligible for relaxation. Of the 26 districts, where the positivity is lower than 10%, five to six districts have a bed occupancy higher than 40%. According to latest guidelines, corporations with a population of more than 10 lakh will be considered a different unit than respective district and corporations with smaller population will be considered part of the district. So, even though Panvel civic body has a positivity rate of 6% it cannot be considered for relaxation as it comes under Raigad district, which has weekly positivity of 15%. Panvel civic chief Sudhakar Deshmukh is yet to decide on relaxation of lockdown restrictions from June 1As of now, there are no changes in timings for shops selling essentials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/within-mumbai-metropolitan-region-only-panvel-may-not-see-curbs-eased/articleshow/83129096.cms||---
---||Surat||Drug shortage hits black fungus operations in Surat||SURAT: Unavailability of Liposomal Amphotericin B injections, the only treatment for black fungus infection, has delayed the number of surgeries of mucormycosis patients in the city in the last couple of weeks. Doctors said that although the distribution of injections from the SMIMER Hospital has streamlined, the numbers being distributed is not enough to cater to all patients. Officials at SMIMER confirmed that they receive requests for around 1,000-1,500 injections daily from private hospitals but are not able to provide even 10% of it. Liposomal amphotericin-B is used after surgeries to prevent the fungus from spreading to other organs. A trust-run hospital in the city has even started procuring injections from the manufacturer directly, but since the demand from across the country is high, the company’s production capacity is not able to meet the orders. “Earlier we used to perform six to eight surgeries daily but now it is around three to four because the injections are not easily available,” said ENT surgeon Dr Bhavin Patel of a trust-run hospital near Sumul Dairy. He added that those patients waiting for the surgery are administered oral medications to prolong the procedures. “The oral medication helps us in buying more time and during that period the patient is always under observation in case any complications arise,” he said. Private practitioners have also observed that in the last week, new patients of fungal infection have reduced as people prefer going to New Civil Hospital or SMIMER Hospital. “The first preference for Liposomal stock that comes from the government is given to patients admitted at NCH and SMIMER Hospital, so a greater number of surgeries can be conducted there,” said an oculoplastic surgeon who conducts surgeries at one of the two government hospitals in the city. Doctors at NCH have been conducting eight to 10 surgeries daily while at SMIMER Hospital, 35 surgeries have been conducted so far. Medicine should be protected from light Liposomal amphotericin B injection comes in powdered form and is administered through intravenous. Once the medicine is mixed in the intravenous bottle, the bottle and the infusion set must be protected from light so that no photosynthesis reaction takes place. Doctors cover the bottle and set either with black paper or aluminium foil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/drug-shortage-hits-black-fungus-operations/articleshow/83125669.cms||Jay Pachchigar

They have also sought steps to ensure that Muslim community gets 100% benefit it deserves. The letter also urged the government to reveal the truth on the false propaganda going on in the social media that the government was spending crores of rupees for paying salaries of madrassa teachers. They also urged legal action against those engaging in communal propaganda. The signatories of the letter included Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal, Syed Muhammed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal, president of Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulema, Kanthapuram AP Aboobacker Musaliyar, general secretary of All India Sunni Jem Iyyathul Ulema, Thodiyur Muhammed Kunji Moulavi, general secretary of Dakshina Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema, among others. The leaders asked the government to come up with a white paper on the benefits provided by the government to various sections. It pointed out that the then central government had constituted the Sachar committee to submit recommendations to bring Muslim community, which was backward, to the mainstream. Based on the report, the government had announced some programmes and had asked state to implement them. “On the basis of the report, VS Achuthanandan government had appointed a committee and it had announced some projects to overcome the backwardness of the community on the lines of Sachar committee report. But, successive governments made changes in scholarship scheme aimed to resolve the backwardness of Muslim community through the 80:20 ratio and included 20% of beneficiaries from Latin Catholic and converted Christian community,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/move-legally-to-overcome-hc-order-cm-urged/articleshow/83125662.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Students with fee dues likely to miss out on virtual classes||HYDERABAD: Students with fee dues from the previous academic year will most likely miss out on attending virtual classes as many schools are only admitting a student to the next class if the dues are cleared. Students are not added to WhatsApp groups and schools are making it clear that they won’t be allowed into virtual classrooms. “Dear Parents, unless you clear the pending fee dues of the previous year, your child will not be admitted to the next class. A gentle reminder to all those who have to pay the pending school fee. The school office is opened from 6.45 am to 9.30 am on all working days. Kindly do the needful and render your cooperation,” read a message from a school in Secunderabad. Another private school in Himayat Nagar sent out a similar message asking parents to clear fee dues immediately. “Do the needful so that the expenses such as taxes, staff salaries, and utility bills can be cleared. Kindly avail of the online facility for payment of fees,” read the message from the school. Parents said that class WhatsApp groups, which had over 40 students during the last academic year, now hardly has 20 to 25 members as class teachers were instructed only to add those who cleared fee into these groups. Teachers too confirmed that they have received oral instructions asking them to include only those students without fee dues into the nominal rolls of the next class. “We were asked not to add defaulters to groups or allow them into virtual classrooms,” said a teacher of class 8, working at a corporate school in the city. According to teachers, about 30% of students of corporate schools and 50% of students in budget schools are yet to clear last year’s fee. The members of the Telangana Recognised School Management Association (TRSMA) also made it clear that they are not going to promote fee defaulters. “Irrespective of whether a student attended online classes or not, they will have to clear the fee. Only then, they will be promoted or issued a transfer certificate. If needed, we are even ready to organise bridge course for a couple of months to brush up last year’s concepts,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, TRSMA, adding that about 80% of students studying budget schools have fee dues from last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-with-fee-dues-may-miss-out-on-virtual-classes/articleshow/83135265.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Some others are planning to donate raw food material to LMC’s community kitchen so that it can be used to feed the poor. A group of senior citizens from Jankipuram Extension, who organize ‘bhandaras’ (community feast) on Bada Mangal every year, have decided to collobrate with a non-government organization to distribute lunch packs among the people. “Every year, we set up a small stall to distribute poori sabzi as prasad on first Bada Mangal. Last year, we were not able to do so due to Covid restrictions. This year, we are planning to distribute about 800 lunch packs in slum areas near our locality. We will adhere to all Covid-19 safety precautions,” said Akshar Parmar (41) of Jankipuram Extension. Harshit Lamba (29) and his mother, residents of Sector K in Aliganj, are also planning to distribute khichdi and distribute it to the destitutes under a flyover near Purania crossing. “Covid-19 should not be an excuse for not feeding the hungry. We will follow Covid-19 safety norms and serve lunch packs to as many people as possible,” said Harshit. Akshit Amber of Niralanagar said, “My family has been organizing community feast on Bada Mangal every year. It may not be possible for us this year due to restrictions so we have decided to contribute at LMC community kitchen. We hope our contribution will reach the poor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/this-yr-food-packs-to-replace-bhandara/articleshow/83129091.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Nagpur||‘Lockdown-like curbs did help in controlling Covid resurgence’||Nagpur: Covid-19 cases started increasing from the second week of February, prompting the district administrations across Vidarbha to impose curbs to prevent the situation from worsening. Lockdown-like restrictions were put in place in April when the second wave of the pandemic reached the peak. After almost two months, the cases and deaths are declining in Vidarbha. Nagpur guardian minister Nitin Raut, who used to constantly review the situation, told TOI that the restrictions helped to contain the spread of the disease and ease burden on the health machinery. He also appreciated efforts taken by the administration, cooperation from people and dedicated work of the healthcare workers. “The same kind of efforts are needed in the coming days too to prevent any increase in cases in the district,” he said.“Lockdown-like restrictions definitely helped in reducing cases in Vidarbha as the second wave spike was unusual. But, it’s not the only way to keep the virus away,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde and added, “it must be accompanied by vaccination for optimum effect.”“In Nagpur, NMC should take forward the good initiative of spot testing in markets and public places,” said a senior member of Nagpur’s Covid task force and added, “Hopefully, vaccination will improve from June 1.” BJP MLA from East Nagpur, Krishna Khopde, gave entire credit to people who, he said, followed all the guidelines. “Lockdown-like restrictions in May helped in containing the spread,” he said. At the same time, Khopde condemned the state government’s decision to extend the restrictions till June 15 “without any proper planning”. “People are supporting the restrictions but the government should plan for opening all shops with limited timings, and provide foodgrains and financial support etc to needy people who are daily wagers,” he said.Veteran Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat is in favour of continuing with the restrictions in some or the other way. “Instead of nationwide or statewide restrictions, micro containment is the need of the hour. Villages or localities in city where cases are detected in large numbers should be isolated for two weeks,” he said.Restrictions helped a lot in containing cases, said Dr Shyamsundar Nikam, civil surgeon of Amravati where Covid resurgence started in early February. “When we locked the city and banned entry from nearby villages, the cases reduced significantly. But, as soon as we opened up, cases started coming from rural parts,” he said. According to Dr Nikam, efficient contact tracing, increased testing and strict adherence to wearing mask will be the key while unlocking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lockdown-like-curbs-did-help-in-controlling-covid-resurgence/articleshow/83125659.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Health staff dead, kin await Rs 50 lakh grant||LUCKNOW: Government school teacher Preeti lost her husband Sri Saran Srivastava (52), chief pharmacist at the Chinhat community health centre, to Covid-19 on January 4 this year. The tragedy was not only devastating but led to the family income dropping by 60%. Their son could not take admission to the US-based university he got selected for. Now, the single mother also has a mounting home loan, but her applications for compensation have not received any concrete answers so far. Many healthcare worker families like Preeti’s, which have lost their bread winners to Covid-19, complain that they are struggling to get the promised Rs 50 lakh insurance under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package for corona warriors. Preeti claimed that their own house is still under construction and authorities have asked them to vacate the accommodation allotted to her husband. “Forget about compensation, even pension has not started despite several reminders. Besides loan EMIs, paying children’s education fees has become difficult. We have shelved the plan to send our son for medical education to the US,” she added. According to healthcare workers’ associations, Covid-19 has snuffed out lives of 149 healthcare workers so far: these are 75 doctors, 40 NHM-outsourced employees, 20 permanent staff including nurses, and 14 pharmacists. Among these, eight doctors, six NHM workers and six nurses are from Lucknow. Director general medical health Dr DS Negi said, “The names of 48 healthcare workers who died of Covid-19 have been sent to the central government for Rs 50 lakh compensation. Of these, nine have got it, five applications were rejected and others are pending. UP Employees’ Joint Council vice-president Suneel Yadav claimed that some applications were rejected because the healthcare worker was not deployed in a Covid hospital. “The infection risk is equal in all hospitals because Covid cases came for treatment everywhere, hence all victims who got infected at workplaces must be compensated,” he said. President of National Child Health Programme Employee Union Dr Anand Singh, said Dr Mahendra Pal, posted at a Covid hospital in Moradabad, died on September 2, 2020. The Moradabad CMO had forwarded the compensation application, but the insurance company rejected it saying he had turned Covid negative by the time of death.” KGMU staff nurse Asha Dhusia died of Covid-19 on September 21. Her son Shubham said, “My mother got infected during duty in the triage area. Since then, we have been making rounds of offices for compensation and pension with no conclusive answer.” Lab technician at Balu Adda CHC Ritesh Raj Mishra (28), collected samples for tests without taking any leave from March 2020 to April 2021, till he got infected and died on April 18. “He was felicitated by the mayor and police for devotion, but we are in the dark about compensation,” said Ritesh’s father Jitendra Mishra. A paediatrician at a government hospital died last June. Hospital chief Dr Sudha Verma said, “All documents were submitted last year itself, but we don’t know why approval is still pending.” UP Provincial Medical Services Association general secretary Dr Amit Singh said that authorities should ensure that the victim’s family doesn’t have to run around for compensation or other benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/health-staff-dead-kin-await-rs-50l-grant/articleshow/83129104.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan no. 2 in vaccination drive, 90% senior citizens covered||JAIPUR: The state stood second in the country in terms of vaccinating its population (17.9%) while Gujarat topped the list with 18.7% as of May 29. Cowin.gov.in figures say as of May 29, the state had inoculated 1.69 crore people — 1.38 crore first dose and 31.09 lakh second dose. The percentage of those who have received both the doses stood at 5%, which according to the experts is very less in achieving any safety cover.  Officials claimed that the state has achieved 90% of its target in vaccinating people aged 60 years and above.  The website said the state inoculated 56.22 lakh senior citizens against a target of around 60 lakh. Badi Kalan gram panchayat in Nagaur was one among the many in the state to have achieved 100% target in inoculating 60 years age group while 70-80 per cent in 45 years and above age group. In the country’s second and third-biggest districts —Barmer and Jaisalmer — where a health worker has to travel for over 100km, 50% target in the age group of 60 years age group has been achieved. “Geography is the biggest challenge than anything else here. In some cases, the difference between the two villages is as far as 20km. Still, a major effort by Asha workers, ANM and anganwadi workers has helped in achieving the target to a large extent,” said Ashish Modi, DM Jaisalmer. In absolute numbers, Jaipur is leading with 11 lakh vaccinations among many other state capitals including Ahmedabad (4.66 lakh), Patna (9.63 lakh), Bengaluru Urban (3.98 Lakh), Bhopal (8.16 Lakh) etc. The districts which have pulled down the graph are Pratapgarh, Sirohi, Jalore and Sawai Madhopur. Several vaccination camps in these districts have reported zero turnouts due to the barrage of misinformation for the vaccines. Dhariyawad tehsil in Pratapgarh, which lost is MLA Gautam Lal Meena, has recorded around 40% of its total aggregate target in 45-60 and 60 years above age group. Siddhart Mahajan, secretary of the health and family welfare department, said the state was leading in the country in terms of vaccinating its people till April. “Supply chain issues have delayed the vaccination process in the state. The delay has drastically affected the speed,” said Mahajan. The erratic supply has been the biggest bottleneck in providing a safety cover to the state. Mahajan said the state had followed a multi-layered strategy which helped in breaking the stereotype, myths and encouraged people to take it. “From roping in elected representatives to local influencers and from tracking the persons from voters list to integrated campaign has helped achieved this aim,” said Mahajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-no-2-in-vax-drive-90-senior-citizens-covered/articleshow/83127347.cms||Shoeb Khan

---||Chandigarh||Innovative water hole saves deer from killer dogs||Chandigarh: As the Shivalik foothills behind the Tricity see the drying waterholes turn into killing fields for packs of domesticated dogs from neighbouring villages, an innovative solution from a Chandigarh resident has provided a lifeline for beleaguered wild animals and birds to quench their thirst without suffering the risks of mauling, maiming and wanton slaughter, especially of fawns and young ones. At Karaundiawallah village in Mohali, a water hole constructed on top of the ridgeline with two linked storage tanks of 1,000 litre each has drawn in herds of Sambar deer, a pregnant Barking deer and the Indian Crested porcupine with young ones. The creatures come deep in the night when dogs have retreated to their village shelters. Their visits to the water hole have been recorded by a day-and-night US-made Bushnell trail camera installed by the farm owner, Narbir Singh Kahlon, a member of the state wildlife advisory boards of Punjab and Chandigarh. Kahlon has installed a pump at his own expense to replenish the storage tanks at the ridge heights from water resources at his farm situated in the valley below. “Seeing that dog packs were massacring wild mammal species when the latter came down to drink water in the valley rivulets, I set up a water hole on the ridge where dogs are unable to hunt effectively due to precipitous terrain that suits the deer better. We also chase away dog packs from the area. The dogs do not come at night to the water hole on the ridge due to fear of a predator like a roving leopard and they also prefer to retreat to the safety of village homes. I ensure that the water hole is filled up every evening. About 500 litre of water are consumed by the wild creatures every night at the water hole. The wild creatures have adjusted their timings to drink from the water hole by avoiding the periods during the day when dogs are hyper-active,” Kahlon told the TOI. The water model adopted by Kahlon can be replicated by the forest and wildlife departments of Punjab and Haryana in the foothills as the drought-hit jungles are facing receding water holes and increasing slush areas, which work to the advantage of marauding dog packs as the deer get stuck while trying to evade these unnatural killers from the villages. Siswan dam, which forms a part of the notified Siswan Community Reserve, and the bone-dry Perch dam have witnessed an abnormally high number of Sambar kills by dogs this spring and summer due to paucity of rainfall. A drying water hole behind the Mansa Devi temple in Saketri witnessed a similar scale of killings by dogs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/innovative-water-hole-saves-deer-from-killer-dogs/articleshow/83117025.cms||---

The notification issued by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) says all non-essential shops (standalone and not inside shopping centres and malls) shall be allowed to operate between 7am and 2pm.A section of traders says this includes shops in market places also. Their logic is each shop is an individual building and not part of any shopping centre or mall. However, a senior NMC official contacted by TOI said a standalone shop strictly means a shop establishment which is located in isolation. This can be a lane or any other locality where there are no other shops of non-essential items in a row.Ashwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), said according to his interpretation of the order, any shop in the market area which is not part of any shopping complex or mall can be standalone. However, the NMC official TOI talked to cited examples of areas like Sadar, Sitabuldi or Dharampeth where such shops are in a row, saying these cannot be treated as standalone.Dipen Agrawal, president of Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT), also insisted that shops in market area are standalone.BC Bhartia, president of Confederation of All India Traders (VAIT), said the order clearly excludes shops in market places. Standalone means those shops in small lanes or in residential areas where no other similar establishment is there. Bhartia said the order also unduly favours e-commerce companies by allowing deliveries of non-essentials till 11pm. “Even brick and mortar shops should be allowed home delivery of items,” he said.Traders said the government should have come up with clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) for running the shops. In the absence of any SOPs, traders have decided to have their own norms. Though, they will ensure that both owners and the staff gets vaccinated. There will be no entry without mask.Mehadia said the government should come up with norms on limit on entry of people on the basis of size of shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/traders-confused-over-standalone-clause/articleshow/83125677.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Chennai||HC: Govt staff cannot seek legal refuge in DA cases||Madurai: The legal protection to a public servant, against prosecution for a deed done as part of his official duty, will not be available if he faces a case of disproportionate assets, the Madras high court has said.Declining to come to the rescue of Dhandapani, who faced a case while working as assistant director in the rural development department in Trichy district and with an investigation pending against him, a division bench of Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice S Ananthi upheld a single judge’s order in this regard.The judges held that the complaint is not with regard to discharge of Dhandapani’s official duties, but related to his disproportionate assets. The judges said: “Therefore, Section 17(A) of Prevention of Corruption Act is not applicable to the appellant. The single judge has rightly observed this point. The appellant has to face the criminal case.”Section 17 A of the Prevention of the Corruption Act insulates a public servant against prosecution, and says: “No police officer shall conduct any enquiry or inquiry or investigation into any offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant under this Act, where the alleged offence is relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken by such public servant in discharge of his official functions or duties, without the previous approval…”It was Dhandapani’s case that he and his brother Kandasamy had a property dispute, due to which the latter’s friend P Karthik kept filing complaints against him before various authorities.Karthik had also moved the high court in 2019 seeking DVAC to probe into his complaints. While dismissing his petition, the court directed Karthik to submit a complaint before the director of rural development and panchayat raj at Chennai.On receipt of the complaint, it was forwarded to district collector who appointed an inquiry officer. Subsequently, the DVAC also issued proceedings on March 9, 2020, directing Dhandapani to furnish certain particulars. Challenging the proceedings, Dhandapani filed a petition before the Madurai bench of the high court.He argued that the DVAC had commenced preliminary inquiry proceedings, that too while the inquiry conducted by the inquiry officer was at the final stage. Also, as per Section 17(A) of Prevention of Corruption Act, it is invalid and illegal to conduct an inquiry against a government servant by DVAC without obtaining prior permission from the government. However, the single judge had dismissed his petition. Challenging the order of the single judge, the appellant had filed this present writ appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-govt-staff-cannot-seek-legal-refuge-in-da-cases/articleshow/83127359.cms||---

We will check the documents and validate the bidder firms’ connection to vaccine manufacturers. If no proper connection is established, we will not process the bid further,” said additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu, who is heading the BMC’s vaccine procurement plan. “The shortlisted proposals will be verified through appropriate government channels. We will select only those bidders who have real potential to supply vaccines,” he added. With the Russian Development Investment Fund and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories clarifying that they have not tied up with any firm to supply Sputnik V in India, the BMC said if unable to confirm any direct connection of the suppliers with manufacturers, it would stop processing the bids. In a joint statement last week, the two firms had said that Dr Reddy’s has the sole distribution rights for the first 250 million doses of Sputnik V in India.With Pfizer stating that it would supply its vaccine only to the Centre and it has not authorised anyone to import or market the vaccine in India, the BMC is faced with a tough task of verifying and authenticating the offers of the seven bidders, since many of them are foreign entities. —Chaitanya Marpakwar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-may-not-extend-global-eoi-for-50-lakh-vaccine-doses/articleshow/83129108.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

In oxygen production too, Maharashtra is almost self-sufficient. After the first wave of Covid, in the last one year, we successfully upgraded our infrastructure and, as a result, now no patient will suffer for want of ICU bed, oxygen or ventilator,” said medical education director T P Lahane. A senior official said in view of the stringent measures taken by the government, only a fraction of the 2.8 lakh active cases have had to be admitted to hospital. But the battle against the virus is far from over, and the health department plans to move most of the people in home quarantine to Covid care centres in the vicinity in phases. Small centres with basic facilities will be set up in each village too. Interestingly, with the state reporting 2.8 lakh active cases, a vast majority of the 20 lakh people isolating at home would be contacts of Covid patients or those who have travelled to the state from abroad or other states. The major bulk (12.6L) are in Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Satara, Nagpur and Kolhapur, while there’s none in home quarantined in Hingoli district. Wardha, Gondia, Nandurbar and Bhandara have fewer than 5,000 but the number jumps 10 fold in Palghar, Solapur, Sangli, Ahmadnagar and Jalgaon. The government has recently stepped back from a decision of compulsory institutional quarantine, largely because of infrastructure and manpower shortage as well as hesitancy among the populace. If home quarantine is to be done away with, the government will have to create at least 25,000 to 3 lakh beds in each district and provide enough paramedical staff to manage them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-20l-in-home-quarantine-in-state-govt-to-shift-them-to-covid-centres-in-phases/articleshow/83137461.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Though the number of travellers looks to be high, according to officials, it is one-third of what it used to be during normal times. “Most of the passengers are those who moved out for urgent work and official matters. Students did not travel as education institutes are closed,” they said. Information received under RTI Act by Abhay Kolarkar states that 18.32 lakh people travelled from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021. This was despite zero frequency of trains from April-August 2020 when all trains were cancelled due to the Covid-19 scare. The total train frequency as per punctuality analysis monitoring (PAM) during the financial year was 12,782 trains while the number of cancelled trains during the same period were 52,852. Kolarkar says the number of passengers who booked tickets was far more as data shows that over 9 lakh passengers cancelled tickets. The Central Railway earned over Rs7.89 crore out of cancelled tickets. Though there was low traffic during the coronavirus period, there seemed to be business as usual for ticket checking staff as the Central Railway earned Rs2.94 crore revenue by way of fine from more than 47,000 ticketless travellers. The revenue from freight Rs2,704 crore was the only morale booster for the railways. As there were restrictions for entry into the station, revenue from platform earnings was at a low of Rs7.15 lakh during the year. Gurdwara Road underbridge opens for light vehicles today Nagpur: Central Railway has decided to open Gurdwara Road underbridge between Godhni and Nagpur railway stations for light vehicles on Tuesday. Road traffic was stopped in October 2020 as the CR undertook replacement of steel girders by PSC slab of the old structure. Amid the Covid lockdown when traffic was minimal, four blocks were executed on May 10, 17, 23 and 28 to complete the works. As the RUB work has been completed, the road shall be opened only for light vehicular traffic from Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cr-revenue-rs122-crore-from-18-32-lakh-passengers-in-2020-21/articleshow/83120063.cms||---

Addressing a press conference, Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra said vaccines are the only remedy for Covid-19. But the Centre has not been able to make available vaccines and is also discriminating against the state. Congress will not tolerate this, he said.He asked the Centre to make available sufficient quantity of vaccine or the Centre will be responsible for the consequences. He alleged that the vaccine crisis that the country is facing is due to Centre’s wrong policies. He said the responsibility of vaccination in the country is Centre’s duty. He alleged that the Centre had failed to come up with a vaccination policy which promotes universal free vaccination.The state government has been writing to the Prime Minister, home minister and health minister on vaccines. Despite the 25 MPs from the state from the ruling party at the Centre they had failed to do justice to the people of the state.Former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot also attacked the Centre for its failure to provide relief to the people. He said, “The BJP government at the Centre has completed seven years in power. I think, instead of celebrating the seventh anniversary, it should seek an apology from the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-warns-centre-on-vaccine-shortage/articleshow/83127386.cms||---

The only place where their attempts did not work out is Kerala. For a century, they tried to create Muslim fear among Hindus with an agenda to emerge as the advocates of the majority community. But Hindus have rejected such attempts outrightly,” he said. Baby expressed his opinion at a time when the CPM-led government in the state is finding it extremely difficult to take a stand on the high court order that struck down the 80:20 ratio followed by the state in the distribution of scholarship among Muslim and Christian communities. Kerala Congress parties, IUML and INL in the state have taken a divergent stand on the issue, irrespective of they being in the CPM-led LDF or the Congress-led UDF in Kerala. “The RSS is now trying to inject anti-Muslim sentiments in Christians for its own survival. But assembly election results indicate that such attempts have fallen flat. Their attempt to raise non-issues like Love Jihad did not work. Even though some Christian bigots too supported the RSS claims, none of the Christian believers were caught in that trap. Leaders like P C George too have faced a pitiful defeat this time,” Baby noted. Baby said Christians can see through the RSS men and decipher their intentions without much efforts. Christians know what stand RSS had taken towards Christians since the Nilackal issue. But still, there should be heightened vigil against the RSS agenda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/divisive-agenda-of-rss-wont-work-out-baby/articleshow/83125704.cms||---

The association has threatened to start a statewide agitation from June 10 if its demands are not met. Dr Pawan Bhagwat, treasurer of the association, said, “Veterinary practitioners and assistants in the animal husbandry department have worked hard in the pandemic despite the risk of getting infected. We served farmers amid Covid, which makes us the most deserving candidates for the status of frontline workers. Vets should be covered under the insurance scheme for frontline workers.” As most association members are diploma and certificate holders, they want representation in a state-level committee which is formed to revise rules for the appointment of assistant commissioner (animal husbandry) and livestock development officer (Group A). “There is a promotion quota for diploma/certificate-holder veterinarians. We deserve to represent ourselves in the committee. But the meeting was held without our representation and our quota was cancelled completely. On the other hand, 5% posts have been reserved for the degree holders. This is clear discrimination,” said Bhagwat. The veterinarian practitioners’ 11 demands include their salary structure, promotion, recruitment on vacant posts and re-designation. Most of these demands are pending for the last five years, they said. Dr DR Choudhary, working president of the association added, “In 2017, when our association had called for agitation, the then minister of animal husbandry and the principal secretary promised to settle the demands. The agitation was called off after a written assurance from the animal husbandry commissioner.” But since then, said Choudhary, “No issue has been resolved,” adding that there were 4,500 practising veterinary physicians in the state, half of whom were leading the veterinary hospitals and institutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vets-seek-covid-warrior-status-threaten-agitation-across-state/articleshow/83125680.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

It will continue till June 15. We are only giving some relaxations so that economic activities may also resume while stress on protection from the Coronavirus pandemic continues. Unlock life, lock corona.” “I have a feeling of satisfaction while interacting with you today. In the last two months, we all have fought a terrible war against corona. We have also suffered great losses in this battle with corona. Many people have lost their loved ones. Wounds are deep, and the pain is unbearable. I deposited the pension amount in the accounts of children yesterday. We shall always take care of the children who have lost both their parents. But today I can say that together we have reached the final stage of winning the battle with corona infection. We received support from everyone in this fight,” he said. He said, the battle against Covid is yet to be won. “The situation is satisfactory today. Now the number of new cases are decreasing. But there still are a large number of cases remaining. There are some districts where cases decrease but also increase on the second day. The infection has been controlled, but the threat still looms. We need to remain careful at present.” The CM said, we are also fighting black fungus. “We are committed to providing proper treatment to the patients of this disease. There was a crisis of anti-fungal injection. But now its supply is gradually being ensured. We are sending injections to private hospitals too. We will leave no stone unturned in dealing with Black fungus.” “The fight against corona must continue. So we are not withdrawing the corona curfew right now. Corona curfew will continue till June 15 although we are relaxing it to some extent. ‘Suraksha bhi aur samriddhi bhi’ (Let there be safety and prosperity both). We have to protect ourselves, but we also have to resume economic activities, so that business can go on, construction works can go on. The poor can earn their bread. Crisis Management Groups, whether they are from our district, our block, ward or village, have decided for themselves which activities will be resumed and which activities will not be resumed till June 15. But there are certain activities which will be banned throughout the state. For our safety, these restrictions are necessary to prevent infection.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/unlock-life-lock-corona-cms-message-to-mp/articleshow/83127395.cms||---

By August 2021, 30 crore vaccines will be manufactured allowing more people for the same. I reiterate that in December every person in the country will be vaccinated.” Hitting on the repeated allegations of discrimination in vaccine distribution, the minister argued that it is being distributed on the basis of population.Responding to the repeated attack on faulty ventilators received by the state under the PM Cares Fund, Shekhawat expressed surprise that the fund gave away 70,000 ventilators to states, including 1,900 to the state. “Isn’t it strange that the ventilators which worked in other states don’t work here. The reality has been exposed by the media by highlighting that ventilators were found in bathrooms and given on rent to private hospitals,” said the minister.Replying to the allegations by the opposition of slow pace of vaccination, Shekhawat said that after the US, it is India, which has vaccinated its huge chunk of population. “So far, 21 crore people have been vaccinated in India. Which other nation can inoculate its 135 crore of population?” asked the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/union-min-shekhawat-slams-gehlot-over-vaccine-wastage/articleshow/83127373.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Revolt in BJP? Leaders question state chief||Chandigarh: Like Punjab Congress leaders, those at the helm of state BJP are also facing questions in their own party, which is not only struggling to face farmers but is also required to contest all 117 assembly segments for the first time. On Monday, former cabinet minister and three-time MLA from Pathankot Master Mohan Lal questioned the leadership of his one-time protégé and now Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma for allegedly “spoiling his career.” “I have been sidelined since 2012, when Sharma got the ticket from my Pathankot assembly seat. I have won three assembly elections and he has won one. Still, he is overall in-charge and sarv shaktiman, I have no future in the party,” Lal told TOI. Lal, who has his roots in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), says now when BJP will contest all 117 seats in 2022, he also wants to contest from Pathankot. “Sharma, who has grudges against me, told me that the tentative list of all 117 candidates has been drafted and my name is not there. What should I do now?” he asked. The former minister said he gave 50 years to the party and could win the seat. “In the run-up to Lok Sabha polls, Sharma asked me to meet Arun Jaitley (former Union finance minister) for the ticket. But when I met him, Jaitley told me Sharma himself wanted to contest Lok Sabha polls. I picked up my briefcase and came back from Delhi,” he added. Though the BJP is not new to such internal rumbling, as former state party presidents, including Shwait Malik, were also accused of failing to take everyone along, the incumbent party president is facing a challenge in Pathankot, his home turf. Sharma, who served as party president from 2010 to 2013 also contested unsuccessfully in Pathankot in the 2017 assembly elections. Party leaders accused Sharma of arrogance, which, they said, cannot be tolerated in such trying conditions when party leaders fear stepping out of their homes amid protests by farmers. A leader also raised questions on the constitution of the state executive committee and state office-bearers, pointing out underrepresentation of Sikh leaders, leaders from farming background and leaders from all sub-castes within the scheduled castes. “Most office-bearers, including Subhash Sharma and Jeevan Gupta, have not contested assembly elections. Senior leaders like Surjit Kumar Jyani, Master Mohan Lal, Bhagat Chunni Lal, Anil Joshi and K D Bhandari, who have ample knowledge, have not found a place anywhere,” he said. Another leader said, “If the state executive committee members were so competent, why would the party high command choose Harjeet Singh Grewal and Surjit Kumar Jyani to talk to farmers?” Sharma: All is well Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma told TOI: “I can’t tell you whether the list of 117 candidates has been prepared or not. Being president of the state unit, I have limitations. Above us, there is also a Parliament board.” On the denial of ticket to Master Mohan Lal, he said, “He is an honourable member of our party. In BJP, the role of every leader changes with passage of time.” If Lal is the party's spokesperson on electronic channels, he goes on behalf of the party. And if he has some issues, he should take those up at the party platform, he added. Denying claims of him being arrogant, Sharma said, “Nobody can say that. BJP is not run by the president alone; it is run collectively by all.” About the underrepresentation of some segments of society in the party, he said instead of getting into politics of caste and religion, he would talk about Panjabiyat and his party had tried to accommodate every segment and it was a work in progress. “We have to maintain balance among those who run the party and those who contest elections,” said Sharma, when asked about having a maximum of those leaders in the executive committee who have not contested any election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/revolt-in-bjp-leaders-question-state-chief/articleshow/83129119.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The team has covered villages in Nirmal, Jagtial, Husnabad, Bhupalpally, Mulugu, and Mahabubabad to date and distributed 200 kits in each of these places. “We got requests for another 800 to 1,000 kits from all these places,” said Sai Teja of Feed the Needy NGO, adding that there is a huge requirement for medicines in rural areas. The medicine kits delivered by the NGO have nine different tablets (almost the same as isolation kits delivered by the state) to treat fever, pain, cold, vitamins, zinc, etc and cost about ₹450. The team has been using money from their pockets and is also accepts funds or medicines from donors so as to distribute the medicines to the needy. “The home isolation kits by the state are given only to those who have been tested positive. However, the number of tests conducted is limited. So, we are giving these kits to district officials so that they can test and distribute them to those in remote areas,” said Srinivas Bellam of the NGO. Feed the Needy team said that they have been handing over medicines to district collectors, officials of the health department and have been following up whether the kits are reaching those in need by contacting volunteers at ground level. They said that residential welfare associations, pharmacies, and others are coming forward to help the poor. Their journey of distributing medicines in rural areas started with the Nirmal district after they received a request from a police official.

Also, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has finalized two centres to inoculate students, who are going abroad for education, from Thursday. Kingsway Hospital received 12,000 doses from Serum Institute of India (SII) a day ago, hospital director Amit Somani told TOI. “After we started taking appointments on Co-Win, 500 people booked the slots for Tuesday. They will be inoculated between 11am and 3pm,” he said. “It takes some time to stabilize the system. We will explore if session can be again opened for 3-5pm and 5-7pm on Tuesday. No walk-in registration and vaccination is allowed,” he said. The hospital has yet no plans to start vaccination in industries or establishments. “For vaccination at Kingsway Hospital itself, charges are Rs1,000 for dose and Rs100 for registration. Registration charges will not be required for those who have registered earlier at the OPD or IPD of the hospital. Charges of Rs 950 will be for companies empanelled with the hospital. Vaccination will be free of cost for our staff,” he said. The central government had allowed inoculation of 18-44 years age group from May 1 but placed responsibility of procurement of doses and vaccination on the states. The state had launched vaccination with limited centres on May 1 and stopped on May 12 citing shortage of doses. Inoculation for this age group is going on at few private hospitals in five districts of the state as they managed to get doses directly from manufacturers. Many hospitals in the city had applied for doses with SII. Two more private hospitals are likely to start vaccination for 18-44 age group later in this week. As reported by TOI on Monday, the NMC has finalized vaccination of students going abroad for education. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “Vaccination will be conducted for these students on every Thursday and Friday at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR) and Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital. Students of 18-45 years are eligible. They will have to fill a google sheet which is available on NMC’s website (www.nmcnagpur.gov.in) and social media pages before 24 hours. They will also have to upload admission confirmation certificate from foreign university, I-20 and DS-160 forms sent by university for Visa, aadhaar and passport. They will receive confirmation mail with application number, scheduled date and name of centre,” he said. For further details, the interested may contact on NMC’s helpline number- 0712-2567021. On Monday, the NMC in association with Composite Regional Centre for Skill Development, Rehabilitation and Empowerment of Persons With Disabilities started vaccination centre specially for persons with disabilities at the latter’s centre situated at Yashwant stadium. Centre will run from 9am to 5pm. Number of beneficiaries increased to 3,687 in the district on Monday. The number was 1,209 on Sunday probably due to weekend. The vaccination is on decline in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/private-hosp-to-start-vax-of-all-above-18-yrs-from-today/articleshow/83125718.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kochi||Kerala: Senior leader K C Joseph slams Chennithala over letter controversy||KOTTAYAM: It seems senior Congress leaders can’t let go of group politics as ‘A’ and ‘I factions – that united briefly to oppose the possible elevation of K Sudhakaran as the new KPCC chief – were at loggerheads once again over the letter written by senior leader Ramesh Chennithala to Sonia Gandhi. The ‘A’ group came out in the open against Chennithala after they came to know that Chennithala had allegedly criticized Chandy in his letter. Senior leader K C Joseph, also a confidant of Chandy, slammed Chennithala on Monday and demanded an explanation on the letter controversy. But, he was quickly censured by the Congress leadership and later refused to speak on the issue. Though there is a controversy within the party over Chennithala’s letter, he has not commented on the matter. This has naturally provoked the ‘A’ group. Chennithala had allegedly written that by making Chandy the chairman of the election committee, Congress lost the support of all majority communities. Chennithala did not clear the air about this alleged reference in his letter. Joseph, who called Chandy as the trouble-shooter for the Congress, recalled how the senior leader had resolved organizational issues in the party at Palakkad, Wayanad and Kannur districts prior to polls. Meanwhile, those looking for a transition in the party were relieved as both groups picked a fight. This in turn shifted the focus that was centred on the selection of the new KPCC chief. The announcement of the new KPCC chief is expected next week . Apart from Sudhakaran, Kodikunnil Suresh, P T Thomas and Benny Behanan are vying for the post. Going by the current situation the groups will be here to stay for some more time even if a new KPCC president assumes office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/joseph-slams-chennithala-over-letter-controversy/articleshow/83125723.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mango Baba app to deliver fresh fruit to your home||LUCKNOW: You can now order mangoes at your doorstep straight from the orchards of Malihabad without any glitches. Last year, the Central Institute of Subtropical Horticulture (CISH), a Lucknow-based ICAR lab, had developed the mobile app called Mango Baba, exclusively for marketing of mangoes and products made from it. The app was designed by entrepreneurs in the institute’s agri-business incubation centre. This year, the institute has updated the app by removing the glitches it reported earlier and making it more customer-friendly. Director of the institute Shailendra Rajan said, “The app has been modified based on the first year’s experience. Consumers were facing difficulty generating an OTP. To address the issue, efforts were made to use a fast server because multiple registrations at the same time necessitated a quick response.” The app now accepts both cash on delivery and online payment as opposed to only cash on delivery last year. Since mango marketing is done for only two months, the app has started selling mango-based value-added products such as pickles and immunity boosters to remain active for the rest of the year. “In future, it will also be used to deliver plants to people’s homes,” said the director. The app will also serve as a platform to self-help groups engaged in the making products by giving opportunities of sales. “Last year, Mango Baba was used successfully to deliver mangoes to people’s homes. Entrepreneurs created a mango supply chain from the orchard to the customer. All standard grading and packaging procedures were carried out under the supervision of the institute’s scientists,” said Rajan. When the app was launched though, it did face difficulties in distributing mango packs across Lucknow on time. That has been dealt with in the newer version.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mango-baba-app-to-deliver-fresh-fruit-to-your-home/articleshow/83129127.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Fraudsters operate unchecked due to delayed registration of e-crimes’ FIRs?||BHOPAL: In the normal course, a first information report (FIR) should be registered as soon as the complaint is received. But, over the last year, the complaints received at the crime branch are being sent to police stations concerned for FIR registration after a delay of over six months to almost a year. Cops feel, online fraudsters are taking advantage of this delay. A police officer posted at Aishbagh police station aid that cyber crime cases are committed by online fraudsters sitting in faraway states like Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal. It takes a lot of resources to go and search for them. Such crimes should be registered immediately because with every passing minute these fraudsters change their phone numbers and SIM cards. They even use bank accounts on rent, so it becomes impossible to track them. He added that cyber crime branch forwards those cases to city police stations in which they could not track the online thugs. So, such FIRs remain merely a formality. Another senior cop said, online fraud victims approach police and most of the city police station staff send them to cyber crime branch without even listening to their complaints . So, the cyber crime branch receives a lot of complaints including those with much smaller fraud amounts and the victim is made to run from pillar to post to register an FIR. Due to this hectic process of FIR registration, most of the victims of online frauds do not file complaints and thugs take advantage of it. ASP (Zone-1) said, cyber crime focuses on major online fraud cases in which the organised rackets are involved to dupe a large number of people. The branch has limited resources so it is not possible to pay much attention to complaints dealing with smaller amounts because the process for major online crime and smaller crime is almost the same, technically. Cyber crime branch is not able to handle many of the complaints received on a daily basis, so the senior officials have instructed that the online fraud complaints of dealing with smaller amounts should be sent to city police stations for registering FIRs and investigations. He said, in the coming times, cyber crimes will rise even more, so the aim is to make the cops posted at city police stations adept in dealing with such cases. In the last one month, cyber crime branch forwarded around 300 such complaints to various city police stations out of which cases were registered on only 60-70. Many complainants themselves refused to register formal FIRs due to such delay. Some of the cops posted at city police stations said, due to delayed registration of FIRs it becomes almost impossible to solve these cases. In the latest online fraud FIR registered at Habibganj police station on Sunday, a 20-year-old student was duped by an online fraudster, posing as an Army officer. The victim had filed a complaint with cyber-crime branch in July 2020 from where it has been forwarded to Habibganj police station for registration of FIR now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fraudsters-operate-unchecked-due-to-delayed-registration-of-e-crimes-firs/articleshow/83127414.cms||Sudeept Mishra

Out of the 19.3 lakh samples tested for Covid in May, 3,41,957 tested positive at a positivity rate of 17.7%, while 4,146 persons lost their lives at an average of 134 casualties daily.The quantum of fatalities due to Covid can be gauged by the fact that almost 50% of the deaths took place in May. Also, 36% of state’s overall Covid cases were reported in May. However, over the last two weeks, cases have started reducing. With the graph of daily Covid infections going down and trajectory of recovered cases going up, active cases have gone below the 50,000 mark. Count of active cases in eighteen districts are now less than 1,000 and among those 12 are currently accommodating less then 500 active cases. As on Monday, active cases stood at 42,654 while 8,000 persons have recovered from the disease. The lowest active cases have been recorded in Jalore, where 74 persons are still positive and undergoing treatment. A health department official said active cases across the state have been going down rapidly. More people are now recovering and daily new infections are going down, which is a good sign, but people still need to be careful for preventing from getting infected.On Monday, the state reported 68 deaths due to Covid, while 1498 tested positive taking the casualty count to 8,385 and overall tally to 9,39,958. Districts which reported new cases are Jaipur (220), Alwar (135), Jodhpur (127), Hanumangarh (110), Sriganganagar(109), Jhunjhunu (104), Bikaner (68), Sikar (59), Jaisalmer (52), Churu (44),Kota (42), Nagaur (39), Barmer (38), Pali (37), Udaipur (37), Dausa (36),Bhilwara (30), Dungarpur (29), Bharatpur (25), Banswara (20), Ajmer (19), Rajsamand(16), Bundi (16), Pratapgarh (15), Jhalawar (15), Baran (13), Sawai Madhopur(9), Chittorgarh (9), Jalore (8), Karauli (7), Sirohi (6) and Tonk (4).

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 55% tests now on rapid antigen rather than more reliable RT-PCR||MUMBAI: Almost 55% of Covid testing in Maharashtra is now through the rapid antigen test (RAT) while the share of the gold standard RT-PCR has dropped to 45%. In several districts, up to 90% tests are being carried out using RAT, which experts caution has a fairly high false negative rate and could result in cases going undetected. Early in May, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revised testing guidelines saying states could conduct more rapid antigen tests to keep up with the big surge in testing demand in the second wave. The change in stance had surprised many since ICMR had insisted until then that share of RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) testing should be 70%. The RAT is faster than the RT-PCR which has a turnaround time of 24hours. But the RAT is not as sensitive as RT-PCR which can pick up even minuscule signs of the virus. On Saturday, of the 2.51lakh tests carried out, over 1.38lakh were using antigen and 1.13lakh with RT-PCR. The reliance on antigen is massive in districts like Gadchiroli, where almost 90% tests are done on it. Other districts relying heavily on antigen are Palghar (86%), Satara (84%), Sindhudurg (85%), Raigad (83%) and Ahmednagar (75%). In Mumbai, 66% of tests are still done using RT-PCR. In Parbhani, 82% tests are done with Rt-PCR. Explaining why a shift in favour of antigen testing is worrying, an official said that the state’s RT-PCR positivity rate is 10% while that of antigen is 6%. “The tiny 4% difference could be several thousand cases that are being missed out. If we perform more RT-PCR tests, we pick up even those cases that are missed by the antigen,” he added. A senior doctor said bigger cities and towns especially shouldn’t cut down on RT-PCR. Aurangabad is one example where despite the availability of RT-PCR, 66% tests are done using antigen. Public health researcher Dr Anant Bhan said when cases rose, ICMR guidelines allowed for more RAT to enable more testing with faster turnaround. “But we could be missing cases especially asymptomatic ones,” he said, adding that RAT also depends a lot on the reliability of antigen kits being used. Dr Pradeep Awate, surveillance officer, however, said transmission of Covid in Maharashtra is now mainly seen in peri-urban and rural areas where RT-PCR labs are not readily available. “Even ICMR advocates use of antigen in hotspots to test and segregate early. With RAT, we can diagnose at rural hospitals, villages, almost in every corner within minutes. And if symptomatic patients come negative, we refer them for RT-PCR compulsorily,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-55-tests-now-on-rapid-antigen-rather-than-more-reliable-rt-pcr/articleshow/83129129.cms||Sumitra Debroy

On Friday, the father — Dilip Yadav — who is in his mid-40s, returned to his village in Mehrama block after travelling to Jamtara sadar hospital with his child for the blood transfusion, a distance of 400 km to and fro. This is the second time that Yadav embarked on a long cycle ride for his son’s treatment. Talking to TOI over the phone, Yadav said, “It was the second time I had to travel to Jamtara on a bicycle carrying my son as A negative blood was not available in the district blood bank. Before that, I had gone to Dumka and even Bhagalpur, looking for blood. With no earning, I couldn’t hire a private vehicle.” Yadav has four children — three daughters and a son. The boy was found suffering from thalassemia four months after his birth. “We would have arranged blood from other sources had the parent contacted us. We shall ensure that no patient face problems in the district in future,” said Godda civil surgeon Dr SP Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cycling-400km-for-transfusion/articleshow/83132558.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The Airport Authority of India (AAI) has suggested that these obstructions be cleared. The night landing facility is required to ensure more airports are connected to the Kolhapur airport. Many airports do not have parking slots available during the day and they are ready to provide slots at night — this will facilitate flight services between Kolhapur and the other cities. However, there are several obstructions. For instance, a study found a hilltop hamlet just outside the Kolhapur city obstructing vision during night landings. The entire hamlet needs to be relocated. Also, there are other obstructions such as a power station, several poles, an elevated water tank, mobile towers and several constructions. District guardian minister Satej Patil and MP Sanjay Mandlik surveyed the various localities around the airport a couple of times recently. Satej Patil said: “I have asked several departments to remove the obstructions as soon as possible. We are in discussion with the residents of the hamlet. They are being convinced to shift to another location. The authorities have been asked to prepare a plan to relocate the people and the utilities.” It has been decided that airport authority survey teams will be called to carry out a fresh survey to ensure minimum relocation. The electricity department has been given the task of shifting the power station, poles and overhead wires. The plan is ready and adequate funds will be made available to accomplish the task. “Flight movements and passenger load are increasing at the Kolhapur airport. The airport has been serving those making frequent trips to major cities for business and tourism. We are also extending the runway to make sure that large aircraft can safely land here,” Patil added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/obstacles-around-kolhapur-airport-block-night-landings/articleshow/83123536.cms||---

Now, they have offered a donation of Rs 16,530 from their piggy bank savings to the actor urging him to help more people. The actor advised their parents to deposit the money in an account and has promised a video chit-chat with the girls. मिलिए यह हैं दुनिया के सबसे अमीर बच्चे,और दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा बैंक.आपके 16530 रुपए हमारी सबसे कीमती डोनेशन है। आ… https://t.co/2bNlYFEC9Q— sonu sood (@SonuSood) 1622292405000Sonu Sood, while sharing their video of opening of the piggy bank, introduced the girls as the “richest children of the world having world’s biggest bank” and said on twitter, “Aapke 16,530 rupaye humare liye keemti donation hai (your donation of Rs 16,300 is priceless for us). TOI on Monday spoke to Yogesh Joshi, father of the girls. “As we were narrating them stories on how Sonu Sood has been helping people tirelessly, and they were also watching TV while staying at home, my elder daughter Mahi, 10, asked me if she can donate the money in their piggy bank in which she, along with my younger daughter Pratha, 6, were saving,” Joshi said. Mahi, in Class 4, and Pratha, in Class 1, are now celebrities in Jalore, ever since Sonu Sood tweeted their video requesting the actor to take their money. “Many people have been calling on my number and requesting us for a chat with my daughters,” an elated Joshi said. “Initially, I was surprised, but later, I got in touch with one Hitesh Jain who is in the team of Sonu Sood sir. And, finally, the video was sent to him. Acknowledging the gesture Sonu sir not only tweeted the video with words of praise for my daughters, he also gave us a bank account number to deposit the money,” Joshi said. “Both my daughters were restless until I deposited the money. Now, Sonu Sood sir has promised to make a video call to talk to my daughters,” he added. The sisters are now waiting to hear from Sonu Sood, as the latter promised them a video chat. “Uncle bahut achcha kaam kar rahey hain, unhone kaha woh humse baat karenge (Uncle is doing a good job; he promised to chat with us),” Mahi Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/beacon-of-hope-two-sisters-break-piggy-bank-and-donate-rs-16k-to-actor-sonu-soods-social-programme/articleshow/83127424.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Nagpur||War on Covid-19: Don’t let go May gains in June||Nagpur: After remaining on the tenterhooks throughout April on Covid front, the region got the much-needed relief in May as the caseload reduced and recoveries increased on daily basis. May proved to be a unique month in the Covid-19 scenario for Vidarbha in many aspects. For all 31 days of the month, the number of recovered patients was higher than the number of new cases reported. Covid toll, which was near 300 per day in April last week, kept on reducing and dipped below 50 per day by May 31. Recovery rate improved from 81% to near 96%, a sharp 15% jump in 31 days of May. Test positivity rate, which was above 30%, came under 6% in most districts in Vidarbha. May’s Covid toll (5,153) is also less than April (5,670). Still, there is a long way to go. It’s just the beginning of the end of second wave of Covid-19.Overall, a sharp drop in new cases in May, fall in test positivity rate and number of under-treatment patients bodes well for the region. However, amid all these positives, we must not forget that Vidarbha is still reporting more than 2,000 cases per day, and it’s not time to be casual at all, say experts. “The cases are low as compared to the April peak, but we must consider the figures from post-first wave period,” said a senior member of State Covid Task Force. “Cases are still being reported from rural areas. Most important are the unreported cases and deaths in Vidarbha’s rural and tribal belts. It’s a bigger challenge to stop rural spread,” said the doctor.The task force has suggested the government to continue with strict restrictions on movement from cities to villages. While the cities will unlock in the first week of June, there must be strict vigilance in villages. Aiming at this, the government has launched ‘My Covid Free Village’ campaign on May 30, informed the member. According to epidemiologists, June is going to be crucial month for the region as well as state.“Sudden drop in cases and test positivity rate can create a delusion that the virus has gone away. But, we must not repeat the same mistake that we did after the first wave. Despite unlock in cities, people should wear mask, follow Covid distancing strictly and get the vaccine protection at the earliest,” said epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte. June Is Crucial UNLOCK | Cities will open up, but rural spread is still a threat CAB | Covid-appropriate behaviour is must despite relaxationsJAB | Vaccination is must and need to be encouraged in June DEATHS | Cases have gone down, deaths are not in that proportion POST COVID | Problems like black fungus, MIS-C, lung fibrosis need to be tackled||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/war-on-covid-19-dont-let-go-may-gains-in-june/articleshow/83125721.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

But this year, mango aficionados may miss these lesser known traditional varieties from Malihabad, Sandila, Barabanki and adjoining areas, the reason being the restricted movement. The ‘desi’ or traditional varieties of mango are the early varieties that grow before Dussehri, Langra and Chausa. Johari Safeda, Benazir, Gillas, Khas ul Khas, and Amin Abdul Ahad Khan, Bride of Russia (Surkha Burma), Laila Majnu, Tehsil Wala, Amina Abrahim Pur are a few of these. These are not available in the market as abundantly as Dussehri and others. Shailendra Rajan, director, Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture said, “Growers of these unique varieties sell these mangoes using an unusual marketing chain. Producers of these varieties are worried as it will be challenging to get a reasonable market price this year.” The traditional varieties of mangoes have existed for years but have vanished from markets due to popular ones like Dussehri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/benazir-laila-majnu-may-find-only-a-few-takers-this-yr/articleshow/83129148.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Smokers carry risk of severe infection, lung damage, say Hyderabad doctors||HYDERABAD: On the occasion of ‘World No Tobacco Day’, doctors said that smoking is a major risk factor for respiratory infections and increases the severity of Covid-19 infections. Also explaining how tobacco smokers (cigarettes, bidis, cigars, waterpipes, heated tobacco products) may be more vulnerable to contracting Covid-19, the doctors said that the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand to mouth. “The risk of severe infection, requirements of ventilatory support and death are doubled in patients who are active smokers. Smoking causes more deaths in Covid-19 infections. In the absence of proper treatment for Covid-19 infection, smoking remains a detrimental factor in the outcome”, said Dr Devender Singh, senior vascular surgeon, Yashoda Hospitals, Somajiguda. He further explained that Covid-19 is an infectious disease that primarily attacks the lungs and that smoking impairs lung function making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases. On the occasion, the National Service Scheme Cell (NSS) of Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU) also observed ‘World No Tobacco Day’ here on Monday. Vice-chancellor of the university, professor SM Rahmatullah, administered the pledge to students and staff that they would not use any kind of tobacco products in life and also advise the same to their loved ones. “Using tobacco causes lung damage and other diseases. Therefore, it is important to stay away from these things,” professor Rahmatullah said. Similarly, sports players have also come together to spread awareness against tobacco use and its ill-effects. In their message, former badminton player and chief national coach for the Indian badminton team P Gopichand and badminton player PV Sindhu pledged to protect the youth of the country from the menace of tobacco products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/smokers-carry-risk-of-severe-infection-lung-damage-docs/articleshow/83127444.cms||---

The price of remdesivir was brought down to Rs 3,500 from Rs 5,400 per vial, it said. The drug manufacturing companies have volunteered to bring the rates down following the intervention of the Centre, the NPPA said in its affidavit before the Telangana high court which made NPPA arespondent in the ongoing case on Covid-19. The court, while hearing a batch of PILs on Covid-19 questioning the high charges on one hand and failure of the authorities on the other, had asked the NPPA to file an affidavit specifying its efforts to contain the exploitative practices of the hospitals. NPPA deputy director T Rajesh Kumar said in his affidavit that manufacturers of non-scheduled drugs cannot increase the maximum retail prices of their drugs by more than10 per cent in a year. “Remdesivir is a non-scheduled drug. NPPA is monitoring the situation in respect of nonscheduled drugs used in the management of Covid-19 to ensure that the manufacturers do not increase the prices beyond10% per annum,” he said. For Covid-19 drugs, the NPPA is monitoring the situation regardless of the classification of the drug, scheduled or non-scheduled. “The NPPA is also coordinating with the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD) for removing bottlenecks in the supply chain,” Rajesh Kumar said. NPPA issued an office memorandum on April 17 notifying the reduced prices of the drugs used in Covid-19 with a direction to drug controllers in the states to ensure that these drugs were available at reduced rates, he said. The central agency’s affidavit said NPPA fixes the ceiling price of scheduled medicines specified in the first schedule of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013, known as DPCO. Manufacturers of scheduled drugs will have to sell their products within the ceiling price and GST can be added to this. However, the price fixation methods are not the same for all drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-drugs-rates-brought-down-nppa-tells-high-court/articleshow/83127455.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Anand, from Ganiganakoppalu village, about 30km from Mysuru, had to get tablets for his son on Wednesday night. Ever since his son was diagnosed with the ailment, Anand has been visiting Nimhans, Bengaluru, every two months to get tablets free of cost. Doctors have advised him not to miss even a single dose of medicine for his son as any disruption could set back the treatment plan by years. With the lockdown throwing his scheduled visit to Nimhans in May out of gear, Anand mulled many options. He pleaded with friends to borrow a scooter, but they refused because of fears that the vehicle may be seized by cops for lockdown violations. That was when Anand decided to pedal all the way and chose the Kanakapura route for his journey from Mysuru to Bengaluru and back home, all adding up to well over 300km.With time running out and the Wednesday deadline closing in, Anand took off on his bicycle from his village around 3am on Sunday (May 23) with Rs 600 in hand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/daily-wager-pedals-300km-to-get-crucial-meds-for-10-year-old-son/articleshow/83132579.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Trousers help man identify body of brother on Varaprada||MUMBAI: Fifteen days after tug Varaprada sank in the Arabian Sea a few kilometres away from Palghar’s Wardai Coast during cyclone Tautkae in which 11 crew members went missing, body of 30-year-old crew member Vicky Bhooplal was identified by his younger brother Sunil at JJ mortuary on Monday. Sunil, who is with the Army, said that he identified Vicky’s body with the trousers he was wearing which belonged to him. Yellow Gate police probing the case of barge Papaa (P-305) said DNA tests of the 29 bodies, including eight recovered from Raigad Coast and that of Vicky’s and P-305 captain Rakesh Ballav’s, are awaited. Vicky, a native of Palwal city in Haryana, had joined Varaprada as a seaman on September 8 last year. “He is married and has a three-year-old son,” Sunil (27) told TOI. Sunil said he was on duty in Leh Ladakh when he received a call from his family about the incident.

Instead, many are heading to Canada, the UK and other European countries to pursue higher education and for employment. While overseas education consultancies in the city have observed a dip in the number of students going to Australia and New Zealand, there is a spurt in students going to Canada. “This year, we have seen an almost 50% jump in applicants hoping to head to Canada. Better work opportunities and ease of staying there for longer through permanent residency has attracted a lot of students to Canada. Since Canada has a huge Indian population, it is also culturally preferred by many students,” said Piyush Kumar, regional director (South Asia), IDP Education, adding that the Canadian government is going out of its way to draw foreign students’ attention. The country expects to admit a record 4,01,000 new immigrants in 2021. Courses like information technology and business administration continue to woo foreign students. However, given the pandemic, many are also vying for courses in medical sciences, pharmaceuticals, hospital management etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aus-nz-out-more-students-turn-to-canada/articleshow/83127477.cms||---

The next batch of 42.58 lakh doses of vaccine doses are expected to arrive between June 6 and June 9. On Monday morning, Tamil Nadu had less than 4.5 lakh doses of the vaccine — 2.1 lakh doses purchased by the state for people in the age group of 18-44 and 2.5 lakh doses given by the Centre for people aged above 45 and priority groups. By Monday evening, 1.6 lakh people, including 87,781 people in the 18-44 age group were administered the vaccine. The state was left with little more than 1.3 lakh doses of the Centre’s vaccines given to health care providers, frontline workers and people above 45 years after vaccinating 74,594 people on Monday. The total number of recipients decreased on Monday as many vaccine centres across districts ran out of stock. “Barring Sunday, we were vaccinating up to 2.5 lakh people, including up to 2 lakh people in the 18-44 age group who take the vaccine in the state everyday since May 24. Now, many centres have gone out of stock. We are restricting vaccination to select centres in all districts. We expect the stock to last only a day or two,” Radhakrishnan said. Officials said they were awaiting 1.7 lakh doses of vaccines — including the state’s purchase of 70,000 doses — allotted to TN for May. “But the Centre has promised to double the state’s allotment to 42 lakh in June. This includes 25.8 lakh of the Centre’s vaccines and 16.7 lakh doses the state can buy for people in the 18-44 age group. The first batch, however, will come only between June 6 and June 9,” Radhakrishnan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-may-halt-vaccine-drive-tomorrow-as-stocks-run-low/articleshow/83127464.cms||---

If they ask, I will suggest my opinion and will also recommend a name,’’ said Congress working committee member Chandy. The party high command has every power and right to take a decision. The decision taken by the party high command would be final and every Congress man would have to accept it, he added. On the speculations that K Sudhakaran is being considered for the post, Chandy said “whatever decision taken by the party high command will be accepted by everyone.’’ “Ashok Chavan committee is probing into the reasons for the defeat in the assembly elections and I have given my statement before the committee. But this committee did not ask anything on the choice of the new KPCC president. Most probably after the submission of this committee report, the high command is likely to take a decision on the new president,” he said. “If the party high command asks, I will recommend a name or else I will accept the decision of the party,’’ he said. On the letter by Ramesh Chennithala to Sonia Gandhi that it was the elevation of Chandy as the election committee chairman that drifted away the majority vote bank from the Congress, Chandy said: “I don’t believe that Chennithala has written such a letter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/will-suggest-a-name-if-aicc-asks-opinion/articleshow/83125742.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||SAD slams Cong ministers, MLAs for trooping to Delhi over ‘chairs of office’||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday expressed concern over the functioning of the Congress government in Punjab, hinting at the ongoing war of words between CM Amarinder Singh and former minister Navjot Singh, and the party’s attempts to resolve the crisis. The SAD said Congress MLAs and leaders had deserted the people of Punjab in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic by shifting to Delhi to fight for the “chairs of office”. In a meeting on Sunday evening, SAD’s core committee noted that Congress ministers and legislators were “indifferent to the suffering of people battling Covid, but were outpacing one another to reach Delhi. The committee said: “The fact that the Congress high command has encouraged this exercise speaks volumes about the ‘soch’ (attitude) of the Gandhi family towards Punjabis.” The committee meeting presided over by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal also condemned the CM, saying that he was presiding over the entire mess and keeping himself busy in trying to save his chair, rather than taking out time to supervise the fight against Covid. “All this has resulted in 14,500 deaths and the highest fatality rate in the country, but Amarinder is least concerned. He has joined the game with his detractors and dispatched his own team to Delhi to save his chair, instead of dispatching them to Punjab to save Covid patients,” he said. Sukhbir said the CM should lead by example and create Covid centres at the block level to control the increasing incidence of Covid in rural areas, besides purchasing vaccine doses worth Rs 1,000 crore from vaccine manufacturers to vaccinate the entire population of the state within the next six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-slams-cong-ministers-mlas-for-trooping-to-delhi-over-chairs-of-office/articleshow/83129190.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Visa delays may derail students’ foreign dreams||HYDERABAD: While students going abroad for further studies are relieved over the state government’s decision to vaccinate them, many are worried over the delay in processing their visas due to closure of US consulate and the Visa Facilitation Services (VFS) global centers. Despite getting admission offers from universities abroad, city students are in a fix on whether they’ll be able to travel overseas and join their peers when the fall semester commences in August/September. “I completed my medicals on April 27 in Bengaluru before the lockdown and applied for the visa on May 5. I have been waiting to get my biometric done so that my visa can be processed. However, closure of the VFS centers in Telangana is resulting in delay,” said Hrudhvi Bandla, 23, who has secured admission for masters in management (business analytics) at Western University in Ontario in Canada. With many universities mandating 15 days quarantine period before the commencement of classes, students are racing against time to get their visas processed. “My classes commence from September 7 and the Canadian government has mandated15 days institutional quarantine for those coming from other countries. In that case, I have to be in Canada latest by August 15. Therefore, I have to get my visa latest by July to be able to make flight bookings,” said Ashish Patnaik, 21, who has secured admission for masters in global business administration at Humber Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning in Toronto in Canada. Closure of the US Consulate has also put many students in a fix. With the lockdown extending for another 10 days in Telangana, many have reached out to the authorities on social media seeking help. “Dear @KTRTRS sir please do something for us students who are about to leave to abroad this Fall 21. Along with the vaccination we also need the US consulate @USAndHyderabad to be available so that we can get our visas. We’ve only 2 months left, else we’ve to wait until winter 21’,” tweeted Likhitha Gupta, a student. Following several requests from students, IT minister KT Rama Rao has requested the US Consulate to look into them. The VFS centers are waiting for government directives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/visa-delays-may-derail-students-foreign-dreams/articleshow/83127494.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Coolest’ May in 20 years kept heat wave at bay||LUCKNOW: This year’s May month was the ‘coolest’ in decades, at least in the past 20 years of which TOI has records. May in north India usually witnesses heat wave, when mercury during the day touches 43-44 degrees Celsius. But in a break from the trend, the maximum temperature did not touch even 40 degrees Celsius even once this May. The mean maximum temperature for May is 39.6 degrees Celsius. It is the average of maximum temperatures recorded in May in 30 years from 1981 to 2010. However, the mean maximum temperature of May this year was just 36.6 degrees Celsius, three units lower than the mean of the past three decades. The main reason for low temperatures, particularly during the day, in May was that the city being lashed by thunderstorms at regular intervals. The first fortnight saw a steady stream of the western disturbance (WDs) that hit the Himalayan range changing weather conditions in the state and the city. In the second half of May, temperatures remained below normal because of the impact of two successive cyclones — Tauktae in the Indian western coast and Yaas in West Bengal and Odisha. The dry hot winds coming from the deserts of Rajasthan typically seen during this part of the year were completely missing. Instead, the sky remained cloudy or partly cloudy with rains on a few occasions. Though temperatures remained below normal, sultry weather conditions prevailed most of the time. The highest maximum temperature was recorded on May 16 (39.8 degrees Celsius) and the lowest maximum temperature on May 28 when mercury plummeted to 27.8 degrees Celsius, 12.4 degrees below normal. The weather was humid on Monday as well with maximum 38 degrees Celsius, 2.7 units below normal, and minimum temperature 26.5 degrees Celsius. State Met director JP Gupta said no significant change in weather is expected for a week, temperatures will rise in coming days and may touch 40 degrees in the first week of June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/coolest-may-in-20-yrs-kept-heat-wave-at-bay/articleshow/83129196.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Sr cop suspended in BJYM office-bearer assault case||Aurangabad: Senior inspector Prashant Mahajan, of the Kadeem Jalna police station, became the sixth police personnel to be suspended in the case of assault on Shivraj Naryalwale, the Jalna district secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), who has been accused of being a part of a mob that ransacked the ICU of a private hospital. Though the alleged assault took place on April 9, the video showing the policemen thrashing Naryalwale went viral only on May 27. Political bigwigs, including former CM Devendra Fadnavis and the entire BJP leadership in the state, came forward and sought action against the policemen. Meanwhile, Jalna superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh told TOI, “Prima facie, it appears the policemen were not aware if the person was politically connected. The matter is being seriously looked into and there are standing orders to initiate action against any policeman or officer found at fault.” Not satisfied with the suspension of the policemen, BJYM state president Vikran Patil and vice-president Rajendra Sable Patil unanimously demanded registration of offences against the policemen, who have been caught breaking wooden canes on the office bearer. However, the police are contending that they were compelled to use force after the mob ransacked the hospital ICU where several critical patients were under treatment. The mob was outraged after a youth, who had suffered accident injuries, died while undergoing treatment at the hospital. When contacted, Aurangabad range special IGP Prasanna Mallikarjun said, “We have suspended the inspector for his alleged role in the thrashing of the man in Jalna. As far as deputy SP Sudhir Khiradkar is concerned, we have sent a report to the state government.” Khiradkar had recently been suspended after he, along with two constables, landed in the trap set by the anti-corruption bureau. Four constables and a police sub-inspector were suspended within 24 hours of initiating a probe in the incident on May 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sr-cop-suspended-in-bjym-office-bearer-assault-case/articleshow/83123653.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||18+ vaccination starts in Howrah, Kolkata Municipal Corporation ramps up infrastructure before launch||KOLKATA/HOWRAH: After resuming Covishield first dose vaccination for senior citizens on Monday, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is gearing up to roll out the first shots for the 18-44 age group. The Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) is set to introduce vaccination for this age group from Tuesday. To begin with, the HMC authorities have identified select vaccination centres for this purpose. “Arrangements have been made for rolling out the first dose of Covid vaccines for the residents of Howrah who fall in the 18-44 age group. Initially, the jabs will be administered at Howrah district hospital, Red Cross Society building and a healthcare centre at Mandirbazar. Later, we will open more such centres,” Arup Roy, chairman of the HMC board of administrators (BoA), told TOI on Monday. In Kolkata, the KMC brass is engaged in strengthening its infrastructure and manpower before rolling out the facility for the 18+ group. According to Atin Ghosh, a member of the KMC BoA, the civic body was readying its infrastructure and would roll out the facility soon, depending on the availability of vaccines. KMC has already adopted the vaccination of this age group, which is included in the list as priority group. According to a KMC health department senior official, before rolling out the facility, which will be an added pressure on the civic body’s existing health infrastructure, the officials were engaged in rearranging the entire vaccination facilities at the ward and borough levels. “We have been running vaccination programmes for different age groups and categories at our ward-wise urban primary health centres. We have taken our infrastructure and manpower to an optimum level. That's the reason before launching vaccination for a new group, we need to ramp up our infrastructure and manpower,” a KMC health department senior official said. On Monday, elderly citizens stood in long queues in KMC vaccination centres braving intermittent rains. At some centres, seniors were caught in a jostle when the registration counters opened. A KMC health department official said more than 100 senior citizens were administered their first dose of Covishield at each of the centres in Tollygunge, Garia, Kasba, Garfa or Behala, among others, on Monday. The vaccination process for the senior citizens at these centres ended at 2pm to make room for recipients of the 45-plus age group who had registered for their first dose of Covishield through the KMC WhatsApp chatbot service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/18-vax-starts-in-howrah-kmc-ramps-up-infra-before-launch/articleshow/83125793.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Chennai||Elderly from Tamil Nadu care home take internet by storm via podcasts||CHENNAI: Until three months ago, K Subramanian, enjoyed the leisurely pace of life at the Coimbatore retirement home where he lives. Now, the 62-year-old makes audio programmes for Tapovani, an internet radio channel, with 14 others, talking about myths related to the vaccine and why the elderly should get it. Their programmes/podcasts including song and dance performances have become so popular that more than 2,000 people tune in every week. The Centre now plans similar models at 20 locations across the country on a proposal from Alagappa University. “It’s a brilliant idea that can engage the elderly. A proposal has been submitted by R Sreedhar Ramamurthy (a member of the home and brain behind the scheme) and we are examining it,” said Reddy Subhramanyam, secretary, department of social justice and empowerment, government of India. Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, Union ministry of science and technology, said, “It is good they [the elderly] are getting a voice and it will be heard.” Vigyan Prasar, department of science and technology, is set to take up the idea for discussion on June 4.The senior citizens, many of them retired doctors and government employees, were trained by students from PSG College of Technology in using microphones, audio editing software, making podcasts and uploading them. They pay Rs 3,600 a month for using Iradiolive.com, a national podcasting portal run by an NGO, to make the podcasts. While Subramanian is enjoying learning something new ‘so late in my life,’ for Anantha Ramakrishnan it is a way to show off his mridangam skills after 32 years. M N Vardarajan, another member, says, “This is an opportunity for us to showcase our talent, while Girija Nandakumar, who earlier shared stories with her grandchildren, now reaches millions of children across the world. Sreedhar Ramamurthy, who started the country’s first community radio station at Anna University in 2004, says it was a random idea. “We were alone, bored and scared during the pandemic. There was a lot of misinformation, myths and complete lack of verified medical information. So I thought why not start a small internet radio. Licensing process for a community radio station is tedious. So, we opted for I-radio live.com. We got computers, mikes, trained ourselves and began making programmes,” he said. Soon they began getting enquiries from other retirement homes in the city and Ramamurthy, an adjunct professor at Alagappa University, sent the proposal to the Centre. Ramamurthy says the elderly have so much to offer to each other and the world at large. “It’s essential that the elderly get a voice that’s heard and echoed across generations. In Kerala one hears of a retirement living community being built for doctors, where they will live together, offering their services to each other and to the larger community around them. This is where a medium like internet radio (and offline podcasts) can help. And the retirement communities would be the ideal locations to set them up,” he said. Setting up and running internet radio and podcast services can be done with minimal technological assistance and is affordable, he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/elderly-from-tn-care-home-take-internet-by-storm-via-podcasts/articleshow/83127515.cms||---

The discharge of dams will be carried such in such a way that there is no flooding to rivers in the downstream area. Soon we will hold a meeting with our counterparts in Karanataka to ensure effective coordination between irrigation authorities of both states,” he added.

Sharma, 60, was elected MLA for the first time in 1993. During this tenure, he was awarded outstanding legislator award by the assembly speaker. A four-term member of House, Sharma was elected from Sironj assembly constituency in Vidisha district in 1998, 2003 and 2008 too. He was first appointed as minister of state in the Uma Bharti led BJP government in 2003. He also served as minister of mineral and public relations. During Babulal Gaur's government, Sharma was appointed as minister of culture and later, in 2008 elevated as minister in Shivraj Singh Chouhan's government where he was given mineral and higher education portfolios. In 2014, Sharma was named in the infamous Vyapam scam and charge sheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) along with 87 other accused. He was given a clean chit by the CBI in January 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ex-min-laxmikant-sharma-dies-of-covid-19/articleshow/83127518.cms||---
---||Noida||FASTag on Yamuna Expressway from June 15||GREATER NOIDA: Latest by June 15, the FASTag toll system will be operational on Yamuna Expressway. Initially two lanes on each side will be reserved for FASTag vehicles at the three toll plazas across the 165km-long high-speed corridor between Greater Noida and Agra, officials said. The remaining lanes will continue to accept tolls in cash or digitally. A FASTag is a radio frequency identification (RFID) sticker attached to a vehicle. An RFID reader near the toll booth checks the balance and allows vehicles to pass, cutting down the time taken to collect tax manually and easing traffic movement. As per pre-Covid estimates, over 40,000 vehicles use the six-lane road daily, often leading to long queues at the toll plazas due to the absence of the electronic system. According to officials, the expressway concessionaire has signed an agreement with Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) to implement the FASTag system at the three toll plazas. As a next step, Jaypee Infratech will sign an agreement with Indian Highways Management Company Limited, the company backed by the National Highways Authority of India, in order to install the electronic toll system. YEIDA’s CEO Arun Vir Singh said, “It should not take more than a fortnight to get the system operational. All the formalities have been completed from our end. The concessionaire is looking for a system integrator who can set up the hybrid electronic toll collection system and by June 15, car owners having FASTag shall be able to move through the lanes in a seamless manner.” Jaypee Infratech sources said that since their plaza does not fall under the purview of NHAI and was privately developed, ensuring collection of the revenues was also a concern. “The money collected will come to the account of the company and a memorandum of agreement has to be signed for that with the company incorporated by NHAI for setting up the electronic system,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/fastag-on-yamuna-e-way-from-june-15/articleshow/83129208.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Vijayvargiya, Narottam meet sparks off speculations in political circles||Bhopal: A closed-door meeting between BJP's national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya and Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra sparked off speculations among political circles in the state. The meeting which lasted for an hour, was convened at Mishra's official residence where the two leaders are believed to have focused on the present political scenario in the state amid speculations over a possible rejig in the organisation and at the Centre. Vijayavargiya, who was in-charge of West Bengal affairs, reached the state capital after six months. He has not been allotted a new responsibility by the BJP leadership after the Bengal elections. During his recent visits to Indore, Vijayavargiya had expressed displeasure over decisions taken by the local administration to impose lockdown during the pandemic. As the government decided to unlock restrictions in some districts from June 1, the two leaders are believed to have discussed plans to provide relief to local industries and manufacturing sectors. "The Madhya Pradesh government has done a remarkable job to control the pandemic. The health department officials have also managed well with the district collectors to control the crisis. This was a formal courtesy meeting between two friends. I came to the capital after six months and was eager to meet some friends. Obviously, when two leaders meet they discuss politics but it was casual," Vijayavargiya said after the meeting. Home minister Mishra though ruled out any plan behind the talk. "Kailash ji was in-charge of Bengal elections and I was an assistant. He is a good friend who accepted my request to meet over a cup of tea. The meeting was casual. It should not be seen through any political prism," Mishra told reporters after the meeting. Sources in BJP disclosed that the two leaders share a good rapport and last time they met on December 8 in Bhopal ahead of assembly elections in West Bengal. Mishra was also in-charge of 48 assembly seats in Bengal. Vijayavargiya remained active in the state in the month of June last year when the BJP had plans for cabinet expansion after Shivraj Singh Chouhan took over as the chief minister for the fourth time. Now again Vijayavargiya is believed to have shifted to state politics. Speculations are rife about a possible rejig of the Union cabinet, as BJP sources disclosed that half a dozen ministers are likely to be inducted in the expansion by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BJP sources hinted that apart from Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, a few more leaders in Madhya Pradesh are hopeful to get a berth in the central cabinet. The main opposition Congress took a dig at the closed-door meeting between two BJP stalwarts hinting out at a political plan. "In one-hour closed-door meeting, Shivraj government's work was openly reviewed?" tweeted Congress state media coordinator, Narendra Saluja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vijayvargiya-narottam-meet-sparks-off-speculations-in-political-circles/articleshow/83127548.cms||Rajendra Sharma

The real estate industry is worth over Rs 90,000 crore in Bengal and there are over 10 lakh construction workers in the state. Credai Bengal president Sushil Moha said it was ready to bear the cost of vaccination of the workers. “We are ready to give space for vaccination in malls that are closed now. Credai members are ready to organize vaccination camps for construction workers,” he added. Credai was ready to pay if the state government helps in procuring vaccines. According to Mohta, there are around 1.5 lakh-2 lakh workers in organized real estate in and around the city. “There are around 300 construction sites in greater Kolkata,” he added. The total number of Credai members of Credai in the state is 250. Credai national president H V Patodia felt that the CM’s move would help the industry. “Nationally, vaccination of construction workers is a mission of Credai. So we are dedicated to vaccinating workers,” he said. According to him, the real estate industry has huge employment potential in the state. “It has a great multiplier effect and is the second highest employer in the state as well as in the country,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/credai-ready-to-vaccinate-workers/articleshow/83125834.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||‘Price fixation process erroneous’||Hyderabad: Akunuri Rambabu, working president of the Telangana wing of the Indian Pharmacists' Association, however, found fault with the way the drug price control order (DPCO) was prepared during the fag end days of the UPA regime in 2013 which is followed even now. All drugs that come under National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) are under Drug Price Control Order (DPCO) 2013. However, the DPCO is prepared by a formula which itself is erroneous, he said. He alleged that the DPCO benefits the industry and not the patient as it does not take into consideration the ex-factory price or manufacturing price of a given drug. This flaw needs to be rectified by fixing the MRP of the given drug at two or three times the ex-factory price. For example, he explained, if the manufacturing price of a drug is Rs.100 then the MRP can be fixed at Rs 200 or Rs 300. And it should not be beyond this. It cannot be several hundred times more than the manufacturing cost, he said. This would ensure a considerable fall in the prices of the drugs, he told TOI. All drugs and vaccines that are prescribed for the prevention and treatment of covid should be brought under NLEM and DPCO as per the above-mentioned formula, instead of fixing the prices as per the formula that suits the industry, Rambabu demanded. The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) should be informed of the ex-factory price and these prices should be in the public domain through its website, he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/price-fixation-process-erroneous/articleshow/83127547.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Uttar Pradesh government has betrayed relatives of dead frontline workers’||LUCKNOW: Accusing the ruling BJP of betraying family members of those frontline health workers and employees of the district and police administration who have died of Covid-19, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav regretted that the government has failed to grant even the ex-gratia relief to relatives of the deceased which was promised by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Akhilesh added that the BJP government has no time to look into grievances of family members of employees who died of Covid-19. BJP leaders are more interested in making strategies for the 2022 elections, he said, adding that the BJP is only concerned about retaining power and the people’s welfare does not figure in their priority list. “The ruling BJP is in a habit of making tall promises. The CM had himself announced financial assistance for the kin of those who died while attending Covid-19 patients. However, now, family members of such health workers, policemen and even administrative officials are being denied any financial relief by the government on one pretext or another,” Akhilesh said and added that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had turned emotional while remembering those who died of Covid-19, but the BJP has now excelled in pushing all promises under the carpet after some time. To support his allegation, Akhilesh cited an instance of sub-inspector Mukesh Arya who died of Covid-19. The former CM claimed that even after seven months of his death neither his wife is getting pension nor his son has got any job. “The family is yet to receive Rs 50 lakh that was announced by the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-has-betrayed-relatives-of-dead-frontline-workers/articleshow/83129219.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Kolkata||Off-site jab doubts cleared, drive to go on at complexes||KOLKATA: A recent circular shared by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan — which apparently indicated that only senior citizens and people with disability would be allowed to get vaccinated at housing complexes — was ruled out as a misinterpretation of the minister’s comment at a meeting at Swasthya Bhavan on Monday. Attended by representatives of private hospitals, which have been conducting vaccination at complexes, health officials said the Union minister had objected to “vaccination packages” being offered by luxury hotels and had not barred inoculation at complexes for those under 60. Times ViewAll vaccination rules and their implementation must be geared towards making the jab more accessible to citizens while ensuring there is no wastage or misuse. There has been some amount of confusion because of the change of rules midway for the second shot; some time has been lost here because of weather factors. It is important to prevent any more delay or waste of time.“Even while multiple complexes were conducting the vaccination drive on Sunday, the circular was making the rounds. It was confusing. Butwe have now been told the vaccination drive for all 18+ residents can continue at the complexes,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of NTFN, a social welfare organization in New Town and member of a network of multiple housing complexes in the township. Last Saturday, Vardhan tweeted, “Hotels offering Covid-19 vaccination packages shall face strict legal action. Such activities are in contravention to rules under the national Covid vaccination programme and must cease immediately.” The tweet was accompanied by a letter from Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, to principal health secretaries of states. While the letter said vaccination in star hotels is contrary to the guideline and must be stopped, it left loose ends as far as inoculation camps in housing societies was concerned. But with the state saying yes to off-site vaccination, private hospitals conducting such drives said they will go ahead. “The last point had created some confusion,” said Deepak Agarwal of Diamond City West, where a vaccination drive for 18+ residents was carried out on Sunday. The state health department officials on Monday, however, clarified there is no bar on private hospitals conducting off-site inoculation drives at complexes, community halls or other suitable spaces after prior approval from the health department. “Private hospitals can conduct off-site vaccination at housing societies, provided these places are suitable and the inoculation is done after due registration,” said a health department official. Spokespersons of private hospitals, like Fortis, Belle Vue, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences and Woodlands, spoke about the need to expand the drive to housing complexes. “We need to expand the avenues for vaccination to reach out to the maximum number of people at the earliest to ensure good coverage at the minimum time,” said Richa Sing Debgupta, chief of strategy and operations at Fortis Healthcare. R Venkatesh, zonal director (east), Narayana Health of RTIICS — which re-launched its inoculation drive on Friday — also said they were going to expand the drive to housing societies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/off-site-jab-doubts-cleared-drive-to-go-on-at-complexes/articleshow/83125830.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Taking to twitter, a day after Chouhan launched the Covid19 Bal Kalyan Yojana, the senior Congress leader said: “All schemes of the Shivraj government are on paper, just flashy. People do not get any benefit from them. The government always wakes up and talks about digging wells after the fire have spread.” The LoP said that the state government failed to anticipate the Covid second wave. No arrangements were made for production and supply of medical oxygen. Only when people died, then they wokeup and started making announcements of setting-up oxygen manufacturing plants. “After thousands of people died because of the dearth of treatment and hospital beds in the state, then they (the government) started discussing about increasing beds,” Nath said. “No provision was made for remdesivir injections. When people died because of its shortage, then they started talking about its procurement,” he said. “When they had to save lives, prevent children from becoming helpless, then they were sleeping and thereafter, announced schemes that will never benefit the real victims,” he added. The former chief minister said that over the last three months, people were being robbed and looted in hospitals, patients were pleading for help. “The government was in deep slumber. Now when the Corona numbers are decreasing and hospitals are being vacated, then the government remembered to issue treatment guidelines for hospitals and fixed the rates for beds and treatment,” Nath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/govt-schemes-exist-only-on-paper-dont-reach-needy-nath/articleshow/83127584.cms||---

On Monday around 10.30 am, Vipin Jain (43) drove to Father Agnel School, Sector 62, to get the vaccine. A senior employee of the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS), Jain wanted to take Covaxin and he was relieved to finally get a slot after repeated attempts.Jain said he stays in Jaypee Greens Kosmos and the government centre was about 17 km away. He reached on time and after verifying his details, the officials gave him a slip and asked him to proceed for the vaccine shot. “When my turn came, the paramedic administering the injection asked me about my health. I told her I had Covid in April and on April 20, I tested negative,” Jain said. The paramedic told him he cannot be vaccinated now and he will have to wait till at least July 20 to get the dose, as per the latest guidelines framed by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.While he was having this conversation, Jain got a text message on his phone that said he has been “successfully vaccinated” with the first dose. It also had a link to download his certificate. “I clicked on it and my certificate said I got the dose,” he said.Officials at the vaccination site said there was no way to update the status on Co-WIN from their end and he should call up the helpline. After several attempts, Jain got through and spoke to the technical support team handling Co-WIN at 0120 – 4473222. “But I was told there is no way to reverse the status now,” Jain said.When he sought help with the process of registering again, he was told next time he should book a slot on Co-WIN using a different mobile number and a different photo ID proof. “That was the only solution they offered,” he said.The health department officials in Gautam Budh Nagar said once the details of a person are verified and updated on the portal at the session site, confirmation text message and certificate are generated in a few minutes.“Once a person takes the slip, it is assumed that he/she is getting the dose. This is a rare case,” said district immunisation officer Neeraj Tyagi. He added that the matter will be taken up with senior officials. Told about the incident, retired chief medical officer, UP, Ashok Mishra, said a handwritten note with a stamp of the booth in-charge should be issued to such people. “If the status is not changed then the person would be treated as someone who is seeking his first shot more than once,” said Mishra, who stays in Noida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/no-jab-taken-but-man-gets-a-vax-certificate/articleshow/83129233.cms||Shalabh

---||India||When Mysuru royalty popularised vaccine||MYSURU: The early years of the 19th century were a period of scientific and social ferment in the United Kingdom. One of the greatest breakthroughs in medicine — the vaccine for the deadly smallpox disease — was developed by English physician Dr Edward Jenner in that period. In faraway Mysuru, which was an English Colony, members of the royal family were among those who volunteered to take the vaccination to popularise its use among the people. The then Maharani Lakshamammanni took the lead in getting other members of the royal family to take the vaccine. Her daughter-in-law, who was the wife of Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, was the first to take the vaccine for the disease — a historic incident that was committed to history by Ireland-born painter Thomas Hickey, who rendered it in oil on canvas. Although many historians have claimed that the woman in this painting, a precursor to the ‘vaccine selfie’ is Devajammani, PV Nanjaraj Urs begs to differ. Nanjaraj Urs, who has chronicled the history of the Mysuru royal family, said that he did not find Devajammani’s name mentioned in any of the historical documents found in the palace relating to the painting. Editor of Arasu Dhwani N Nanjundaraje Urs confirmed the former’s observations. Nanjaraj Urs said that the vaccine drive in Mysuru had been carried out at the Mysuru Palace between 1805 and 1808. “At that time, the population of those living within the confines of the Mysuru Fort was around 7,000 to 8,000. A large number of people were falling prey to smallpox. It was in this backdrop that the vaccination came to Mysuru,” he said. Notwithstanding the efforts of the colonial rulers to convince the local population about the benefits of taking the vaccination, they were extremely reluctant. “Local medicines were not effective against the disease. It was then that Rajamatha Lakshamammanni decided that the palace and those in it should set an example by taking the vaccination,” Nanjaraj Urs said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/when-mysuru-royalty-popularised-vaccine/articleshow/83132667.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Mission June to inoculate 1 crore starts with a bang today in||LUCKNOW: Almost all of the 1.75 lakh slots for Covid-19 vaccination in the 18-44 age category were reported to be booked by Monday evening ahead of the launch of UP government’s Mission June in which the state has pledged to vaccinate one crore persons over the next four weeks. Data from the health department indicated that over 1.75 lakh slots were booked by people in the 18 plus category speaking for an outstanding start of the campaign that promises to change UP’s fate in the anticipated third wave. Officials also said that over 1.5 lakh registrations in the 45 plus category were also recorded. “Vaccination is important to the strategy to face the impending third wave and it is for this that UP has made arrangements to vaccinate as many eligible persons as possible,” said additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal, citing Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath here on Monday. He added that Mission June is arguably the biggest Covid-19 vaccination drive launched anywhere in the country. Figures also speak for the hefty target ahead. According to the CoWin Portal, as many as 1.83 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in Uttar Pradesh since the launch of the drive on January 16, 2021. In terms of persons, 34.79 lakh have been fully vaccinated in the state, while 1.48 crore persons have been given the first dose. A target of one crore vaccinations over the next month would mean that health teams will conduct over 3.4 lakh vaccinations every single day. Going by the registrations in the 18 plus and 45 plus categories, it appears that UP is very close to the daily target set. Speaking about the vaccination drive, ACS, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that a gamut of arrangements have been made to facilitate people to get their vaccine shot. “The government will be holding dedicated camps for large groups like state employees, teachers, trader associations and very large community groups at special Covid vaccination centres and drive-in vaccination camps besides the regular vaccination sites,” he said. Officials in the health department assured that the government had enough stock of vaccines for the job. “We have about 30 lakh doses in hand while more stock is expected over the week. The outcome of the global tender to procure four crore doses is also expected to bear fruits very soon,” said an insider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mission-june-to-inoculate-1cr-starts-with-a-bang-today/articleshow/83129246.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Three hours business window brings relief for retail shops||KOLKATA: The Bengal government on Monday allowed stand-alone shops, including those selling liquor, to operate for three hours — noon to 3pm — from Tuesday. Retailers have welcomed the announcement from chief minister Mamata Banerjee. On May 28, Banerjee had announced the extension of restrictions till June 16. Curbs on retail had been enforced on May 16 to stem the surge in Covid cases across the state. Only grocery stores and daily essential markets were allowed to operate from 7am to 10am. With a decline in the number of infections since the curbs came into effect, the state has now announced some relaxation to other shops. Owners of off-shops are now awaiting an Excise department order. There are 350 bars (on-shops) apart from over 1,500 off-shops and country spirit shops in Kolkata. It is, however, unclear if retail shops in civic markets will be allowed to open and whether grocery stores can do business twice a day — in the morning and in the afternoon. The relaxation comes as a huge relief to households, too. “We had trouble with the sudden announcement of restrictions. At home, our domestic helps stopped coming and I was desperately looking for a sturdy mop with a handle. But all the hardware shops were shut. My son required paper to complete his project for school, but that was held up as well. I think many have faced similar problems. This three-hour window will be of great help,” said Sayantan Ghosh, a college teacher from Jadavpur. Confederation of West Bengal Traders’ Association president Sushil Poddar said the association had made an appeal to the CM three days ago, highlighting the sector’s woes and seeking relief. “Since everyone is not conversant with online recharge of mobile phones, many elderly citizens trying to stay in touch with their children who live elsewhere over phone have been facing a problem. Others want to buy some non-essential items, including stationery. This three-hour window will help them,” said Poddar. Publishers and Booksellers’ Guild also welcomed the announcement. Guild general secretary Suhanshu Shekhar Dey expressed gratitude towards the CM for responding to their appeal positively. “The opening of book stores will be of immense help to publishers, book lovers, students, scholars, readers and writers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-hr-biz-window-brings-relief-for-retail-shops/articleshow/83125963.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The land is reserved for the public amenities in the development plant of the civic body. City mayor Satish Kulkarni gave a nod to the proposal during the GB meeting. All the corporators supported the proposal but urged the mayor to have some NMC involvement related to bed reservation as the land belongs to the civic body. Kulkarni said a meeting of all-party group leaders will be called on the issue. The civic administration had tabled the proposal at Monday’s GB as per instructions by the district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal during a meeting held in February and as per the letter by the district collector Suraj Mandhare, seeking transfer of land for the proposed first government medical college and hospital under MUHS. Bhujbal on Monday conducted the meeting with the MUHS officials after the NMC’s decision was announced. He asked the MUHS to enter into an agreement with the Nashik Civil Hospital at the earliest to use the infrastructure for the students of the medical college and hospital by the time their hospital is constructed. “The MUHS has already entered into an agreement with Dr Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre where it would be sending the students admitted for postgraduate courses in its college to take lessons and do practicals till the time the construction is completed. Similarly, it will also require civil hospital for its students and hence these formalities should be completed immediately,” Bhujbal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gb-approves-proposal-to-give-land-for-medical-college-hosp/articleshow/83123857.cms||---

The MP attacked basic education minister Satish Dwivedi for the alleged misappropriation of funds, raising the issue of the recent employment of his brother on the basis of an allegedly fake economically weaker section certificate. Singh has also accused Dwivedi of having purchased property for much less than its market value after he was elected MLA in 2017. “Between February 11 and March 31, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Residential Schools for girls from SC/ST backgrounds were closed due to novel coronavirus pandemic. Despite that, money was reportedly spent on purchasing food, fruits, milk, soap, oil, and stationery. Rs 9 crore was spent on food when the schools were closed,” Singh said, adding that this included Rs 84 lakh withdrawn in Bareilly, Rs 74 lakh in Bijnore, Rs 68 lakh in Deoria, Rs 31 lakh in Fatepur, Rs 18 lakh in Ghaziabad, Rs 96 lakh in Gonda, Rs 23 lakh in Mau, Rs 26 lakh in Meerut, Rs 39 lakh in Moradabad, Rs 76 lakh in Pratapgarh and Rs 38 lakh in Varanasi. “In 2020, a rule was made that photos of students and their classes would have to be uploaded on the Prerna portal for funds to be released. In Sonebhadra, where funds were taken out for the school, the minister in-charge is the basic education minister himself,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-alleges-scam-worth-rs-9cr-in-basic-edu-department/articleshow/83129265.cms||---

The deceased, Raghunath, his wife Vimlesh (35), sons Subhash and Naresh, and a neighbour Roopwati had gone to get fodder from the fields. The bees stung the villagers when a bee-hive on one of the trees was suddenly hit by a sorghum bush they had been carrying. Raghunath was badly wounded due to the attack as the others could not help him evade the collective bee attack, villagers said. He, along with the other injured persons, were taken to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences, where Raghunath succumbed to his injuries. Tejpal Singh Bhati from the Failanda village said that one of trees had a beehive formed at it and while cutting the fodder, a jowar (sorgum) shrub hit the beehive accidently following which the bees attacked Raghunath. “When the other accused persons tried to save Raghunath, they too were attacked by the bees and got bitten. However, Raghunath was stung several times by a swarm of bees,” he said. Rabupura SHO Dinesh Yadav told TOI that they are yet to receive information about the case. “We will get a post-mortem conducted in case an information is received,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/stung-by-bees-man-dies-in-gr-noida/articleshow/83129268.cms||Shikha Salaria

Heavy winds and snowfall, resulting from Tauktae and Yaas cyclones, made things very difficult, following which sherpas advised her not to proceed further post May 29, he said. “Kasturi would have become the first person from Kolhapur and youngest from Maharashtra to have conquered the Everest. She waited for five days for window to open, but in vain,” said Adake. According to Adake, Kasturi took the southeast cone route via Nepal to reach the base camp, which is at a height of 5,400 metres, on May 18. She was expected to reach the Everest summit on May 25 under normal circumstances. The climb till camps 1 and 2 was normal. However, the weather became bad soon after she, along with 150 other mountaineers, reached camp 3. Daughter of Deepak Savekar, a four-wheeler mechanic, and housewife Manasvini, Kasturi had started trekking right since her childhood. She has completed tough treks in Maharashtra, like Panhala-Pawankhind, Sinhgad-Raigad and Alang-Malang-Kulang. Savekar said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, climbing the Everest was cancelled in 2020, forcing his daughter to wait for a year. Manasvini said, “Today morning, I got a chance to speak with Kasturi after four-five days. She is all right and determined to conquer Mount Everest next year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/inclement-weather-halts-kolhapur-girls-final-climb-to-peak-of-everest/articleshow/83123909.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The project which is expected to change the socio-economic situation of the area has been mired in troubles for years.On last Friday, local villagers intercepted a truck carrying 19 tonne iron ore and reported the matter to district administration. It was found that the material was being taken away without paying royalty. Papers with the driver said the ore was being taken for sampling purpose. Sampling is done to ascertain the grade, on the basis of which royalty is paid. However, questions are being raised about need of taking as much has 19 tonne ore merely for sampling.Gadchiroli collector Deepak Singla, who confirmed the development, said the company has been fined and the management has assured to comply. The consignment was being taken away without filing the mandatory online details. An official in the district’s mining office said a fine of Rs25,000 has been levied on the company, also confirming that the truck was intercepted by the locals.Iron ore mining in Surjagarh area of Naxalite-infested Gadchiroli has always been a controversial issue. The mining lease has been granted to Lloyds Metals and Energy Limited (LMEL). The company could not start full-fledged operations, mainly due to Naxal threat. Over the years, there have been incidents of burning of equipment and also killing of a company officer.Lately, LMEL, which continues to hold the mining licence (ML), had outsourced the contract to mine the ore to Odisha’s Triveni Earth Movers.When LMEL did the mining on its own, it required police protection at the site, which could be not be made available in continuity. This stopped mining operations for long periods. Triveni Earth Movers had started mining a month ago.Sources said Triveni Earth Movers had agreed to carry out mining without police protection as it had experience of operations in other Naxal areas like Odisha.Officials said LMEL also has earlier royalty dues of Rs2.65 crore. This is expected to be cleared soon. The operators have also agreed to repair the weigh-bridge so that material taken out can be measured properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/surjagarh-mining-starts-truck-caught-for-non-payment-of-royalty/articleshow/83123897.cms||Shishir Arya
---||India||Even as Congess panel meets, Capt FB page calls him ‘CM face’||JALANDHAR: A day ahead of the three-member panel set up by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi beginning one-on-one meetings with Punjab Congress MLAs and ministers to address the infighting, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh’s Facebook campaign page, “Punjab Da Captain”, projected him as the CM candidate for 2022 assembly polls. The slogan “Punjab Da Captain” was first projected in 2017, and this FB page has been working since then. The post, titled “In 2022 also Punjab Da Captain will be CM face”, claimed that the “Congress high command is standing like a rock with Punjab’s Captain, in 2022 also (he) would be the party’s face, people of Punjab will make him victorious (sic)”. A clip inserted in the post also states that he would be the CM face in 2022. Many of the comments on the post are negative and raise questions. Announcing a CM candidate has always been considered the prerogative of Congress high command. The three-member panel — comprising Congress general secretary and party Punjab affairs in charge Harish Rawat, leader of the opposition in RS Malikarjun Kharge and former Delhi Congress president JP Aggarwal — has called 25 MLAs to Delhi on Monday. Over the next two days the panel will hold meetings with MLAs and ministers. This projection of Amarinder as the Congress CM candidate on his FB page was made on Sunday. As per party insiders, Amarinder has upped the ante just as the party high command started to intervene. He has been facing criticism from MLAs Navjot Sidhu and Pargat Singh, while some ministers have held meetings with them. Some ministers and most of the MLAs have not taken any side as yet. In February, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar had twice announced the starting of the “Captain for 2022” campaign, which virtually meant declaring Amarinder as the CM candidate. But the move fizzled out after Pargat said it was prerogative of the party high command.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/even-as-cong-panel-meets-capt-fb-page-calls-him-cm-face/articleshow/83132784.cms||IP Singh

---||Chandigarh||Overcoming the Covid Hurdle: Challenges, Opportunities and Threats in Online Education||The Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have presented a variety of challenges and opportunities in the field of education, particularly with the increased assimilation of the use of online methods such as video conferencing. Mehak Jain talks to academicians about the struggle of students as they continue with online education. For teachers too, it has been a trying time to handle students and monitor their understanding and progress. It has become a testing time to reach out to students who do not have access to the internet, and who do not have their personal smartphones. Covid has also put brakes on the activities and competitions that develop the overall personality of students. A course of action has to be taken especially with regard to fees. The college has to pay 40% of what it collects as university fees. If the university reduces its fees, the college can pass on the benefit to students. Besides this, the university has to simplify the syllabus and make it more interactive by changing the pattern and the content of the syllabus. Also, reducing the syllabus by 30% can help students focus on quality education. For their assistance, lectures have to be recorded and uploaded so that students can learn at their own pace and time. These certain changes will make the teaching-learning process more meaningful. Lastly, the timetable should have slots of one hour each to make it easier for students to log in and attend classes. Even when staff is working from home, a roster can be prepared to inform students of teachers who will be available on campus so that they can fix appointments and meet teachers in a safe environment keeping all the Covid restrictions in place. Ranjodh Singh | President | Ramgarhia Educational Council from Ramgarhia Girls College Online teaching cannot be replaced with physical teaching and can only be complementary to physical classes. But in this time of pandemic, it is the only alternative and this is the means to stay connected with students. In highly developed countries, they have strengthened technology but as India is a developing nation, a lot of funding is required in the education sector. From the teaching methodology to the change is exam system is direly needed to improve the style and system of learning. More blended learning methods, by conducting seminars, workshops where harnessing the expertise from overseas has helped a lot of students. However, science subjects that are practical cannot be taught online alone. Dr Gurpreet Kaur Sandhu | Principal of SCD Government College Education and learning are different aspects and they are mostly dependent on infrastructure. Few students having mobile phones do not have sufficient data to attend six lectures a day. About 2% of girls are quitting college due to economic reasons and family issues and opting for correspondence education. Online education is not a bad mode as the students have flexibility but both, teachers and students have to be responsible for making it successful. In offline classes, teachers control the attention of students, but in an online class, the teacher has to monitor attendance, attention, and teaching. If exams happen offline, the students would definitely be serious and attentive in online studies. Most of the students who wanted degree for the sake of degree are happy, but few think about the career hence putting an impact on real learning. Also, the government has to be serious and give employment opportunities as students are moving abroad Dr Sukhwinder Kaur | Principal | Government College for Girls Online classes have unfortunately decreased access for students from economically disadvantaged students, many of whom cannot afford laptops, smartphones, and high-speed internet. Additionally, it has also become harder to hold the attention of students over video conferencing platforms. Classes that are held in-person enable a teacher to hold the attention of students due to the physical presence while also getting feedback through their facial expressions and body language. That has become more difficult with online classes. But, it has allowed universities and schools to continue educating their students despite the circumstances, and also reduced the time taken up by ancillary activities, such as the commute to university, which would take up hours for some students. Dr Sajla | Head | Department of Economics, SCD Government College This is the third semester which will be held online, now is the time where government should develop a system that is student- and teacher-friendly and which gives accuracy and transparency in conducting classes. We must have a selective platform at affordable prices than free platforms free platforms are without features. Teachers and students are using temporary arrangements unlike foreign universities and colleges we lack technical resources. Therefore, there is a need to have a mechanism and an established platform as postponing exams is not a solution. Dr Ashwani Bhalla | Dean | Academic Affairs at SCD Government College It’s been a year and students are losing interest as there is academic fatigue. Students are patiently looking for offline classes, now, there is a fear of uncertainty and stress that has been built up. The average online attendance in colleges is 60% and there is a drop in admissions of girls due to economic problems. A sensible approach to the Covid-19 issue is needed, and we can not rely totally on the government to be responsible. This is an opportunity for every student to be responsible for their academics and become socially aware to bind with family and look after mental health.

The forest department, the nodal department for the drive, will plant 10.8 crore trees followed by the rural development department which has been given the target of planting 10.5 crore trees. Besides, 23 government departments will also take an active part in the drive to make it a success. Reviewing the preparations virtually on Monday, chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari directed senior administrative officers of various departments to chalk out a foolproof strategy to avoid glitches.  Tiwari directed district plantation committees to finalise the plantation programme in their respective districts. He said the committees, headed by district magistrates and having divisional forest officers as its members, would have to play a major role in planting of the targeted number of tree saplings in districts. Advising the officers to ensure that these committees should meet at least once a week, the chief secretary asked divisional commissioners to review the preparation for the plantation drive fortnightly. Tiwari said that he would now meet divisional commissioners and district magistrates next Monday to review the progress. For geo-tagging of the plantation sites and for inter-departmental coordination, control rooms will be set up at the DM and DFO offices in every district. The forest department has raised at least 42 crore saplings at 1,755 nurseries for the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/preps-begin-for-july-plantation-drive/articleshow/83129270.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||U’khand govt forms panel to look into proposed change of syllabus as recommended by NCERT||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand education department has set up a committee to look into the proposed change of syllabus as recommended by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT). The proposed change is concerning the National Curriculum Framework (NRF) policy. Notably, the school syllabus for all classes hasn’t been modified since 2005. The NCERT has directed all states to give their feedback with regard to the change of syllabus, especially in the context of their respective regions. The state education department has made the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) the nodal department for this purpose. The SCERT has already constituted four teams — of 25 members each — to give suggestions to the Centre from Uttarakhand. The teams will prepare a syllabus with a blend of local state culture. Barring the ICSE/ISC board, the NCERT syllabus applies to all the CBSE and UBSE board schools of the state. This forms around 85% of the total schools in the state. Meanwhile, teachers and other staff members of government-aided colleges of the state wrote a letter to the Uttarakhand CM on Monday and sought an appointment from him. The staff members have been complaining for a long time that the state is overlooking government-aided colleges, leading to their degradation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-govt-forms-panel-to-look-into-proposed-change-of-syllabus-as-recommended-by-ncert/articleshow/83123970.cms||Mohammad Anab

The national agency had completed the same stretch of road in 18 hours. The entire road of 39.671 km — from Pusegaon to Mhasurne in Satara district — was completed in 24 hours with the help of a private contractor. NHAI had recently built the Solapur-Vijapur road in record time. A team of 15 engineers of the state PWD, 60 engineers of the private contractor, 47 inspectors, 23 quality control engineers, 150 drivers and 110 workers toiled in three shifts to complete the road from Pusegaon to Mhasurne. After learning about the record, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke to the officers, engineers and congratulated them for achieving the near-impossible feat. PWD’s superintendent engineer Sanjay Mungilwar said, “We did mirco-level planning to build the road in record time. We placed six teams at different places so that the building work starts at six sites at the same time. Along with quantity, we also ensured quality of the road being built.” He added that they used high grade equipments to check the quality of the raw materials as well as the quality of the road built. Around 1,100 metric tonnes of tar and 6,000 cubic meter load of gravels were put to use to build the road. Around 8 hot-mix plants, 7 sensor pavers, 12 vibratory rolls, 6 pneumatic rollers and 180 dumper were used to make the material, transport and build. To start with, the PWD had set up a think tank of its top engineers for planning. Also the department set up a war room to coordinate and communicate during actual work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-pwd-builds-25-5-km-road-in-14-hours-breaks-nhais-record/articleshow/83124001.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||India’s first spurious favipiravir racket busted||AHMEDABAD: Even as the police continue to crack down on those selling fake remdesivir, another racket — in what is touted to be the country’s first case of counterfeit anti-viral drug favipiravir — has been busted in the state. The state food and drugs control authority carried out statewide raids and seized 5,850 tablets worth Rs 7.5 lakh sold by a fake pharmaceutical manufacturing firm to seven pharma outlets in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat and Bhavnagar. The FDCA identified the alleged kingpin as Sudip Mukherji who ran Max Relief Healthcare. The firm operated from Gwalior and used to push the fake drugs through a website for online sales. The fake anti-viral drug were sold as Favimax-400 and Favimax-200. FDCA officials are now concerned if these tablets have already made their way to patients. Mukherji’s firm was shown to be fictitiously registered in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. He even claimed that he marketed his fake anti-viral concoction through a Kolkata-based firm, Covalent Healthcare. “We found this marketing firm to be fake,” says Gujarat FDCA chief HG Koshia. He said that after remdesivir and tocilizumab, favipiravir was the next candidate for duplicates as its demand had increased four times in the state during the April-May pandemic surge. “I have not heard of fake favipiravir being seized anywhere else. We checked with the DGCI,” says Koshia. Elaborating on the modus operandi, FDCA officials claimed that Mukherji’s firm supplied the drug to Meditab Worldwide in Kandivali, Mumbai, and two firms in Ahmedabad called Anisum Lifesciences and RB Remedies. However, the bulk of the tablets were routed through Meditab into the Gujarat market. These were supplied to pharmacies and stockists in Ahmedabad like Krishna Pharma at Ellisbridge, Kivonyx in Changodar, and Kakmax Pharmaceuticals in Kathwada. In Rajkot, the tablets were supplied to Oncovac Orange and Jaliyan Pharma. In Surat, the fake anti-virals were supplied to Run Medway and Sanskruti Pharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/countrys-first-spurious-favipiravir-racket-busted/articleshow/83127677.cms||---

Applications under this system will have to be cleared within 15 days, failing which it will be deemed as approved. Directions have been issued for promotion of ethanol manufacturing in the state under the Centre’s Ethanol Blended Petro Programme. Quoting environment experts, a government spokesperson said ethanol mixed with petrol could reduce carbon monoxide pollution by 35%. “The Centre is aiming 20% ethanol mix in petrol by 2030. Last year, the target was set at 10% by 2022,” the spokesperson said. The state government is also promoting manufacture of ethanol from sugarcane and cereals. Under this, 54 projects of ethanol production from sugarcane have been taken up, along with seven projects for making ethanol from rice, wheat, barley, maize and sorghum. Out of these, 27 sugarcane-related projects have been completed while the remaining will be over by September-end. Projects related to ethanol from rice, wheat, barley, maize and sorghum will start in the next few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/single-window-nod-for-ethanol-plants/articleshow/83129291.cms||---

Though the hospital administration provided oxygen concentrators to patients admitted in the Covid ward, one woman died while the patients were being shifted to another ward. Her relatives alleged that she died due to oxygen shortage. The administration has denied the charges and assured an enquiry in the matter.Around 11am on Monday, while digging to set up a new oxygen plant in the hospital, the labourers accidentally struck the electricity cable leading to power failure. As the oxygen pressure was low the doctors tried shifting the patients to another ward. During this time a woman patient died. Relatives present on the spot accused the hospital for negligence and said that she died due to low oxygen pressure.Electricity department staff rushed to the hospital but were unable to track the fault. The electricity was resumed at 3pm. Finally, it was found that the main electricity cable had been struck accidentally.Ward in-charge Santosh told the media that the hospital provided oxygen concentrators as soon as there was power outage. She denied that there was any death due to low oxygen pressure. Dr Alok Shrivastava, principal medial officer, also denied any such incident. However, Gaurav, resident of Chavani and the deceased patient’s son told the media that his mother Geeta Devi was in the female ward. Her oxygen saturation was 80-85%. The staff asked Gaurav to bring an oxygen cylinder from the ground floor, when he came back with the cylinder he found his mother dead. He said that he will lodge a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/power-failure-at-beawar-hosp-kin-allege-death-by-o2-shortage/articleshow/83127676.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||BJP general secretary, vice-president take stock of Uttar Pradesh, meet CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: The UP BJP went into a huddle on Monday as the party’s national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and vice-president Radha Mohan Singh held a meeting with organizational leaders. The two leaders also had a closed-door meeting with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at his official residence. While the state BJP termed it to be a regular organisational exercise, the meetings gain significance as the state is set to go to polls next year. Sources said the two leaders sought feedback on political situation on the ground and public perception about the ruling party, especially in wake of pandemic. The development came a day after BJP launched relief operations through its ‘Sewa hi Sangathan’ campaign to blunt the opposition’s attack on handling of pandemic. A senior BJP leader said Santhosh and Singh assessed the impact of the campaign launched by the party to lend a healing touch to people affected by the second wave of the pandemic. UP BJP general secretary, Govind Narayan Shukla, said: “The leaders stressed on reaching out to maximum number of people affected by the pandemic. The leadership also decided to help the state government in ramping up vaccination drive in urban and rural areas.” Sources said the two leaders also sought feedback separately from six regional presidents of the party – Shesh Narayan Mishra, Manvendra Singh, Mohit Beniwal, Mahesh Chandra Srivastava, Dharmendra Singh Saithwar and Rajnikant Maheshwari. They also met UP ministers Suresh Khanna, Brijesh Pathak, Jai Pratap Singh and Dara Singh Chauhan. The meeting had evoked curiosity in view of recent panchayat elections in which the opposition parties, especially Samajwadi Party, had put up a formidable challenge. Sources said Santhosh stressed on scaling up of the party’s outreach in rural areas through campaigns with focus on schemes launched by the central and the Uttar Pradesh government. Sources said the issue of election of zila and kshetra panchayat chairmen, which have been kept in abeyance by the government due to pandemic, was also discussed. The BJP has opened back channel talks with independent candidates to win most zila and kshetra panchayat seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-gen-secy-vice-president-take-stock-of-up-meet-yogi/articleshow/83129298.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Four decades ago, assembly sparred over Lakshadweep||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala assembly which unanimously passed a resolution on Monday on Lakshadweep issue had once earlier witnessed an instance where the legislators sparred over the validity of the question on denial of organisational and individual rights in Lakshadweep. Pinarayi Vijayan, who moved the resolution on Monday, was one of the legislators who had asked the question in the assembly. In 1972, during the sixth session of the legislative assembly, CPM Beypore MLA K Chathunni master along with eight other legislators asked whether the news reports about the violation of individual and organisational rights of people in Lakshadweep had come to the notice of the government. . K Karunakaran, who was the then home minister, replied that it concerned Lakshadweep and it did not come under the limits of the state. CBC Warrier didn’t budge and said that it was an issue people of Kerala were interested in and that the government had a commitment towards the issue and hence it was raised. Moideenkutty Haji, who was the speaker, guided the home minister to reply saying that the question was regarding the news report and if it had come to the state government’s notice, yes or no could be given as answer. Karunakaran replied that the news report had come to the government’s notice. Haji further ruled that Lakshadweep did not come under the purview of Kerala. “The question was admitted since our people resided there and because it was asked whether the government knew about violation of organisational rights to people of Lakshadweep. There is no need for further explanation in this regard,” he had ruled. Warrier asked whether the government had communicated regarding Lakshadweep issues to the Centre since the problems had come to the state government’s notice. The matter ended with Karunakaran replying that it was not possible to divulge anything then. Political historian Cherian Philip said that Lakshadweep was ruled by the Centre and hence it was a natural reply to a question regarding the issues there. “The issue which led to that question in the assembly is not clear, it may not have been communal, it could have been some other issue. The assembly declined to deliberate on that matter then because there was no way the state government could have replied on an issue concerning an island ruled by the Centre. There is a difference between a question and a resolution since the resolution is warranted by a common cause,” said Philip. Officials with the archives section in the assembly couldn’t recollect the issue on which the question was raised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/four-decades-ago-assembly-sparred-over-lakshadweep/articleshow/83126048.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The organisation offers meal at a token amount of Rs 10 per plate to people while Covid patients are supplied free of cost. The organisation on Monday started its third booth in the city in Salem Tabri near Sheran Wala Mandir. Praveen Dang, spokesperson of the organisation, said, “The initiative has been started in the remembrance of Deewan Todar Mal, who bought expensive piece of land in history for the cremation of family of revered Sikh guru Gobind Singh. Under our initiative, we are serving nutritious meal to the needy people at just Rs 10 per plate. This token amount is being taken so that we do not hurt the self respect of those, who despite being under extreme circumstances would not accept the meal for free. However, we will not charge those who come to us and cannot pay for their meals. We are also sending these meals free of cost to Covid patients as and when required.” According to Dang, already two distribution points have been setup by the NGO for distribution of the meals — one at at Gandhi Nagar, another at Gill Road. On Monday, a third one has been started at Salem Tabri. “This initiative of not letting anyone sleep without food is a very small effort on our part that we could do to repay to the society and nation. Our organisation will continue with opening more distribution outlets for offering meals in every nook and corner of the city,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/city-based-ngo-offers-meals-for-rs-10-free-for-covid-patients/articleshow/83129301.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

What effect does the Covid-19 infection have on the heart? Dr Kamal Sharma, a city-based interventional cardiologist, said ACE 2 receptors, associated with the entry of Covid into human cells, is present in hearts. “Thus, many Covid patients report cardiac issues such as irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate causing poor blood flow), thrombosis (clotting in the blood stream), pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the right chambers of the heart) among others,” he said. He said that regular health check-ups are a must for cardiac health after Covid, to reduce the chances of severe problems or fatality. “Complications such as myocarditis (inflammation of heart wall tissue) should be detected in time,” said Dr Sharma. Dr Jayesh Prajapati, head of the cardiology department at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology, said peripheral vascular disease, arterial gangrene, etc. were also seen during this wave. “Compared to last year, we have witnessed a smaller number of stroke patients. The patients, however, were presented with higher lung involvement,” he said. For existing heart patients, the Covid infection comes as a double whammy as several operated patients came back with further complications, said city-based cardiac surgeons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cardiac-health-crucial-after-covid-recovery/articleshow/83127674.cms||---

A provision for special withdrawal of EPFO funds was introduced by the government in March last year under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY). The scheme, aimed at helping workers tide over the pandemic-induced financial difficulties, had allowed non-refundable withdrawal of funds to the extent of basic wages and dearness allowances for three months, or up to 75% of the amount standing to member's credit in the EPF account. Labour ministry sources said the Covid-19 advance facility has been availed by nearly 76.31 lakh applicants and an advance of Rs 18,698.15 crore was released. The government said members who have already availed the first Covid-19 advance will also be permitted to opt for a second advance and the process for withdrawal will be the same. The ministry also said that it has accorded top priority to Covid-19 claims and EPFO has been directed to settle all Covid-19 related claims and requests for advance within three days of the receipt of such claims. To facilitate prompt settlement, EPFO has also deployed a system driven auto-claim settlement process in respect of all members whose KYC requirements is complete in all respects. Auto-mode of settlement, the government said, has enabled EPFO to reduce the claim settlement cycle to 3 days as against the statutory requirement to settle the claims within 20 days.

She said that the concentrators also have a low capacity of generating oxygen. The district collector has assured her of an inquiry into the matter. Bhadel stormed into the collectorate carrying the oxygen concentrators that were purchased by the health department. She told reporters that she had sanctioned Rs 25 lakh from MLA fund to purchase oxygen concentrators for people of Ajmer. She said 26 concentrators were purchased with a capacity of 10 litres and the department paid Rs 83,000 per concentrator. “The market rate of such concentrator is not more than Rs 30,000,” Bhadel said. She also charged that these concentrators are of low quality and look like toys. There is no name of any company on the concentrators and there is sticker stating that it is made in China. There is also no detail when it was manufactured, she added.She said quality oxygen concentrators have compressors weighing 26 to 30kg, but the concentrators purchased by health department in Ajmer weigh much low. She pointed out that if the purchase from MLA fund has been made in such way, then what would be the quality of other medical equipment purchased by the state government. Health minister Raghu Sharma is also from Ajmer, but he has turned a blind eye towards this issue, she said. She demanded a high-level inquiry in the matter. Meanwhile district collector Prakash Rajpurohit has assured her of an inquiry. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/low-quality-o2-concentrators-bought-using-funds-bjp-mla/articleshow/83127678.cms||---

The triage centre has also been moved out of the GH.Though the number of Covid-19 cases has begun dropping, ambulances both 108 and private kept driving into the college almost continuously.When TOI was at the spot, there were at least 12 ambulances lined up outside the in-patient ward.The waiting time for a bed too had reduced by five to six hours to hardly one to two hours for most patients.But it was chaotic for many new patients who had no idea where the triage centre was and just began standing in front of the OP counter.One of the attendants was in tears because he was waiting outside with his 76-year-old mother for the past 45 minutes.At 12.30 pm, the first ward with 120 beds and oxygen facilities was full. Doctors and staff were running around trying to get another 46 beds on the first floor of the auditorium building ready.“That section is challenging because very sick patients can’t be transferred in their stretchers upstairs. Though there was a makeshift camp set up with another 50 beds and another ward also being set up, we don’t have electricity connections for them yet,” said medical director Dr Sadagopan, who was on inspection.Health officers said they needed some form of a task force to ensure visitors and attendants were kept outside the campus and someone to coordinate all the logistics.“The logistics include ensuring visitor vehicles don’t enter or park within the premises, ensure vehicles don’t block ambulances and visitors don’t crowd in such a way that we don’t realise who are patients, who are volunteers and who are attendants,” said a doctor.The lack of water and electricity connections to the makeshift camp also was an issue.“We need all departments on hands here like the public works department, corporation and Tangedco, etc., to make sure everything works smoothly, so we staff can focus only on patients and triaging,” Dr Sadagopan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/chaotic-scenes-on-day-2-at-covid-centre/articleshow/83127684.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Getting Binagunda vaccinated was adventurous & challenging as well||Maruthi, the young son of Binagunda’s patil (village head) has been working as kotwal with Bhamragad administration for the past few years. A few days back he trekked over 20 kilometers to inform Bhamragad Tehsildar that the health team couldn’t find any success in vaccinating Madia tribals of Binagunda and other nearby villages. All the villagers had refused to get vaccinated from a health team that travelled to these areas recently. The fear of Covid rampaging his village in the next wave was clear in his hushed but concerned tone. The monsoon would also play spoilsport as these villages would be cut off from the rest of the civilization for four months or so. The administration would lose any opportunity to vaccinate them at that time. The kotwal himself had been vaccinated, but he had not been able to convince many of his village folks. “Sir, please visit the villages, we need to convince our people to take the vaccination…” On the evening of Buddhapurnima, May 26, the tehsildar called me about the problem at hand. We decided to chart a plan to vaccinate every eligible person of Binagunda and other villages nearby. After much deliberation, we decided to organize four vaccination camps: one in Kuwakodi (the eastern most Gram Panchayat of Maharashtra), Permilbhatti, Fodewada and Binagunda each. All located in the infamous Abhujmarh, often referred to as the ‘liberated-zone’ by Naxalites, these villages are home to the Madia tribe, a vulnerable group. These tribes continue to live in seclusion from the rest of the world. Our fear lay in the cold hard fact that if the recent strains of Covid-19 make its way to these villages, lack of health facilities and immediate care could potentially lead to much misery and loss of human life. Vaccination camps were held on the lines of election exercise. It would have three components. First, an intense awareness campaign would take place in each village on Friday, May 28. The administration team along with all the Patwari, Kotwals and persons with influence in the area would travel to each village and organize meetings in the Ghotuls, the traditional meeting halls of the Madias. The traveling itself was dicey as our vehicle crossed at least five flowing rivulets, removed heavy stones along the forest trail and was stuck multiple times on a hilly and inaccessible terrain. All the villagers were informed in advance about the meeting. The first meeting was held at Fodewada, a hamlet of around 30 houses. The ‘ice-breaking’ session, as Tehsildar Anmol Kamble liked to refer it to, was done by talking about general issues faced by the villagers. This was followed by transitioning to the topic of health and Covid. A video of local leaders and influencers like Prakash Amte ji, was shown to all. It instantly struck a chord with many of them. Afterwards, we took the questions of each villager with much patience. In the classic dialectic method, both sides presented arguments. One of the village seniors wanted us to visit the nearby water source first and address the water problem as well. She led the way as we trekked almost a kilometre in the deep jungle to learn that she had been ferrying water on foot for all her life. It was her chance to have us feel the problems she lived everyday. The meetings went much beyond Covid as they enabled us to note many problems faced by these inaccessible areas. By the end of the day, the team noticed that it had taveresed over 10 kilometres on foot while walking through these villages. Eventually, home visits and Ghotul meetings ensured that all the villages were convinced to get vaccinated. The next morning, ‘vaccination booths’ were set up in each village. Two teams traveled with vaccine in the pulse polio cold boxes, now used for storing and transporting Covid vaccine in the nearby areas. The vaccination booth agent was armed with the list of all villagers above 45 years of age. The first to get vaccinated was the local Patil, Maruthi’s father. He led by setting an example for all to follow. One by one, as the villagers trickled in the booth, their Aadhar card numbers were noted and vaccine shots were administered after testing their blood sugar levels, blood pressure and other vitals. Many were encouraged to get vaccinated. A little hesitation and concern was still visible. 59 out of 68 persons, almost 87% of the entire eligible population were vaccinated. Almost everyone beyond 18 years of age is eagerly awaiting for their chance as well. As the day ended, we knew that with the right awareness campaign, some personal touch from vaccination warriors, and a clear system and process of vaccination, we could defeat vaccine hesitancy and vaccinate one village at a time in the entire area. I would like to give all the credit of this ‘Operation Vaccinate Binagunda’ to Tehsildar Anmol Kambde and the team, Sattu, Kotwal-Phodewada, Dinkar Kotwal-Turremarka, Chukku Kotwal-Kuvakodi, Maruti Kotwal-Binagunda, Shankar Kotwal-Laheri, and Akash Kotwal-Malampodur.(Manuj Jindal, IAS, is currently PO Bhamragad and SDM Etapalli in Gadchiroli)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/getting-binagunda-vaccinated-was-adventurous-challenging-as-well/articleshow/83127718.cms||---

Also, in a more worrying development, Nagpur district witnessed 12 mucor deaths in a day on Monday, highest so far, taking the toll to 102. In Nagpur division, total number of mucormycosis cases has now reached 1,294, while Nagpur district’s count is 1,097. The general notion that mucormycosis is mostly a post Covid complication or detected among Covid-recovered patients had already been jolted on a few occasions when top medical practitioners found black fungus related complications in patients with no Covid history. There had also been instances of patients developing mucormycosis despite remaining without treatment for Covid as they were asymptomatic or got cured with minimum or no steroids use. A few such patients were known to have remained in home isolation without being hospitalized or had not taken oxygen therapies of any type, which are some of the causes attributed to the growth of black fungus in one’s body. The latest cases of two patients of IGGMCH being simultaneously treated for Covid and mucormycosis has triggered a debate among experts as a fresh angle to the corona-mucormycosis inter-relationship has surfaced. Dr Jeevan Vedi, head of the department of ear, nose and throat (ENT) of IGGMCH, said two patients with nucormycosis symptoms are receiving treatment at the Covid ward as their RT-PCR tests too were positive. “The patients had come with only mucormycosis symptoms, but it was during mandatory Covid testing that they were found positive and shifted to the specific ward. This proves that steroid is only a contributory factor and not the only reason and also it is not necessary that only Covid-recovered patients will only suffer from fungal complications,” he said. Dr Vedi added the mutating Covid is springing surprises as they seem to be capable of deranging the inherent immune system of the body. “There is information about mucormycosis even when no Covid history is found like in the patients with autoimmune diseases where the body’s defence mechanism has got disarrayed,” he said. Sources from Government Medical College and Hospital too shared information that a patient had developed mucormycosis and also had leprosy even when there was no Covid history. Renowned ENT surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar of Seven Star Hospital said he had treated at least three mucormycosis patients, who did not had Covid. “Immunosuppressed patients on steroid therapies had developed mucormycosis even when they were not Covid positive,” said Kothalkar, adding he is seeing a spurt in revision surgeries being referred to him from other hospitals where the treatment was not completed as per protocol. He also shared his concern regarding more rural patients developing mucormycosis in the coming days in compared to their urban counterparts. Infection specialist Dr Nitin Shinde also supported the theory of Dr Vedi saying the latest variant of Covid virus is compromising the body’s immune system which is paving way for the fungal infection like mucormycosis. “I have handled a couple of mucormycosis patients who had no Covid symptoms and hence taken no treatment, but they had antibodies in them. So, we may say it was the latest Covid strain which had increased the sugar level in them and also brought down the immunity paving way for a fungal attack,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patients-test-mucor-covid-ve-same-time/articleshow/83127692.cms||Soumitra Bose

The nearest major hospital is Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, which is 35km away.”“Doctors and nurses should be present there round-the-clock. We want oxygen connection and facilities for beds and ventilator. We also want 108 ambulances, which were shifted to Pollachi and replaced with a car ambulance,” said Jeyamuruganveli.Bethany Hospital, which was reportedly shut after a doctor was diagnosed with Covid-19, should be reopened, the petition said. “Many patients from Mettupalayam, Thondamuthur and Sulur used to visit the hospital.

The interns, who have completed four-and-a-half years of MBBS course and are completing one-year of internship, have also sought an increase in stipend along the lines of resident doctors roped in for Covid duty. Dr Jagdish Dhote, representative of the intern doctors at GMCH-Aurangabad, said the interns were as exposed to the risk of Covid as the other medical and para-medical staff. “While a majority of other health workers are being protected by health insurance, we still do not have such a cover though we have been performing Covid duties for more than a year. Not just us, our family members are also exposed to the risk of sourcing the infection. Therefore, we must get insurance cover,” he said. Stating that they were receiving stipends of only around Rs 11,000, the intern doctors sought a raise to at least Rs 50,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/intern-docs-demand-insurance-cover-increased-stipend/articleshow/83124178.cms||---

---||Kochi||Shah has assured that people will be consulted, says MP||New Delhi: Union home minister Amit Shah has assured that the new draft laws for Lakshadweep which are being opposed by the islanders will not be finalized without consulting local representatives, its MP Mohammed Faizal said on Monday. Talking to reporters after meeting Shah here, Faizal said he apprised the home minister of the strong opposition to the draft laws proposed by new administrator Praful Patel. Faizal said he also told Shah about the widespread protests on the islands and opposition from several other quarters to the proposed legislations. “He has assured that whatever laws that are under the consideration, they will be sent to Lakshadweep where they will be consulted with the local representatives in the district panchayat. People’s consent will be taken into consideration before they are finalized,” Faizal said. Faizal has also sought removal of Patel, the administrator of the Union Territory. Faizal said Patel has been pushing for the laws — from ban on cow slaughter to two-child norm for those wanting to contest the grama panchayat elections, allowing liquor to be served at resorts on inhabited islands — that have upset the islanders. The majority of the residents of the islands are Muslims. The NCP leader said the draft laws were being opposed by every section of the Lakshadweep society, even the local BJP leaders. He alleged that the draft legislations were in blatant violation of the Supreme Court guidelines for carrying out developmental work on the ecologically-sensitive islands. Patel was given the charge of the Lakshadweep administrator following the death of Dineshwar Sharma in December last year. “He (Patel) is completing five months after assuming charge. In these five months, his presence on the islands must have been for 15-20 days. He has never been to the island to the understand its people concern, their heritage and culture,” Faizal said. Besides, people have apprehensions about the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR) and the draft Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation, Faizal said. LDAR is aimed at overseeing development of towns on the islands with sweeping changes in the way land can be acquired and utilized, while the draft Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation provides for powers to detain a person for up to one year to prevent him from “acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”. It allows for detention for anti-social activities from six months to a year without legal representation. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/shah-has-assured-that-people-will-be-consulted-says-mp/articleshow/83126079.cms||---

Because, it has been almost six days since he took the jab and is yet to receive a message confirming it. The message will also have a link to the certificate with details of the vaccine taken. “At the school, they distributed tokens but took it back after administering the vaccine. Now, I have no evidence with me to prove that I had taken the first shot. I initially thought I will get a message in a couple of days. But as days passed, I am worried. Because, it looks like vaccination certificate might become mandatory for almost everything especially for travelling to other countries,” Venkatachalam said.When asked whether he tried visiting the school for inquiring about the message, he said he did not because the vaccination camps are crowded and he did not want to take a risk. “If only there is a helpline number, it would have been easy for people like me,” he added.Similarly, Saibaba Colony resident Tulasi Janarthanan, 23, who took her jab at a camp organized at TK Market on Thursday, Ramanathapuram residents D Ramesh Kumar, 30, and his mother who took their shot at Nanjudapuram primary health centre on Thursday and several others have not received the message confirming of them taking the jab.Tulasi said, “As my details are noted down in a notebook, I specifically asked them when I would receive the message and sought their contact number. They refused to share their contact details with me and assured me that I will receive the message within two hours. While one of my relatives who took the shot with me, got the message, I had not received it till date. Now, I don’t know even whom to contact or how to go about it. I have a lot of confusions like what will I do if authorities refuse to give me the second shot or ask me to take the first jab again.”Ramesh said he had tried reaching out to the helpline number – 1075 – but to no avail. Because of the huge crowd at the vaccination centres, I don’t know whether they will respond properly to me, he added. When contacted, a senior official of the city corporation said that the issue was not brought to his knowledge and he will investigate it.“Mostly, people who took the shot would receive the message within a couple of days and the delay is due to the delay in feeding the details on the website. However, the public can register the complaint at the district helpline number – 1077,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/beneficiaries-complain-of-not-receiving-vaccine-certificates/articleshow/83127709.cms||---

The application said that Ramdev’s recent statements against allopathy, practising doctors and even Covid vaccination are aimed at boosting sales of Patanjali’s medicines such as Coronil which have no approval from regulatory bodies and the central government must put a stop to its advertisements. Dr Kamlesh Saini, told TOI that the doctors’ body is not against ayurveda and its applications. “But Baba Ramdev from platforms like social media and TV channels is terming allopathy a ‘stupid science’. So many doctors have laid down their lives during the pandemic while treating Covid patients. When the country is going through the second wave, such statements are not only hurtful but also unfortunate,” he said. “When Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is trying his best to boost vaccination in the country as a preventive measure, Baba Ramdev’s statements against it are causing mistrust.” IMA officials said that earlier, IMA chapters in Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Punjab, Delhi have sought legal or police action against Baba Ramdev. The application states that the statements were made with ‘illegal and dishonest intentions’ and with a view to obtain ‘wrongful gains’, causing irreversible damage to national interests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ima-gujarat-makes-plea-to-cops-against-ramdev/articleshow/83127851.cms||---

---||Jaipur||HC: Bank guarantee and advance fee from MBBS students illegal||Jodhpur: In a major relief to students pursuing MBBS, the high court has restrained private medical colleges from recovering any amount as advance fee in addition to the fee for one year. The division bench comprising Justice Sangeet Lodha and Justice Rameshwar Vyas while deciding a PIL by Deepesh Singh Beniwal on Monday termed as illegal the insistence of these medical colleges upon students to submit a bank guarantee at the time of admission. The court has termed these provisions laid by the medical colleges as violative of the legal provisions and considered them as illegal and unconstitutional.The court also stated, “The advance fee in addition to the fee for one year already recovered by any of the private institutions from the students admitted to the medical course shall be kept in a fixed deposit in a nationalised bank against which no loan of advance may be granted.” It further stated, “The advance fee deposit as aforesaid shall carry interest at the rate equivalent to the rate of interest admissible on fixed deposit by the bank and the interest accrued already and in future thereon shall be paid to the students from whom the advance fees was collected by the college at the time of admission”. The state government has been directed to ensure compliance of this order of the court.Beniwal in his petition had stated that the private institutions had been collecting a massive sum from the students in the form of advance fee in absence of bank guarantee equivalent to the fee of three and a half years and termed it unconstitutional as well as a huge burden on the parents.The court, however, had stayed these provisions of institutions in December 2020, but Beniwal argued that inspite of this, the institutions continued to recover money from the students under these provisions.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-bank-guarantee-and-advance-fee-from-mbbs-students-illegal/articleshow/83127761.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||AMC spent over Rs 650 crore in 13 months on Covid battle||AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has in the last 13 months spent Rs 661 crore — about Rs 50 crore a month — on treating Covid patients, testing and other Covid-control measures during the pandemic. AMC officials said that in the first seven months of the pandemic, the city saw two peaks in Covid cases, in the second week of July and and in the last week of September. The expenditure during the first peak was about Rs 318 crore of which nearly Rs 120 crore was spent only on testing and medicines. As the surge of cases in the second phase shifted from the eastern parts of the city to the west, expenditure fell considerably as more people preferred private laboratories over government facilities. Officials said from the figures of those hospitalized, it is clear that till September there was greater dependency on government hospitals. Officials said that the bills of private hospitals requisitioned by the AMC where 50% of patients were referred by the AMC were also settled between November and March. The AMC had in the initial phase acquired 1,750 beds at private hospitals, which reduced in the second and third phases. Officials said expenditure for the recent wave of Covid cases, over Rs 200 crore, was done from March to April 30. The city recorded 2.27 Covid lakh cases so far. A senior AMC officer said the AMC has also received medicines and testing kits from the government and hence expenditure in the second and third phases was comparatively lower in relation to the cases reported. Officials said the AMC is yet to settle bills of Rs 50 crore which included bills of patients admitted at private hospitals in the AMC quota and other expenditure. However, officials said that private hospital bills for April have not been received yet. “This expenditure is purely for Covid treatment and does not include the cost for treating fungal infections.” The AMC officials said dependency on AMC hospitals reduced with more cases reported from the western part of the city. In the first week of June, if there were 900 patients at AMC hospitals, there were 600 at private hospitals. In September, the numbers were equal. By mid-September there were 1,100 patients at AMC hospitals and 1,250 in private ones. In November, when the city saw the second wave of cases there were only 900-odd patients at AMC hospitals and 2,800 were at private hospitals. In March-April this year, while there were 1,100 patients at AMC hospitals, there were 8500-odd at private hospitals. “Hence with the greater dependency on the private sector, be they laboratories or hospitals, there was less expenditure,” said a senior AMC officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-spent-over-rs-650cr-in-13-months-on-covid-battle/articleshow/83127846.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Jaipur||Absence of PM Modi pics in Vasundhara Raje free food banners triggers rift talks in Rajasthan BJP||KOTA: Distribution of free food packets from ‘Vasundhara Jan Rasoi’ launched three days ago here is being drawn into a political quagmire. The scheme was launched in the name of state’s former chief minister and BJP’s national vice-president Vasundhara Raje by her confidante, ex-MLA Prahlad Gunjal. Absence of photos and names of top party leaders including that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the banner that is displayed at Vasundhara Jan Rasoi is enough to attract speculation from different quarters. “On Raje’s call, I launched it on May 28 where we distributed free food packets in slum areas and villages. A day later, Raje’s supporters started Vasundhara Jan Rasoi in several districts,” said BJP ex-MLA Gunjal. “There is no bigger leader than her in the state. Her photo on the banner stands for all party leaders and workers of the state,” said Gunjal. In Jhalawar, the banners display her son Dushyant Singh. The jan rasoi will continue to distribute free food packets till lockdown is lifted, Gunjal added. A senior BJP worker said, “The launch of free food scheme is an experiment. It is being run parallelly to the party’s motto of serving society under ‘Seva Hi Sangathan’.” He added that instead of lending a helping hand to the party, this is a clear indication that BJP might have to fight against the Raje group in the next state assembly elections. Only Raje supporters are operating the rasoi, said a BJP office bearer in Bundi, adding that the BJP workers are maintaining a distance. Kota, the coaching hub, has been a stronghold of BJP and RSS for decades, while Jhalawar district has been the home turf of ex-CM Vasundhara Raje and son Dushyant Singh. Raje’s supporters have always attempted to have an upper hand in all political decisions, however, elevation of Kota- Bundi MP Om Birla to the post of Lok Sabha Speaker sidelined Raje’s confidantes in the region. Now, they are trying to reclaim their lost power through this rasoi, observed a worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/absence-of-modi-pics-in-raje-free-food-banners-triggers-rift-talks-in-state-bjp/articleshow/83127786.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Woman on footpath dies as tempo runs over, kin get Rs 22 lakh||MUMBAI: Observing that a footpath is meant for pedestrians, and not for driving vehicles, a Motor Accident Claims Tribunal has granted a compensation of Rs 22 lakh (with interest) to the family of a 47-year-old woman who was killed after a speeding tempo rammed into her while she was sitting on a footpath at Andheri (east) in 2014. The tribunal refuted the insurance company’s claims that since the woman, Devaamma Kathal, was sitting on the footpath, she was equally responsible for the accident. “The deceased sat on that footpath doesn’t make any offence. Thus, it was the bounden duty of the offending vehicle driver to drive his vehicle safely instead of that, it rushed on the footpath and dashed into the deceased, resulting in death,” the tribunal said. The woman, who worked in the kitchen of a private company, earned a monthly salary of Rs 8,000. She was survived by her husband, Tippanna Kathal (53) and son, Narayan Kathal (29). The tribunal also said that since the tempo driver did not hold an effective driving licence, Shriram General Insurance Company Limited, the insurance firm, was at liberty to recover compensation directly from the tempo owner, Fazal Mohd. “...registered owner of the offending vehicle shall furnish security for the entire amount which the insurance company will pay to the claimants and unless the security is furnished, office of this tribunal shall not release the amount deposited by the insurance company,” the tribunal said. The claim was submitted before the tribunal in January 2015. It was submitted that on March 25, 2014, around 6.45 pm, the woman was sitting on the service road footpath near Seepz, Andheri (east), with care and caution. It was alleged that the vehicle came at high speed as well as in a rash and negligent manner and rammed into the woman. It was further alleged that due to that impact, the victim sustained serious injuries and was rushed to the hospital. However, she died on April 7, 2014. The family had sought compensation of Rs 17 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/woman-on-footpath-dies-as-tempo-runs-over-kin-get-rs-22l/articleshow/83130845.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Mumbai||Marathas can take benefits under 10% EWS quota: Maharashtra govt||MUMBAI: Over three weeks after Supreme Court struck down the Maratha quota, the MVA government on Monday decided to allow the Maratha community to avail benefits under the 10% EWS (economically weaker sections) quota in government jobs and education. But Marathas would have to compete with others in the open category for 10% EWS quota, while the quota the community had been granted by Maharashtra and which now stands quashed had given it 12% reservation in jobs and 13% in education. When the SC had stayed the Maratha quota in September last year, the state had allowed Marathas to apply for the EWS, but it had said they could not avail of benefits under the Maratha quota later if they opted for EWS benefits. The state on Monday issued a government resolution allowing for availing of EWS benefits. It came two days after BJP MP and Sambhaji Raje, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, threatened to hit the streets if demands of the Maratha community were not met before June 6. The union government had introduced the EWS quota early in 2019. The quota is applicable in government office jobs as well as jobs in state-run corporations, semi-governmental institutions, local urban civic and rural civic bodies and educational institutions. According to the Centre’s criteria, the annual income of a beneficiary should not be more than Rs 8 lakh to avail of the EWS quota. The EWS benefit will be applicable with retrospective effect from May 5, 2021, stated the GR. Eknath Shinde, urban development minister, told mediapersons the community cannot benefit from two types of reservations. “Now that SC has scrapped the socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) reservation, the Maratha community will be eligible to avail benefits under EWS,” he said. One of the convenors of the Maratha Kranti Morcha, Vinod Patil, said the state is not given anything additional to the community as EWS benefits are for those from the non-reserved category. “The state should clarify what could be done for the community as the EWS quota has nothing to do with the state. It is a Central government reservation which people from various religions and castes can avail of,” Patil said. The SC struck down the Maratha quota on May 5, terming it “unconstitutional.” After the verdict, the state appointed a committee led by former CJ of Allahabad high court Dilip Bhosale to study the order. The panel was asked to submit its report by May 31. The state has extended the deadline to June 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/marathas-can-take-benefits-under-10-ews-quota-maharashtra-state/articleshow/83129473.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

For this, he said on Monday, the government should involve the Central Drug Research Institute to carry out studies on genome sequencing and use the results of the study to be better prepared to handle the pandemic in the future. Health minister JP Singh said that the health department would be carrying out genome sequencing of 10% of all positive samples, which would be picked up from districts where the number of cases continue to remain high. “We carried out a similar exercise in the first wave as well, where 10% of the samples were picked up for genome sequencing. Now, because of the massive spread of the virus, we need to make sure that the virus has not mutated or if it has, then the government needs to keep abreast of any changes and ensure that if there is any sequence of concern, then we have it on record,” the minister said. Currently, the King George Medical University carries out genome sequencing in the state. The minister added that the state would also be getting a sero survey conducted in the state to determine how many people would have already been infected by the Coronavirus. “The government will be able to determine the percentage of infection in the population, collated on the basis of gender and age. We are expecting the results of the survey to be in by the end of June,” said a government spokesperson.Meanwhile, the CM has directed the health department and concerned officials to complete the setting up of paediatric ICUs (PICU) and mini PICUs in hospitals by June 20. In preparing for the possible third wave where, the CM said children are likely to be most affected as per experts, the government has asked all medical colleges to set up 100 bed PICUs and 50 bed neonatal ICUs. PICUs are also being set up in district hospitals and community health centres. The CM has directed district magistrates to carry out regular inspections of the facilities as no extension will be given for the work. The government has also commenced training in Noida and Lucknow to prepare master trainers in the health sector. From June 1, the government will also start paediatric care training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-orders-genome-sequencing-to-study-virus-mutations/articleshow/83129398.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Complainant Pratap Chandra, a resident of Ruchi Khand, said he took the first dose of Covishield on April 8 at a private hospital in Aashiana. He was due to get the second shot 28 days later but following a new notification advising longer gap, he waited. Chandra, who runs a travel business, said he was unwell after getting the first dose. “On May 21, I heard ICMR director Balram Bhargava on Doordarshan saying after first dose of Covishield, good levels of antibodies are produced, but with Covaxin, an adequate immune response is triggered only after second dose,” he said. Thereafter on May 25, Chandra decided to get an antibody test done for Covid-19 at a private lab approved by ICMR. The lab sent its staff to collect his blood sample. “On May 27, I got the report which was negative, meaning that no antibody had developed even after taking the vaccine. On the contrary, my platelet count had lowered to 1.5 lakh from 3 lakh. I have been defrauded in the name of vaccine and my life is at risk,” he claimed. In his complaint, Chandra has named the owner of the vaccine manufacturing company, the joint secretary health in central government, ICMR director, director of National Health Mission and director of WHO. ADCP, east zone, Qasim Abidi, said that the application was received in Aashiana late on Sunday evening and will be sent to CMO Lucknow for his view. Based on that, further action will follow.

The urban development and housing (UDH) department on Monday issued an order granting relaxations to activities under the medical sector. This special incentive scheme will benefit the investors planning to set up or expand establishments, including multi-specialty hospitals, medical colleges, clinics, dispensaries, medical universities. The scheme will benefit the allopathy sector as well as institutions of ayurveda, naturopathy, homeopathy and unani systems of medicine. Considering the medical sector activities in larger public interest, it will be permitted in various land uses, including residential, commercial, mixed-use as earmarked in the master plan of the cities. However, this exemption will not be provided on ecological, eco-sensitive parks, open fields and others. An official said, “The state has decided to exempt medical establishments from conversion fee and building map approval fee. The exemption in the lease amount can be given after receiving the approval of the finance department.” The move is expected to give unprecedented boost to private investment in the medical sector. To take advantage of the special incentive scheme, it will be necessary that proposals for establishment or expansion of medical related institutions should be submitted to the body concerned by March 31, 2022. The project will have to be completed by December 2025. An official said, “The amount of rebate will be recovered, along with the interest, if a project is not completed on time. Such hospitals will have to give the benefit of Chief Minister Chiranjeevi scheme to the people.” The technical examination of the proposals that will be received will be conducted by the town planner of respective cities after they assess the facilities as per the requirement of the region. Also, before the implementation of this scheme, if any investor has deposited the fee in any local body across the state, then it will not be refunded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-scheme-to-convert-state-into-countrys-top-medical-care-hub/articleshow/83127884.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

For the first fortnight of June, the Centre will send us 3.33 lakh doses while 6.78 lakh doses will be sent in the next two weeks,” Siddharth Tripathy, the nodal officer of IEC wing, said on Monday. Of the 10.11 lakh doses, there will be approximately 4.66 lakh doses of Covishield and 2.12 lakh doses of Covaxin. Nearly 3.79 lakh people aged above 45 have taken both their doses in the state so far, while 23.87 lakh of the estimated 88 lakh people (in the same age group) have taken the first dose. Late last month, the Centre had asked the Jharkhand government to increase vaccination coverage for this age group. Since the vaccination drive kicked off nationwide on January 16 this year, Jharkhand has so far received 46.41 lakh doses from the Centre. For vaccinating people from the 18-44 age group, the state is due to receive a little over 8 lakh doses this month. Meanwhile, the health department on Sunday directed the deputy commissioners of all 24 districts to vaccinate those in the “high-risk groups” on a priority basis. As per the order issued by health secretary Arun Kumar Singh, the department has termed journalists, railway loco pilots, TTEs, transportation workers, hotel and restaurant staff, PDS shop workers, petrol pump operators, vegetable and fruit vendors, newspaper vendors, milk distributors, home delivery agents, airport and ground staff, workers at check booths and toll plazas, transgenders, specially-abled citizens, labour department officials, all workers in oxygen production and refiling plants, Covid volunteers and inmates of various jails as high-risk groups. On Monday, the department also added banking employees and LIC agents to the list. “Special camps will be held to inoculate these people. They are in the high-risk groups as the nature of their work requires them to come in contact with many people,” Tripathy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/centre-vows-10l-vax-doses-for-frontline-staff-this-month/articleshow/83127446.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand man pedals 400km to get blood for his thalassemic son||RANCHI/DUMKA: A father of a five-and-half-year-old thalassemic boy from Godda district was forced to pedal 400 km for blood transfusion of his child amid the ongoing lockdown as the local blood bank does not have any stock. Two days ago, Dilip Yadav, a contract labourer in his mid-40s, returned to his village in Mehrama block after travelling to Jamtara sadar hospital with his child for the blood transfusion, a distance of 400 km to and fro. This is the second such bicycle rally for Yadav, who returned from Delhi in mid-February after the lockdown started in the national capital to stop transmission of the Covid-19 virus. Talking to TOI over the phone, Yadav said, “It was the second time I had to travel to Jamtara on a bicycle carrying my son as A negative blood wasn’t available in the district blood bank. Before that, I had gone to Dumka and even Bhagalpur in the distant past, wherever I learn about blood availability. With no earning, I couldn’t hire a private vehicle.” He also said when he was in Delhi, there were no transfusion problems as either Ram Manohar Lohia or Safdarjung hospital would easily provide the blood. “I returned to my native place for safety but I am finding it difficult to make ends meet and arrange blood for my son.” Yadav has four children — three daughters and a son. The boy was found suffering from thalassemia four months after his birth. “He requires blood at least once a month,” he said, adding that before returning to Jharkhand, his son had transfusion on February 17 at Ram Manohar Lohia and managed to have another on March 18 in Godda. But since then, the blood bank in Godda has gone dry. “So, I had to pedal to Jamtara on April 20 again and this month,” he added. In his latest journey, Yadav started cycling on May 25 and reached Jamtara on May 27 from Dumka. After the transfusion, it took him two days to return to his village in Mehrama block under Thakurganti police station in Mahagama constituency. “We spent the nights at bus stands or under a roadside tree roadside during the journey,” he recalled. Yadav’s woes are a shocking reminder of how people in the hinterlands are not just battling livelihoods but continue to struggle for basic medical care amid the raging pandemic. Admitting the problems faced by the rural populace, Rajesh Kumar, a lab technician at a Godda-based blood bank, said Yadav’s son is the only thalassemic patient in the district with A negative blood requirement, which is rare. “In the entire district, we have only one donor in our list,” he said, adding that they had transfused blood to the kid once but failed thereafter as the stock wasn’t available. “As donors are afraid of contracting Covid, they did not turn up to donate blood and our stock has been depleting since long,” he rued. Meanwhile, Godda civil surgeon Dr S P Mishra expressed shock over Yadav’s woes. “We would have arranged blood from other sources had the parent contacted us. We shall ensure that no patient face problems in the district in future,” he said, adding that the district has a total of 36 thalassemia patients. “We appeal to people to come forward for blood donation,” he said. Atul Gera of Life Saver’s, an NGO working in the field of blood donation, slammed the administration for the non-compliance with the national blood policy. “If the district had adhered to national blood policy which mandates all hospitals to hold regular blood donations, the crisis could have been averted. It is always convenient to say there is no blood, but the onus of arranging blood lies with hospitals and the administration. The poor man had to travel far only because he had no one to tweet for him or lobby to get it arranged,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-pedals-over-400-km-to-get-blood-for-his-ailing-son/articleshow/83127021.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Hospitals asked to prepare for dengue, malaria patients||Jamshedpur: Fearing a possible outbreak of vector-borne diseases during the monsoon season, the district health department has written to all the major hospitals and healthcare centres in East Singhbhum, asking them to keep all the necessary facilities ready for treating patients diagnosed with dengue, chikungunya, brain fever, malaria and diarrhoea. “Rainfall and the resultant fluctuations in temperature lead to an outbreak of vector- borne diseases and that is why hospitals have been asked to keep all the necessary facilities ready. The hospitals have to share with us the data of people arriving with complaints of such diseases so that timely treatment can be provided to them,” additional chief medical officer Sahir Pall said. The letter was issued to MGM Medical College and Hospital, sadar hospital, Tata Motors Hospital, Mercy Hospital, Tata Main Hospital, Tinplate Hospital, Brahmananda Narayana Multispecialty Hospital and all the medical officers-in-charge. The health department is also making sure that larvae density surveys are done in the vulnerable areas by the respective municipal bodies. Pall said they are making sure that water-logged drains are cleaned and garbage is disposed of by the agencies concerned every day. “Along with cleaning the drains, the urban municipal bodies need to sprinkle bleaching powder, spray anti-larvae chemicals and make sure fogging is done,” he added. “Stagnant water is an ideal breeding ground for larvae and people need to make sure that air-coolers, discarded tyres or any other object that contains stagnant water is cleaned regularly,” Pall said. Steel City has a history of reporting a high number of dengue cases. In 2017, the district reported 150 cases and two years later, the Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee invoked Section 133 of the CrPC to punish people for not keeping their cowsheds clean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hospitals-asked-to-prepare-for-dengue-malaria-patients/articleshow/83126914.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand plans unique IDs to weed out ‘ghost’ farmers||Ranchi: The state agriculture department has decided to provide a unique identification (UID) number to every farmer to ensure seamless transfer of benefits under agri-related schemes. But for the time being, the department has begun allotting ‘seed tokens’ to farmers. The tokens carry details of seeds distributed, land available with the farmer and his/her Aadhaar and mobile number, among others. In the coming months, the department will provide every farmer a digitised chip-based card along with their unique ID number that will carry all relevant information pertaining to the transactions between them and the government. Talking to TOI on Monday, state agriculture director Nisha Oraon said that the move has been conceived to bring in greater transparency and weed out ‘ghost’ farmers to prevent instances of forgery in availing agricultural schemes. “We are working to bring out a card for farmers on the lines of Aadhaar. We have started issuing ‘seed token’ to every farmer. The token carries basic details of seed distribution, time of allotment, land available with the farmer, his/her Aadhaar and mobile number. Farmer’s UID will be an extension of the seed token,” she said. The exercise will also allow real-time verification of farmers. As per government records, there are about 35 lakh farmers in the state. “So the ID move will also help us in authenticating the farmers and in ensuring that genuine farmers aren’t left out of any schemes,” she said. For the first time, Jharkhand began distribution of kharif seeds from May 12 this year, weeks ahead of the monsoon. Oraon said they had placed orders for 43,483 quintals of seed and 18,000 quintals of seed have already been distributed. The department was awaiting a detailed report on crop losses due to cyclone Yaas. “Preliminary reports suggest rabi crops suffered damage in some districts like Latehar and Kolhan regions but we are waiting for a detailed report on crop damage to arrange appropriate compensation from competent authorities. The state, however, is hopeful for a good kharif season this year as conditions are favourable and the department, too, has worked in advance to provide timely assistance to farmers,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-plans-unique-ids-to-weed-out-ghost-farmers/articleshow/83126946.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Health dept to train med professionals for child care||Ranchi: The state health department on Monday began looking into the infrastructural and manpower lapses across all state-run hospitals to make sure that they are prepared to handle the minor patients -- who are likely to be infected the most, as pointed out by experts -- in the event of a possible third wave of coronavirus. As part of their preparations, all the 24 civil surgeons have to make sure that neo-natal intensive care units (NICU), paediatric intensive care units (PICU) and essential equipment like paediatric ventilators are available at the hospitals. They also need to identify if there is a requirement for additional manpower and single out health workers who can be trained for Covid-19 management in the paediatric wards. A letter in this regard was issued by National Health Mission’s MD Ravishankar Shukla, directing all the civil surgeons to provide the details of paediatricians, medical officers and nurses from their respective districts who are eligible for the training. Each district needs to share the details of two paediatricians, medical officers and nurses, along with their designation and area of posting, in two days. Upon contact, a senior official from the health department said, “The training will give the health workers an insight into the specialised treatment protocols that one needs to keep in mind while attending to minor patients of Covid-19. The training will also familiarise them with the functioning of NICU and PICU.” Some districts, like Palamu for instance, have started their assessment of equipment and manpower at the hospitals and begun the process for setting up NICU and PICU wards. Palamu deputy commissioner Shashi Ranjan said: “We have started work on setting up a 30-bed PICU ward at our district hospital and work on oxygen lines is underway. We are also completing the formalities for procuring paediatric ventilators.” He added, “We are working on setting up play areas and non-Covid wards for kids, as per the guidelines given by the state government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-to-train-med-professionals-for-child-care/articleshow/83127397.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The scheme was inaugurated by Jharkhand high court Justice-cum-JHALSA executive chairman Aparesh Kumar Singh. The project has been conceptualised by Justice Singh in order to ensure that welfare schemes of the Centre for children are channeled to the rightful beneficiaries. Justice Singh said: “JHALSA will identify children who have lost their parents to Covid-19 and help them bounce back in life.” He added that JHALSA will either contact the grandparents or rehabilitate the kids through adoption, foster care and institutional care. JHALSA through its district offices will coordinate with the other stakeholders including the government to help the children and cater to their basic needs of clothing, education and health, said JHALSA secretary Muhammad Shakir. Several rounds of meetings have already been held with government agencies and departments to streamline the project, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jhalsa-launches-statewide-project-for-cov-orphans/articleshow/83127351.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||Banna slams Centre for ‘inadequate’ vax supply to state||Ranchi: The state health minister, Banna Gupta, on Monday lambasted the Union government for its “indifferent attitude towards Jharkhand in allocating vaccines”. Gupta said, “It is because of this step-motherly attitude of the Centre that the state decided to procure vaccines from overseas and has floated global tenders in this regard, which are yet to be approved.” He further said, “As per our state government’s commitment we had placed an order for 50 lakh vials (for the 18-44 age group) with the manufacturers but we were provided with only 5 lakh since the Modi government is controlling the supply.” As per government data, out of the nearly 2 crore beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group, only 5,20,283 have taken their first dose since the inoculation drive began on May 14 for that age group. There are only 1,35,020 doses left for that group and over seven lakh for the above 45 group. On Monday, several session sites in Dhanbad remained closed for sixth day in a row due to the shortage of vaccines and a senior health department official said that they cannot resume the drive for the 18-44 age group unless they receive a fresh consignment of vaccines. Asked why Jharkhand is not getting its share of the vaccines, Gupta said, “The Modi government seems to be following the saying ‘maal maharaj ka mirza khele holi’, which roughly translates to we place orders for vaccines but they divert it to other locations, including overseas. If this is the Centre’s attitude, one can understand what Modi is trying to do.” He added, “We were told that India has become the hub of vaccine production, then why aren’t we being provided what we have ordered. It is because they want people of Jharkhand to suffer and I will not allow that and we will do everything possible to get things moving.” According to health department sources, the formalities for inviting global tenders have already been completed and the process will be initiated once the state cabinet gives its approval for the procurement. On being asked whether the cabinet is going to meet over the issue as it is an emergency situation and a matter of public health, Gupta said, “I have already given my recommendation for approving the proposal. We have kept everything ready and if required, we can go ahead with the whole process even without the approval, provided the green signal is given by the cabinet eventually. I will make sure that nothing stalls our commitment to provide free vaccines to the youngsters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/banna-slams-centre-for-inadequate-vax-supply-to-state/articleshow/83126616.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies — casirivimab and imdevimab — can be used on mild and moderate Covid patients and is known to reduce the chances of hospitalization by 70%. The proprietor of Raj Hospital, Jogesh Gambhir, said the medical fraternity was eagerly waiting for this ‘wonder drug’ to arrive in India after the Centre granted emergency-use authorisation. “It arrived in Delhi on May 26 and we are the first in Jharkhand to obtain the consignment. Although the single-dose drug is costly and priced at around Rs 60,000, we are hopeful that people in the high-risk groups can be prevented from slipping into emergency condition by the use of this drug,” Gambhir said. Asked if the antibody cocktail can be used on children as a possible third wave is predicted to infect kids more, Gambhir said that the drug manufacturer, Roche has recommended its use on patients over 12 years of age and 40kg body weight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/antibody-cocktail-now-available-in-ranchi-hosp/articleshow/83127276.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It can also be studied as an elective subject by students taking other courses. “We had a Board of Studies meeting on philosophy recently in which it was decided that the works of Yogi Adityanath and Ramdev would be included in the syllabus,” pro VC of the university, Prof Y Vimla, said. “The two books have been recommended by the state government and been endorsed by the board of studies of the university,” Dr NC Lohani, a member of the board committee and head of the department of Hindi Arts, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-ramdev-yoga-thoughts-to-be-part-of-university-curriculum/articleshow/83132929.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Goa||Goa: Hike tobacco cess and use it for Covid infrastructure, urges public health groups||PANAJI: On the occasion of World No Tobacco Day, public health groups have urged the GST Council to hike the compensation cess on all tobacco products. Further, they have suggested that the additional revenue generated could be used towards defraying the increased expenses on health infrastructure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Increasing the existing compensation cess on cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products and levying compensation cess on bidis can be a very effective policy measure by the Centre to address the immediate need to raise revenue to compensate state governments for their GST revenue shortfalls during an ongoing pandemic, the statement by the public health groups read. Consumer VOICE, New Delhi, chief operating officer, Ashim Sanyal said, “Our country will need huge financial resources to recover from the economic shock of Covid-19. Increasing compensation cess on all tobacco products will be a win-win proposition as it will bring in substantial revenue for the government while motivating millions of tobacco users to quit and preventing youngsters from initiating tobacco use.” Over three lakh people have already succumbed to Covid across India. Tobacco use is a slow-moving pandemic itself and claims 13 lakh lives annually. It is critical than ever before to keep tobacco products out of the hands of vulnerable populations such as youth and the underprivileged, it said. “There is growing evidence that smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco products raises the risk of getting severe Covid-related infections,” National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication (NOTE) – India, secretary, Dr Shekhar Salkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hike-tobacco-cess-and-use-it-for-covid-infra/articleshow/83127988.cms||---

The briquettes are compressed and are a proven way of generating energy from waste. They contain various organic materials such as rice husk, solid waste, agricultural waste, etc. all commonly referred to as biomass. The proposed biomass-based renewable energy project is first-of-its-kind in Goa which will help reduce open dumping and burning of agriculture waste and will help bring down the carbon footprint by replacing fossil fuels with biomass briquettes. “This project has been proposed with an aim to sensitize the local community about the importance of waste management, the health hazards caused by burning or decomposing it in open fields. Besides, we aim to empower the enterprising lot among the local population with appropriate training and development programs to participate in the biomass supply chain and then densifying the fuel to briquette. Other aims include organising a Swachh Bharat campaign and social forestry across the project area,” a senior official said. He also said that currently Goa’s requirement of biomass briquette is about 170 tons per day which is being supplied to industries from neighbouring states. Verna Industrial Estate itself requires about 100 tons per day for the boilers operating on biomass briquettes after the ban on furnace oil. Biomass in Goa currently remains unutilized and briquettes are sourced from othe0r states. The Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) and Punjab Renewable Energy Systems Private Ltd (PRESPL) will jointly set up the project in Goa. GEDA had floated a tender to invite developers to set up a biomass briquetting project with a processing capacity of 2,000kg per hour. The official said that the project will be located at Saligao and will be set up under a design, build, operate, finance, and transfer basis for ten years. The plant capacity planned is 20 tons per day. The official said that PRESPL successfully applied for this tender and secured the work order to set up this biomass briquetting plant. PRESPL will be using tree, tender coconut, coconut leaves and other biomass available in the region for the project. “Further a grid-connected solar project will be set up on rooftops of the plant. GEDA will provide 3,520sqm of land at the project site free of cost to PRESPL,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/biomass-project-to-turn-agri-waste-into-green-fuel/articleshow/83128009.cms||---

Her move sent shock waves among the investigating agencies as she’s considered as one of the best government lawyers, who successfully pleaded high profile murder cases like of child Yug Chandak and ensured death penalties to the accused.In this case too, she was specially appointed by HC and was very close to securing conviction for the accused, said sources.Flaying the Maharashtra government over the move, Shreerang Bhandarkar, who’s lawyer of petitioner Omprakash Kamdi in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court, said efforts were being made to scuttle the case which has already lingered for over 17 years.Terming it as a clear case of “conflict of interest”, where the MPCC office-bearer would be pitted against the sitting minister from Congress, he said that he would apprise all these facts to HC where the case was pending.“Since Vajani was appointed by HC, it was the government’s duty to seek its consent before appointing a new SPP. It was HC that constituted a special court for hearing this high-profile case involving top politicians and directed chief judicial magistrate (CJM) SR Totla to expedite the hearing within six months,” he told TOI.Confirming that she had resigned on March 5, Vajani refused to divulge any details stating that “it was for personal reasons” and “she didn’t want to comment further on the issue nor want to enter into its politics”. She only stated that the trial was on the last stages and could have been completed by now but for Covid-19 situation.Law and judiciary secretary Rajesh Laddha told TOI that he wasn’t looking after the case details and it was under one of his subordinates named Deshmukh. He said he will send the latter’s contact details, but didn’t send it till the filing of this report.Ready to resign if asked: QureshiQureshi, also the former Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa chairman and ex-district government pleader (DGP), was appointed as SPP through a notification issued by state law and judiciary department’s section officer Vaishali Borude on May 14. He told TOI that state CID approached him for the consent based on his vast experience in criminal matters and his impeccable record.“In my 15 years of experience, I handled the responsibility of public prosecutor with aplomb and my conviction rate is very high. Based on that and seniority, they approached me. I, however, have no problem resigning if asked to do so on the basis of ‘conflict of interest’, as I am still holding the MPCC post,” he told TOI, adding that profession would always be his priority over politics.HOW THE SCAM UNFOLDED* NDCCB lost Rs125cr in govt securities in 2002* Sunil Kedar accused of flouting rules to invest bank funds* Money routed through investment firm M/s Home Trade Securities* Owner Sanjay Agrawal neither bought securities nor paid back money* Kedar suspended from NCP, joins Congress* NDCCB board of directors sacked, administrator appointed* Offences lodged against Kedar and 11 others* All accused charged under sections 406, 409, 468, 471, 120-B and 34 of IPC||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ndccb-scam-congs-office-bearer-chosen-to-plead-case-against-kedar/articleshow/83128006.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

This is provided they are registered on the Cowin/ Arogya Setu app and are hand carrying their passport and other necessary documents, president Frank Viegas said. In a letter to the chief minister Viegas suggested that seafarers, who have been unable to take even a single dose and are scheduled to join within the next few months, be vaccinated on priority and given the second dose within a duration of 4-6 weeks. The association suggested that the government consider roping in DG approved medical centres to administer vaccines for seafarers as this would reduce the workload of government nominated vaccination centres. He also suggested that MPT and the GSAI office at Madel be considered as vaccination sites. To ensure that only genuine cases of seafarers scheduled to join within the next 1-2 months are accorded priority, the association said they must be made to upload their frontline worker annexure, which can contain signature, stamp, contract number of their employer/ shipping company which can be verified online.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seamen-seek-priority-vax-for-those-joining-work-in-2-months/articleshow/83128017.cms||---

Crimes such as rapes, theft, murders and burglaries have come down across the districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam over the last few weeks. According to police records, Visakhapatnam usually sees 5–8 property offenses (burglaries, thefts, snatchings, robberies and murders for gain) every day. This number has now dropped to only 1–2 cases per day. Bodily offenses (murders, kidnappings, rioting etc.) have dropped significantly between May 5 and May 30. Speaking to TOI, ACP DS Sravan Kumar of CCS Vizag said that the curfew has led to decrease in property offences in the city. "We received complaints of only 11 property offences in the last few weeks. These were only minor offences where suspects are either neighbours or relatives." One of the reasons for the drop in crime is the presence of police on roads since the last week of April, according to a police official. Especially since May 5, police have been constantly manning the roads in a bid to impose pandemic rules. The increased police presence has put criminals on the backfoot, the police official added. In addition to crime numbers, accident cases, both fatal and non-fatal, have decreased significantly in Visakhapatnam. This is because vehicular movement drops drastically after 12 noon on account of pandemic rules. Streets which saw 6–8 accidents a day reported a mere 1–2 since May 5. Police say that the law-and-order situation in north Andhra Pradesh has improved significantly and they are receiving very few complaints apart from cases of lockdown violation. However, one thing that is keeping the cops on their toes is the rise in hooch trade. SEB and police have destroyed nearly 200 litres of jaggery wash in the last few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-curfew-cuts-down-crime-in-north-ap/articleshow/83124531.cms||Nalla.Babu

Technical experts from the ASHRAE Mumbai Chapter, inclusive of Goa regions, have highlighted the risk of Legionella bacteria growth in building water systems due to water stagnation during lockdown restrictions. The team said that when businesses and offices, which shut due to government restrictions, reopen, the water systems in their building complexes will require a review. Otherwise, building occupants could face the threat of infection from Legionellosis, a type of bacterial pneumonia that affects lungs. ASHRAE Mumbai team led by president Mihir Sanghavi has already made a presentation to the deputy chief minister, Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar, who also holds the town planning portfolio, about the risk. They have advised that the subject of Legionella now assumes significance as a potential threat post lockdown. “Today, a building or facility is likely among the thousands operating at anywhere from zero to low occupancy due to Covid-19. As occupancy rises through phased business operations and returns to normal, critical measures are needed to address the safety of everyone entering the facility. With such a strong focus on Covid-19, it’s easy to overlook another risk of prolonged low occupancy: the increased potential for Legionella outbreaks via domestic water systems,” said Mahesh Prabhu, Chair, Government Affairs, ASHRAE Mumbai Chapter. Low occupancy can reduce the flow and usage of domestic water by as much as 80-90% across all building water systems. This can result in a dangerous combination of declining levels of treatment residuals plus elevated levels of waterborne bacteria, including Legionella. “‘Legionnaires’ disease is a serious lung infection caused by inhaling water mist or droplets containing Legionella. One out of 10 people who contract Legionnaires’ disease can die. Various standards, including the recently released ASHRAE guideline for 2020 and 2018, both highly recommend that all facility managers and building owners implement water management plans for all at-risk water systems,” the team’s report stated. ASHRAE guidance documents have advised that the best approach to manage the water safety risk is by implementing a water management plan and testing the water systems prior to re-occupying a facility. The guidance suggests that water systems be tested for Legionella in addition to conducting risk profiling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/post-lockdown-water-systems-in-office-buildings-pose-risk-of-legionella-bacteria-infection-warn-experts/articleshow/83128029.cms||---

Congress corporator Harish Gwalbanshi on Monday expressed concern over NMC garden department’s public notice to fell 4,522 trees for the proposed inter-modal station (IMS) coming up at Ajni.Participating in a discussion on the NMC budget, Gwalbanshi expressed shock as the ruling party has made no budgetary provision for tree plantation in the city at a time when the garden department has proposed to cut such a huge number of trees in the heart of the city. “We should prevent tree felling of this magnitude in Ajni as it will be a great environmental loss to the city,” he said. “In spite of so many Covid deaths due to shortage of oxygen, how come hundreds of trees providing oxygen to Nagpur city are allowed to be felled?” he asked. According to him, every corporator should not only plant 100 saplings but also ensure they grow well and survive. The garden department should initiate a drive to plant saplings of neem tree in the city as they not only provide oxygen but are also easy-to-care for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-1-out-of-156-corporators-raises-ajni-tree-felling-issue/articleshow/83128077.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Goa||Goa: Congress objects to BJP propaganda at vaccination centre||PANAJI: If the Pramod Sawant-led state government continues to use photos of its party functionaries on banners outside Covid vaccination centres during the ongoing Tika Utsav, similar photos should also be used on death certificates of Covid-19 victims, said Congress on Monday. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat and state party general secretary Amarnath Panjikar said that displaying pictures of BJP office bearers outside vaccination centres was nothing but an attempt to seek cheap publicity. “We demand that the publicity hungry chief minister Pramod Sawant must write to the Prime Minister and BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavde must write to BJP national president J P Nadda with the demand that photos of BJP functionaries must be displayed on the death certificates of those succumbing to Covid-19 and at every crematorium and burial ground,” said Panjikar. Kamat raised strong objections after banners were put up outside a Covid vaccination centre with photographs of Nadda, Tanavade, Union minister Shripad Naik and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar. “Publicity hungry BJP Goa displays banners with photos of BJP India functionaries and lotus symbol at Covid vaccination centre at Adarsh High School, Margao. This is government of Goa programme and political parties have no right to claim a credit for the same. Collector of South Goa must act,” said Kamat. South Goa District Congress president Joe Dias has demanded an apology from Tanavade for misusing taxpayers’ money to seek publicity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-objects-to-bjp-propaganda-at-vaccination-centre/articleshow/83128072.cms||---
