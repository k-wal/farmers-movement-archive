The current pandemic has made people reflect on what needs to change in the world. So, recently, 13 artists of the Geechugalu collective planned an ‘art map’ of all things that make this old Bengaluru area what it is, while also subtly showing us what we need to work on as a society for a better tomorrow. The planning of ‘Malleshwaram Hogona’, in association with Bengaluru Moving — 12 artworks from Malleswaram 18th Cross to 8th Cross, mostly on the conservancy lanes — began in March this year. The artists began work on April 1, 2021, and in 12 days, the historically-significant lanes came alive with beautiful works of art — each depicting something about the area. ‘MALLESWARAM PLEASANTLY SURPRISED US’ “We were initially hesitant about doing street art in a conservative area like Malleswaram, and thought that we might not be allowed to do it. Most of the properties on the conservancy lanes are owned by senior citizens and we were surprised at how open they were to allow us to work on the walls and, in turn, make it a public space. People usually just look at us and walk away in most of the other parts of the city, but here, the locals were very involved. They asked questions and treated us very well. This shows that they really care about the area and want it to keep its essence,” says Yash Bhandari, creative lead, Geeghugalu. TAKE A WALK DOWN A NEW MALLESWARAM Now that the lockdown restrictions have eased, you can either refer to the walking map designed by Maanvi Kapur or use the interactive live map on the collective’s website, and explore the artworks by foot. Geechugalu picked the conservancy lanes to give a push to the movement by Bengaluru Moving, Sensing Local and Malleswaram Social to reimagine the purposes of the conservancy lanes as places for senior citizens to use as a gym, for children to use as a park, and to promote more walking. PUTTING THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE UNDERREPRESENTED While the theme of the project is Malleswaram, each artist was free to take their own inspiration. For Parameshwar Waran that was giving a larger-than-life space to the underrepresented. For his artwork, he chose to make a photorealistic mural of Narayanamma, a pourakarmika who works on and near 13th Cross. “People’s standing in society has to do with the job that they have. A pourakarmika’s job is not considered at par with, say, a techie’s. But they are such an important part of our lives — they keep the city clean, come rain or shine, and yet they go unnoticed. Usually, murals are done of ‘important’ personalities and stars, so when I was drawing her, a lot of people asked me who she is. And that is what I wanted — for people to take notice. I wanted my work to be an equalizer of sorts. I really hope that this brings more attention to pourakarmikas,” says Parameshwar, a resident of neighbouring Sreerampura. COFFEE, DOSAS & FLOWER MARKETS The walk begins with Saksham Verma’s work, titled ‘Greetings From Malleshwaram’. On a wall spread over 60 feet, Saksham, with the help of 20 volunteers, has portrayed everything that Malleswaram is known for, in his typographic work in Kannada and English, near the 18th Cross bus stand. “This is an important bus stop, where not just locals, but tourists also get off at. So, I wanted the artwork to resonate with both groups. In the typography, you will see all the things that make Malleswaram what it is — the flower market, fruits, love for coffee, dosa, etc. I was surprised that 20 volunteers turned up with just a post on social media. They had all tested negative for Covid-19, and over three days, we finished the work. What was amazing was that a sugarcane juice seller closeby would give us juice throughout the day and a lady, who never even told us her name, gave us food just because she was happy that we were doing something there. I feel this has created an episodic experience for people. Residents have seen us work hard on this, and I hope that the next time someone wants to spit paan, they will do it elsewhere,” Saksham says with a laugh, adding that involving the locals in his work places a sense of ownership on them. ‘THE CONSERVANCY LANES ARE NOW WELCOMING’ And this is the experience that Gaurav Srinivas, an architect and resident of Malleswaram, who volunteered for the project, had. “I saw a post on social media and was attracted to the complexities of it. I enjoyed working on this project and I already see conversations taking place around it. The entire area looks better now. Somehow, the timings of the artworks and a general upkeep of the conservancy lanes coincided. I used to avoid the lanes earlier because they were dirty and unsanitary. But now, they look welcoming,” he says, with a smile. REIMAGINING MALLESWARAM It is interesting to note that traditionally, backdoors of homes opened out onto the conservancy lanes, and these doors were typically used to let servants in, who were not allowed to use the front door. So, there are several layers to the messages that are being sent out through the ‘Malleshwaram Hogona’ murals. By having many young, local volunteers on board for the project, the Geechugalu collective is facilitating a process by which they can give locals the tools to do such projects in public. “The new-gen of Malleswaram needs to own the area. We are using this pandemic as an opportunity to reimagine what Malleswaram can become. It is one of the most well-gridded and organised areas of the city, but is that enough? There are different kinds of sociological problems that we face today; for e.g., can we talk about the politics of the conservancies? The fact that the backdoors opened out to it because servants couldn’t use the front door is in itself very political. These lanes are being revived now, with a push to make them walker-friendly. So, how do we all work together to enhance the experience of these conservancies? Those who volunteered with us have the appetite to reimagine what these lanes can be. We were biased about the people of Malleswaram not being open to what we did there, but we were pleasantly surprised and our bias about it being a conservative area was proved wrong. So, yes, the future looks very promising,” Yash says, signing off.

Local fuel consumption- a proxy for oil demand - in May slumped to its lowest since last August as lockdowns and restriction in several states stalled mobility and muted economic activity. The fuel demand showed signs of resurgence this month due to the lifting of lockdowns by states and a gradual pick-up in economic momentum, Pradhan said at an energy summit organised by BNEF. India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, imports over 80% of its oil needs. Asia's third-largest economy has been hit hard by a spike in global oil prices, with its tax-heavy retail prices of gasoline and gasoil touching record highs. "Inflation is a challenge to the globe today ...so we are also facing this challenge in our economy. But with all these challenges we are confident by the end of this calendar year we will be in a position to restore our original consumption behaviour," Pradhan said. The minister has repeatedly asked the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to ease supply curbs for a demand-led recovery. Ahead of the meeting of Opec and its allies on July 1, Pradhan said he expect oil prices to ease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-sees-fuel-demand-recovery-to-pre-pandemic-level-by-end-2021/articleshow/83966353.cms||---
---||World||First African American named to lead US Forest Service||WASHINGTON: Veteran forester Randy Moore has been named chief of the US Forest Service, the first African American to lead the agency in its 116-year history. Moore, 66, replaces Vicki Christiansen, who has led the agency since 2018. The Forest Service, a division of the Agriculture Department, oversees 193 million acres of public lands in 154 national forests and 20 national grasslands. Moore has served as a regional forester in the California based Pacific Southwest Region since 2007, where he has responsibility for 18 national forests in California and Hawaii. He will take over from Christiansen as head of the 30,000-employee agency upon her retirement on July 26. Christiansen and Moore will collaborate on what is already shaping up as a severe wildfire season in the West, where an epic drought, complicated by climate change, has made putting out fires more challenging and strained firefighting resources throughout the region. In the Pacific Northwest, where an extended heatwave has triggered record-breaking temperatures in Oregon and Washington state, fire crews have been positioned in high-risk areas, and cities and counties have imposed burn bans. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who appointed Moore, called him a catalyst for change and creativity in carrying out the Forest Service's mission to sustain the nation's forests. As a regional forester, Moore has been at the forefront of climate change, most notably leading the region's response to the dramatic increase in catastrophic wildfires in California over the last decade, Vilsack said. His proven track record of supporting and developing employees and putting communities at the centre of the Forest Service's work positions him well to lead the agency into the future at this critical time in our country, Vilsack said in a statement. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., praised Moore's selection as Forest Service chief. California understands all too well the challenges facing our forests and I'm glad a Californian will head efforts to tackle them,'' she said. Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman, the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Moore a seasoned professional, adding: I sincerely hope we can work together on mitigating catastrophic wildfires, opening up our national forests to sustainable lumber harvesting, making forests more resilient against insects and diseases and much more. Before heading the Pacific Southwest region, Moore was a regional forester in the Wisconsin-based Eastern Region, where he oversaw forests in 20 states. Moore started his federal career in 1978 at USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service in North Dakota. He has worked at national forests in Colorado, North Carolina and Missouri, a national grassland in Kansas and as an administrator in Washington. Moore's appointment comes as Congress and the Biden administration push to increase firefighter pay and convert at least 1,000 seasonal wildland firefighters to year-round workers as fires have grown more severe. President Joe Biden last week called for an increase in pay for federal firefighters, who start as low as $13 an hour. That's a ridiculously low salary to pay federal firefighters, Biden said. That's going to end in my administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/first-african-american-named-to-lead-us-forest-service/articleshow/83965291.cms||---
---||World||Washington says it will not 'stand by in the face of horrors' in Tigray||WASHINGTON: Ethiopia and Eritrea should anticipate further actions from the United States if the announced cessation of hostilities does not lead to improvements in the Tigray region, a senior US State Department official said on Tuesday. Robert Godec, acting assistant secretary of state for the State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, said the Biden administration was far advanced in its assessment of whether to call events crimes against humanity, genocide or war crimes. "The administration is in full agreement that horrifying atrocities are being committed in Tigray," he told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. The former rulers of Ethiopia's Tigray said on Monday they were back in control of the regional capital Mekelle after nearly eight months of fighting, and the government which ousted them declared an immediate unilateral ceasefire. The developments marked a turn in a conflict that has killed thousands of people, displaced more than 2 million and pushed hundreds of thousands to the brink of famine. Godec said Washington welcomed the Ethiopian government's decision to declare a temporary end to hostilities, but warned that the United States will watch closely to determine whether the ceasefire results in changes on the ground. "We will not stand by in the face of horrors in Tigray," he said, urging the Eritrean government to immediately join in the cessation of hostilities and calling for a commitment of all parties to a permanent, negotiated ceasefire in the region. "Every effort must be made to make this ceasefire meaningful, including discussions with all parties to the conflict," said Representative Karen Bass, who chairs the panel's Africa subcommittee. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Greg Meeks said that if the disaster in Tigray is not abated, "we could witness one of our closest and most powerful allies in Africa march toward civil war and, eventually, a state collapse." The fighting has been punctuated by reports of gang rapes and mass killings of civilians. At least 12 aid workers have been killed. Last week, an Ethiopian military airstrike on a crowded market killed at least 64 people and wounded 180. Doctors said that children were among the dead and wounded and that Ethiopian troops prevented ambulances from reaching the scene for more than a day. The military said all the victims were combatants. Representative Michael McCaul, the committee's top Republican, said that in his assessment acts of genocide had been carried out against residents of Tigray and called for targeted sanctions. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he raised the issue at a Group of 20 meeting of foreign ministers in Italy. "I sought robust action to push all parties to commit to a negotiated ceasefire to resolve the conflict in Tigray," he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/washington-says-it-will-not-stand-by-in-the-face-of-horrors-in-tigray/articleshow/83966313.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: We are a welfare state, not East India Company, says high court||BENGALURU: The government should treat its employees with due deference, keeping in mind the heartburn that those retiring soon could suffer if they are repeatedly or abruptly displaced without a plausible explanation, the high court observed while directing that an official be continued at his current posting. “Our Constitution envisages a welfare state and not an entity like the East India Company of the bygone era,” a division bench headed by Justice Krishna S Dixit observed while pointing out that the government is not claiming that the petitioner-official is incompetent, unsuitable or undesirable for the post of special land acquisition officer. Petitioner Vasantkumar, due to retire on April 30, 2022, was posted as special land acquisition officer (SLAO), KIADB, Dharwad on January 6, 2021 and he took charge the next day. Within 24 hours, he was transferred as deputy commissioner (revenue), Hubbali-Dharwad Municipal Corporation. On January 21, 2021, Mohammed Zubair, registrar of a university, was given additional charge of Vasantkumar’s SLAO post. Vasantkumar moved the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal, challenging both the orders. On March 10, 2021, the tribunal dismissed both pleas. He then moved the high court, contending that the minimum retention period hadn’t been adhered to and service conditions were violated. The government argued that the second transfer order is only a modification and was the employer’s prerogative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/we-are-a-welfare-state-not-east-india-company-hc/articleshow/83966699.cms||---

It is rare to find women priests at temples or other religious forums though there is no such ban in the scriptures. However, 17-year-old Anagha Bhat from Dasakodi village in Bantwal taluk found the path easier as her father and priest Kashekodi Sooryanarayana Bhat encouraged her to study Sanskrit and Vedas and helped her become a priest in her own right. In fact, it was her grandfather Guruvayoore Bhat, who would repeatedly ask a young Anagha why wasn’t she interested in learning the Vedas. Years later, she fulfilled her grandfather’s wish and learnt the Vedas from her father. She has been assisting her father for two years in solemnizing marriages and performing rituals in other religious events, besides taking up independent assignments as a purohit under the watchful eyes of her father. The PU student said she’s “extremely happy” that people insist she lead the rituals in religious events. “I am born and brought up in a family of purohits. All in our family, without exception, encouraged me to learn Sanskrit, the Vedas and become a purohit. I have learnt 15 suktas of Rig Veda and Rudrapaata of Yajur Veda from my father,” the teenager added. Her father Sooryanarayana Bhat said there are no restrictions on women from learning the Vedas and other rituals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pu-student-is-first-woman-priest-from-family-of-purohits/articleshow/83966700.cms||Vinobha K T

The highly infectious strain has caught many nations off guard, with Russia reporting its highest daily death toll yet, Australia shutting down city after city and fears growing over major sporting events like Euro 2020 and the Olympic Games. According to an AFP tally, high-income countries have administered an average of 79 doses per 100 inhabitants, with the UAE, Bahrein and Israel taking the lead. In low-income nations, the figure is just one shot per 100 people. On Tuesday, foreign ministers from the G20 countries stressed the need for greater global cooperation in the face of the pandemic. "Multilateral cooperation will be key to our collective ability to stop this global health crisis," US secretary of state Antony Blinken said in Italy. Meanwhile, WHO, concerned about Delta, have urged even fully vaccinated people to wear masks.

A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka gave this direction after pointing out that for the past four months despite granting sufficient time, the government had neither placed the cabinet decision nor filed its statement of objections, explaining its stand. “Why is the state government hesitating to take a stand? We are struggling to find out,” the bench told the government advocate, who at first instance indicated that some “action” is being taken and later requested the court to grant two more weeks’ time. “As of today, the state has not placed on record its stand... We have no option but to direct the chief secretary to file an affidavit as to why the orders of this court have not been complied with. The affidavit shall be filed within one week from today. The matter may be listed on July 8 for considering the affidavit,” the bench said. The court is hearing a PIL filed by Davanagere resident DR Sharada, who has sought for a direction to ban all forms of online gambling and betting until an appropriate regulatory regime is established and regulations are framed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/court-why-is-state-govt-hesitating-to-take-firm-stand-on-online-betting-gambling/articleshow/83966776.cms||---

Karnataka is ranked third in SDG’s India Index for 2020-21, improving its score from 66 in 2019-20 to 72 in 2020-21. A delegation of Niti Aayog, which was on a two-day tour of Karnataka, asked the government to meet the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-set goals. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa assured the team that the state has already made it mandatory for all departments to meet the SDG and it has been announced in the 2020-21 budget. In the SDG India 2020-21 report, Karnataka ranked third with Andhra Pradesh and Goa with an Index score of 72. Of the 16 goals in SDG India-2021 report, Karnataka has one goal (7) in achiever , 9 goals in front-runner and 5 goals in performer categories. The category pertains to industry, innovation and infrastructure, wherein the state has been disputing the parameters set by Niti Aayog. In February 2020, then chief secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar had written to Niti Aayog, citing that the parameters undermined the service sector’s contribution in the industries segment and its ranking dropped from 5 to 21 in 2019-2020. In 9 goals, the state is a “front-runner” and in 5 other goals, it's in the “performer” category. The government also issued a handbook of 20 best practices initiated by various departments, with the CM suggesting their implementation across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/niti-aayog-asks-ktaka-to-focus-on-nutrition-of-moms-to-be-kids/articleshow/83966851.cms||---

---||Business||Musk set to invest up to $30 billion in Starlink||BARCELONA: Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk said Tuesday he plans to invest up to 30 billion dollars to develop his ambitious Starlink satellite internet service. Starlink plans to deploy thousands of low-orbit satellites to provide high-speed internet to isolated and poorly connected areas. It has so far deployed over 1,500 satellites and by August it will be able to provide coverage everywhere in the world except the North and South Poles, Musk told the Mobile World Congress, a telecoms industry conference underway in Barcelona, by video. The Tesla chief said he expects to invest "at least five billion dollars, and maybe as much as ten billion" in Starlink before the service has a positive cash flow. "Then over time it is going to be a multiple of that, and that would be 20 or 30 billion dollars. It is a lot basically," he added. Starlink is currently operating in about a dozen countries, with more being added, and it currently has just over 69,000 active users, Musk said. "We are on our way I think to having a few hundred thousand users, possibly over 500,000 users, within 12 months," he added. "There is a need for connectivity in places that don't have it right now, or where it is very limited." Musk said Starlink had two partnerships with "major company telcos" to develop the satellite internet service but gave no further details. His SpaceX firm, which operates Starlink, has requested authorisation from US regulator the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to deploy up to 42,000 satellites to provide the satellite internet service. Starlink faces competition from a number of rivals including OneWeb, a broadband satellite communications company acquired by a consortium of investors comprising the UK government and Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Global, and Amazon subsidiary Kuiper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/musk-set-to-invest-up-to-30-billion-in-starlink/articleshow/83966900.cms||---

Covishield is produced by the Serum Institute of India and has been distributed to African nations as part of the Covax initiative to give poor and developing countries access to vaccines. But Covishield is not one of four vaccines approved by the EU for its planned digital vaccination certificate, which is intended to allow people to travel freely within the EU. The 54-nation African Union said late on Monday that Covishield's exclusion could lead to discrimination against African travellers. Non-recognition of Covishield endangers the "equitable treatment of persons having received their vaccines in countries profiting from the EU-supported COVAX Facility, including the majority of the AU states," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/african-union-wants-covishield-approved-for-eu-covid-certificate/articleshow/83967208.cms||---

In a meeting with CEOs of all clubs, Football Sports Development Ltd, the body that organises the league, said they are committed to the development of young players as “there has been a limited number of competitions and leagues since the start of the pandemic outside the professional game.” The league has already made it mandatory for ISL clubs to sign at least four development player – those born on or after January 1, 2001 – with two of them as part of the match-day squad. Most of these players will get limited time on the field, so the organisers have suggested another league to keep these players, and others who don’t get a chance, engaged. “This will be a developmental league,” one senior club official told TOI on Tuesday. “We have been told that this won’t strictly be for under-21 players. A few overage players will be allowed, while many clubs want their reserves to have a chance.” While most clubs are open to the idea of participating in the developmental league, there are concerns over the budget. In a separate presentation to the clubs, they were told to set aside a budget of Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore for team travel and accommodation. The organisational and operational costs will be borne by the league. “The developmental league is a very good idea, but I am not sure if all clubs are willing to spend the money. There has to be ways where the expenses are cut down,” said another official. The proposed two-month league will be held in Goa inside a bio-secure bubble between January and March, following the same medical and safety procedures as ISL. All teams will play each other once with the top four qualifying for the knockout stage. Last season the ISL saw a rise in performances of developmental players with Lalengmawia (NorthEast United), Suresh Singh (Bengaluru FC) and Akash Mishra (Hyderabad FC) all making it to the national team. Players like Ashish Rai, Rahul KP, Jeakson Singh, Rahim Ali, Ninthoinganba Meetei, Shubham Sarangi and Hendry Antonay also caught the eye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-proposes-new-league-for-reserve-u-21-players/articleshow/83967398.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Raja Ram Jevaji Bettasur, a resident of Dharwad, met Madhusudan, one of the gang members, when he had come to Bengaluru a few months ago. Madhusudan sent fake documents to Bettasur with the help of his associate Sridhar Murthy. They claimed they needed Rs 25 lakh to get the fund released in favour of Murthy. Bettasur did not know Murthy and Madhusudhan were working in tandem. He pledged his agricultural land for Rs 10 lakh and took Rs 15 lakh as loan from his friend Sangamesh. Bettasur transferred Rs 14 lakh to two bank accounts provided by Murthy’s aides and gave Rs 11 lakh in cash to the gang members at Doddakallasandra on Kanakapura Road on June 24. The gang members then demanded Bettasur arrange for Rs 10 lakh. However, Bettasur sensed something amiss and filed a cheating case against Sridhar Murthy, Kantharaju, Madhusudan, Naveen Kumar, Shivashankar and Manjunath. Woman orders wine online, loses 12k to fraudsters A 38-year-old woman from Richmond Town lost nearly Rs 12,000 to cybercriminals while placing an online order for wine. Sana (name changed) said she was looking to buy wine online, found a mobile number on the internet and ordered for one bottle. The call receiver asked her to pay first and promised to deliver the wine to her house. “I paid Rs 5,900 online and got a call from the same number. The caller claimed to be a wine store employee and asked me to pay Rs 20 more to generate a bill with GST. He sent me a QR code, which I initially refused to scan, and demanded my money back. He sent me another QR code for repayment and I scanned it only to find that another Rs 5,900 had been debited from my account. In all, I lost Rs 11,800,” Sana said in her complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gang-shows-fake-business-papers-man-loses-25l/articleshow/83967513.cms||---
---||World||Miami high-rise collapse uncovers history of corruption and bribes||WASHINGTON: The country that pioneered the high-rise building concept (also called skyscrapers when New York City eclipsed the first multi-storyed structures in the midwest) is having a moment of reckoning following the collapse of condominium in Miami that is evocative of such frequent disasters in Mumbai. Americans are hearing and watching in horror stories of corruption, and building code violations in a saga more akin to those in developing nations than in a nation that prides itself on enforcing laws. The disquiet extends beyond the collapse of the 12-storied beachfront building: Six days after the disaster only a dozen bodies have been recovered from the 159 unaccounted victims believed entombed in the rubble. The growing list of red flags now being revealed with Champlain Towers South building is alarming residents far beyond the North and East towers - which were built later - that remain standing. Some are abandoning apartments over questions about the structural integrity of buildings amid concerns that saline water inflow in such seafront properties are corroding the foundations. According to local reports, the South Towers, promoted and built in 1981 by a Canadian developer and two other American principals, all of whom are since deceased, involved short cuts and payoffs to navigate through the permit system. The 12-storied, 136-unit tower was on the verge of undergoing a $15 million renovation to pass a 40-year re-certification required by the Miami Dade county, when it collapsed last Thursday. It now transpires that engineers had warned the management as early as 2018 about problems with the structure. Although the concept of high-rise structures goes back into millennial history, Americans pioneered the idea of multi-storied offices and dwelling units. The skyscraper boom in America is said to have begun in Chicago in 1885 with William Le Baron Jenney's Home Insurance Building, which rose to 10 storeys (and to 12, after an 1890 addition) before it was overtaken by New York City, which in 1930 build the 102-storied Empire State Building in just one year, and which remained the world's tallest building till 1970 when the World Trade Center was built. There was been very few structural collapses in the US, mainly due to strict code enforcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/miami-high-rise-collapse-uncovers-history-of-corruption-and-bribes/articleshow/83967432.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

---||World||Spain's PM reopens talks with Catalan separatists||MADRID: Spain's prime minister met Tuesday with the chief of Catalonia for the first time since his government pardoned nine separatist leaders of the affluent region's separatist movement. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez sat down with Catalan regional president Pere Aragones for two and a half hours at the Moncloa palace, the seat of Spain's government. The Spanish leader had warned that the road to normalizing relations with Catalonia's separatists would be a long one. As expected, the meeting was more about getting the sides to talk again. Aragones repeated his demand for an authorized referendum on independence, as well as a complete amnesty for all those facing legal trouble for their roles in the region's illegal 2017 secession bid. Sanchez had previously said that a ballot on independence by a region is unconstitutional and that the way forward is satisfying the Catalans' needs by focusing on social and economic issues. "The first meeting with Pedro Sanchez has shown how far apart our positions remain and the evident differences that exist to resolving the conflict," Aragones said afterwards. But, Aragones added that the two leaders agreed that delegations from their respective governments will meet in September to start "a new round" of negotiations. Last week Sanchez's government pardoned the nine separatists who had spent over three years in prison for instigating the 2017 secession bid that threw Spain into crisis. Spain's government hopes the meeting with Aragones helps further mend relations with the nation's northeastern corner surrounding Barcelona where roughly half the voters support pro-secession parties. Sanchez, a socialist, has made rebuilding bridges with the separatists a main goal of his left-wing coalition government. He and the separatists agreed to open talks in February 2020. But the issue of the imprisoned separatist leaders was a major stumbling block, and Sanchez had not met with a separatist leader since then. While Sanchez has been accused by Spain's right-wing opposition of appeasing radicals who want to rupture Spain, the meeting comes with political risks for Aragones as well. Aragones, who became the new regional leader of Catalonia in May, is being pressured to make another unilateral attempt at secession by his hard-line cohorts. Despite the pardons, the legal plight of some separatists is not over. Some are still on the run from Spanish law after fleeing to other European countries, and Spain's National Accountability watchdog said Tuesday that it will ask former Catalan officials to pay back millions of euros that they used to promote the secessionist cause abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/spains-pm-reopens-talks-with-catalan-separatists/articleshow/83967988.cms||---
---||World||Covaxin rolling data to start in July: WHO||HYDERABAD: Indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin moved yet another step closer to a World Health Organisation (WHO) approval, with the global health body stating on Tuesday that post the pre-submission meeting held on June 23 with Bharat Biotech, the rolling data will be starting in July. The status of Covid-19 vaccines within the EUL/PQ (emergency use listing/prequalification) evaluation process was updated on Tuesday by WHO in its latest guidance document. WHO had accepted Bharat Biotech’s expression of interest (EoI) for the inactivated vaccine in mid-June after the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker provided the additional data that it had sought. A senior Bharat Biotech official had told TOI that Covaxin’s dossier would be complete and taken up for review by WHO only after the company submits the entire Phase-3 clinical trials data in July. Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech’s joint managing director Suchitra Ella tweeted on Tuesday: “Covaxin will cross new frontiers, adhering highest international regulatory guidelines. A new vaccine from India is all set to make history once again, with proven data, safety & quality.” Bharat Biotech had submitted the Covaxin Phase-3 data to the Indian drug regulator in the third week of June. The data, which was reviewed by the subject expert committee (SEC) that advises the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), had indicated an overall efficacy of 77.8% against SARS-CoV-2 virus. The company’s top brass had earlier said that they expect a WHO EUL in the July-September quarter this year. WHO's nod would be a major booster for Covaxin as it would open the doors of several countries to the vaccine and put to rest concerns of international travellers about restrictions being imposed on those who have taken jabs not yet approved by WHO. While some countries like Israel, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece and Poland have already put in place vaccine passport systems, European Union will be implementing the system from July 1. The Bharat Biotech official had indicated the feedback they had received from WHO had indicated that an approval may not be a very long-drawn process as the cell line and a majority of the company’s facilities have already been audited and approved by WHO for other vaccines like Typhoid, Polio and Rotavirus. “We already have several WHO prequalified vaccines. It’s not like a new company going for WHO prequalification. All our QC, QA, everything is audited already for our other vaccines…The Vero Cell line that we are using for Covaxin is the same line that we use for the Rotavirus vaccine also,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covaxin-rolling-data-to-start-in-july-who/articleshow/83968017.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Business||Facebook launches newsletter product Bulletin, its Substack rival||Facebook Inc launched its newsletter product "Bulletin" on Tuesday, a standalone platform for free and paid articles and podcasts that will aim to rival Substack. CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the platform, which is live at Bulletin.com, and introduced some of the writers that the company has recruited in a live audio room on Facebook. Facebook is pushing to compete in the fast-growing email newsletter trend, as high-profile journalists and writers have left media companies over the past year to strike out on their own. Self-publishing platform Substack is a leader in helping writers sell email subscriptions, and has lured journalists with cash advances. Other tech companies are also competing in the field, including Twitter Inc, which acquired newsletter platform Revue. Facebook said it would not take a cut of Bulletin creators' revenue at launch and that creators can choose their own subscription prices. It is launching the platform with a number of high-profile personalities and writers, including sportscaster Erin Andrews, author Malcolm Gladwell and "Queer Eye" star Tan France. The social network has had a tumultuous relationship with the news industry, which came to a head in February after a showdown with the Australian government over paying news outlets for content. Following the conflict, Facebook pledged to invest $1 billion in the news industry globally over the next three years. The company said the articles and podcasts would also be available through the Facebook News Feed and through Facebook's News section. "We built Bulletin on a separate website to enable creators to grow their audience in ways that are not exclusively dependent on the Facebook platform," it said on the new site. Facebook said it was primarily launching with US creators and it was not accepting new ones at this time. But it said the Bulletin site was available worldwide and it would look to add more international names after the beta test. In April, Facebook said it would pay $5 million to recruit independent local journalists to write for its new publishing platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/facebook-launches-newsletter-product-bulletin-its-substack-rival/articleshow/83968080.cms||---

Pakistan and China enjoy a "very special relationship" spanning over 70 years and nothing could change these time-tested ties, Khan said in an interview with English-language state-broadcaster China Global Television Network, an excerpt of which was shared on his Instagram account. Talking about the evolving regional rivalry between the US and China, he said that "Pakistan thinks it is very unfair for the US or other powers - western power" to pressurise "countries like us to take sides" in a conflict with China. "Why should we take sides? We should have good relations with everyone. It is not going to happen if pressure is put on Pakistan to change its relationship or downgrade its relationship with China, it wouldn't happen," Khan said. Emphasising the deep relationship with China, Khan said that Pakistan would never bend under any kind of pressure. "Whatever will happen, our relationship between the two countries - no matter what pressure is put on us - is not going to change," he said.

---||World||No indictment for Georgia officer who killed Black driver||ATLANTA: A grand jury has declined to indict a former Georgia state trooper who shot and killed a Black man last year after trying to pull him over for a broken tail light. Jacob Thompson, who worked for the Georgia State Patrol, had been arrested on charges of felony murder and aggravated assault in the August 7 death of 60-year-old Julian Lewis. After the case was presented to a Screven County grand jury Monday, the grand jurors did not indict Thompson on any of the charges. Francys Johnson, an attorney for Lewis' family said they want to see video from the shooting. He also called on district attorney Daphne Totten to empanel another grand jury to try again to get an indictment. A woman who answered the phone in Totten's office on Tuesday said the district attorney was in court in another county. Totten did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment. Keith Barber, an attorney for Thompson, released a statement thanking the grand jury for "listening diligently to the evidence in this case and coming to this just and fair determination." "We trust this will be the end of this long ordeal that the Thompson family has had to wrongfully experience because of Trooper Jake Thompson only doing his job to protect the Citizens of the State of Georgia," Barber said. Lawyers for Lewis' family had applauded Thompson's arrest a week after the shooting and subsequent firing by the Georgia State Patrol. They were further heartened when Screven County judge F. Gates Peed initially denied bond for Thompson in September, saying it "would be inappropriate" to allow bond at that moment given the facts in the case. Peed granted a $100,000 bond in November after seven people, including four law enforcement officers, testified on Thompson's behalf. Lawyers for Lewis' family expressed disappointment Tuesday with the grand jury's decision, saying the system too often fails to provide justice for Black people. "Make no mistake about it, we believe that this was a very strong case," Johnson said during a livestreamed news conference in Savannah. "The evidence was there. It still is." Barber said Thompson, his family and his defense team offer their condolences to Lewis's family, but he defended Thompson's actions. "Jake Thompson has committed no crime in relation to his interaction with Julian Lewis," Barber said. "He has clearly shown he only acted in self defense in this situation." Thompson, who is white, tried to pull Lewis over for a broken tail light in rural Screven County, near Georgia's border with South Carolina. When Lewis didn't immediately stop, the trooper pursued him and forced his car into a ditch, then shot Lewis in the head. Thompson wrote in his incident report that he shot Lewis as Lewis was revving his engine and turning his steering wheel, as if he was trying to ram the trooper. But Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent Dustin Peak testified in September that was impossible, because Lewis' car battery disconnected when it hit the ditch, leaving the vehicle inoperable. Peak testified that dash camera video shows one second elapsed between the time the trooper got out of his patrol vehicle and when he fired the shot that killed Lewis. Johnson noted that district attorneys have great power in the indictment process and essentially can present what they want to present how they want to present it. The evidentiary standard of "probable cause" required for an indictment is much lower than the "beyond a reasonable doubt" required to convict someone at trial. While grand jury proceedings are secret and people accused of crimes do not generally get the opportunity to appear before grand jurors to present their side, Georgia law does have an exception that allows police officers accused of crimes to testify before a grand jury. Johnson said he wants to see the transcript of the grand jury proceedings: "If the presentation went like the prosecution has gone thus far, we will not be surprised by what we see if there is underzealous prosecution.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/no-indictment-for-georgia-officer-who-killed-black-driver/articleshow/83968313.cms||---
---||World||Overseas BJP UK group slams 'anti-India' Labour leaflet being distributed in Batley and Spen bypoll||LONDON: Overseas Friends of BJP-UK has written a letter to Labour party chief Sir Keir Starmer calling for the withdrawal of an "anti-India, anti-democratic" leaflet promoting his party candidate in a parliamentary byelection. The flyer for Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater in the Batley and Spen byelection has a picture of Indian PM Narendra Modi with UK PM Boris Johnson along with the message: "The risk of voting for anyone but Labour is clear". The title of the flyer is "Don't risk a Tory MP who is not on your side". Labour activists have been distributing the leaflet in areas populated with Hindus and Muslims from Gujarat and J&K, as well as from PoK. Leadbeater is the sister of the constituency's former Labour MP Jo Cox, who was murdered. The byelection, which takes place on Thursday, was triggered after the former MP was elected West Yorkshire mayor. Labour is in a fierce battle to retain the seat it has held since 1997. Besides Tories, hard-left politician George Galloway, leader of Workers Party of Britain, is targeting to get hold of the constituency. He is said to be successfully wooing away disillusioned Muslim voters upset with Starmer's tough stance on anti-Semitism and his neutral position on Palestine. Kuldeep Shekhawat, president of OFBJP-UK, raised objection to the use of Johnson- Modi's 2019 G7 summit photo as well comment regarding "human rights abuses" in Kashmir in the flyer. "We would like to express our dissent to the misuse of a photo of the PM of India in one of the campaigns by Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater. We kindly request you to verify the facts," he wrote in letter to Starmer. Conservative MP Bob Blackman said, "The disgraceful literature purports to use Boris Johnson and Narendra Modi to condemn the local campaign. To jeopardise such an important relationship for a mere parliamentary byelection seems outrageous." Labour Friends of India too condemned the leaflet. "It is unfortunate that the Labour party used a picture of the PM of India, the world's largest democracy and one of the UK's closest friends, on its leaflet."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/overseas-bjp-uk-group-slams-anti-india-labour-leaflet-being-distributed-in-batley-and-spen-bypoll/articleshow/83968742.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||SA court orders arrest of former president for contempt||JOHANNESBURG: South Africa's highest court on Tuesday ordered the imprisonment of Jacob Zuma, the country's former president, for 15 months on contempt charges, after he defied an order to appear before a corruption inquiry examining the breathtaking financial scandals that tainted his tenure from 2009 to 2018.  The move to detain Zuma, a comrade of Nelson Mandela and one of the dominant figures in the governing African National Congress party since apartheid ended in 1994, was a notable development in the legacy of corruption that shadowed his years in power. Zuma was not in court on Tuesday, and he was not taken into custody. The decision by the Constitutional Court to have Zuma arrested came five months after that same body ordered him to appear before the corruption inquiry. But Zuma defied the court. Not only did he fail to show up to testify before the inquiry, but he also ignored the court's contempt proceedings, declining to so much as mount a defence. The call to imprison Zuma for his defiance comes at a time when many fed-up South Africans seem to have coalesced behind the efforts of the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to root out corruption in the government and the ANC party. The looting of public enterprises by government officials has taken a heavy toll on the lives of ordinary citizens, felt in problems like the shoddy delivery of services, frequent power outages and water shortages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/sa-court-orders-arrest-of-former-president-for-contempt/articleshow/83969087.cms||---
---||World||Indian symbols adorn UK coat of arms||A British peer of Indian origin, who famously took up his seat in the House of Lords by swearing his oath of allegiance on the Rig Veda, has broken new ground through the design of a personal coat of arms containing Indian symbols and Sanskrit text. Lord Jitesh Gadhia, who became the youngest Indian parliamentarian in the House of Lords in 2016, has been working with the outgoing head of the Royal College of Arms, Sir Thomas Woodcock, for several years to design an emblem using the traditional art of British heraldry which incorporates influences from his Indian heritage and family history. Commenting on the design, Gadhia said: "The aim was to take the best of British heraldry and combine it with iconic Indian symbols and a nod to Uganda, where I was born. Having taken my oath of office using the Rig Veda, I am also pleased that it has helped to inspire my coat of arms." The coat of arms created for Baron Gadhia of Northwood, his formal title, will be officially signed and sealed this week by Woodcock in one of his final acts before retirement on 30 June. The patent has been hand painted by a herald, with the text written by a scrivener. The European custom of using coats of arms dates back to the 12th century when they were worn over armour in battle and in tournaments, so that opponents could identify each other. Each coat of arms is unique, carefully researched for its style and iconography and must be distinct from all previous arms on record at the College of Arms. The Gadhia coat of arms features two Asiatic Lions on either side, known as 'supporters', which are inspired by the habitants of the Gir National Park in Gadhia's native state of Gujarat, the last remaining habitat for this endangered species. Each lion is holding a triple-headed spear or 'trishul', a divine symbol connected with various trinities of Hindu spiritual thought. It also invokes Britannia, the national personification of Britain, as a helmeted female warrior holding a shield and trident. The shield in the centre of the design is headed by an indented fortress pattern, derived from the prefix of Gadhia's family name "Gadh", meaning fort. The shield features three eternal knots (known as Srivatsa) referencing India, Uganda and UK, the countries of Gadhia's origin, birth and adoption respectively. Srivatsa is an auspicious ancient symbol in Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism - first found on clay tablets from the Indus Valley Civilisation, dating around 2500 BC. Above the shield, by tradition, sits the coronet of a Baron made out of red velvet, ermine and silver, together with a helmet. At the apex is the crest - in Gadhia's case a lotus flower - surrounded by a mantle of peacock feathers, representing the national flower and bird of India. Gadhia's chosen motto, emblazoned at the foot, is a Sanskrit phrase from the Rig Veda scribed in the Devanagari text: "Aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah" (Let noble thoughts come to me from all directions).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/indian-symbols-adorn-uk-coat-of-arms/articleshow/83970483.cms||NAOMI CANTON

---||World||Brazil's Bolsonaro under fire after vaccine deal allegations||BRASILIA, Brazil: Accusations that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro turned a blind eye to possible corruption in a deal to purchase coronavirus vaccines have heightened threats to his presidency, including a move to recommend slapping him with a criminal charge.  The claims have added impetus to the opposition's impeachment drive and left the Brazilian leader's allies in Congress evaluating the costs of their support.  Bolsonaro, who has been targeted by nationwide street protests in recent weeks, has called the senate committee investigating the government's Covid-19 response a "national shame" aimed at undermining his administration. For two months, the nationally televised hearings have largely focused on why his health ministry ignored opportunities to buy vaccines while Bolsonaro relentlessly pushed hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug that rigorous studies have shown to be ineffective in treating Covid-19.  Testimony before the senate committee last week from Luis Ricardo Miranda, the chief of the health ministry's import division, and his brother Luis Miranda, a lawmaker until recently allied with Bolsonaro, has turned up the heat even more.  The health ministry official said he faced pressure to greenlight the import of Indian pharmaceutical Bharat Biotech's Covaxin vaccine and that there were irregularities in the invoices - particularly a $45 million upfront payment to a Singapore-based company.  In March, the brothers brought their concerns to Bolsonaro, who they said promised to send the case to the Federal Police and mentioned the government's leader in Congress's lower house, a top Bolsonaro ally, as being involved.  However, the Federal Police never received any request to investigate, neither from Bolsonaro nor his health ministry, according to a Federal Police source with knowledge of investigations who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and declined to be named.  The secretary general of the presidency, Onyx Lorenzoni, told reporters last week that Bolsonaro did meet with the Mirandas but claimed they presented fraudulent documents and ordered the brothers investigated.  Bharat Biotech has denied any allegation of wrongdoing with respect to vaccine supply, saying in an emailed statement that it adheres to the highest standards of compliance. The company's press representative didn't respond when asked why a payment would be routed through a Singapore-based company.  The case has galvanized Bolsonaro's opponents and prompted protest organizers to move up their next nationwide demonstration to Saturday. Bolsonaro's approval rating has reached an all-time low, according to pollster Datafolha.  Seven of the 11 members of the senate committee investigating Bolsonaro's Covid-19 response told The Associated Press that, once their inquest concludes, in August at earliest, they will vote to approve recommending Bolsonaro be indicted on the charge of prevarication. The crime entails delaying or refraining from action required as part of a public official's duty for reasons of personal interest.  Senator Randolfe Rodrigues and senator Humberto Costa spoke on record with the AP. Five senators spoke on condition of anonymity due to concerns that detailing plans will expose the committee to attacks from the government and its allies.  Bolsonaro on Saturday said the committee has "seven scoundrels" among its members. He has denied all wrongdoing and knowledge of possible corruption.  Any committee recommendation for indictment would need to be accepted by the prosecutor general, a Bolsonaro appointee, then approved by Congress before an investigation could begin.  The committee is "a big threat to Bolsonaro, but one step at a time," said Thiago de Aragao, director of strategy at political risk consultancy Arko Advice, who added the accusations have increased the pressure.  "But it's only a gamechanger if you have an important portion of congressmen ... shifting sides and endorsing this kind of action against him."  Last year, Bolsonaro began drawing close to the large "Centrao" bloc in Congress to shore up his legislative agenda and stave off risks of impeachment. In the wake of the allegations against Bolsonaro, its lawmakers have begun reevaluating the risks of backing him, according to Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university.  "It's still in their interest to follow the government at this moment," Couto said. But, he added, "Defending a president who is very compromised is difficult for anyone. Politicians and parties won't want to associate their image with a president like that. There's a limit to everything."  The opposition has filed more than 100 impeachment requests, but house speaker Arthur Lira, a Centrao member, reiterated in an interview Friday with local media Jota that there aren't sufficient reasons for him to greenlight proceedings.  The Miranda brothers' Senate committee testimony "fundamentally changes the debate, because at that moment the president had the duty to take some sort of measure" or explain why their claims were baseless, said Davi Tangerino, a professor of criminal law at the Getulio Vargas Foundation.  The health ministry signed a contract for 20 million Covaxin doses in February. However, the government hasn't yet made any payments nor were any vaccines yet provided due to obstacles in the health regulator's approval process.  Even before the Miranda brothers' testimony last week, federal prosecutors were already investigating possible irregularities in the contract, which committed the health ministry to pay $320 million - at a cost of $15 per vaccine dose, the most expensive of all vaccines Brazil purchased - to Bharat Biotech's representative in Brazil, according to a document sent to the AP by the prosecutor-general's press office.  The political dust has yet to settle, but the case is a sign that Bolsonaro will face additional headwinds with his reelection bid next year.  "The extent of the political damage remains uncertain," newspaper O Globo wrote in an editorial published Tuesday. "Concretely, the only thing one can say is the government is cornered and ever more hostage to allies."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazils-bolsonaro-under-fire-after-vaccine-deal-allegations/articleshow/83969460.cms||---

One plaintiff in the federal lawsuit filed Monday alleges Strauss abused him during more than 10 medical exams in the 1980s, starting when he was a 16-year-old high school wrestler whose team competed on the Ohio State campus. He said he was also later abused by Strauss during required medical exams while playing football and wrestling for OSU.  A different wrestler in the lawsuit alleges Strauss fondled him during more than 50 medical visits.  More than 400 alumni have raised similar allegations in lawsuits against the university, alleging abuse throughout the doctor's two decades at OSU. A law firm investigation conducted for Ohio State concluded employees were aware of concerns about Strauss as early as 1979 but didn't stop him.  OSU has apologized publicly to anyone Strauss harmed. It has reached nearly $47 million in settlements for 185 plaintiffs, and announced an individual settlement program that could help resolve more claims from five of the remaining lawsuits. That program isn't open to plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed more recently.  No one has publicly defended Strauss in the three years since the allegations started to become public.  The newest plaintiffs also include former athletes in baseball, lacrosse, cheerleading, soccer, football, basketball, gymnastics and fencing, and and patients treated at the student health center, where Strauss also worked before his retirement from Ohio State. Most of them are listed anonymously in the new complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-lawsuit-more-men-were-abused-by-ohio-state-doctor/articleshow/83970102.cms||---
---||World||After suit, New Jersey to house inmates based on gender ID||New Jersey's prison system is about to begin housing inmates based on gender identity, the result of a lawsuit filed in 2019 by a transgender woman who said she was forced to live in men's prisons for a year and a half.  The new policy goes into effect July 1 and provides greater protections for transgender, intersex and nonbinary people in state prisons, most importantly by housing them based on the gender they identify with rather than by sex assigned at birth. Inmates can provide information about their gender identity at any time during their incarceration, under the policy.  Other protections include single-cell housing while final housing determinations are being made; being able to shower separately from other inmates; the right to have input into housing decision and to appeal those decisions, and a prohibition of physical examinations to determine an inmate's genital status. Pat-down searches or strip searches by transgender women by male officers will be prohibited.  The policy will be maintained for at least one year, according to the settlement.  "This policy places New Jersey in the vanguard of states committed to protecting transgender, intersex, and nonbinary people in prison housing determinations and continues its path toward eliminating discrimination based on gender identity," said Tess Borden, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in New Jersey, which represented the woman along with attorney Robyn Gigl.  Under terms of the settlement, the woman, identified in court papers as Sonia Doe, will receive $125,000 in damages and $45,000 for attorneys' fees, and won't face any sanctions in connection with an assault that occurred in prison in May 2019.  "When I was forced to live in men's prisons, I was terrified I wouldn't make it out alive. Those memories still haunt me," Doe said in a statement. "Though I still have nightmares about that time, it's a relief to know that as a result of my experience the NJDOC has adopted substantial policy changes so no person should be subjected to the horrors I survived."  The New Jersey Department of Corrections didn't immediately return a request for comment.  The change comes at a time when New Jersey is grappling with reports of widespread abuses and systemic failures at its only women's prison, the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women in Clinton.  Ten prison guards face criminal charges stemming from an alleged assault on inmates, including a transgender woman, in January. Several corrections officers at the prison have pleaded guilty or been convicted of sexual abuse and misconduct in recent years, and last year a Department of Justice report concluded officials failed to take action to prevent rampant abuse at the facility despite being aware of systemic problems.  Corrections Commissioner Marcus Hicks resigned this month, a day after Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said he would close the prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/after-suit-new-jersey-to-house-inmates-based-on-gender-id/articleshow/83970618.cms||---

The Ukrainian parliament, Verkhovna Rada, voted to endorse a bill that sets up an independent panel to appoint judges. It includes a provision that gives international experts a decisive voice in selecting the nominees. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the bill's approval and promised to quickly sign it into law. He emphasized that the High Qualification Commission to be created to appoint judges would be formed in a way that would exclude any candidates tainted by corruption. ``The Verkhovna Rada has empowered a key instrument to ensure justice in the judicial system,'' Zelenskyy said in a statement on Facebook. The U.S. Embassy in Ukraine welcomed the new legislation as ``an important step forward toward comprehensive judicial reform.'' It said on Twitter that the U.S. stands ready to help Ukraine ``realize this historic opportunity to renew Ukraine's judicial system on behalf of the Ukrainian people.'' The U.S. and the EU long have pushed Ukraine to conduct a comprehensive judicial reform to uproot rampant corruption. Zelenskyy was elected in 2019 on pledges to combat the country's endemic graft and end a war with Russia-backed separatists in the country's east that erupted after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/ukrainian-parliament-approves-key-judicial-reform-bill/articleshow/83969986.cms||---

"After an eight-day trial, Richard Ayvazyan, 42, his wife Marietta Terabelian, 37, and his brother Artur Ayvazyan, 41, all of Encino, were each found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, 11 counts of wire fraud, eight counts of bank fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Richard Ayvazyan was also found guilty of two counts of aggravated identity theft and Artur Ayvazyan was found guilty of one count of aggravated identity theft," the justice department said in a press release. A fourth defendant, Vahe Dadyan, was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, six counts of wire fraud, three counts of bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and one count of money laundering, the release said. The defendants used the loan payments totaling more than USD 18 million to purchase luxury homes, gold coins, diamonds, luxury watches, designer handbags and a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, the release added. Evidence presented at the trial showed the defendants used fake, stolen, or synthetic identities to submit fraudulent applications for the loans to the Small Business Administration (SBA), including fake identity documents, tax documents, and payroll records to execute the scheme, the release said. The jury also found the defendants must forfeit bank accounts, items purchased and about USD 450,000 in cash, according to the release. Sentencing is scheduled for September 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-jury-convicts-4-over-fake-applications-for-covid-19-relief-funds/articleshow/83970439.cms||---
---||World||US Justice Dept says Google depositions should be in person||WASHINGTON: An attorney for the US Justice Department said on Tuesday that he wanted depositions planned for August in an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet's Google to be live rather than on Zoom. The government hopes to question or depose, three people in August, one Google employee and two people who left Google, one in 2011 and 2013. The government sued Google last year, alleging that it broke antitrust law in seeking to hobble rivals. That lawsuit has been combined for discovery purposes with a broader antitrust lawsuit brought by 38 states and territories. We wanted to let the court know that we hope to do all or most of these depositions in person, said the Justice Department's Kenneth Dintzer, noting that the three first people that he wanted to depose were in California. It is our understanding that California is re-open. Kenneth Dintzer also said in the status conference, which was being held remotely, that he hoped to also return to regular court hearings. Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court for the District of Columbia also discussed whether the Justice Department should be allowed to see performance reviews of executives that the government is considering calling as witnesses. Mehta said that after reading a sample of the reviews that they were potentially useful but urged the government to request performance reviews only of people they wanted to depose. He further asked the two sides to agree on a protocol for safeguarding anything personal in them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-justice-dept-says-google-depositions-should-be-in-person/articleshow/83966968.cms||---
---||World||US agency orders automated vehicle makers to report crashes||DETROIT: The US government's highway safety agency has ordered automakers to report any crashes involving fully autonomous vehicles or partially automated driver assist systems.  The move Tuesday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicates the agency is taking a tougher stance on automated vehicle safety than in the past. It has been reluctant to issue any regulations of the new technology for fear of hampering adoption of the potentially life-saving systems.  The order requires vehicle and equipment manufacturers and companies that operate the vehicles to report crashes on public roads involving fully autonomous vehicles, or those in which driver assist systems were operating immediately before or during a crash.  "By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems," NHTSA Acting Administrator Steven Cliff said in a statement.  The agency says it will look for potential safety defects, and the information could cause it to send out a crash investigation team or open a defect investigation.  The order comes after NHTSA has dispatched special investigation teams to 31 crashes involving partially automated driver assist systems since June of 2016. Such systems can keep a vehicle centered in its lane and a safe distance from vehicles in front of it. Of those crashes, 25 involved Tesla's Autopilot system in which 10 deaths were reported, according to data released by the agency.  Tesla and other manufacturers warn that drivers using the systems must be ready to intervene at all times. Teslas using the system have crashed into semis crossing in front of them, stopped emergency vehicles and a roadway barrier.  The agency also is investigating non-fatal crashes involving partially automated systems in a Lexus RX450H, a Volvo XC-90, and two Cadillac CT6s. In addition, teams investigated crashes involving an automated Navya Arma low-speed shuttle, and another Volvo XC90 operated by Uber in which a pedestrian was killed in Arizona.  The National Transportation Safety Board, which also has investigated some of the Tesla crashes, has recommended that NHTSA and Tesla limit Autopilot's use to areas where it can safely operate. The NTSB also recommended that NHTSA require Tesla to have a better system to make sure drivers are paying attention. NHTSA has not taken action on any of the recommendations.  Jason Levine, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group, said the crash reporting is a welcome first step by NHTSA. The center has been asking the agency to oversee automated vehicles for several years.  "Collecting crash data, and hopefully data from crashes which were avoided, can help serve a variety of purposes from enforcing current laws, to ensuring the safety of consumers, as well as paving the way for reasonable regulations to encourage the deployment of safe advanced vehicle technology," Levine said in an email.  Companies have to report crashes involving fully autonomous or partially automated vehicles within one day of learning about them, if they involve a hospital-treated injury, a death, air bag deployment, pedestrians or bicyclists, or were serious enough for a vehicle to be towed away.  Other crashes involving vehicles equipped with the systems involving injury or property damage have to be reported every month. The requirement does not apply to consumers who own vehicles or auto dealers.  NHTSA says in a statement that the data can show if there are common patterns in crashes involving the systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-agency-orders-automated-vehicle-makers-to-report-crashes/articleshow/83971162.cms||---
---||World||Last German troops leave Afghanistan after nearly 20 years||BERLIN: Germany's last troops left Afghanistan Tuesday after a nearly 20-year deployment in the country, the defense minister said. Defense minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer tweeted that the last Bundeswehr soldiers ``left Afghanistan safely'' Tuesday evening. She thanked the more than 150,000 troops who have served there since 2001 and said that ``they can be proud of this mission.'' The German military said that the last troops were on their way home via Tbilisi, Georgia, and that Brig. Gen. Ansgar Meyer, the last commander of the German contingent, was on board an Airbus A400M aircraft bringing them home. NATO agreed in April to withdraw its roughly 7,000 non-American forces from Afghanistan to match U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to pull all American troops from the country starting May 1. At the time, Germany had around 1,100 troops there. Germany's contingent, which focused on northern Afghanistan, was the second biggest in the current Resolute Support mission after the United States'. Its last bases were in Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul. ``An historic chapter is coming to an end, an intense deployment that was exacting for the Bundeswehr and marked it, in which the Bundeswehr proved itself in battle,'' Kramp-Karrenbauer said. The German parliament first approved sending the military to Afghanistan in December 2001, and the first troops arrived in Kabul in January 2002. Fifty-nine German troops died in Afghan missions over the years. American officials have said the entire pullout of US troops will most likely be completed by July 4. Around 750 containers' worth of equipment has been shipped back to Germany by land and air, including 120 vehicles and six helicopters, the Bundeswehr said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/last-german-troops-leave-afghanistan-after-nearly-20-years/articleshow/83971195.cms||---
---||World||Police kill man near California pot farms evacuated by fire||WEED: Officers shot and killed a man who pulled a gun as they tried to keep him out of a complex of marijuana farms in an area of far Northern California where thousands of people were ordered to evacuate as a wildfire raged during a heat wave enveloping part of the US West, authorities said.  Siskiyou County Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue told The Sacramento Bee that the man was trying to drive into the Mount Shasta Vista subdivision on Monday and pointed a handgun at a group of officers that included a sheriff's deputy and local police.  "Based upon preliminary information, it appears that there might have been a couple rounds fired from the suspect's firearm," LaRue said.  The officers killed the man, who was not immediately identified.  The subdivision has been converted into a huge network of marijuana farms mostly run by Hmong families. The county has banned large-scale marijuana cultivation but thousands of pot greenhouses have sprung up. Police efforts to shut them down have been countered with claims of racial discrimination.  The violence erupted as the Lava Fire grew rapidly and the sheriff's office issued evacuation orders for the communities of Lake Shastina, Juniper Valley and Mount Shasta Vista. The flames spanned nearly 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) Tuesday.  The total number of people forced to flee the area was unclear. The Sacramento Bee reported that nearly 3,000 people live in Lake Shastina and as many as 8,000 others live in the area to tend to the thousands of marijuana grows.  "All evacuation orders are still in place at this time. We do not know what structures have burned down and the status of many areas," the sheriff's office said on social media Tuesday.  Ignited by lightning on June 24, the fire is burning brush and timber in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest north of the town of Weed, about 250 miles (402 kilometers) north of San Francisco.  Nearly 500 firefighters were battling the flames in rough and rocky terrain.  They faced a tougher fight because the region was under excessive-heat warnings, with high temperatures expected to range from 100 degrees (38 Celsius) to 110 degrees (43 Celsius).  It comes as an unprecedented heat wave in the Pacific Northwest broke temperature records in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, this week and moved inland Tuesday. Climate change is making such extreme weather events more likely and more intense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/police-kill-man-near-california-pot-farms-evacuated-by-fire/articleshow/83971570.cms||---

The intense weather that gave Seattle and Portland consecutive days of record high temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celcius) was expected to ease in those cities. But inland Spokane was likely to surpass Monday's high temperature - a record-tying 105 F (40.6 Celsius).  About 8,200 utility customers in parts of Spokane lost power on Monday and Avista Utilities warned that there will be more rolling blackouts on Tuesday afternoon in the city of about 220,000 people, with the high temperature predicted at 110 F (43.3C), which would be an all-time record.  Avista had to implement deliberate blackouts on Monday because "the electric system experienced a new peak demand, and the strain of the high temperatures impacted the system in a way that required us to proactively turn off power for some customers," said company president and chief executive Dennis Vermillion. "This happened faster than anticipated."  Customers on Tuesday should expect more "targeted protective outages" Tuesday, he said.  A high of 117 degrees F (47 C) was predicted in the southeastern Washington cities of Richland, Kennewick and Pasco. The state's highest-ever recorded temperature was 118 degrees F (47.7 C), recorded in 1961.  The United Farm Workers urged Washington governor Jay Inslee to immediately issue emergency heat standards protecting all farm and other outdoor workers in the state with a strong agricultural sector. The state's current heat standards fall short of safeguards the UFW first won in California in 2005 that have prevented deaths and illnesses from heat stroke, the union said in a statement.  Unlike workers in California, Washington state farm workers do not have the right to work shade and breaks amid extreme temperatures.  "I was off today so I was helping distribute water and information to the cherry harvesters," said Martha Acevedo, a wine grape worker from Sunnyside, Washington, said in a union statement. "They were struggling. No shade, not even cold water."  Garbage collectors in Walla Walla started their shifts at 3 am instead of the usual 7 am in an effort to beat the heat.  Seattle was cooler Tueday with temperatures expected to reach about 90 F (32.2 C) after registering 108 degrees F (42 Celsius) on Monday - well above Sunday's all-time high of 104 F (40 C). Portland, Oregon, reached 116 F (46.6 C) after hitting records of 108 F (42 C) on Saturday and 112 F (44 C) on Sunday.  President Joe Biden, during an infrastructure speech in Wisconsin, took note of the Northwest as he spoke about the need to be prepared for extreme weather.  "Anybody ever believe you'd turn on the news and see it's 116 degrees in Portland Oregon? 116 degrees," the president said, working in a dig at those who cast doubt on the reality of climate change. "But don't worry - there is no global warming because it's just a figment of our imaginations."  The heat wave was caused by what meteorologists described as a dome of high pressure over the Northwest and worsened by human-caused climate change, which is making such extreme weather events more likely and more intense.  The temperatures have been unheard of in a region better known for rain, and where June has historically been referred to as "Juneuary" for its cool drizzle. Seattle's average high temperature in June is around 70 F (21.1 C), and fewer than half of the city's residents have air conditioning, according to US Census data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rolling-blackouts-in-parts-of-us-northwest-amid-heat-wave/articleshow/83971571.cms||---
---||World||New York City mayoral race grows more uncertain after new vote count||NEW YORK: New vote totals released on Tuesday in New York City's Democratic mayoral contest sharply narrowed the lead for Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, leaving the outcome even more uncertain with thousands of absentee ballots still to be counted over the coming weeks.  Kathryn Garcia, a former sanitation chief for the city, was in second place, while Maya Wiley, a former MSNBC analyst and civil rights lawyer, was in third.  Adams held a considerable lead on Election Day a week ago, based on the initial count of first-choice ballots from voters who cast ballots in person.  But for the first time, the mayoral election used a ranked-choice system, in which voters could rank up to five candidates in order of preference. Tuesday's tally was the first analysis of those choices, though it included no mail-in ballots.  The ranked-choice system operates as a series of instant runoffs. The candidate in last place is eliminated, and his or her votes are redistributed to voters' second choice. The process repeats until there are only two candidates remaining, and the one with a majority is declared the winner.  After 11 rounds of elimination, Adams was ahead of Garcia 51% to 49%, with a margin of just under 16,000 votes among more than 700,000 total ballots.  Wiley was the final candidate eliminated; in the penultimate round, she trailed Garcia by fewer than 4,000 votes.  Tuesday's count, however, did not include any of the approximately 125,000 absentee ballots that have been received, which could easily alter the final results.  Garcia's campaign has said it expects to benefit from absentee ballots, which were turned in at high rates in neighborhoods where she did better than Adams and Wiley. In a statement, Garcia said she was "confident about a path to victory."  Adams' campaign did not immediately comment on the results. In a statement, Wiley called for every vote to be counted and urged all New Yorkers to support the results.  Elections officials plan to rerun the ranked-choice voting tabulation next week, this time with at least some absentee ballots included. Final results are not expected until mid-July.  Last week, Adams had 32% of first-choice ballots, based on the incomplete results released on Election Day. Wiley was at 22%, and Garcia stood in third at 19%.  Andrew Yang, the former presidential candidate, was in a distant fourth place and conceded the race on the night of the election.  The winner of the Democratic primary will be a heavy favorite in November's general election against Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels civilian patrol group. Democratic voters outnumber Republicans in the United States' most populous city by more than a six-to-one ratio.  The next mayor will oversee the city's arduous recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which has been marred by a sharp spike in shootings. The city is also confronting deep-seated issues such as a lack of affordable housing, homelessness and wealth inequality.  The rise in crime dominated the campaign, providing an early look at how Democrats nationally might approach the issue of policing ahead of next year's congressional midterm elections. Republicans intend to portray Democrats as left-wing extremists who want to "defund the police," a rallying cry echoed by some liberals last year amid nationwide protests over police brutality.  Adams, who put public safety at the heart of his bid for mayor, vowed to beef up policing. Wiley, by contrast, argued for cutting one-sixth of the police department's $6 billion budget and redirecting the money to mental health aid and other social services.  Any one of the three leading contenders would make history if elected mayor. Adams would be only the second Black mayor in city history, while Wiley would be the first Black woman and Garcia the first woman to hold the position.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-city-mayoral-race-grows-more-uncertain-after-new-vote-count/articleshow/83971811.cms||---
---||World||Groups sue Biden administration over planned expansion of nuke work||COLUMBIA: Watchdog groups sued the Biden administration Tuesday over its plans to produce plutonium cores for the US nuclear stockpile, arguing federal agencies have failed to conduct a detailed environmental review of potential impacts around installations in New Mexico and South Carolina.  A lawsuit filed against the Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration calls on the federal agency that oversees US nuclear research and bombmaking to take a legally required "hard look" at impacts on local communities and possible alternatives before expanding manufacturing of the plutonium cores used to trigger nuclear weapons.  The suit comes as US officials have doubled down on a push to modernize the country's nuclear arsenal and the science and technology that accompany it, citing global security concerns. The nuclear agency has said most of the plutonium cores currently in the stockpile date back to the 1970s and 1980s.  Los Alamos National Laboratory in northern New Mexico and the Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina face deadlines to produce a set number of plutonium cores in coming years.  On Monday, the National Nuclear Security Administration gave key approval to the production project at the Savannah River Site. Yearly production of 50 or more cores at the South Carolina location is now estimated to cost between $6.9 billion to $11.1 billion, with a completion date ranging from 2032 to 2035.  The watchdog groups said Tuesday that the agency took a piecemeal approach to decide on locating the production at Los Alamos and the Savannah River Site, where nearby communities are already underrepresented and underserved.  "The environmental risk of there being an accident at either location causing the release of radioactive materials is real, and it would have significant consequences to the surrounding environment and communities," said Leslie Lenhardt, an attorney with the South Carolina Environmental Law Project, which is representing the groups.  A spokesperson for the nuclear agency declined to comment, citing policy on pending litigation.  The efforts to bolster the nuclear arsenal have spanned multiple presidential administrations, with the Biden administration reviewing modernization efforts begun during the Obama years that continued under Donald Trump's presidency.  Critics of the plan are worried about lagging deadlines and bloated budgets on top of security concerns and the risks of nuclear waste and contamination. Some have argued the U.S. doesn't need the new plutonium cores.  Tom Clements of Savannah River Site Watch said the South Carolina location was picked for political reasons following the failure of a facility designed to convert weapons-grade plutonium into commercial nuclear fuel. As the Savannah River Site has never served as a storage or production site for the pits in its history, establishing pit construction there would be "a daunting technical challenge that has not been properly reviewed," Clements said.  Beginning in the 1950s, plutonium pits were produced at the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado, which had a long history of leaks, fires and environmental violations that needed a $7 billion, yearslong cleanup. That has left critics concerned about similar problems arising if new plutonium warhead factories are established in New Mexico and South Carolina.  Production moved in the 1990s to Los Alamos, where production over the years has been sporadic, plagued by safety problems and concerns about a lack of accountability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/groups-sue-biden-administration-over-planned-expansion-of-nuke-work/articleshow/83971820.cms||---

The fresh affirmation comes months after the company termed the government’s move to formulate policy and rules around content moderation as “a legitimate scrutiny”, where it also emphasised that respect for Indian laws is “non-negotiable”. Mohan said, “The (Indian) government wants to limit the misuse and abuse of social media platforms by bad actors, and that is an agenda that we are entirely aligned with.” ‘Makes sense to have rules on content’His views mirror the statement made by IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who too had insisted that the IT Rules “empower the users of social media when they become victims of abuse and misuse”. The positive signalling by the Mark Zuckerberg-controlled social media group comes at a time when compatriot Twitter is engaged in a high-pitched battle with the Indian government over adherence to new guidelines. While WhatsApp has challenged the mandate on compulsory traceability of “unlawful” messaging in the Delhi high court, the social media giant seems to be broadly in agreement on all other provisions. “The agenda of safety and security online is an important agenda for us, especially in a country where we have 700 million people online. I think it makes sense to have a framework for accountability and for having rules around harmful content,” Mohan said. Mohan said Facebook and its group companies have been taking several steps to make platforms safe for users, while providing adequate user hygiene and security when it comes to content. This, he said, has been a global initiative of the company and has been rolled out across markets where they have a presence. ‘In fact, over the last few years, as a company, we have invested a lot in this area. Ensuring the safety of our users and keeping harmful content off our platforms takes up a remarkable amount of resources and investments, billions of dollars every year and a significant investment in headcount, all focused on keeping harmful content off our platform.” He said that the efforts to make the platforms safe include both technological interventions and human supervision. “We do this in multiple ways — by creating policies and guidelines to define the content that is permitted on our platform, and by investing in automation and machine learning systems and in the work, we do around our human reviewers.” In India, the company has trained 1.65 lakh girls and women around online safety, privacy and tackling misinformation. Further, it plans to augment this effort by including 1.5 lakh more girls into the programme which is being conducted in collaboration with the National Commission for Women. “We believe we have led the way on some of these efforts globally and our commitment to the agenda of safety is sincere and real. We know that our work in this space will never be done. There will always be more to do — particularly as technology evolves and online behaviours change on an almost daily basis,” Mohan said. The Facebook India MD said that while adhering to the new IT Rules, the company will continue to invest to stay ahead when it comes to making the platforms safe for the users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/it-rules-make-sense-facebook-backs-new-regulations/articleshow/83971786.cms||Pankaj Doval

He will take charge on Wednesday noon. An order in this regard was issued by the ministry of home affairs on Tuesday. Srivastav has served in RAW for nine years and handled sensitive assignments, including a stint in London. He is at present posted as special commissioner, vigilance. The present police chief, S N Shrivastava, is set to retire on Wednesday afternoon. Srivastav will retire in 2024 and is thus expected to have a fairly long tenure as police commissioner. Srivastav had earlier served as director general of police of Puducherry, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In Delhi Police, he was the chief of intelligence, economic offences wing, and also headed the elite anti-terror unit, special cell, in the rank of special commissioner. Srivastav did his graduation in economics honours from St Stephen's College, followed by an MA in economics from Delhi School of Economics and an LLB from Delhi University. The MHA notification issued on Tuesday read, "Balaji Srivastava, IPS (AGMUT: 1988), will hold the additional charge of commissioner of police, Delhi, in addition to his regular charge until the appointment of a regular incumbent or until further orders, whichever is earlier." Among those who were in the race for the top cop's post were Satyendra Garg and Taj Hasan from the 1987 batch and SBK Singh and S Sundari Nanda from the 1988 batch. The names of two officers from the J&K cadre were doing the rounds as well. With Srivastav taking charge as the top cop, Taj Hasan is most likely to proceed on central deputation or be posted as DGP in a northeastern state because of his cadre. Garg is already serving in the Andamans. Delhi Police's current chief, S N Shrivastava, will retire after a tenure of around one-and-a-half years. He was serving in CRPF on deputation when he was brought in overnight to quell the northeast Delhi riots. Shrivastava not only controlled the riots within 24 hours but also presided over a most extensive riots investigation, which involved registration of 750 FIRs and arrest of over 1,800 persons for the violence that led to 53 deaths and injuries to hundreds of people. Shrivastava is credited with handling the Covid-19 situation in a very efficient manner even as he ensured that his men who were infected with Covid got the best possible treatment. He also managed to enforce the lockdown quite smoothly and handled the migrant crisis successfully without the use of force. With him at the helm, the force also showed its human side and came out to help lakhs of needy people during the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-top-cop-headed-terror-intel-units-earlier/articleshow/83972058.cms||Raj Shekhar

A booster dose against Covid is being explored in some countries with other vaccines. Similar research is being considered in India too, said ICMR-NIV director Priya Abraham. A booster shot will come after the first two doses of any vaccine and may have to be given regularly (perhaps after a year or two, or later) to keep the immune system primed against SARS-CoV-2 variants. A person receiving a booster will not have to repeat an entire two-dose schedule. "Covaxin could be more effective at tackling emerging variants. It can play a useful role as a booster vaccine because both antibodies and cells of the immune system (mounted by Covaxin) are able to recognise and neutralise more proteins of the virus, apart from the spike protein," said Abraham. Booster shots with a whole virus inactivated vaccine have proven to work well after two doses of any vaccine. "Inactivated vaccines can trigger a strong immune reaction, though it may not be the same as the immune response to live attenuated vaccines. So, a person may need booster shots" added Abraham.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covaxin-booster-dose-can-fight-variant-menace/articleshow/83972142.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The deal to buy 20 million doses of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin shot has become a headache for Bolsonaro after whistleblowers went public with alleged irregularities. One health ministry official said he alerted the president about his concerns. Bolsonaro, whose popularity has faded as Brazil's Covid-19 death toll climbed past 500,000, has denied any wrongdoing, saying on Monday he was not aware of any irregularities. But thorny questions refuse to go away, and may pose problems for him ahead of next year's presidential vote. Brazil health minister Marcelo Queiroga said at a news conference his team would probe the allegations during the suspension. "According to the preliminary analysis of the CGU, there are no irregularities in the contract but, for compliance, the Health Ministry chose to suspend the contract," the ministry said in a statement. Earlier on Thursday, CNN Brasil reported that the ministry had decided to cancel the contract. Brazilian federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into the deal, citing comparatively high prices, quick talks and pending regulatory approvals as red flags. It is also being probed by a Senate panel investigating the government's handling of the pandemic. One of the leading opposition senators on that panel filed a formal criminal complaint against Bolsonaro at the Supreme Court on Monday. Senator Randolfe Rodrigues said he wanted the court to investigate "the serious allegations" and to find out why Bolsonaro "did not take any action after being notified of the existence of a giant corruption scheme in the Health Ministry."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/brazil-to-suspend-covaxin-vaccine-deal-as-graft-allegations-probed/articleshow/83972121.cms||---
---||World||South Dakota to send National Guard troops to Texas||SIOUX FALLS: South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem announced Tuesday that she will join a growing list of Republican governors sending law enforcement officers to the US border with Mexico. Noem's announcement that she will send up to 50 South Dakota National Guard troops to Texas comes as the GOP ramps up a political fight with President Joe Biden over border security. The issue has drawn a host of prominent GOP figures: former President Donald Trump was expected to travel to the border this week and Republican governors from Florida, Nebraska and Iowa have all committed to sending law enforcement officers for border security. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this month announced plans to build more barriers along the border. Abbott's new push has been criticized as political theatre, but he has defended the plan, saying the number of border crossers remains high. The governor said he will use $250 million in state money and crowdsourced financing for the barriers, although the timeline and cost for the push are unclear. It also faces potential court challenges from the federal government. Large numbers of migrants have been showing up at the U.S. border with Mexico, with many turning themselves over to US Border Patrol agents in seeking legal asylum status. But the numbers of families and children travelling without their parents crossing into the US have dropped sharply since March and April, while the encounters with single adults have remained high. A private donation will fund the cost of sending the South Dakota National Guard troops, Noem said. The deployment is expected to last from 30 to 60 days, while the other states involved are sending law enforcement officers for roughly two-week stints. Noem, who is seen as a potential presidential contender, distinguished her decision to send the National Guard and other governors who are sending state police officers. ``The border is a national security crisis that requires the kind of sustained response only the National Guard can provide,'' she said in a statement. ``We should not be making our communities less safe by sending our police or Highway Patrol to fix a long-term problem President Biden's Administration seems unable or unwilling to solve.'' The governor's spokesman Ian Fury said the donation for the deployment came from Willis and Reba Johnson's Foundation. Willis Johnson, a Tennessee-based founder of an online used car auction called Copart, regularly makes large contributions to Republicans, including $200,000 to the Trump Victory Committee last year. Fury said ``the governor welcomes any such donations to help alleviate the cost to South Dakota taxpayers,'' but declined to provide estimates on the cost of the deployment, citing ``security reasons.'' However, Democratic state Sen. Reynold Nesiba said the fact Noem was using a donor to pay for the deployment showed it was not a `` real priority'' for the state, but instead gave her ``political cover.'' He said he was looking into whether using a private donation to fund the deployment is legal. This could set a dangerous precedent to allow anonymous political donors to call the governor and dispatch the Guard whenever they want,'' he said. Meanwhile, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he has declined a request from Texas to provide state troopers. Hutchinson said sending National Guard troops was still an option and has asked the adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard to evaluate that possibility. ``Because of the public safety needs we have here in Arkansas and because of the important work they're doing here, I will not be sending the Arkansas State Police to the border,'' he told reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/south-dakota-to-send-national-guard-troops-to-texas/articleshow/83971127.cms||---

Till recently, about three deaths on average were being reported from hospitals in the capital, but the sudden rise in numbers had health minister Keshab Mahanta worried. He rushed to the hospital at 1.30 in the morning. "I have come here to oversee how the hospital is functioning. Twelve patients have died. We need to make some changes in management here. Senior doctors are needed at night," Mahanta told reporters on Tuesday. The minister inspected the functioning of each department and emergency service as there have been allegations that there are not enough senior doctors at night at government hospitals. Even as Mahanta brushed aside speculations about a third wave hitting the state already, he said preparations are on in full swing to protect children from any fresh surge. "At GMCH we are readying 300 beds for children. Every district hospital is being readied to tackle a possible third wave," the minister said. The GMCH administration said low oxygen saturation among patients and lack of vaccination was the main reason for the fatalities in the last 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/12-covid-deaths-in-24-hours-at-main-guwahati-hospital/articleshow/83972193.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Some parts of the city were hotter: It was 44.4°C at Najafgarh, while Pitampura, Mungeshpur and Pusa stations recorded 44.3°C. The earlier highest temperature in Delhi this year was 42.2°C on April 28. A delayed monsoon, clear skies and north-westerly winds led to the rise in mercury, Kuldeep Srivastava of IMD said. A heatwave was announced in the city - the second this year after March 29 - which is unusual now as the phenomenon is mostly witnessed till mid-June. IMD predicted heatwave conditions at isolated places on Wednesday, with the maximum likely to be around 42°C. Slight relief is expected from July 2 onwards with the possibility of rain in parts of Delhi. However, the monsoon was unlikely to reach the city in the next five days, it added. The capital did not witness a heatwave in April and May because of cloud cover and a series of western disturbances, Srivastava said. The IMD defines a heatwave day when the maximum is 4.5°C and more above the normal temperature and the maximum is at least 40°C. A heatwave is also declared if the maximum touches 45°C or above. A 'severe heatwave' is declared when the maximum is 6.5°C or more above normal. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 27.4°C, one notch below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 78% and 25%. Meanwhile, Gurgaon reeled under an intense heatwave on Tuesday with the mercury level touching at 44 degrees Celsius - 5.8 notches above normal -, making it the hottest day of the season. The minimum temperature settled at 28 degrees Celsius. As the monsoon continues to evade, Tuesday was Gurgaon's first spell of heatwave, which troubled the residents amid sultry weather conditions throughout the day. According to an IMD official, there will be no respite for the next two days and residents will continue to face the hot and humid conditions with strong surface winds. However, the city may see light rain and thundershowers on Friday at isolated areas in the region. "It is this region's first spell of heatwave in this season. There is a strong possibility of the heatwave continuing on Wednesday. Dry and hot weather conditions will continue for the next two days and strong surface winds are likely to prevail over the region. There is no possibility for the monsoon to hit in the next 5 days, although some rainfall and thunderstorm activities are likely to be seen on Friday." According to the IMD's weekly forecast, Gurgaon will see a partly cloudy sky accompanied by gusty winds (40-50 kmph) and heatwave conditions at isolated places on Wednesday. The minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to hover around 30 and 43 degrees Celsius, respectively. Meanwhile, the air quality on Tuesday deteriorated slightly and slipped to the 'poor' category for the first time this month. The overall AQI was recorded at 206 as against 171 on the previous day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heatwave-grips-city-as-mercury-touches-43c-highest-this-year/articleshow/83972267.cms||---

In issuing the order, the Transportation Department said the US State Department had determined that limiting travel between the United States and Belarus was in Washington's foreign policy interest in light of the diversion of the Ryanair flight. It said the order would extend to "interline" travel in which tickets are purchased through one airline that contains flights operated by multiple airlines. The order - a step that has been under consideration by the US government for several weeks - is mostly symbolic since relatively few tickets are purchased for travel to Belarus from US-based travel services. It is open for public comment until July 1. After the May 23 forced landing of the Ryanair flight, which was en route from Athens to Vilnius, the U.S. government advised passenger airlines to use "extreme caution" when flying over Belarus. At the time, however, the United States stopped short of imposing any restrictions. The "Notice to Airmen" does not apply to cargo carriers such as United Parcel Service and FedEx Corp that fly over Belarus. United Airlines flies a route to India that sometimes is routed near Belarus, but no other US passenger carrier typically flies through the former Soviet republic's airspace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-moves-to-restrict-travel-from-the-united-states-to-belarus/articleshow/83972120.cms||---

IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said Nadeem, who was held from Parimpora on Monday, told interrogators he had been staying in a hideout at Malhoora but didn't utter a word about his aide. "He was guiding forces to that location when the terrorist hiding inside opened fire." A deputy commandant of the CRPF, a sub-inspector and a constable were injured in the initial firing before reinforcements were called to cordon off the hideout. "The injured personnel were evacuated even as the rest of the party took positions. Nadeem got hit during the gunfight. The Pakistani terrorist was neutralised soon after," Kumar said. The slain LeT commander from Budgam had been arrested while frisking highway traffic around 3km from the encounter site the previous day. "We had specific inputs that terrorists were planning an attack somewhere along the Srinagar-Baramulla road. One of the joint teams of J&K police and the CRPF stopped a vehicle and asked the occupants to identify themselves, at which a passenger in the back seat tried to open a bag containing a grenade," IGP Kumar said. "He was overpowered and we later found out he was Nadeem Abrar, a Lashkar commander." Besides the grenade, Nadeem was carrying a pistol. Two AK-47 rifles and some ammunition were found at the hideout after he and the Pakistani terrorist were killed. IGP Kumar said security forces were currently engaged in a cordon-and-search operation for the two Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists identified as the killers of SPO Fayaz Ahmed Bhat, his wife and 21-year-old daughter. The attack took place in their home at Hariparigam village of Awantipora in south Kashmir's Pulwama on Sunday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/arrested-lashkar-mans-trap-goes-wrong-killed/articleshow/83972321.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Sources said it indicates that the bombs, each weighing around 1.5-2kg, were possibly manufactured in a proper factory set-up, rather than being assembled by a bomb expert. A source said the 'sophisticated' metal encasing indicates that the bomb was possibly manufactured in an ordnance unit, pointing to clear involvement of a Pakistani state actor even though the investigating agencies are suspecting that it was Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT) that launched the drones. LeT has launched many attacks in India with the aid and active sponsorship of Pakistani state actors. Meanwhile, the home ministry on Tuesday handed over the case relating to Sunday's drone attack to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). NIA re-registered the FIR, initially lodged by the J&K Police, under Sections 13, 16, 18 and 23 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 and sections of the Explosive Substances Act and IPC. NIA, in a statement issued on Tuesday, said two explosions inside the premises of the Air Force Station, Satwari campus, Jammu within 6 minutes of each other, were carried out by drones "in a well-planned conspiracy" that led to injuries to two IAF personnel and damaged office buildings. NIA, along with the NSG national bomb data centre, have been part of the probe right after the attack. A detailed forensic report on the explosives used, is expected later in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-bombs-factory-made-were-not-crude-ones-experts/articleshow/83972381.cms||Bharti Jain

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari dismissed a batch of petition filed by landowners challenging the validity of the legislation on the ground that it was brought to revive a 2013 law which was declared unconstitutional by the Madras high court and to validate all acquisitions after 2013 which were quashed by the HC. The petitioners alleged that the legislative tool adopted by the state legislature to revive "unconstitutional enactments" was a direct attempt to overrule and nullify the high court's July 2019 verdict, which had quashed all pending acquisition proceedings under three enactments on or after September 27, 2013, and the same was impermissible in constitutional scheme as it violates the doctrine of separation of powers. The bench, however, said there was nothing wrong in applying a law from retrospective date. "It emanates from the basic principle that a legislature is deemed to be the main protagonist of public interest at large. For, the legislature is the bulwark of a democratic polity. It is also beyond debate that a legislature can validate an invalidated law by removing the cause for such invalidity through a legislative exercise," the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/legislature-can-bring-laws-with-retrospective-effect-sc/articleshow/83972431.cms||---
---||Business||Cos should invest in upskilling women to help avoid job redundancies||By Anuranjita KumarIndia has emerged as one of the most adversely impacted countries globally by the Covid pandemic during the second wave. While we are currently dealing with a humanitarian crisis of monumental proportions with cases and deaths running into tens of lakhs and several lakhs respectively, the pandemic has also exacerbated India’s jobs and economic crisis. About 10 million jobs were lost just in May this year, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Of those who lost their jobs, women professionals have been particularly affected. McKinsey estimates that female job loss rates have been about 1.8 times higher than for males globally. India already has one of the worst gender statistics in the developing world, and among the lowest female workforce participation rates in the world at 19% — putting us behind countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, China and Saudi Arabia. India also had lower levels of female workforce participation in sectors related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at 21%, that has steadily fallen over a decade from 32%. Additionally, there is a vast pay gap as well in the STEM sectors. According to the TimesJobs ‘Women in STEM careers’ survey, 52% of female IT employees said that they are paid 30% less salary as compared to their male colleagues for the same job role. Diversity & inclusion amid pandemic While several leading employers in India have worked hard in recent years towards building more diverse and inclusive workplaces, the pandemic has compounded the issue for business leaders: Not only do they have to work creatively to protect and sustain their operations, they are also working hard to preserve and protect the livelihoods by mitigating job losses. We believe businesses need to take specific actions towards building more diversity and inclusion to get out of the pandemic safely, and also build more resilience for the future. Specifically, they must evaluate hiring and working with semi-skilled women and skilling them with tech skills that are in demand. The IT sector is no stranger to skilling and training its freshly recruited workers. The focus now, however, must be on hiring and skilling women with a non-tech background but who have the right aptitude and interest in tech roles. Additionally, large employers willing to create meaningful social impact may take up skilling/reskilling of those women who have lost their families to Covid . Many of these women are otherwise well-educated and just need a break, and the confidence of an empathetic employer. They have the talent and the potential, but no track record to showcase. Apart from skilling and educational training, organisations can take steps like mentorship programmes for young professionals, which will aid them in charting their journey to leadership positions. Mentoring will help change women’s mindsets, where they are pushing for more inclusion with high personal aspirations and being hungry for a career. Innovate for impact The pandemic has also forced businesses to reorient their focus on innovation to drive growth amid a challenging external environment. Here, again, diversity and inclusion play an important role. A Forbes study of companies with more than $10 billion in annual revenues found that 56% of respondents ‘strongly agreed’ that diversity helps drive innovation. Many tech or tech-enabled companies and startups have already shown the way during the pandemic by embracing innovation — pivoting their business models, creating new revenue streams or identifying new market opportunities linked with the challenges brought upon by the pandemic. Now, they need workers with new skills to move forward. STEM professionals, on the other hand, are also well aware that upskilling is like taking an insurance for role redundancies or job losses. We therefore must encourage new innovations in learning and education from all relevant stakeholders — employers as well as academic institutions and dedicated online learning startups. Already, many universities are considering offering their most popular courses and programmes via online classrooms. Combining inclusion with innovation should therefore be an important element of post-pandemic growth strategy for all businesses. Together, they are also the key to generating true business and social impact — helping businesses sustain themselves as well as the livelihoods of their employees.

Currently, rules say that a majority of the members of these two important committees of the board should be independent directors. In its Tuesday’s board meeting, Sebi also said that an appointment of an independent director should be approved by shareholders within three months or through an AGM, whichever is earlier. The appointment should be through a special resolution, one that would need the nod of at least 75% of the shareholders. Sebi further said that if an independent director resigns from the board, the company should disclose to the exchanges the full content of the letter of resignation of that director. It said that all related-party transactions should be cleared only by the independent directors on the audit committee. According to Sebi, among other qualifications, an independent director is a person who is not a promoter or a relative of the promoter of the company, its holding, subsidiary or an associate company. The person should also be qualified to add some value to the company. The person, other than receiving director’s remuneration, should have no other pecuniary relationship with the company during the two immediately preceding financial years. Sebi also introduced a cooling off period of one year for an independent director becoming a whole-time director in the same company, holding, subsidiary, associate company or any group company. It also said that if key managerial personnel, their relative, or an employee of the promoter group companies wants to be an independent director, there should be a cooling off period of three years. A Sebi release noted that the board has agreed to make a reference to the corporate affairs ministry of the government for “giving greater flexibility to companies while deciding the remuneration for all directors (including independent directors), which may include profit-linked commissions, sitting fees, ESOPs, etc, within the overall prescribed limit specified under Companies Act, 2013”. These changes to the rules will be effective from January 1, 2022. Sebi has also tried to make the appointment of an independent director more transparent. It said that the NRC, while appointing an independent director, should make enhanced disclosures that should include the skills required for appointment as an independent director and specify how the proposed candidate fits into that skillset. According to Anand Lakra, partner at corporate law firm J Sagar Associates, by increasing voting threshold for appointment of independent directors from 51% to 75%, public shareholders would play an important part in companies with low promoter stake. However, “a more public shareholder-friendly approach would have been to introduce the requirement of seeking majority of public shareholder vote for appointment of independent directors which was articulated in the discussion paper”, Lakra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-tightens-norms-on-independent-directors/articleshow/83967458.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Don’t blame weatherman if it feels hotter than he says||NEW DELHI: You must have taken a peek at your phone screen to check the temperature outside, seen the app showing 38 degrees Celsius — with a small box next to it cautioning "Feels like 43 degrees”. Yes, it does seem less comfortable than 38 degrees. But what makes it feel like 43? The answer is the heat index, which factors in relative humidity and dew point, among other parameters, to tell you what the day’s weather actually feels like. For the woeful Delhiites, the data from this past week shows a difference of as much as 6 degrees between the actual temperature and the heat index, meaning you’d find the outside temperature closer to 48 degrees Celsius than 42. On Monday, while the ambient temperature at 2.30pm was 40 degrees, the "feels like" index determined it to be 46 degrees. On Tuesday at the same time, the thermometer showed 41.6 degrees and the heat index, 44. Higher the humidity, greater the difference between the two temperatures. Navdeep Dahiya, an amateur weatherman and founder of Live Weather of India, analyses the heat index each day, using a formula that incorporates the humidity level. He said the difference between the real and sensed temperatures normally increases at this time of the year due to high humidity. “The heat index looks at air temperature in terms of relative humidity,” Dahiya explained. “In layman's terms, it is the temperature felt by the human body in the shade. Generally sweating is common when humidity is high and this becomes an important feature of the Delhi-NCR weather towards the end of June and in the monsoon months up to August.” The dry heat, Dahiya pointed out, between April and mid-June, with less sweating feels more comfortable even if the Celsius reading is higher. “Heatwave conditions are recorded in that period, with the moisture content sometimes as low as 10%,” he said. In the past 24 hours, Delhi’s relative humidity oscillated between 25% and 78%, according to IMD data. In the past week, while the temperature at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, at 2.30pm on June 21 was 35.8 degrees, the humidity of 49% made it feel like 42 degrees. On June 23, the 40 degrees felt like 44 degrees due to the 31% humidity and on June 24, the 55% humidity made the ambient temperature of 36.8 degrees feel more like 48 degrees. Even on Tuesday, Delhiites suffered sweaty conditions. While the weather app on the phone showed a temperature of 41.6 degrees at 2.30 pm, the high humidity took it to the 44-degree sensory level. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said the meteorology department had long discontinued showing the heat index even though it was a good indicator of actual weather implications. “It indicates the level of discomfort and it is very important when there are particularly warm winds blowing or high humidity levels,” he noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-blame-weatherman-if-it-feels-hotter-than-he-says/articleshow/83966368.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

On Saturday night, Tamilselvan had visited Kanankulam in Ayyampalayam village panchayat based on a tip that an illegal slaughter house was functioning in the area and asked Velusamy, a meat stall owner, not to sell beef. Velusamy, however, replied there was no such direction from the state government. Tamilselvan told Velusamy that he had received a complaint about slaughtering cattle for meat. Velusamy told him that hundreds of shops were selling beef and they were ready to accompany the officer to identify the meat stalls selling the same. Some recorded the entire episode using mobile phone camera and circulated the video on social media. When the video went viral on Sunday, revenue and disaster management minister K K S S R Ramachandran tweeted that Tirupur district collector was directed to conduct an inquiry into the incident and further action would be initiated soon. Meanwhile, around 16 organisations led by the Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front staged a demonstration in front of Avinashi taluk office on Monday, demanding action against the tahsildar. Tirupur collector S Vineeth issued an order the same day, transferring Tamilselvan and posting him as special tahsildar (special security scheme) at Uthukuli taluk office in the existing vacancy. K P Raghavi, who was working as the special tahsildar (social security scheme) at Tirupur south taluk office, was posted as the new Avinashi tahsildar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tahsildar-who-asked-meat-stall-owner-not-to-sell-beef-transferred/articleshow/83968298.cms||---

The meeting held at the chief minister’s camp office in Tadepalli, studied the investment proposals received by the SIPB so far and cleared several, including a steel plant by the Jindal Group. The Jindal Group had come forward to invest Rs 7,500 crore to establish a steel plant in Nellore district. While clearing the proposal, the chief minister told officials to ensure that 75% of jobs in the unit are reserved for local people as per the state government’s policy. He also told them to ensure strict implementation of environmental safety measures. The SIPB had also cleared a proposal by Pitti Rail and Engineering Components Limited to establish its unit in Kopparthi Electronic Manufacture Cluster (EMC). The firm manufactures electrical, locomotive, energy and industrial infrastructure. It is also expected to provide 2,000 direct jobs, with an estimated investment of Rs 401 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-clears-investment-proposals-over-rs-11k-cr/articleshow/83964577.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: ACB arrests suspended mayor’s husband in Rs 20 crore bribery case||JAIPUR: Almost a fortnight after conducting a preliminary inquiry against suspended Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Greater mayor's husband Rajaram Gurjar and three others, the anti corruption bureau (ACB) arrested Rajaram and Omkar Sapre, an employee of the BVG company, on Tuesday. The ACB had started a probe against suspended mayor Somya Gurjar's husband and BVG India Ltd after a video of the former negotiating a commission of Rs 20 crore for releasing outstanding dues of nearly Rs 276 crore to the company by JMC surfaced. In the video, Rajaram is seen negotiating a deal with the company employee who is seen agreeing to pay Rs 20 crore as commission. Later, in an official statement, the company had refuted the allegations. The arrests came a day after the ACB received the FSL report confirming the authenticity of the video and audio, among other things. Earlier, on Monday, the Rajasthan High Court had upheld mayor Somya Gurjar's suspension. “We got the report from our FSL. We had also sent the video to a reputed FSL outside the state. They confirmed the authenticity on Monday. But to make sure that the accused does not get any hint of our action, we invited him for questioning on Tuesday morning and arrested him after interrogation,” said ACB director general BL Soni to TOI. The FSL report considered three main things. “First, we had to see if the whole video had been made in a single shot without any cuts or manipulation. Second, it was checked if the audio was not dubbed and is authentic. Third, it was to check if the whole video together is authentic. All these things were confirmed by the two FSL reports,” Soni said. “Rajaram had called to ask if there was any arrest. We told him it was for minor questioning only. After he was convinced, he arrived. After some paperwork and verifications, he was arrested,” said a senior ACB officer who is part of the investigation on condition of anonymity. Apart from Rajaram, the ACB also called Omkar Sapre, the employee of the BVG company, without telling him that the former had also been asked to come to their office. “He was also arrested,” Soni said. A case under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act has been lodged against them and two others, one Sandeep Chaudhary of the BVG company and one Nimbaram. ACB sources further said that a few IPS and IAS officers were also on the radar of the bureau.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-arrests-suspended-mayorshusband-in-rs-20cr-bribery-case/articleshow/83968268.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctor surrenders; 9th FIR likely in fake vax drive case||MUMBAI: Even as Dr Manish Tripathi, one of the key accused in the fraudulent vaccine drives case, surrendered before the Kandivali police station on Tuesday, investigators are set to lodge yet another FIR. The case pertains to people from four different companies in Kandivali East being given shots in late April without following civic guidelines. The Samta Nagar police are likely to lodge an FIR on Wednesday, making it the ninth FIR in the scam. One of the four companies offered their premises for the camp where 618 people were given shots on April 23, 24 and 28. But several days later, no certificates were generated. BMC officials said they were pressing charges as no MOU was submitted. An MOU has to be prepared between the organiser of the camp and the hospital providing the service. The organiser is also supposed to inform the BMC. "The Kandivali East camp seems similar to the other vaccination camps where vials were procured unauthorisedly. Only a police probe will reveal if the vials were refilled or genuine,” said Sanjay Kurhade, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, R/South Ward. Once investigators establish facts, this camp would become the largest fraudulent drive in the city due to the sheer number of people given shots. It will also become the third instance where the BMC has stepped forward to press charges. In two previous instances at Borivali where the BMC pressed charges, the management/ owner of the establishment where the camp was organised-- Aditya College and Mansi Stocks and Shares Advisory-- was also booked. Borivali police said they are in the process of recording statements of the management/ owner. Two travel agents that had convinced the stocks firm to hold a vaccination camp for their employees were taken into custody by the Borivali police on Tuesday. The duo, Shrikant Mane and Seema Ahuja, were out of work in the pandemic and had joined hands with the mastermind, Mahendra Singh. Mane and Ahuja were previously arrested by the Bhoiwada police as they had assisted in carrying out a similar fraudulent drive at Podar Education Centre, Parel. Meanwhile, Dr Tripathi who has been booked in eight FIRs so far, appeared before the senior inspector of the Kandivali police station just before noon on Tuesday, a day after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. Police have accused him of sourcing used vaccine vials or fake doses from Shivam Hospital where he ran a training and placement institute. Tripathi has been accused of refilling empty vaccine vials with saline water and ferrying them through one of his students, Karim Ali. Tripathi will be produced before a magistrate court for remand on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-doctor-surrenders-9th-fir-likely-in-fake-vax-drive-case/articleshow/83968304.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Toll tax hike of Rs 5 to Rs 25 at Kini & Tasawade plazas from tomorrow||KOLHAPUR: The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), a state government undertaking, has hiked the toll tax for the Kini toll booth in Kolhapur district and the Tasawade toll booth in Satara district. The revised rates will come into effect from July 1. The MSRDC officials claimed the toll tax rates are revised every year for an annual increase in the maintenance cost of the 133km road. VD Pandharkar, the project director of the national highways division, said, “The hike will range from Rs 5 to Rs 25 for different vehicles.” The new toll for cars and SUVs will be Rs 80 (up from Rs 75), while for light goods vehicles it has been increased from Rs 135 to Rs 145. Trucks and buses will have to pay Rs 290 instead of Rs 265. The national highway from Pune to Bengaluru was built by the central government, but the stretch from Satara to Kagal was completed by the MSRDC. Since 2005, it has been collecting toll to compensate for the expenses towards building and maintenance. In 2018, a private consultant was appointed to study the number of vehicles that cross these toll plazas and the amount collected. According to a study done for one month — from May to June in 2018 — the toll collection was around Rs 16 crore. Adoption of technology has improved transparency in toll tax collection, claimed the officials. However, motorists have always complained about the poor maintenance of the stretch and are upset with the hike. Vikram Shendge, a professional from Kolhapur who visits Pune regularly, said, “Earlier, I had to pay more for fuel, now I pay more for both toll and fuel. Every year, we suffer due to the poor condition of the national highway. I have stopped traveling frequently to Pune these days because of the increased cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/toll-tax-hike-of-rs-5-to-rs-25-at-kini-tasawade-plazas-from-tomorrow/articleshow/83963919.cms||---

The Patna hospital has thus become the third railway hospital to have HMIS facility. According to its medical director (MD) Dr R K Verma, the HMIS facility has been provided to hospital with the help of RailTel, an affiliate of the railways, to ensure quick service to patients under its improved health service scheme. “The purpose is to digitize patients’ data and medical history for ready reference in future as well as to improve hospital administration functioning. Under the HMIS system, the hospital will make patients’ medical history accessible through unique medical identity (UMID). The hospital will generate patients’ medical history through his/her personal registration process. The hospital has made this system functional for its outpatient department (OPD) patients,” Dr Verma said. According to RailTel chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Puneet Chawla, the HMIS will not only maintain transparency in the functioning of the railway hospitals, but also check unnecessary patients’ exposure during the Covid period. “The new system will certainly reduce footfall of patients in the hospitals as they can avail better medical facility through m-consultancy system,” he said . ECR GM L C Trivedi expressed the hope that railway patients would be the main beneficiaries of the new system as the entire gamut of the hospital administration is bound to go through a sea change in the administrative functioning . He said the Danapur railway hospital will also have HMIS facility within a fortnight. RailTel senior manager Sucharita Pradhan said they are working on at least 125 locations at different railway hospitals and 650 polyclinics across the country to implement HMIS system by the end of this year. “The HMIS facility is available in Northern Railway and South Central Railway only. The ECR is the third zonal railway to have this advanced facility,” she said. According to Dr Verma, a newly built state-of-the-art conference hall has been made functional at the hospital. This conference hall has 150 sitting capacity fitted with audio isual devices. “The conference hall will help the hospital hold medical conferences and other activities on a regular basis,” he said, adding it will be helpful for the superspecialty hospital to start DNB courses soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hmis-system-launched-at-railway-hospital-in-patna/articleshow/83960426.cms||Kumod Verma

The court has asked him to furnish the required documents and surety bonds and get the release order from Guntur district jail by July 31 to complete the required formalities. Raju was arrested by the CID on sedition charges in May. The district jail authorities informed the court that the MP did not furnish the personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and did not take the release orders. Though the apex court, in the bail order, told the MP to submit the bond, he is yet to do it. The court gave him time till June 28 to submit the bond and obtain the release order.

He stated that women’s safety would continue to be his government’s priority. The chief minister joined the campaign on Disha app, a mobile application developed by the AP police, on women safety. The application alerts the police when women in distress shake the smartphone with the app three times. He joined the campaign at Gollapudi on the outskirts of the city and interacted with women and the police through the Disha app. The chief minister asked the police to create awareness on the app among the people. He also told them to take up door-to-door campaigns if required only to ensure that the app is available on the mobiles of women and young girls. The chief minister explained that over 17 lakh people have already downloaded the app and it would reach one crore downloads shortly. He said the app has also received four national awards. The app also has an option called ‘Track My Travel’ for safety and guidance during travel. The chief minister said the safety and security of women shall not be compromised and said that 18 Disha police stations have been set up in the state and the Disha Act has been brought in. Further, the chief minister said that the government had bought 900 mobile patrolling teams which were also set up especially in sensitive areas. He said that a woman police officer has been appointed in the village and ward secretariats for the safety of women. During the event, volunteers demonstrated the use of the app in the presence of the chief minister and soon after pressing the SOS button, Bhavanipuram police responded and reached the location in minutes.

---||Business||When Davids strike Goliath-sized deals||MUMBAI: Traditionally, merger and acquisition (M&A) stories are about the big fish gobbling up the small ones. But, a reversal seems to be playing out in the M&A space as startups, who are yet to hit their ‘teens’, are snapping up established giants. Last week, the six-year-old PharmEasy announced that it was scooping up the 26-year-old Thyrocare. Earlier this month, the three-year-old BharatPe and its partner were selected by the RBI to take over the 37-year-old Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank. Investment bankers expect these combinations to continue as more such ‘small-buying-big’ deals will be announced in the coming months. So, what’s propelling these Davids to strike Goliath-sized acquisitions? “The young are ambitious and private capitals are supporting them,” said an industry watcher. SoftBank, Tiger Global, Sequoia, Prosus and others of their ilk from the private equity world have been pouring millions of dollars into these young companies, providing them enough ammunition to go for big-ticket purchases. PharmEasy, for instance, received over $900 million in external funding since it was established in 2015. It is buying 66% of Thyrocare from promoters for $600 million. It is also making a $240-million open offer to Thyrocare’s public shareholders for an additional 26%, but this spend will be to the extent of shares it receives via the open offer. “There are several factors at play, including the need for digital players to build physical infrastructure and presence, generational succession-related issues, access to funding from global investors and, in some cases, distress situations among some ‘old economy’ players,” said Citi India head (corporate & investment banking) Ravi Kapoor. The founding team’s age (many startups are established by young entrepreneurs), their daring & go-getter attitudes, agile decision-making and their body of knowledge are also significant factors aiding this trend. “The main difference is the speed with which some of the so-called new age companies can move, which is much faster than traditional M&As,” Kapoor said. The PharmEasy-Thyrocare deal was struck and signed in 29 days (less than a month). Kotak Mahindra Capital executive director Rajat Ranjan said, “Since startups have a disruptive DNA, they are targeting established incumbent companies to transform the industries they are in. It is their expansive vision — not looking at individual parts of an industry’s ecosystem but at its entirety — that is driving them to go for big bets.” Both Citi and Kotak are involved in a number of dialogues in the emerging M&A space, which is driven by technology-enabled startups. For the Gen Alpha companies, these large acquisitions are helping speed up scale, upgrade capabilities and providing access to experienced management. The head of a large foreign private equity fund said, while these young companies have the first-mover advantage in online, they are realising that they can’t be just that. They need to be ‘phygital’. “You will see more consolidations in the online-to-offline combination in medical, payments and retail,” he said. His fund has backed more than a dozen unicorns (valued at over $1 billion) in India and some of them are exploring large M&As. The India trend is mirroring what has played out in the US, where new age companies had bought legacy enterprises. Ranjan added that established companies too are willing to sell to the startups as they feel it is better to board the train that goes into the future. As for the Davids, the purchase of Goliaths catapults them into the big league in terms of physical infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/when-davids-strike-goliath-sized-deals/articleshow/83967577.cms||Reeba Zachariah

The capital’s peak power demand was clocked at 6,592 MW on Tuesday — the highest for the season till now. Apart from the hot and humid weather, the gradual unlocking process has resulted in Delhi’s peak power demand being clocked at 6,592 MW at 3.30pm on Tuesday, which is not only this season’s highest till now but also crossed the season’s previous peak of 6,540 MW, recorded on June 24. On June 10, Delhi’s peak power demand was recorded at 6,499 MW, eclipsing last year’s peak of 6,314 MW. With more offices and businesses reopening, coupled with the sultry weather and a missing monsoon, officials expect Delhi’s peak power demand to reach the range of 7,000 MW to 7,400 MW, even though the original estimates for this summer was around 7,900 MW. Because of the coronavirus-induced lockdown at this time last year, the city’s peak power demand was recorded much lower than the all-time high peak power demand of 7,409 MW on July 2, 2019. On June 7, Delhi’s peak power demand crossed 5,000 MW for the first time this season, clocking 5,559 MW at 11.19pm and from June 1, 2021, Delhi’s peak power demand has increased by over 40%, officials said. In fact this year, Delhi’s peak power demand has already crossed last year’s peak of 6,314 MW on four occasions — June 29, 28, 24 and 23. In the month of June 2020, Delhi’s peak power demand crossed the 6,000 MW-mark only by June 18 and a peak power demand of 6,314 MW was recorded on June 29. “Ensuring reliable supply in any season is as much the function of proper power arrangements as also of accurate demand forecasting and robust distribution network. BSES discoms are fully geared-up on all these aspects to meet the power demand,” said a BSES spokesperson. “We are closely watching the evolving coronavirus situation in the national capital and taking all appropriate measures to ensure reliable power supply to all consumers including essential services such as hospitals, labs, quarantine centres, vaccination centres etc., without compromising the safety of our employees,” the spokesperson said, adding that the company was in constant touch with all relevant stakeholders on the evolving situation in the capital. He said that accurate demand forecasting is critical for reliable power supply and it is done on various parameters that range from the day-ahead in 96 time-slots, intra-day basis and medium-term from a fortnight to one year. “Among other aspects, weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, cloud coverage, wind speed, wind direction and humidity play an important role in accurate demand forecast. Even holidays and random disturbances have an impact on the power demand,” the BSES official added. “To meet today’s power challenges and to get a grip on so many varied and dynamic variables, BSES uses a mix of advanced statistical forecasting models, combined with state-of-the-art weather forecasting solutions, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/peak-power-demand-at-6592-mw-as-delhi-unlocks-gets-no-rain-breather/articleshow/83966401.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Vijayawada||Renewable energy companies urge Andhra Pradesh high court to expedite hearing||VIJAYAWADA: Renewable energy companies, solar and wind, with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the state government, have urged the Andhra Pradesh high court to expedite the hearing on the batch of petitions filed challenging the single judge order. The companies told the high court that they have been facing financial troubles and are on the verge of bankruptcy. The litigation arose out of the state government’s decision to review the power tariffs and a subsequent GO issued in 2019, forming a committee to renegotiate prices with the companies. The state government had proposed paying Rs 2.44 per unit instead of Rs 4.8 for solar power. The renewable energy companies challenged the GO before the high court arguing that the state government could not form a committee to review power tariffs. They also argued that tariffs were derived through competent bidding process and the government should honour the agreements. The single judge of the high court had set aside the GO and directed the state government to pay Rs 2.44 as proposed, pending disposal of the petitions. The high court also directed the companies and the state government to approach Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) to derive fresh tariffs. Aggrieved by the single judge order, power companies filed appeal petitions. They argued that the judgement by the single judge is self-contradictory as it set aside the GO but directed paying reduced tariff as decided the by the state government in the same GO. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya posted the matter for final hearing from August 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/renewable-energy-cos-urge-hc-to-expedite-hearing/articleshow/83964521.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The instructions were given at a meeting of the Airfield Environmental Management Committee (AEMC) chaired by Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Kumar Agarwal. Other issues, including the ongoing development works at the airport were also discussed in the meeting. Airport director Bhupesh CH Negi made a presentation on the security and extension works at the airport. Information was also shared with regard to the status of garbage removal, pruning of trees and flocking of birds in the vicinity of the airport. Agarwal asked the officials concerned to ensure round-the-clock functioning of CCTV cameras and instructed the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) to ensure timely removal of garbage in and around the airport. Municipal commissioner and PMC’s executive officer of Phulwarisharif were asked to prepare a work plan and carry out the garbage removal works by assigning roster duty to their sanitation staff. Fresh instructions were issued for removal of chicken and mutton shops from the airport area. The SDO and DSP of the area should make joint spot inspection and remove the meat shops at any cost. The meat and chicken shops attract birds looking for food, which in turn, can lead to bird strike incidents. Instructions were also issued to PMC to look into the stray dog menace near the airport. The divisional forest officer of Patna was asked to coordinate with Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park (Patna zoo) director for pruning of trees. The trees on the south- eastern corner of the zoo and adjoining areas are required to be pruned on regular intervals to avoid obstacles in the aircraft approach funnel at the time of landing and take-off. Officials concerned were also asked to remove encroachments near the entry-exit and the boundary walls of the airport. With regard to Covid prevention steps, the divisional commissioner asked the airport officials to ensure that passengers dump their PPE kits in the biowaste bins at the terminal building as well as in the parking lots. Thermal screening and Covid testing of passengers will continue to avoid spread of the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mutton-shops-garbage-to-be-removed-from-airport-area-in-patna/articleshow/83961833.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Garba singer gets his name patented||VADODARA: The razzmatazz of Navratri reached bedazzling heights with the melody of garba, and if it was a rendition by prominent garba singer Atul Purohit, it was sheer magic. Purohit, who takes garba frenzy to feverish heights every year is not only a much sought-after artist in the state, but his melodious voice has even earned him accolades across the world. In order to protect his art, the 64-year-old singer has now registered himself under trademark and copyright laws. With the patenting, Purohit has now officially become a brand in himself! “Since years, people have been using my name and songs in their videos, YouTube channels, mobile applications and also in events, albeit without my permission. This will cause issues for me in the future and so, I decided to get my name officially registered in the trademark registry,” Purohit told TOI. “I don’t mind people using my name or garba songs but it has to be done with due permission. My name and photographs are protected under the copyright law now,” said Purohit, who has been associated with United Way of Garba, one of the most popular garba venues in the city, for nearly three decades now. Interjecting terms like ‘chalo beta’ in the middle of his garba songs, Purohit got his aficionados hooked to the beat that kept revellers across seven seas in the US, the UK, and even Australia and many other countries in their dancing best during Navratri. As his popularity soared, people started randomly using his name, photographs and songs in their websites, online channels, live performances and even in films too. “Now, no one can use his name for commercial purposes without his permission. He has sole right over the name Atul Purohit,” said advocate Yash Suryawala, an expert in intellectual property rights (IPR) laws who got Purohit’s name registered. While companies and organisations usually get trademark registrations, Purohit is the first confirmed artist in the state to have his name registered under trademark and copyright laws. The artist has also got three of his photographs registered. They can now be used only with his permission. Suryawala said that the process to get his name registered in Trade Mark registry started in July last year and they got the certificate of registration of trade mark this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/garba-singer-gets-his-name-patented/articleshow/83964715.cms||Tushar Tere

This will be RIL’s first investment in a greenfield petchem project abroad. In 2012, it had bought BP’s petchem plant in Malaysia for $230 million. The petchem plant in Abu Dhabi’s Al Ruwais city will produce chlor-alkali, ethylene dichloride and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Chlor-alkali is used in water treatment and in the manufacture of textiles and metals. Ethylene dichloride is used to produce PVC, which has a wide range of applications across housing, infrastructure and consumer goods. Commenting on the Abu Dhabi petchem project, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said, “This is a significant step in globalising Reliance’s operations, and we are proud to partner with ADNOC in this important project for the region.” RIL and Abu Dhabi have a long relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from the emirate for many years. Abu Dhabi had also recently invested in RIL’s retail and telecom (Jio) businesses. In 2019, the two had signed a framework to explore joint investments in petchem. RIL’s investment in the Abu Dhabi petchem plant will be finalised when EPC contracts are awarded next year. The petchem plant has been initiated based on the demand potential for these products. “The market for chemicals is expected to enjoy steady growth supported by the needs of growing demand, particularly in Asia and Africa,” RIL said. This will be RIL’s first major investment in the Middle East, according to ADNOC. The Abu Dhabi plant will have a capacity to produce 9.4 lakh tons of chlor-alkali annually, 1.1 million tons of ethylene dichloride and 3.6 lakh tons of PVC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-ties-up-with-adnoc-for-petchem-plant-in-uae/articleshow/83967503.cms||---

The bank already has 15% of its customer-facing applications on AWS after a decision last year to have all new apps on the cloud. The shift is a part of its decision to accelerate a digital transformation programme that involves bringing advanced customer experiences, including online accounts that can be opened in under six minutes and instant digital payments. The bank said that it has deployed over 25 mission-critical applications on AWS, including a ‘buy now, pay later’ product and a new loan management system to support it. Axis Bank will migrate 70% of its on-premises data centre infrastructure in the next 24 months to further reduce cost, improve agility and customer experience. The bank has dedicated over 800 people to its digital projects, built an in-house engineering and design team of more than 130 people, and established a cloud engineering practice said Subrat Mohanty, group executive at Axis Bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-bank-to-move-e-services-to-aws/articleshow/83967761.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Realty, infra investment trusts can use bond market route to raise funds||Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday allowed real estate investment trusts (REITs), infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) and other specifically created entities in the real estate and infrastructure space with less than a three-year track record to tap the bond market. However, it said such issues should be through the exchange’s bond-trading platform and only institutional investors will be allowed to participate in it. But unlisted entities cannot tap this fund-raising route. “This will enable special purpose vehicles created for specific infrastructure purposes/NBFCs/listed REITs/listed InvITs and other companies who propose to list debt securities purely on private placement basis but who do not have a three-year existence history, to list their debt securities issued on private placement basis.” The Sebi board further amended its REIT and InvIT rules to lower the minimum trading lot for listed issues to Rs 10,000-15,000. It also revised the trading lot to one unit. Currently, for InvITs, the minimum investment size is Rs 1 lakh while for REITs it is Rs 50,000 and a trading lot should have 100 units. The changes could allow several government-owned entities to take the InvIT routes to raise funds in an easier way, industry experts said. These changes would also help existing and upcoming REITs. Sebi in its board meeting on Tuesday allowed asset management companies to invest up to Rs 50 lakh in any new fund offer, bringing in the concept of ‘skin in the game’ for fund houses. At present, employees of fund houses including fund managers and analysts were allowed to invest in funds they managed. The regulator also allowed resident Indian fund managers to be associated with foreign portfolio investors. This is not allowed currently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/realty-infra-investment-trusts-can-use-bond-market-route-to-raise-funds/articleshow/83967609.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Three from Islamic nations enrol in Sanskrit university in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: The ancient Indian philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam described in Sanskrit scriptures which regards the world as one family seems to be unfolding at a university in Gujarat. After finding takers from Gujarat and other Indian states, Shree Somnath Sanskrit University in Veraval is now finding takers from overseas. In fact, this year, the university, established in 2005 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has received three unique applications from foreign students from Bangladesh, Iran and Afghanistan. The Sanskrit phrase has been an underlying theme in many of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s foreign policy speeches. Lalit Patel, the departmental head for post graduate programmes, said that this was for the first time that foreign students have enrolled for Sanskrit courses offered by the university. “It is a moment of pride for us,” he said. Farshad Salehzehi from Iran has taken admission in BA in Sanskrit language and literature while Rathindro Sarkar of Bangladesh has enrolled for a doctorate programme in Sanskrit from the university. Masoor Sangeem from Afghanistan is the third student who has been given admission by the varsity. “In all there were nine foreign students who had applied but we had to turn down the other applications as we did not offer the courses they were seeking,” said Dashrath Jadav, registrar of the varsity. This university functions under Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). “The decision about their visa process and how and when they can start their classes will be as per the central government’s decision,” he added. The ancient language, which has influenced the many spoken languages like Gujarati, Assamese, Oriya, Bengal, Hindi, Nepali, Punjabi, Kashmiri and Marathi, among others, is the mother tongue of less than 25,000 people according to the 2011 census of Indian languages. The Sanskrit University has also come up with an option of online courses to reach out to enthusiasts within the country and across the globe, wanting to learn the ancient language. Reviving the ancient language, which is so closely linked to Hinduism and Hindu religious texts, has always been an important project for the BJP led government. Recently, in line with Prime Minister Modi’s vision to promote Sanskrit language, all signboards, names of trees and animals at the zoological park near the Statue of Unity (SoU) at Kevadia bear their Sanskrit identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-from-islamic-nations-enrol-in-sanskrit-univ/articleshow/83966692.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy will lay the foundation stone for the project on Wednesday. Amaravati Metro Regional Development Authority (AMRDA) will develop the four-lane road on the riverbank at a cost of Rs 150 crore. This is the first major infrastructure project in the Amaravati region being taken up by the government after Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy took over the reins of the state. The government had put all ongoing and proposed works in the Amaravati region on the backburner two years ago. It stalled even the structures that were nearing completion with the view of relooking the needs of the region. The state government had also carried out a thorough probe into the costs that were allegedly escalated during the TDP regime. Subsequently, the state government decided to develop three capital cities—one each at Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool—with a view to bring about equitable development in all three regions. The government also cleared a bill to facilitate trifurcation of the capital city. With the issue landing in the Andhra Pradesh high court, the government could not move ahead with any of the proposed works. After several meetings and discussions at the highest level, the chief minister gave his green signal for the development of a few infrastructure works in Amaravati. Along with the widening of River Bank Road, a six-lane seed access road would also be completed shortly. Similarly, the government had granted its nod for completion of officers’ quarters where nearly 80-90% of the work is over. The government allowed AMRDA to borrow about Rs 3,000 crore from the banks to take up pending works in Amaravati. Although local farmers have been agitating to retain Amaravati as the sole capital city of the state, the government is keen on moving the power centre, secretariat, to the proposed executive capital city Visakhapatnam soon after getting the nod from the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/infra-projects-in-amaravati-get-green-signal/articleshow/83964413.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Bihar: Trouble mounts for rape accused DSP||PATNA: Trouble for rape accused senior DSP Kamlakant Prasad is expected to rise as CID, while investigating a case against him for allegedly raping a minor girl, has found more of his “wrongdoings” while he was posted in Gopalganj district as SDPO seven years back. The state government had suspended Prasad on June 15 after he was booked in an FIR registered with Women’s police station in Gaya on May 27 for allegedly raping a minor girl at his official quarter during Dussehra in 2017. A team of CID (weaker section) reached Gopalganj on Tuesday on the direction of ADG Anil Kishore Yadav to probe charges against Prasad that he had falsely implicated two youths – Ashutosh Dwivedi and Naem Akhtar – in a criminal case under SC/ST Act soon. The two had reportedly raised voice against the DSP. CID sources have also traced one Surendra Gaur, who alleged that he had lodged an FIR against Dwivedi and Naem Akhtar with Kataiyya police station in 2015 only after being coerced and threatened by the DSP. “A woman, whose child was kidnapped, had alleged that the DSP molested her after calling her at his official quarter in the name of investigating the kidnapping case. He was in Gopalganj as SDPO then,” a senior CID officer said preferring anonymity. He said in Gaya too, Prasad was charged with raping a minor girl at his official quarter and an FIR was registered against him after thorough internal inquiry on the basis of the complaint of his wife Anant Tanuja. Another senior CID officer said in Gopalganj, Prasad had supervised the case against the duo and issued orders to arrest them. “However, Prasad was transferred and another DSP found the allegations to be false,” he said. Sources said if CID finds strong evidence in the Gopalganj incident, it might take necessary action and get a fresh FIR registered against Prasad. Meanwhile, it is learned that the Gaya rape survivor has filed a petition before special POCSO court, alleging she was coerced by DSP’s wife to allege that he had raped her in 2017. Gaya special public prosecutor (POCSO Act) Sayed Qaiser Sharfuddin said it was due to this petition that the court ordered no-coercive action against Prasad in the case after he filed anticipatory bail petition. “The girl had submitted the petition a few days back only after her statement before the judicial magistrate in which she had supported all the allegations levelled in the FIR,” he said. Sharfuddin said the court would hear DSP’s bail plea on July 5.

Sources said the NIA submitted the FIR before its exclusive court in Patna on Monday. Besides, sources said NIA sleuths from Delhi also flew to Hyderabad in Telangana for a full-fledged investigation in the case. Four suspects, including Imran and Nazeer, have been detained and interrogated by Hyderabad police in this connection. The explosion took place on June 17 when the parcel booked in Secunderabad was dumped on the platform number 1 of Darbhanga railway station, causing a loud bang and minor fire. It was a small glass bottle containing a complex inflammable liquid, wrapped with adhesive tape and kept in the parcel of clothes, which caused the explosion. The consignment was booked in the name of one Mohammad Sufiyan, who was also named as the recipient. Meanwhile, sources said the NIA and intelligence agencies are also probing the case from a different angle, that if any terror group had any plans to target the newly opened Darbhanga airport with the liquid explosive after improvising it. They are gathering information about any such incident of using liquid explosives to trigger a blast in any passenger aircraft. “Suspicion is high that it was destined to be picked up by someone. No untoward incident happened in the train while the parcel was in transit. Explosion probably took place due to mishandling,” a source said. Sources said the NIA court has called for all the records related to the case from the Samastipur railway court under whose jurisdiction the Darbhanga GRP falls and had lodged an FIR after the blast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nia-probes-darbhanga-parcel-blast-case-from-different-angles/articleshow/83961876.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The idea of this study was to see how to improve the road design to bring down both the accident numbers as well as the human toll. Among the worst of these black spots was Delhi Gate.Delhi Gate forms an important connection between Old Delhi and New Delhi, while also connecting the New Delhi Railway Station with the Ring Road. It is surrounded by arterial and sub-arterial roads, including Asaf Ali Road, Jawahar Lal Nehru Marg, Netaji Subash Marg and Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg. Due to the presence of numerous commercial areas, hospitals, educational institutions and sports arenas around Delhi Gate, the traffic volume is extremely high. Pedestrian numbers too are very high.These are conditions that made Delhi Gate one of the city’s worst 10 traffic black spots in 2017. Between 2017 and 2019, 42 road accidents were reported here, apart from eight fatalities. The WRI India trial on this intersection established that it has a huge conflict area of around 4,700 sq metres, and according to officials, the bigger the conflict area, the higher the risk of road crashes. A bigger area also increases the clearance time for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists to cross the intersection.A traffic official said that the study had helped them identify the trouble points at Delhi Gate, which they will now look at to ensure that the number of accidents at such sites are reduced and traffic is managed in a better way.The trial discovered that pedestrian crossings were missing at a few crucial locations or were placed wrongly, putting pedestrians at risk. Such crossings were only available on Asaf Ali Road and Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg. Elsewhere, there was no walking room for the pedestrians.According to the WRI India report, the proposed plan for redesign of the roads says there should be a consistent four-lane carriageway on all arms to channelise traffic movement. Apart from this, it recommended a bold 5-metre-wide continuous pedestrian crossing for the safety of foot traffic and cyclists. There should also be a tabletop crossing for pedestrians on slip lanes from them to connect with and safely access footpaths. The report also suggested a defined entrance and exit to the slip lanes, with lane segregation through extended islands and road markings to reduce left lane blocking by the straight going traffic.The advantages of the new design, officials claimed, were that it would make Delhi Gate safer and facilitate efficient traffic movement, while also making the crossing a safer space for pedestrian movement. A traffic officer said that the changes would also discourage non-permitted traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-traffic-cops-plan-to-strike-delhi-gate-off-black-spot-list/articleshow/83966446.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Mumbai||DCGI gives emergency use nod to Moderna’s vaccine||Indian pharma major Cipla will “facilitate” the import of Covid vaccines donated by US biotech major Moderna, possibly in the near future, under licence for restricted use by India’s drug regulator DCGI. In parallel, Cipla is also pursuing a separate tie-up with the US firm to undertake large-scale fill-and-finish, distribution and commercialisation of Moderna’s messenger or mRNA vaccines. Moderna’s vaccine becomes the fourth to get emergency authorisation in the country after Serum Institute’s Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Russia’s Sputnik-V. Niti Aayog member (health) V K Paul said on Tuesday that the regulatory clearance potentially opens up a clear possibility of the vaccine being imported to India in the near future. He said efforts to have other globally developed vaccines also continue. “An application received from Moderna through their Indian partner Cipla has been granted new drug permission for restricted use which is commonly known as emergency use authorisation,” Paul said. “Our efforts to invite and to have other internationally developed vaccines, specifically Pfizer and J&J, also continue. Those processes are on,” Paul added. Elaborating on the development, Cipla’s global CEO Umang Vohra told TOI, “This is not a commercial or supply deal, and we do not distribute this consignment either.” The company does not have "a definitive agreement on commercial supplies" , it said in a late filing with the BSE. It is supporting Moderna Inc with the regulatory approval and importation of vaccines to be donated to India. It is understood that the imported jabs are part of the donation which the US government promised earlier. In May, the Biden administration announced the donation of coronavirus vaccines through the COVAX scheme for distribution in low-income and developing countries, including India. The US is expected to send a total of 20 million doses of Moderna. Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are expected to be given by month-end to these countries besides over 60 million AstraZeneca vaccines. There will be no need to conduct bridging studies on local subjects prior to import as per the Centre’s tweaked policy in April to fast-track foreign-made vaccines. The company will have to submit safety assessment data of the first 100 beneficiaries before mass rollout, sources said. The exact quantity of the Moderna doses being donated was not available, but sources added that the doses will be available in the country soon. Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said, "I want to thank the government of India for this authorisation, which marks an important step forward in the global fight against the pandemic. We are committed to making our Covid-19 vaccine available around the world."

---||Jaipur||Jaipur Development Authority to revise parameters of heritage city on Agra Road||JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) is planning to revise the parameters for developing the proposed heritage city on Agra Road after seeking objections from the stakeholders. Re-planning was done to reduce the commercial area to 10% which was earlier up to 50% of the heritage city. The proposed city is to be developed on the lines of the Walled City. Also, the JDA will allow mixed land use along 18-metre wide roads, instead of 12-metre wide one. Similarly, 10% area will be earmarked for the institutional area. An official said, “The width of the interior roads will remain 12 metres and control façade guidelines will also not be changed.” Sources said, the committee constituted for public hearing also recommended the proposal. In such a circumstance, the JDA will have to amend the planning of the heritage city. “The final decision will be taken by UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal. However, in the coming years, multi-functional zone is a better option and the JDA should not make amendments in the layout,” said a source. As per initial plan, in the proposed heritage city, 50% of minimum area has been reserved for major economic activities. Similarly, maximum 47% of area was to be fixed for residential. “A list of 161 commercial activities was proposed in scheme. The size of the scheme is 10 square-kilometre. The JDA will only monitor the parameters fixed for the scheme, while construction will be done by the individual plot owners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-to-revise-parameters-of-heritage-city-on-agra-road/articleshow/83968327.cms||---

In the first case, Division 3 police arrested a band of three snatchers. As many as 17 cellphones and nine stolen two-wheelers were recovered from them. The police claimed to have solved at least 35 cases of snatching and vehicle theft with the arrest of Gagan Kumar of Dhandra Road, Rohit Kumar of Mohar Singh Nagar and Ashu Kumar of New Basant Vihar. Joint commissioner of police (city) Deepak Pareek said, “They were arrested from Kirpal Nagar puli of Division 3 area on a tip-off. All three are drug addicts and started executing crimes to meet their drug needs.” About their modus operandi, he said, “The accused would first steal motorcycles and scooters and then use these to commit snatchings. They stole vehicles with duplicate keys. They have sold some stolen vehicles to scrap dealers after dismantling them.” ADCP-1 Pragya Jain said, “Factory workers were their main targets. The gang would snatch their cellphones when factory workers were on the way home after work. They would sell the snatched cellphones at cheap prices and buy drugs with the money.” Gagan has a snatching case against him at Model Town police station. The criminal records of Ashu and Rohit were being checked, she added. In another case, Division 8 police arrested Surjit Singh of Civil City and Deepanshu of New Kundanpuri with 15 snatched cellphones and a stolen bike. On June 26, the accused had snatched a purse from Mukta Goyal, a resident of Deep Nagar, near Rajpura Chowk. Her purse contained Rs 8,500, a cellphone and documents. Division 8 police station SHO sub-inspector Rajinderpal Singh said, “The accused are drug addicts. They started committing the crime four to five months ago to make easy money. They were more active in Clock Tower, Civil Lines and Kailash Chowk. Surjit has a criminal record as he has cases of snatching and theft against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/2-gangs-of-snatchers-busted-5-arrested/articleshow/83964001.cms||---

A case under section 171 (B , C, E and F) of IPC and Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act was registered against the SP MLC regarding the incident. Meja police intercepted the SUV of SP MLC for checking at around 2: 30 am when he along with his friend Sanjay Yadav and driver Arun Yadav was heading towards the city. The SP leader and his aides could not answer the queries of the police about the source of the money. Later, the police consulted officials of the income tax department for further course of action. The SP MLC was taken to the Meja police station for quizzing. The SP MLC was taken to the Meja police station for quizzing. Superintendent of police (Trans-Yamuna) Saurabh Dixit said, “In view of the forthcoming zila panchayat president polls, police have intensified checking against illicit cash movement in trans-Yamuna area. A team of Meja police checked a SUV belonging to SP MLC Dr Maan Singh Yadav and seized Rs 40 lakh from the vehicle.” The SP added, “Neither the SP MLC nor his friends could reveal the motive of carrying the cash or its source.” Dixit also said that police were not ruling out that the amount seized from the possession of the SP leader could be used for undue purpose before the zila panchayat president elections. Meanwhile, SP leaders alleged that the party MLC had become the victim of police harassment at the behest of the state government. SP district spokesman Daan Bahadur ‘Madhur’ said, “The SP MLC was forced to stay at the police station throughout the night and allowed to leave at around 9:15 am when scores of party leaders and workers rushed to the police station to mark their protest against the incident.” He claimed that the police had stopped the vehicle of the SP MLC on the pretext of checking near Tikuri Dhaba, Mirzapur road at a time when the MLC was travelling with his Handia-based friend Sanjay Yadav. Madhur claimed that the police were told that Sanjay was a businessman and he along with the MLC was going for some work. Sanjay had kept the money in a bag for business purposes. SP leaders also accused Meja police of violating the protocol. They took the MLC to the police station for questioning but forced him to stay there in the night though he had given his explanation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/rs-40l-seized-from-sp-mlcs-suv-fir-registered/articleshow/83968362.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Land registration rates set to go up in Telangana from August 1||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is all set to revise land rates for property registrations soon. The cabinet sub-committee on resource mobilisation headed by finance minister T Harish Rao said it would recommend to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to enhance land registration values. If everything goes as per the plan, the new values would come into effect from August 1. The state government collects 6% registration fee and stamp duty for registering both agriculture and non-agriculture land and other constructions such as flats from prospective buyers. The sub-committee, which met on Tuesday and attended by ministers KT Rama Rao and Vemula Prashanth Reddy and chief secretary Somesh Kumar, said the land values for property registrations were last revised in 2013. Though the land market rates have increased exponentially in the past few years and there was a provision in the Act to revise the rate every two to three years, the registration values have not been revised after formation of Telangana. The government has been mulling enhancement of registration land rates for the past one year. Last year, it could not go ahead due to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown. The CM had constituted the committee on resource mobilisation mainly to get more revenue as the state had lost more than Rs 50,000 crore in the past year. “The AP government had revised land registration rates seven times in the past eight years and increased registration charges to 7.5 per cent. Tamil Nadu collects 7.5% and Maharashtra 7%,” officials said. Official sources said the registration department has submitted district-wise revised rates proposals to the government and is waiting for the government’s clearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-registration-rates-set-to-go-up-from-august-1/articleshow/83968319.cms||Koride Mahesh

With this, the number of burglaries reported in Vadavalli has gone up to five in the past seven days in a major concern for police officials. In one of the incidents, unidentified person(s) broke into the house of 44-year-old Nelson at Arunachalam Nagar and made away with Rs 70,000, laptop and digital video recorder of CCTV camera. A police officer said Nelson, an engineer with a private firm, had gone to Coonoor after locking his house on June 9 to perform his father-in-law’s last rights. “On Sunday, his neighbour Wilson informed him that the front door of the house was found to be open. Nelson returned on Monday morning to find valuables missing from the house.” Nelson lodged a complaint with the Vadavalli police, who visited the crime scene and lifted fingerprints. Police have registered a case and further investigations are on. In the second incident, unidentified person(s) broke into the house of 45-year-old Manikandan at Navavoor Pirivu and decamped with Rs 7,000 and 3kg silver. The police officer said Manikandan, headmaster of a private school, was away at his farmhouse at Pollachi for the past two months because of the pandemic situation. “He returned home on Monday to find his front door broken open and cash and silver missing. He has lodged a complaint with us and we have registered a case and launched a probe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/rise-in-house-break-ins-at-vadavalli-worries-cops/articleshow/83968332.cms||---

He said that the HC wrongly passed adverse observations against them for filing a “motivated” petition.Terming it as a “vital and essential project of national importance”, Delhi High Court on May 31 dismissed a plea against the Central Vista project. The court also imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on petitioner for filling the frivolous and motivated petition to stay the ongoing construction work. Challenging HC’s order, the petitioners in their appeal said, “The judgement, especially the imposition of exorbitant costs, has a chilling effect on public spirited individuals raising genuine issues of public health and on the right of citizens to question the actions of the government and to hold it to account, which it is submitted is the bedrock of democracy. The PIL has been erroneously dismissed by solely relying upon the submissions of the respondents at face value, without any inquiry on the alleged compliance with DDMA orders by providing on site accommodation for workers/labourers or following Covid -19 protocols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-vista-sc-refuses-to-interfere-with-hc-order-on-motivated-pil/articleshow/83966454.cms||---

On Tuesday, the HC directed the district panchayat officer and the officials of the panchayat to seal the illegal structure forthwith. Videograph the sealing process and furnish us a report along with the video clips, said a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. The bench was hearing a writ appeal filed by V Gopal Rao from Kothagudem seeking permission to raise a four-storied building in his 1,200 square yards land. The panchayat had earlier failed to get any reply from him on the status of the title of the land and also refused to grant him permission to raise a structure there. When he was raising the structure there, the panchayat issued a demolition notice. Gopal Rao earlier challenged the same before a single judge who found that he was acting in a high-handed manner and even ordered the district collector, SP, and the DPO to inquire into the status of his structure. They furnished their reports indicting Gopal Rao. The single judge also recorded a finding that Rao misbehaved with advocates too who were arguing against him. DPO in his report said that Rao is a politically connected man and they are unable to prevent him from raising the structure. The bench ordered sealing of the building and posted the case to Aug 23 for hearing the case along with a related PIL on the same subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-orders-illegal-bldg-to-be-sealed/articleshow/83968355.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man goes home after 2 months, total 20,000 treated at Lok Nayak Hospital so far||NEW DELHI: When Deepak Gupta was admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital two months ago, he could barely breath even with oxygen support. The doctors put him on a bi-pap machine first, and later on ventilator support. His chances of survival looked slim. However, in a rare success that could bring hope to many patients battling severe Covid-19, the 46-year-old recovered and was discharged from the hospital on Monday, 58 days after hospitalisation. “We have treated more than 20,000 Covid-19 patients since the pandemic began. Gupta was admitted for the longest period and had multiple complications. Despite that, we managed to save his life,” Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, told TOI. Lok Nayak Hospital was designated a Covid-only facility during the first and second wave of the pandemic. Dr Kumar said 4,388 patients were treated at the hospital during the second wave, which peaked in April-May. “While 54% patients were in the 14-50 age group, 26% were between 50 and 60 years old, 16% patients were aged above 60 years and the rest (4%) were children less than 14 years old,” he added. The oldest patient to get treated was a 102-year-old and the youngest a day-old child. Kumar said the need for oxygen support was very high among hospitalised patients during the second wave compared with the first. “Nearly 85% of the patients had very poor oxygen saturation at the time of admission. More than 40% had diabetes, hypertension, heart disease or kidney disease. An analysis of data also revealed that nearly 69% of the patients had taken steroids for up to a week before they were hospitalised. The mortality rate was higher in the second wave compared with the first one,” said the director. According to the hospital, which has 2,000 dedicated beds for Covid-19 patients, the first patient was admitted on March 17. “Initially, we didn’t know much about treating the disease. There was a lot of scare among healthcare workers. But as the pandemic progressed, we learnt a lot about disease management. However, a sudden surge in cases in April-May overwhelmed the infrastructure and it became really difficult to manage it. Many doctors and nurses tested positive themselves and some of them lost their family members due to Covid-19. However, they continued to save lives,” said a senior doctor. At present, there are only 160 patients admitted in the hospital. “We are readying our infrastructure to deal with a potential third wave and also taking time to heal from the psychological impact of devastation witnessed during the second wave,” said a resident doctor at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-goes-home-after-2-months-total-20k-treated-at-lnjp-so-far/articleshow/83968417.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Is it the end of the political career of Gurjar couple?||JAIPUR: Arrest of Raja Ram Gurjar has added another controversy to his chequered career. Both Somya Gurjar and Raja Ram Gurjar have courted controversies throughout their careers and were removed from posts unceremoniously a couple of times. However, this time the bribery case against them may end their political careers. In December 2019, Raja Ram who was the chairperson of Karauli municipality, was suspended for slapping a sanitation inspector. Later, he was reinstated, but that case was reopened by the current government. Now, a video of him allegedly asking for money in exchange of clearing the money of garbage collecting firm has put him in the limelight again. Similarly, Somya was earlier a member of the women commission, but was removed for taking selfie with a rape survivor. Now, since her appointment as a mayor of JMC, Greater, she has been constantly in tussle with the ruling party. Now, she is suspended for allegedly involved in manhandling the commissioner and a bribery case is pending against her husband. Sources in the party said that it will be difficult for both husband and wife to make a comeback. “The bribery case is the last nail in the coffin. Since, the start of their appointment in the corporation, there has been tussle with the commissioner, ruling party and local BJP MLAs. So, things have now become too difficult for both of them to come back even if they get saved in this case due to the maligning of their imaging,” said a source in JMC. It is said that Somya became mayor with the help of a big RSS leader. This time RSS even didn’t consult with the local MLA regarding the appointment of the mayor. That made almost all the BJP MLAs in the city angry and when mayor was suspended, none of them came in support of her. “It has to be seen that if Somya and her husband cleared their names from the bribery matter, will BJP or RSS stand by them again. Will they give them a chance to run for any post in the state. On party level there are lot of discussions going on and due to the video, that was made viral, it has now become evident that party is not happy with their image and even if they make a comeback, they will have to fight a long battle to get any recognition,” said a source in BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/is-it-the-end-of-the-political-career-of-gurjar-couple/articleshow/83968361.cms||---
---||Delhi||Fishing banned at two Yamuna stretches due to high pollution||New Delhi: The animal husbandry department has banned fishing in two sections of the Yamuna till further orders due to high levels of pollution in the river. A senior official of the department said fishing licences had been suspended as the fish on these stretches were not fit for consumption. Experts say pollution in the Yamuna has affected the population of fish over the years.The department has banned fishing in the portions of Hindon Canal, Ghazipur drain and Shahdara drain from RD 0 to 17,000 and another stretch from the Yamuna from groyne number 8.5 downstream, New Okhla Barrage to New Delhi boundary. Rakesh Singh, director, animal husbandry, said, “The fishing licence in two stretches of the Yamuna, which are highly polluted, has been suspended as the fish are unfit for human consumption. The stretches are those that we lease out on an annual basis. We had stopped fishing activity there last year too.”Experts say the dissolved oxygen (DO) should be 5mg/l or more in the river for survival of aquatic life. According to data of Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the level of DO has been nil at Khajuri Paltoon Pool, Kudesia Ghat, ITO Bridge, Agra Canal Okhla, Shahdara downstream and Agra Canal Jaitpur from October 2020 to March this year. The water quality was not accessed in April and May due to the lockdown.Diwan Singh, a Yamuna activist, said, “As the level of DO mostly remains below the standard parameters, the polluted water is not fit for survival of fish. Though some fish species have adapted themselves to the polluted water, the consumption of such fish is not good for health. The high load of pollution in the river is dangerous for the food chain.” Bhim Singh Rawat, another Yamuna activist and part of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People, told TOI, “The aquatic life hardly exists in the main stretch of the Yamuna in Delhi. Most of the species survive in the fresh water and many fish species are not found in the river due to pollution. The fishing activity mostly takes place during monsoon as when there is a fresh flow, fish go upstream.” He added that the government should work on improving the water quality of the Yamuna rather than restricting activities like fishing as many communities are dependent on the river for livelihood.To prevent frothing from taking place and adding pollution in the river, Delhi government had banned sale, storage, transportation and marketing of soaps and detergents, which did not meet the Bureau of Indian Standards norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fishing-banned-at-two-yamuna-stretches-due-to-high-pollution/articleshow/83966448.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The programme, where the PM is scheduled to speak, has been organised by Indian Medical Association. “India is proud of the efforts of all doctors in fighting Covid-19. 1st July is marked as National Doctors Day. At 3 pm tomorrow, will address the doctors’ community at a programme organised by IMA,” Modi tweeted on Wednesday. Earlier on Sunday, IMA president Dr JA Jayalal said the PM had assured that doctors would be respected, protected and safeguarded. He added that the Doctors’ Day would be celebrated in remembrance of veteran Dr BC Roy. Like every year, the country will be celebrating National Doctors’ Day on July 1 to honour the contributions of the doctors. The first National Doctor’s Day was celebrated in the country in July 1991. “On the Doctors’ Day, I would like to convey my deep heartfelt gratitude to all healthcare and frontline workers for working tirelessly in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, countless lives have been saved – thanks to our healthcare and frontline workers who have continued to work day and night for over 18 months, responding to the pandemic and also providing other essential services. We have unfortunately lost many of our health workforce to the pandemic. To these brave hearts, their families, and our health workforce, WHO salutes you. Your heroism, commitment and duty are legendary. WHO will continue to work with countries to invest in health workforce strengthening, to protect their occupational health and safety and embrace health workforce innovations that enhance health equity. WHO stands in solidarity with all health workers, everywhere,” Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia, said. At least 128 doctors have died due to Covid-19 in Delhi in the second wave. Across India, the IMA says, the number of deaths among doctors has touched 789. Dr Vinay Aggarwal, past national president of IMA, said the pandemic had been tough for healthcare professionals. “The PM’s decision to address the doctors is a historic one. It will motivate the healthcare professionals, who have been facing multiple challenges, including loss of their peers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/modi-to-address-docs-today-honour-their-contribution/articleshow/84001547.cms||---

AREPRL had been allotted a total of 6,115 bighas of land in Nedan village in 2018 for setting up a power plant by the then DM. The division bench of Justice Sangeet Lodha and Justice Rameshwar Vyas directed the state government to conduct a survey of land parcels allotted to AREPRL as well as Essel Surya Urja Company of Rajasthan Ltd (ESUCRL) in three villages, the others being Ugras and Nagnechinagar, and ordered cancellation of land allotted to these companies if the same is meant for public utilities. The court gave these directions on a petition by Barkat Khan and 23 others objecting to the allotment of land for public utilities to solar power companies by the state government. The court further stated that the allotment of land surrounding that of petitioners, khatedar tenants and the land for public utilities made in favour of these two companies in three villages shall be reviewed by the state government to ensure that the rights of the inhabitants of the aforesaid villages are not infringed upon or adversely affected. The court ordered the land for approach road to the lands of khatedar tenants and inhabitants of the villages to be specifically kept apart and entered in the revenue record for the said purpose. The entire exercise pursuant to this order should be completed by the government within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/raj-hc-cancels-allotment-of-public-utility-land-in-pokhran-to-adani-firm/articleshow/83968370.cms||---

The sale will be done by the liquidator appointed for the purpose by NCTL through a public e-auction platform on July 7 as per provisions in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, says the e-auction sale notice. The Mumbai bench of NCTL has fixed July 7 for the e-auction of sale of the properties and assets owned by Nicomet Industries Limited, according to a notice issued by Divyesh Desai, the liquidator appointed by the Tribunal. The notice said that the properties and assets owned by Nicomet Industries Limited in liquidation put up for auction form a part of the Liquidation Estate in possession of the liquidator. The property/assets will be sold on “as where is basis”, “as is what is basis” and “whatever there is basis” and “no recourse basis” for recovery of debts under Insolvency and Bankruptcy code, 2016. However, what has caused to raise concern among the residents is that apart from its land, building, and plant and machinery at the Cuncolim industrial estate that has been put up for sale, the landfill site of the plant is also a component of the composite unit that goes under the hammer. Several of its assets, including a number of vehicles, located in Goa, Mumbai and Bhiwandi, are among the items listed in the e-auction notice. Dr Jorson Fernandes, who has been leading a campaign against industrial pollution in the Cuncolim industrial estate, demanded that the authorities immediately undertake remediation measures to prevent any further contamination of ground water through the landfill site. “Apart from the existence of hazardous waste in the landfill, one of the leachate containing tanks is believed to be leaking. Despite repeated pleas, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has failed to take any action,” Fernandes said. He has demanded a joint inspection of the site by all government agencies concerned at the earliest. GSPCB member secretary Shamila Monteiro, when contacted, said that “all necessary steps” will be taken by the Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/defunct-nicomet-firms-assets-to-go-under-hammer/articleshow/83970650.cms||---

The cinema hall owners say they have already suffered huge losses and will consider resuming operations only when the government introduces a relief package for them. Varinder Singh Chawla, a multiplex owner, said, “The cinema and multiplex business’s future is very uncertain. We have been the worst sufferers of the lockdowns. During the first wave of coronavirus, we had to keep our operations shut for eight months and were finally allowed to open in November 2020. After incurring huge expenses, we resumed shows but received a very poor response from the public and could not even cover our operational costs. Now, it will be like a gamble to open the cinema halls and spend lakhs on operations when there is no guarantee that there will be no lockdown again.” “We have suffered unprecedented losses and it is impossible to come out of the financial mess. So we want the state and the Central governments to lend a helping hand to us and bring out a relief package for us. Along with announcing a three-year tax holiday for cinemas and multiplexes, we should also be given interest-free and collateral-free loans for the revival of our businesses,” he added. Gursahib Singh, PRO of a multiplex, said unlike any other business, it was a very daunting task to restart operations of cinema halls. “We will take a call in the coming days after taking into account the number of new movie releases and the coronavirus cases.” A large number of people employed in the cinema and multiplex business have changed jobs due to the uncertainty. A Punjab Mata Nagar resident, who was working as a cashier at a multiplex, said, “From April 2020 till now, we have worked only for three to four months. There has been no hike in salaries as not enough business was generated by multiplexes even to manage the expenses incurred in operations. As uncertainty looms over the future of this business, I think it is better to shift to some other job.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/two-weeks-after-rules-relaxations-cinema-halls-not-prepared-to-open/articleshow/83964044.cms||---

Accused ASI Hakam Singh had demanded Rs 7,000 from the complainant. The deal was later struck at Rs 5,000. Complainant Nishan Singh of Sarabha village said, “My wife Manjit Kaur runs a boutique in the village. Another woman of the village, Ranjit Kaur, works as a helper there.

However, Vajinder somehow got a case registered against Manjit and Ranjit for beating him up.” “I met investigating officer ASI Hakam Singh with the medical reports of Manjit and Ranjit and asked him to probe the case in a fair manner. Assuring action, the cop took a bribe of Rs 4,000 from me. Thereafter, he demanded Rs 7,000 more. The deal was settled at Rs 5,000,” he added. SSP Rupinder Singh said when ASI Hakam Singh accepted the bribe near Mansooran Chowk, the VB team nabbed him red-handed.

---||Delhi||SC refuses to treat La-Residentia project as a part of Amrapali||New Delhi: Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to bring one of the residential projects of La-Residentia Developers in Greater Noida within the fold of Amrapali projects being constructed by NBCC under its supervision. It turned down the plea of homebuyers that the project be treated as a part of Amrapali as it has around 20% stake in it.A bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ashok Bhushan, however, said the investment made by Amrapali group in the project has to be recovered and the amount would be used for construction of Amrapali’s other projects, which is currently being done under its monitoring. It directed sale of 632 flats of the project to recover Amrapali’s investment which will be used for construction of Amrapali unfinished projects. Under this project, 3,256 apartments were to be constructed in three phases — 1,408 apartments in first phase, 996 in second phase and 852 in third phase. Phase-I of the project is almost complete and around 1,143 flat buyers have received possession while work of construction with respect to phases II and III are in advanced stage.Noting that considerable construction work has been completed, the court said there was no need to treat it as part of Amrapali and hand over the construction work to NBCC as pleaded by the homebuyers’ association. “Considering all these features of the matter, in our considered view, it would not be just and proper to hand over the development at this stage to the NBCC as prayed for by the Association,” the bench said. The association pleaded that the court had passed an order to treat ‘Heartbeat City’ as part of Amrapali and sought a similar order be also passed for La-Residentia. But the bench said, “The interest of Amrapali Group of Companies and consequently that of the flat buyers who had invested money in other Amrapali Projects already stands quantified at 19.75% ... Therefore, even if there could be some similarity with regard to the status of the instant project as against ‘Heartbeat City’ Project, considering the fact situation on record, that by itself would not afford sufficient reason to entertain the submissions on behalf of the Association and the applicants supporting the Association”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-refuses-to-treat-la-residentia-project-as-a-part-of-amrapali/articleshow/83966473.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Cluster plan from July 1 to help cover more vaccine recipients in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ: Vaccine recipients on Tuesday had to return without getting a jab in trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets of the district due to the unavailability of vaccines. The vaccination exercise was taken up at 14 sites in the city areas only on Tuesday. Officials of the health department informed that vaccination exercise against Covid would not be held at community health centres (CHCs) in rural areas on Wednesday. Officials, however, claimed that a cluster plan meant to cover more and more recipients in rural and urban areas would be taken up in the district from July 1. On Tuesday, recipients who arrived at rural and semi urban-based vaccination centres returned empty-handed due to the non-availability of vaccines. Recipients approached the health staff concerned to know about the vaccination dates and the staff assured them that they would be covered under the cluster plan. However, 14 vaccination sites that were opened in the city on Tuesday witnessed a huge rush of recipients. As many as 8,40,098 Covid vaccine shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, that is, those aged above 18 years, till June 28. While 7,02,556 beneficiaries have taken the first dose, 1,37,542 recipients have also received the second dose. A total of 10,470 vaccine shots were administered to people of all age groups in the past 24 hours, which included 6829 recipients of the first dose and 3,641 of the second shot, he said. Meanwhile, officials of the health department are focusing on a cluster plan and deployed over 300 health teams to cover each village, block and ward of the district from June 1. The district has been divided into 216 clusters. As around 60 per cent of the eligible recipients stay in rural areas, more health teams have been pressed into service in rural pockets. With a cluster plan to be launched from July 1, at least 10 -12 additional teams would be roped to achieve the target. Officials have set a target of administering around 39.87 lakh beneficiaries, including 27 lakh recipients aged between 18 and 44 and 12.87 lakh beneficiaries aged over 45.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cluster-plan-from-july-1-to-help-cover-more-vaccine-recipients/articleshow/83968443.cms||---

This includes Rs 28,623 crore of BRPL, Rs 19,213 crore of BYPL and Rs 3,810 crore of TPDDL. The petitions also show that their standalone revenue gap for 2019-20 is around Rs 2968 crore, which includes Rs 1,565 crore of BRPL, Rs 609 crore of BYPL and Rs 794 crore of TPDDL.Delhi government had started the process of selecting a new chairperson and a member for DERC in March this year. Incumbent chairman Justice (Retired) Satyendra Singh Chauhan, judge of Allahabad High Court, was appointed directly in 2018 without the regular selection process through various committees — as retired judges can be directly appointed.As per the Electricity Act, chairman and member shall hold office for a term of five years from joining or till attaining age of 65 years. The incumbent chairman will retire on July 4.The AAP government had constituted a selection committee under the chairmanship of Justice (retired) Sarvesh Gupta, judge of Uttarakhand High Court, under Section 85 of the Electricity Act, 2003, with the approval of state power minister Satyendar Jain. However, the selection committee’s tenure got over and a second committee has been formed, sources said. The delay in the selection also means a further delay in the annual revision process.On April 1, the Union ministry of power had written to all State Electricity Regulatory Commissions that “timely issuance of the tariff orders and full cost reflectiveness of tariff are important prerequisites for ensuring sustainability of the power sector and is also in the interest of the consumers.” The letter further said that “it has been brought to the notice of the government that despite explicit legal provisions, there are significant delays in issuance of tariff orders by some of the state commissions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/revision-of-power-tariffs-delayed-for-second-year/articleshow/83966467.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Major quake can permanently displace 40% of Kumaon Himalayas, finds study||DEHRADUN: Over 40% of the Kumaon Himalayas — a region of rich biodiversity — is at risk of permanent displacement from co-seismic landslides if a major earthquake were to strike Uttarakhand, scientists have found. Researchers at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology in Dehradun studied Goriganga valley in Pithoragarh district, the highest seismically active zone of the seismic zoning map of India, and found that a major earthquake in the region could induce landslides that would displace 40% of the Kumaon Himalayas — an area spanning 894 square km. Several studies have predicted that the Goriganga area is susceptible to an earthquake of magnitude 8 or higher. Earthquakes can lead to co-seismic landslides, an important hazard phenomena in the hilly and seismically active mountainous region. “Often the destruction caused due to the earthquake-induced landslides is much greater than the destruction caused by direct ground shaking of an earthquake,” said Vikram Gupta, a scientist at Wadia Institute, who was part of the study published in the ‘Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment’. According to researchers, the work is the first of its kind in the Himalayan region to explore earthquake-induced landslides in view of future major to great probabilistic earthquakes. The study mapped coseismic landslides for scenarios where earthquakes of magnitude 7, 8 and 8.6 would hit in the region. They used modified Newmark’s analysis — a method which factored in joint strength of rock mass, critical acceleration of the slope and peak ground acceleration of the region — to provide the permanent displacement of the potential landslide. Researchers found that earthquakes of magnitudes 7.0, 8.0, and 8.6 might lead to high coseismic landslide susceptible zone covering an area of 300 sq km, 785 sq km and 894 sq km, respectively. They also found that earthquakes of these magnitude might moderately damage an area ranging from 1,134 sq km to 1,459 sq km. The other authors of the paper include Sandeep Kumar, Vikram Gupta, Parveen Kumar and YP Sundriyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/major-quake-can-permanently-displace-40-of-kumaon-himalayas-finds-study/articleshow/83964080.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Ludhiana||Baldev Singh Dhillon to continue as Punjab Agricultural University vice-chancellor||LUDHIANA: The board of management of Punjab Agricultural University has decided to give extension to Baldev Singh Dhillon as the vice-chancellor. The board meeting, which was attended by all its members under the chairmanship of chief secretary Vinni Mahajan, was held on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the issue of appointment of the new vice-chancellor. Additional chief secretary (development), department of agriculture and farmers welfare, Punjab, Anirudh Tewari said, “The board has unanimously decided to give Dhillon an extension as the VC till further orders. The date is not decided yet as the file is at the chief minister office. He has taken PAU to greater heights.” An official said, “A screening committee has been set up to look into the extension of the VC.” Dhillon has various achievements to his credit in the agriculture field. He was appointed as the VC in 2011 for four years. He was again appointed as the VC in 2015 for another four years up to 2019. Thereafter, his term was extended by two years. Members of the board of management included Punjab governor and PAU chancellor V P Singh Badnore, Mahajan, Dhillon, Tewari, principal secretary, department of finance, Punjab, K A P Sinha, and director of agriculture, Punjab, Sukhdev Singh Sidhu. Agricultural scientists SS Gosal and Balwinder Singh and progressive farmers Kulwant Singh Ahluwalia and Devinder Singh Chahal also attended the meeting. R S Sidhu, registrar of the university, was the secretary of the meeting. Meanwhile, Punjab Agricultural University Teachers’ Association secretary K S Sangha said, “We condemn the decision of the state government and the board of management. It is against the university rules. There is no clarity in orders that it is till what date. Nobody is indispensable and it seems that the government lacks the talent to find a new and better VC. He has given a whole decade to the university. Now, he should make way for change.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bs-dhillon-to-continue-as-pau-vc/articleshow/83964061.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Nagpur||Nagpur has around 144 km of kuccha roads, civic body survey shows||NAGPUR: The city, which once took pride in having the most motorist-friendly, bump-free roads, is now dotted with potholes, ripped off patches and slush pits that emerge every monsoon. As per a Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) survey, the city, spread over 227.29 sqkm, has 1,491.19km of tar roads, while 666.78km have been converted into cement ones. The city has around 144km of kuccha roads and these are a cause for concern for motorists. The roads fall under the domain of different agencies like the NMC, Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), NHAI and the state’s public works department (PWD). The national highways constitute just 1.35% of the total road network, state highways and PWD roads have a length of 91.13km while NMC and NIT are responsible for 2,080.26km roads. Different agencies have affected infrastructure development in the city’s peripheral areas. This also means that the onus of having good roads largely rests on the NMC and NIT. BJP corporator from east Nagpur Rajkumar Sahu said that many areas in this part of the city are struggling to get motorable roads. Sahu has submitted proposals for construction of water bound macadam (WBM) or kuccha roads in many areas under his prabhag. He said getting an WBM road offers some relief to people residing in areas like Laxmi Nagar, Sahakar Layout, Vijay Nagar, Radha Krishna Housing Society, Bharatwada etc. Congress corporator Darshni Dhawad too pointed out that many taxpayers are being forced to use kuccha roads in her prabhag comprising areas under Dabha due to “favouritism” towards places represented by ruling party corporators. “There are many roads in the city which are tarred twice a year. But in areas like Dabha, we struggle to get the funds sanctioned for WBM roads,” a miffed Dhawad said. The elected representatives also pointed out that areas in Hudkeshwar and Narsala, which were included in the city limits, were lucky, thanks to former guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. Many kuccha roads in these two areas were not only converted into tar roads, but many were concretized and more were in the pipeline. It shows that the areas in the outer parts of the city, which have no influential elected representatives, suffer for a longer period of time due to lack of civic amenities, especially road infrastructure. “These roads are mostly in underdeveloped areas with a fewer number of houses and are generally located on the outskirts of the city,” said a senior official from the NMC’s public works department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-has-around-144km-of-kuccha-roads-civic-body-survey-shows/articleshow/83968412.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

These beneficiaries were vaccinated early in April and according to norms, they’ll need a second dose after 12 to 16 weeks. The coverage of this group will also have to happen alongside 18-44 vaccinations, which means more sites, more personnel and more doses. According to district health office data, more than 14 lakh citizens were vaccinated against Covid in April. In March, nearly 6.4 lakh were given first and second doses. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune Circle, said supply of vaccines is expected to streamline further by next month. “We also cannot rule out to vaccine reserves at private hospitals. Beneficiaries who can pay can get jabs at private hospitals. That will give civic sites relief if there are vaccine shortages,” he said.  Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said the Centre has to now keep up supply. He said, “There is a lot of confusion among citizens about vaccine availability. The Union government’s lack of clarity is responsible for that. To vaccinate this large number of second-dose beneficiaries in July, we will be at the mercy of the Centre. If it fails to send enough doses, there won’t be enough drives for beneficiaries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-10l-in-district-up-for-covishield-2nd-dose-in-july/articleshow/83968437.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||80% of planned coal power plants in India, four Asian nations||NAGPUR: Asian countries are responsible for 80% of the world’s planned new coal-fired power plants, with India being the second-largest coal power producer with around 250 gigawatt (GW) of operating capacity and 60 GW in the pipeline. This was revealed in the latest report ‘Do Not Revive Coal’ released by the financial think-tank Carbon Tracker on Tuesday. According to the report, China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam plan to build more than 600 new units with a combined capacity of over 300GW, ignoring calls from United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres for all new coal plants to be cancelled. Out of these planned units, 92% of them will be uneconomic, even under normal business, and up to $150 billion could be wasted, the report stated. The report stated that in India, new renewables can already generate energy at lower cost than 84% of operating coal and will outcompete everywhere by 2024. “It has a target of 450 GW of renewables by 2030 – more than five times its 2020 capacity which would meet 60% of energy demand,” the report stated. The analysis further highlighted that at the corporate level, just ten companies account for around 40% of the stranding risk, of which NTPC and the Adani Group in India, and PLN in Indonesia are by far the most “exposed”. “Of the ten most exposed companies, seven are head-quartered in India,” the researchers found. The same five Asian countries also operate nearly three quarters of the current global coal fleet, with 55% in China and 12% in India. The report warns that around 27% of existing capacity is already unprofitable and another 30% is close to break even, generating a nominal profit of no more than $5 per MWh. Worldwide, $220 billion of operating coal plants are deemed at risk of becoming stranded if the world meets the Paris climate targets. Stating that around 80% of the operating global coal fleet could be replaced with new renewables with an immediate cost saving, the report added, “By 2024, new renewables will be cheaper than coal in every major region, and by 2026 almost 100% of global coal capacity will be more expensive to run than building and operating new renewables.” Carbon Tracker’s head of power and utilities, Catharina Hillenbrand Von Der Neyen said, “These last bastions of coal power are swimming against the tide, when renewables offer a cheaper solution that supports global climate targets. Investors should steer clear of new coal projects, many of which are likely to generate negative returns from the outset.” IN A NUTSHELL - 5 Asian countries responsible for 80% of world’s new planned coal plants - China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam plan more than 600 new units with combined capacity of over 300GW - India second largest coal power producer - Has around 250 GW of operating capacity, pipeline of 60 GW - Among the top 10 companies most exposed to stranded asset risks, 7 are from India||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/80-of-planned-coal-power-plants-in-india-4-asian-nations/articleshow/83968450.cms||Manka Behl

It is a publicity stunt. It is unfair what you are doing to us. Don’t behave like a private litigant,” a bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla said after hearing the matter. The court added that the NGO could not “behave like an ordinary litigant. You have to espouse a much higher cause.” It cannot be allowed to indulge in bench hunting, the court said. Sensing the mood of the court, the counsel for the NGO, Justice for All, withdrew the plea. The application for interim relief was filed in a pending petition in which the petitioner NGO had sought to modify CBSE’s policy for tabulation of marks of Class X Board exams 2021 based on internal assessment conducted by the schools. Advocate Khagesh B Jha, appearing for the organisation, submitted that a fresh set of FAQs had been published by the board on June 9. He said the last date to upload the marks and internal assessment of Class X students on CBSE website was June 30. The application, through advocate Shikha Sharma Bagga, sought an interim order to direct all the schools affiliated to the board to publish the rationale document for devised criteria for assessment of Class X students on their respective websites, before calculating the result and uploading the same on the CBSE portal, to bring transparency. According to the plea, students should be able to access the document and raise grievances with CBSE well in time along with a grievance redressal mechanism by the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-calls-plea-on-class-x-marks-a-publicity-stunt/articleshow/84001631.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The resupply could take total doses received to more than seven lakh. The number does not include vaccines supplied to the region’s private hospitals, which have been keeping up their daily vaccination drives. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune Circle, said the improved supply has also boosted vaccine coverage in June, which has seen the highest number of beneficiaries covered since April, when the district had vaccinated more than 14 lakh beneficiaries. In May, just over 5 lakh were given their jabs. “At the time, supply was coming only from the Centre. Now, private hospitals too are buying vaccines and that has improved coverage across the district, especially in the Pune Metropolitan Region,” Deshmukh said. He said that the final vaccine resupply for June is likely to arrive on Wednesday, which could take the total number of vaccine doses received to seven lakh. But he added that Covaxin supply continues to remain limited. “We are a little short on Covaxin so shots have been reserved only for those who are due for a second dose. Both doses of Covishield continue to be administered due to its availability. Also, even if Covishield is unavailable at government-run sites, beneficiaries have the option to get it from private hospitals,” Deshmukh said. As of June 28, the district has vaccinated 39.48 lakh citizens — 30.89 lakh have received their first dose while 8.59 lakh citizens have received their second dose. On Tuesday, records showed that 60,418 beneficiaries were vaccinated against Covid-19 in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coverage-in-june-brings-relief-after-last-months-poor-show/articleshow/83968451.cms||Piyush Bhusari

In Jaipur, almost all government vaccination centres remained closed for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. The situation was the same in several other districts. The state received 60,000 doses of Covaxin on Tuesday, a day after it received 2 lakh doses. “In comparison to other states, vaccine hesitancy in Rajasthan is the lowest, a result of our efforts. The Government of India should take all these aspects into consideration and supply vaccines according to our need,” tweeted chief minister Ashok Gehlot. “In the entire country, we were the first who took the lead and, as a result of that, 75 lakh second doses are due in July. But, the Centre has decided to supply only 65 lakh doses, which is quite less. Until we get 1.5 crore doses in July, we will not be able to give first and second doses,” he said in his tweet. Gehlot said that the Centre had assured that there would be no shortage when it took the decision to vaccinate the above 18 years population from June 21. The state is not receiving vaccines regularly, according to our needs, following which the drive is being interrupted, he said.Rajasthan has a capacity to administer 15 lakh doses daily. By vaccinating over 10.4 lakh doses in a day, the state government has also shown that it has expanded its network. So far, 2.44 crore doses have been administered in the state. Gehlot said that if the Centre provides vaccines regularly, there won't be risk of the third wave. Rajasthan was the first state to vaccinate the first 50,000 beneficiaries and second in administering 1 crore doses. The Centre should keep its vaccine policy transparent and make public the doses received by each state, he said. Geographically, the state is the biggest in the country and requires more time to transport vaccines. “Once the supply gets interrupted, the momentum is lost," said Siddharth Mahajan, health secretary. The state has 5.14 crore beneficiaries as per the Centre’s statistics. Out of these, 40% have already received the first dose, while 8% have received both the doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vax-shortage-acute-gehlotdemands-1-5cr-shots-for-july/articleshow/83968456.cms||---

The shops are opening beyond permissible time, markets are getting crowded and many people are seen violating Covid-appropriate behaviour, but there is no surveillance or enforcement of rules. For the past few days, the Ludhiana police have also stopped lodging FIRs against the violators. A team of the TOI witnessed violations in most parts of the city. As per the guidelines of Ludhiana district administration, all essential and non-essential shops can open from 5am to 7.30pm. After that all eateries can open till 9pm only for home delivery and not for takeaways. The curfew is imposed by 8pm. However, markets remain open till 9pm and beyond too. On Dandi Swami Road, eating joints a few metres from the residence of commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal remain open for takeaway till 9pm. Besides, the crowd there doesn’t respect social distancing. “The eateries on Dandi Swami Road are always crowded. After 7.30pm, they close entry for customers, but the takeaway option remains open till 9pm, sometimes even after that. Police do not see this violation when the top cop’s residence is merely a few metres away and the police lines is also on the same road,” says Vipan Kumar, a resident of Hambran Road. In Dugri also the eateries remain open for takeaway till 9pm. Some inner markets of Rajguru Nagar, BRS Nagar and Sarabha Nagar are also open and unchecked. “There are a few restaurants that check the temperature of visitors and sanitise their hands. The Covid cases have reduced, so people and cops have become lenient. If police seriously want to keep a check on violations, they should start checking CCTVs of restaurants and shops,” says Lalit Ahuja, a resident of Dugri. On Gill Road too, some vegetable and fruit shops and grocery stores near Gill bridge are open till 9pm despite the presence of cops at the site. Sudhir Chopra, a resident of Gill Road, says, “When the lockdown was imposed last year, the policemen used to patrol even in the inner lanes of the localities. The same kind of patrolling is needed now. The shops that are inside the residential localities are overlooked.” Checking drives Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “All restaurants, cafes, dhabas, gyms, among others, must get their employees vaccinated, at least with the first dose, to open with 50% capacity. The police are starting a drive to check all these places. If staffers of these places are not vaccinated, the premises will be sealed. Moreover, we will also scan the CCTV footage of these places to check if all Covid rules are being followed. Residents are requested not to crowd at any place as precautions will ensure safety of their and others lives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-police-go-easy-on-covid-rules-violators/articleshow/83964121.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Kochi||Kerala: 12 districts are unable to meet daily testing target||KOCHI: Despite government’s efforts to increase testing to bring down test positivity rate (TPR) and control spread of Covid infection, several districts are unable to meet the daily testing target set by the health department. The main concern is especially in areas that are containment zones or under triple lockdown. Of the 14 districts in the state, in almost 12 districts, the authorities struggle to meet the daily testing target. The only two districts able to achieve the testing targets are Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam and this is mainly due to the presence of several Covid testing centres in the private sector. In districts like Idukki, Malappuram, Wayanad and Thrissur, on most days, 30% to 45% testing targets are not met. This issue was discussed in detail in the review meeting on June 22 and now authorities are taking initiatives at the local level to increase testing. “Since the last few days we have seen an increased reluctance among people to get tested and due to this it is often difficult for us to meet the targets. Only symptomatic patients are coming for tests. Health department and local self government officials have been trying to convince asymptomatic contacts and people in the community for random testing but to no avail. However, efforts to sensitize and encourage people continues,” said Shaji Joseph, deputy director of panchayats, Malappuram district. In many districts, including Malappuram, the authorities are now trying to involve places of worship, religious, business and community leaders,and political leaders to sensitize and convince people to test. However, a few panchayats with high TPR have also drawn flak for trying to reduce TPR by testing a few who have no symptoms and are not part of clusters where there is prevalence of the infection. Kerala has been in a plateau phase for weeks and the TPR on most days is above 10%. The health authorities are worried about a possible a surge in cases with the spread of Delta and Delta Plus variants amid lockdown relaxations. “We suspect that the TPR may be higher than what is officially declared as the spread of Covid infection has not reduced especially in rural areas. Contacts of Covid-positive persons refuse to get tested and people in the community also refuse to come to the testing camps organized at the panchayat levels where TPR is high. The only silver lining is that the number of critical patients has now reduced,” said Dr Gopikumar P, secretary, IMA, Kerala chapter. Health officials said that the main reason for reluctance among the public is the concern that if tested positive, they may have to sit in quarantine for nearly 17 days and this would result in further loss of livelihood earnings. Also, health officials, who are busy with Covid vaccination drive, are exhausted and now fatigue has set in. “This is not the time to lower our guard. We need to continue testing more people in the community and speed up the vaccination drive to protect our people from the third wave,” said Kerala Government Medical Officers Association president Dr G S Vijayakrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/12-districts-are-unable-to-meet-daily-testing-target/articleshow/83966524.cms||Preetu Nair

In at least five cases, doctors at Sir Ganga Ram hospital said on Tuesday, they found another opportunistic infection caused by a virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which leads to rectal bleeding. Until now, it has affected only immunocompromised patients, post-transplant, cancer, AIDS, etc., but this is the “first time in India” that cases of CMV-related rectal bleeding in patients who have recovered from Covid-19 have been reported, the hospital said. Dr Anil Arora, chairman, Institute of Liver Gastroenterology and Pancreaticobiliary Sciences, at the hospital, said he had treated five such patients already. “They came with pain in abdomen and bleeding during stool discharge. None of them had other predisposing immunosuppressed states accounting for this viral infection,” he said. The patients in the age group of 30-70 were from Delhi-NCR. Four of them had presented with lower gastrointestinal bleed, which is bleeding in stools and one of them with intestinal obstruction, the hospital said. “Two of them had massive bleeding, one requiring life-saving surgery, while another succumbed due to massive bleeding and severe Covid-19 chest disease,” said a hospital spokesperson. Other three were successfully treated with antiviral therapy with ganciclovir, he added. Cytomegalovirus colitis was confirmed by PCR testing for CMV viremia and tissue biopsy from the large intestine, which showed intra-nuclear inclusion bodies that was further confirmed to be due to CMV by specific immunohistochemistry stains, said Dr Sunila Jain, senior consultant pathologist, SGRH. Covid and medicines used for its treatment (like steroids), do suppress the immunity of patients, and make them susceptible to uncommon infections with varied presentations, the doctors added. Cases of rectal bleeding have also been reported from Moolchand Hospital. Dr Sachin Ambekar, consultant, department of laparoscopic and minimal access surgery, at the hospital said, since March, he had seen three to five patients daily in OPD with symptoms of anal fissures and piles. “On probing, patients have been found to be following home remedy sent on WhatsApp. They have been overdosing on Vitamin D and C, herbal and ‘kadah’ preparations, which have in the long run flared up symptoms of pre-existing fissure or piles. Moreover, even new cases of acute anal fissures have been observed,” Dr Ambekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/five-covid-19-patients-at-ganga-ram-hosp-suffer-rectal-bleeding-one-dies/articleshow/83968527.cms||---

---||Nashik||Nashik cops slap Maharashtra control of organised crime act on 108 in just 5 months||NASHIK: The Nashik city police, in a record five-month time, have applied the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) to over 100 criminals in the city. Once the MCOCA charges are framed, it becomes hard for the criminals to get a bail, which eventually helps in maintaining peace, law and order. On Saturday, police commissioner Deepak Pandey instructed the Ambad police to frame MCOCA charges against 27 criminals for organized crime in connection to a case of robbery. Earlier, the police had framed the same charges against 81 other criminals. The police action against criminals has instilled a sense of security among Nashik residents Meanwhile, the police have also initiated a special programme to reform the history-sheeters who had got involved in illegal activity innocently or committed offences in the heat of the moment. The police have started taking bonds of good behaviour from such criminals. Once the police get the bond of good behaviour from the criminals concerned, they do not take action against such criminals. In due course of time, after checking their records, the police also remove their names from their list. The Ambad police had proposed the names of 33 criminals to be booked under MCOCA in connection to robberies and theft. However, since six criminals participated in the special criminal reformation programme, the police did not book them under the stringent law and gave them an opportunity to improve their conduct. The city police are also making efforts to ensure that criminals who give bonds of good behaviour are provided with a job. Recently, seven such criminals were provided with employment as security guards and drivers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-cops-slap-mcoca-on-108-in-just-5-months/articleshow/83964163.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Maximum coverage, they said, will ensure industrial production from the belt stays at full capacity. Chakan has several factories. There are more than 2 lakh people employed at these units and many are yet to receive their shots because of shortages, said Dilip Batwal, secretary of the federation. He added, “Most of the workforce is between 18 and 44 years of age. Many of them haven’t been vaccinated because of shortages at the government-run vaccine centre in Chakan. The Karanjvihare PHC, which covers Chakan industries, gets just about 300 doses daily.” Jayshree Mahajan in-charge of the Karanjvihare PHC, said, “Besides industries, we have to cover 32 villages in our jurisdiction. We have been asking for more doses.” BB Gadve, Khed tehsil health officer, said has asked the district administration for more doses. “We get limited supply from the district administration.

We were told by the police commissioner that cops were called by the SMC officials,” said Bhanderi.

They demanded suspension of guilty officials and immediate relief to camel raisers by the government. Prior to this, joint director of animal husbandry department heard the complaints in which camel raisers demanded to suspend the officers. On the other hand, district collector Ashish Modi has sent his report to the state government for action. The Times of India on June 25 had published the news of officers in camel development scheme who had paid Rs 3 crore to fake camel raisers by taking commission of Rs 75 lakh. There is growing resentment among the camel raisers as no action was taken in the case so far. Degrai Camel Protection Association president Sumer Singh Bhati said that the corrupt officer had paid crores of rupees to fake camel raisers by taking commission whereas actual people are not benefited. In the investigation, the corruption has been proved, however, no action was taken, he said. Sang Singh said there is no office in the district where corruption is not there. Not taking action even after the revelation of corruption in the animal husbandry department put the government under suspicion. The report clearly states that Dr. Jangid was involved in corruption. If action is not taken, then a protest demonstration will be organised at a wide scale by the camel raisers. Another camel raiser said that Rajasthan had the maximum number of camels in the country and it is the state animal but despite that the government is not paying any attention. The government has closed the camel development scheme due to which the economic situation of the camel raisers has become very bad, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/camel-raisers-seek-action-against-corrupt-officials/articleshow/83968491.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||300 units of free power in Punjab, 24-hour supply if AAP wins: Arvind Kejriwal||CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday promised 300 units of free electricity to all domestic consumers in Punjab, besides waiver of pending electricity bill dues and uninterrupted supply if his party wins the next assembly elections. Addressing mediapersons here, the Delhi CM said, “This is Kejriwal’s guarantee, and not Captain’s (Amarinder Singh) promises. Soon after AAP forms the government, the announcement about 300 units and bill waiver will be implemented immediately. But ensuring 24-hour supply will take 2-3 years.” Even though Kejriwal had not announced to the media that the benefit will be on a monthly basis, the claim was later added by the party leadership. “Power tariff is the highest in Punjab even though the state generates electricity. That’s because private power producers are in collusion with the state government. We need to end this to make power cheaper in Punjab. “AAP MLAs have been going to villages and people are troubled due to inflated bills. Bhagwant (Mann) told me that a poor man with one fan and two bulbs in the house got a bill of Rs 50,900 and his supply was disconnected for non-payment. AAP will waive off all such old bills and restore power connections. In Punjab’s villages, people are using illegal ‘kundi’ connections as one cannot live without power. We will restore the dignity of such families,” he said. “People of Punjab, especially women will benefit from these announcements. When we first fought the 2013 elections, it was the same situation in Delhi. People used to get inflated bills and the private companies were hand in glove with the state,” he added. “According to our calculations, 77 to 80% households will get zero power bills here. In Delhi, 73% of families get zero bill. “Punjab is power surplus and yet there are long cuts. We will ensure uninterrupted supply,” he said. Kejriwal said power units exceeding 300 free units will be charged as per general rate. “When we made this announcement in Delhi, even then we were asked where the funds were. It is magic and we know how to do it. I have done my calculations,” said AAP supremo, adding, “Punjab government claims to spend Rs 60,000 on every citizen. Where does the money go? It goes to liquor and the sand mafia. We will stop all these mafia and end contracts with private companies. There is no shortage of funds, there is lack of intent.” Responding to the media, Kejriwal said that today mafia rule was rampant in Punjab including sand, mining, drugs, liquor, transport and other mafias. He said that there was no shortage of revenue in Punjab, but it was being siphoned off by the political leaders. Punjab state president Bhagwant Mann said AAP gives “guarantees” and those announced in Delhi have been delivered. “Power tariff is one of the 188-points flagged by the Congress high command to chief minister Amarinder Singh. It shows that the ruling party has failed to fulfil its promises,” added Mann.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/300-units-of-free-power-24-hr-supply-if-aap-wins-kejriwal/articleshow/83968494.cms||---

Deceased Ajay Malik, 55, a resident of Jat Colony in Muzaffarnagar, operated a birck kiln on a rented plot in Kumrada village. In the morning, two men on a bike barged into his office at the kiln, fired at him from a close range and fled. Police have identified one of the men. They said he is related to the owner of the land Malik rented. “Malik had rented the land from Nathu Ram a few years ago. Ram’s son Ankush had a dispute with Malik over the rent. Ankush and his friend Vipin came to the kiln and shot Malik dead. A manhunt is on,” said inspector Yashpal Singh Bisht, in-charge of Manglaur police station. Haridwar district brick kiln association, ‘Brick Manufacturing Welfare Committee’, condemned the brazen murder. “Malik’s killing in broad daylight is very frightening,” said Naresh Tyagi, president of the brick kiln association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/brick-kiln-owner-shot-dead-in-manglaur/articleshow/83964224.cms||Tapan Susheel

---||Jaipur||Centre accuses Rajasthan of not cooperating to meet water schemes’ targets||JAIPUR: Jal Shakti ministry’s flagship scheme Atal Bhujal Yojana (ABY) related to recharge of groundwater and improving its quality has become a victim of poor coordination between the Centre and the state. The ministry has been accusing the state of not providing support for implementing the objectives of the scheme, which is applicable for 16 districts. The five-year scheme was launched in 2019. The Centre has allocated Rs 1,450 crore to the state’s 1,144 gram panchayats, including 155 in Dausa and 108 in Jaipur. The scheme is targeted to benefit 50 lakh people in the first phase, while in the second phase more gram panchayats will be included. The aim is to build capacity of sustainable water resources along with improving groundwater management. Officials called it a missed opportunity for the state as the scheme focused on reviving the old forgotten techniques of water conservation and improving water quality. “The scheme has not kicked off in many states despite several reminders. Rajasthan is yet to provide the names of blocks and gram panchayats slated to be included in the second list of ABY,” said a senior official in Jal Shakti ministry over the phone from Delhi. The delay is also due to a lack of coordination among different departments which have been assigned the task under ABY. Three departments have direct and indirect roles in the scheme — rural and panchayati raj, water resources and PHED departments. TOI called PHED minister BD Kalla for his reaction, but he didn’t respond. DM Jaipur Antar Singh Nehra said departments are working on the scheme. “Three blocks with scarce water resources have been covered under the scheme,” said Nehra. The apex body which undertakes the work is State Water Sanitation Mission (SWSM) with nodal offices in every district. TOI has learnt in most of the districts, they don’t have enough staff for the basic work of surveying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-accuses-state-of-not-cooperating-to-meet-water-schemes-targets/articleshow/83968518.cms||---

Cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi said, “Kejriwal has made some announcements for Punjab. He is known for lying and creating drama. AAP got to know that the Punjab government is about to make 300 units of power free and waive off the pending dues of the economically weak. He made a rush to make the promise especially for this. He has tried to mislead people of the state.” Amritsar West MLA Rajkumar Verka said, “Why did Kejriwal come to announce this suddenly. He got to know that Rahul Gandhi has asked the Punjab government to make 200 units free for all sections of society. Kejriwal has not done this in Delhi but has announced it for Punjab.” Apart from free power, the Congress high command had also asked the chief minister to look into the possibility of cancelling the power purchase agreements (PPAs), a promise that Kejriwal also made during his Chandigarh visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stole-cong-idea-on-free-electricity/articleshow/83968608.cms||---

Some of them stated that the accused inspector compelled them to pay the bribe as he demanded or else threatened them to implicate them in false criminal cases,” Vijay Singh, additional SP, ACB, Alwar told TOI. Senior officers of ACB stated that the people who approached ACB maintained that they had never approached the bureau in the past since they were threatened by the inspector. “Some of these complainants maintained that they had to sell off their cattle to pay the bribe demanded by the inspector. Some of them even thanked us for initiating action against this inspector.

On Saturday too, more than 2 lakh vaccine doses were administered. Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said that on Sunday, government vaccination centres were closed but on Saturday and Monday, vaccination was done at a high speed. “With the increasing speed of vaccination in Delhi, the number of total vaccinations administered has reached 75,43,765. Out of this, more than 17 lakh people have been administered both doses of vaccine,” she said. She said the youth in Delhi had been playing the biggest role in increasing the speed of vaccination. “Out of the 2 lakh vaccines administered, 1.5 lakh vaccine doses have been administered to the youth. And more than 35,000 doses administered to 45+ were administered to such people who had already received their first dose,” the MLA stated while releasing the vaccine bulletin on Tuesday. “Sometime back, the gap between Covishield doses was increased, that’s why the percentage of the second dose reduced. However, there are many such people now, whose second dose is due. Now, they are also coming out to get their second dose,” Atishi said. “Right now, Delhi’s per day vaccination capacity is 2.25 lakh and we hope that this is going to increase with time,” she said. The MLA further said Delhi had a stock of 5.25 lakh vaccines on Tuesday morning. “3.7 lakh Covishield and 1.5 lakh Covaxin doses are available. This vaccine stock will last for two days because now, the vaccination in Delhi is occurring at a very high speed,” she said. She requested the central government to provide vaccine stocks to Delhi before this stock gets over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-5l-youths-among-over-2l-vaccinated-in-a-day/articleshow/83968672.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Another year of low-key Ganeshotsav upsets organisers||MUMBAI: With the threat of the third wave looming large, the state government has, for the second year in a row, capped the height of the idols in sarvajanik Ganpati mandals at 4 feet and in households at 2 feet. The decision has evoked resentment among mandal representatives and sculptors. In fact, a section of the organisers has even threatened to cancel festivities unless they are permitted regular tall moortis made of plaster of paris (PoP). The annual Ganeshotsav guidelines issued by the home department on Tuesday appealed to people to downsize the festivities and to follow all other Covid-related restrictions issued periodically. The state urged devotees to worship idols made of metal or marble (instead of immersible plaster of paris or clay). Like last year, people are advised to pray to permanent Ganpati idols that are kept at home. If people do install an idol it should be made of clay so that it can be immersed in a tub at home itself. The government has instructed mandals to ensure there is no crowding at any ritual. Aagman and visarjan processions to mark arrival and immersion will not be permitted because they attract crowds. The notification orders mandals to stream online aarti and darshan as far as possible via Facebook Live, website or cable TV network. Mandals may organise awareness campaigns on dengue, Covid-19 or conduct blood donation drives instead of routine cultural events. But moortikar Reshma Khatu said they would try to get the government to revise these guidelines. Naresh Dahibawkar, president of the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti, said, “ We offered to hold the festival with all karyakartas vaccinated, even a ‘bio bubble’ and online darshan. I request the CM to call a meeting of all stakeholders and revise the rules.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-strict-ganeshotsav-rules-for-one-more-year-leave-organisers-sculptors-agitated/articleshow/83968598.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Jaipur||This girls’ school in middle of Thar desert needs no ACs||JAISALMER: You are in a school in the middle of Thar desert on a hot and sultry afternoon where the mercury is hovering around 50°C. Add to it the harsh winds that blow through the day. Sounds cruel? Read on... Located a little distance away from Jaisalmer’s famous Sam Dunes is an architectural marvel that has come up in Kanoi village with an aim to educate girls and empower them. The Rajkumari Ratnavati Girls’ School is made of yellow sandstone and there are no ACs. Here, students can study and even play in the courtyard without bothering about the extreme weather. The institution is oval-shaped that blends in the desert landscape. The school portion, known as the Gyaan Centre, will accommodate 400 girls from kindergarten to Class X when it is fully ready. The complex also has a textile museum and performance hall, as well as an exhibition space for artisans to sell their crafts. In another building, mothers of the schoolgirls will be trained in traditional arts like weaving and textiles to preserve dying handicrafts. It took more than 10 years for Michael Daube, founder of CITTA, a non-profit organisation, to conceptualise the building and build it. Michael roped in US-based architect Diana Kellogg, who conceived the design. The school was scheduled to start two years ago but Covid prevented it. Plans are afoot to launch classes within the next few months after the situation becomes conducive. Jaisalmer Maharawal Chaitanya Raj Singh said the school’s oval shape symbolises womanhood across many cultures. The symbol projects infinity and complements the landscape of dunes that merges with the school. It is also how the children play in circles or the women work in a community, he said. Singh said Jaisalmer Foundation president Manvendra Singh had provided 22 acres to Rajamata Rajeshwari Devi and he himself collected money for the school from Mumbai and New York. The main objective is to encourage girls to come and study. Initially, the school will have up to class 5, which will be later upgraded up to class 10. Manvendra Singh said the school was designed by Daube of CITTA, which works in the education and health sector in the country and abroad. When Daube was scouting for land in Jaisalmer for the project, they met Manvendra Singh who fulfilled their wish. Later, members of the erstwhile royal family got associated with Jaisalmer Foundation president and together made eforts to raise money for the institution. Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor and several renowned designers also pitched in with contributions for this school. He said this school will prove to be a milestone for shaping the future of girls in rural areas. CITTA website says that the schooling will be offered to BPL girls of Thar desert area. The facilities include classrooms, a library, a computer centre and bus facility to ferry girls from the nearby villages. The website says besides education to 400 girls, midday meals will also be provided to ensure proper nutrition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/this-girls-school-in-middle-of-thar-desert-needs-no-acs/articleshow/83968605.cms||---

Their family refused to collect the bodies citing harassment by police. They approached human right activists alleging that the Verna police drove their family members to death. South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh told TOI, “Verna police registered the case as suicide on Tuesday. The accusation and refusal of the family has been brought to my notice by mediapersons and I have set up a separate inquiry by SDPO Margao Harish Madkaiker.” On Tuesday morning, Halagappa Ambigera, 35, his wife Devamma Ambigera, 28, and his brother Gangappa Ambigera, 29, were found hanging in their rented house near MES college, Zuarinagar. Human rights activist advocate Albertina Almeida said, “It all started at 1am on June 22, when the owner of the house where Devamma worked complained to Verna police that jewellery and cash was missing and they suspected her of stealing it.” A formal complaint was lodged by Verna police on June 23. She last worked there on June 21. The complainant also owned the rented house they lived in. Subsequently, all three were called to the Verna police station for inquiry. Almeida said, “Devamma’s 17-year-old brother, who had recently come from their native village in Karnataka, was also summoned to the police station every time they were called. He informed that he witnessed police beating up all three of them. They went to the police station whenever they were called and from Saturday they were asked to come daily. On Tuesday again they were asked to report at 9am.” The minor boy told the activist that the trio was up early in the morning and were discussing the issue. Finally, he was sent to a shop to get breakfast. On his return he found the door open and all three hanging. The police conducted the panchanama and sent the bodies for postmortem to Goa Medical College and Hospital. The family refused to collect their bodies. When police tried to pressurise the family, they contacted the activists and asked the police to keep their bodies in the morgue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/three-die-by-suicide-in-zuarinagar-family-says-police-harassed-them/articleshow/83968819.cms||Ruvina Khan
---||Kochi||Kerala: Vlogger flouts protocol, visits Edamalakkudy sans permit||IDUKKI: Even as Edamalakkudy, the first tribal panchayat, continues to be Covid-free in the second wave, a vlogger illegally visited and shot videos of the tribespeople and tribal hamlet. Forest department has begun a probe into the incident. On Sunday, Idukki MP Dean Kuriakose and Youtuber Sujith Bhakthan conducted a trip and shot videos of the tribes and tribal hamlet. After the visit, Bhakthan posted the video on Youtube and the pictures on Facebook. According to Kuriakose, the trip was for the inauguration of a school at Edamalakudy and to distribute education equipment for online class at the hamlet that was sponsored by Bhakthan. Forest officials said that the Youtuber filmed videos inside the reserve forest without the department’s permission. AIYF Munnar unit president N Vimalraj filed a complaint at Munnar police station demanding action against Bhakthan. Munnar range officer Hareendra Kumar told TOI, “The MP sought permission to visit Edamalakudy. Before issuing the permit, we informed him that only a minimum number of people could visit. Bhakthan had not applied for permission for the visit or to shoot video. He visited Edamalakkudy and shot the video illegally. The probe is going on.” “Prior permission from the concerned DFO or wildlife warden is needed to shoot video in a reserve forest area. But Bhakthan had no such permission,” said a senior forest department official. Edmalakkudy panchayat secretary in charge Anish Kumar said that they had no information about the visit to the tribal hamlet. “The tribespeople in the hamlet were following self-isolation for several months to prevent Covid-19 spread. The district administration and panchayat are in support of the decision,” he said. Environmentalist and social worker M N Jayachandran told TOI that he will submit a complaint to the National ST commission demanding action against Bhakthan. “The Youtuber illegally entered the tribal hamlet and shot videos of tribespeople, including kids, without permission,” he said. CPM Idukki district secretary K K Jayachandran demanded strict action against Bhakthan. “The Youtuber used the tribes and tribal hamlets for commercial purposes. They travelled to Edmalakkudy in a forest department vehicle,” he said. Meanwhile, Kuriakose said that there is no need for controversy over the visit. “I invited Bhakthan, who sponsored equipment to the school,” he said . According to officials, several positive cases were reported in most tribal settlements in Idukki during Covid second wave but Edamalakkudy has no positive cases so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vlogger-flouts-protocol-visits-edamalakkudy-sans-permit/articleshow/83966568.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Ahmedabad||Speedster robs 3 kids of their mother||Ahmedabad: The screams of his parents and siblings tore through Rupesh Bhabhor’s sleep, and he woke up to complete mayhem. His mother was lying injured on the road while his father and two siblings were pinned under the wheels of a vehicle. A 22-year-old driver had run a speeding car over the family that was sleeping on the footpath near Shivranjani Crossroads. By the time help arrived, Rupesh had lost his mother. The Babhors — Babu (40), his wife Satu (38), his kids Rupesh (20), Vikram (7) and Jetan (5) — were fast asleep when Parv Shah, a resident of Mithakhali, ran over them. Witnesses say he was involved in a car chase when the accident occurred. According to an FIR filed by Rupesh with N Division traffic police, the impact flung Satu in the air. She crashed back onto the road. Locals called up 108 ambulance, but Satu, who suffered injuries on her head and legs, died by the time it arrived. The two kids were taken to Asarwa Civil hospital and Babu was admitted to Sola Civil hospital. Rupesh miraculously escaped unhurt. The family hails from Khajuria-Ambli village in Garbada taluka of Dahod. Parv and three others travelling in the car fled the spot after the accident, said the FIR. Interestingly, cops could not catch the accused. Instead, Parv appeared before them around 15 hours after the accident. He claimed he was chased by cops in a private sedan car. The city police neither accepted the claim nor rejected it. Parv, a commerce graduate from a college in Law Garden, works with a private garments firm run by his father’s friend. “His father, Shailesh Shah, is also in the business of selling women’s clothing. He has a younger sister,” said his relative. A team of traffic cops traced the address of the car owner and reached Parv’s house at Siddhgiri Flats in Mithakhali but the house was locked. Cops including DCP traffic Tejas Patel kept claiming that they were trying to nab the accused, but were clueless. Surprisingly, the accused along with his advocate, family members and relatives appeared at N division traffic police in Satellite later in the day, admitting that he had run over the footpath dwellers. However, he claimed the accident occurred because he lost control of the car as some cops were chasing him. The city traffic police though did not arrest him officially till late on Tuesday nor conducted a medical test to ascertain if he was drunk as claimed by some locals who witnessed the accident. The N division traffic police registered a case of negligent driving causing death against Parv and have began investigation. Accused comes up with police chase story, cops keep mum Ahmedabad: The accused, Parv Shah, when he appeared before police. confidently claimed that he was being chased by cops in a private vehicle when he was in the car with three others and was scared of being caught for violation of the curfew. He claims he then lost control during the ‘chase’ and ran over the pavement dwellers. “I and my friends Rishabh Shah, a resident of Siddhgiri Apartments in Mithakhali, Divya Shah, a resident of Soham Flats in Mithakhali, and Parth Shah, a resident of Vasupujya Flats in Paldi, were returning from near Thaltej Gurudwara to our houses and we saw a car with cops in it chasing us,” Parv Shah told reporters at N division police station. On what he was doing during curfew hours, he said, “I was on an outing with my friends. As it was raining, we decided to stay back in Thaltej for a while.” He claimed, “As the car with the cops overtook my car near Bimanagar, I tried to move my car to the left, I lost control over the steering and went on to the footpath.” A relative of Parv’s at N Division traffic police station said, “After the accident, Parv went to his house and then the family went to a relative’s house. They took advice from community members on what to do. As they were advised to have Parv surrender to the cops, we came here.” He added, “Parv told me the cops were in uniform and one of them banged a baton on Parv’s car after which he drove in speed and then met with the accident.” Lack of space at night shelter forced victims to road outside Ahmedabad: The negligence and lackadaisical attitude of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) may be held responsible for the accident in whcih a 38-year-old woman was killed just outside the night shelter near Shivranjani Crossroads. This is the same shelter for which a proposal to increase capacity has been pending with the AMC since August 2018. A source in the ren basera or night shelter run by the AMC, which is sub-contracted to an NGO, said, “We have a capacity of 30 persons here but 48 people, all of whom are from the tribal districts of Dahod and Chhota Udepur and are mainly into construction work, have been living here.” He further said, “We made a proposal for expanding the capacity of this night shelter to at least 60 persons by making more rooms on the first floor in 2018, when Vijay Nehra was AMC commissioner. No action was taken on the proposal and since then we have been struggling with people overflowing from the shelter.” He said that the number of users increase during the rains and the winter. A user of the night shelter who is also from Dahod like the victims, said, “Satuben used to meet me every day and told me that I was fortunate to be able to stay under a roof. If she and her family had been accommodated here, she would not have been killed.” Satu Bhabhor, who was killed in the accident on Tuesday, was supposed to be taken to another night shelter, near IIM-Ahmedabad, but they could not be registered there for some reason, said a source in the Shivranjani night shelter. Slept on traffic island first, rain pushed them to footpath Ahmedabad: The Bhabhor family slept on a traffic island a few metres away in the summer, for the benefit of the breeze, the only luxury of footpath dwellers. But on Monday night, as a drizzle began, they moved to the footpath under a tarpaulin shelter. The accident took place a few minutes later.A shop owner from Bimanagar said, “They used to buy milk from me every two or three days. On Monday night, I saw them resting on the traffic island, talking to each other.”After a drizzle started they shifted to the footpath where they usually stayed during the day to get out of the sun and also when it was raining, he said, adding, “I heard the sound of a vehicle braking and then a bang. I ran out of my shop, where I stay at night, and found that a car had run over them.” At the spot of the accident, there was a man’s scarf and an imitation silver anklet on the boundary wall. Next to that, was a torn packet of salt, a few green chilies and handful of flour, which may have been for their meal on Tuesday morning. Family returned to their village after accident Ahmedabad: Even though three members of the Bhabhor family were injured and admitted to different hospitals, they returned to their native place, Khajuria-Ambli village in Garbada taluka of Dahod district, said cops. “After the accident, Satu Bhahor’s body was sent for a postmortem to the Asarwa Civil hospital from where it was handed over to her family. The family decided to get the other victims discharged and took the body to their native place,” said a cop. A relative of the victims said, “Babu and his son Rupesh collected some money, hired a car and took the body to their native village for their last rites which is a tradition.” Other relatives said the family was too scared to stay here after Satu’s death. “They will not return to Ahmedabad after such a loss,” said a relative. The Bhabhor family had been living on the same footpath for 20 years, said another relative. Police delay arrest, blood test City police showed an exemplary lackadaisical approach to this case as they did not bother to do a blood test to ascertain whether Parv Shah was drunk, as claimed by some eyewitnesses. Some 15 hours after the accident, Parv Shah appeared before the cops and was made to sit in the chamber of the in-charge PI of N division traffic police station. But the cops did not have a blood test taken, which is necessary in such cases. They also did not bother to have a Covid-19 test done, which is compulsory in the present circumstances. ACP B B Bhagora of city traffic police said, “We have not officially arrested him as of now and he may be produced before court tomorrow.” Tejas Patel, DCP, city traffic (admin), also rushed to see the accused and was clueless about him having surrendered to police. On the question of drunk driving, both Bhagora and Patel said, “The investigation is going on.” Cops clueless about second speeding car City traffic police officers were clueless about the second car which was seen speeding alongside the accused’s car at the crime scene. The accused claimed that cops were in the other car, whereas eyewitnesses said that the driver of the other car was racing with the accused. DCP, city traffic (admin), Tejas Patel, said, “We are yet to get details of the other car and are not sure if the cops were in it. If the cops were in the car, why did they flee after the accident.” Police did not get the registration number of the other car, saying the CCTV footage from which they ascertained the accused’s car number was not clear enough. Took place under cops’ noses The incident took place when cops were patrolling the area, less than 100m away from a traffic police chowky. It happened between two police points during curfew hours. Despite this, cops could not track the accused and second car driver until the accused himself appeared before them. Two cars were allegedly racing on the 6.5km stretch from Iskcon Crossroads to Shivranjani Crossroads where the accident took place, but could not be captured on cameras or the cops deployed at various points turned a blind eye to their rash driving. Eyewitnesses’ account They were racing, says cab driver Sujal Thakkar, a cab driver who witnessed the accident, said that the incident took place because the accused was in a race with another car. “I was driving from Iskcon Crossroads towards Kalupur when I saw the two cars — a hatchback and a sedan — driving at speed and they overtook me near Jodhpur Crossroads in such a way that I could also have had an accident,” said Thakkar. He said when he came to Bimanagar, he saw that one of the cars, the hatchback, had run over footpath dwellers. “I saw the accused running away from there and then I found that the children and their father were under the wheels and the woman was unconscious,” he said. Thakkar got them out from under the car with help from others. Later, 108 paramedics declared the woman dead, he said. Thakkar said, “These car drivers were doing stunts and speeding like an action sequence of a movie.” Not the first accident on this road, another eyewitness Another eyewitness, Mansingh Ninama, said that this was not the first accident at this site and claimed to have witnessed many car races every night. “Earlier also, cars and motorcycles were seen racing in the area. We are scared with the sound of their exhausts, honking and screams. We usually wake up with their noise,” said Ninama while his wife Meena nodded in agreement. He further said, “In the wee hours of Tuesday, I heard the noise of something crashing into the footpath and then saw two men come out of the car and run towards Jhasi Ki Rani and two others ran towards Shivranjani.” Another car stopped for a few seconds and then sped off without bothering about the accident victims. “Rather than running from there, they should have taken them to a hospital. They could have helped the victim but they may have fled to save themselves from the public’s fury,” said Ninama, who said that after the accident he decided that he too would go back to to his native place in Dahod. PAST ACCIDENT CASES Labdhi Shah acquitted, got benefit of doubt Nineteen-year-old Labdhi Shah was accused of hitting three vehicles in the wee hours of January 1, 2012 with her car near Himalaya Mall. A motorcyclist named Gaurav Rajyaguru, 24, died in the accident. Shah was booked by Vastrapur police for rash driving and causing death by criminal negligence. Seven years later, on May 6, 2019, a court acquitted her by giving her the benefit of the doubt, because the court did not find concrete evidence to link her to the incident. The police had not furnished CCTV footage in court during the trial. Vismay Shah got five years in jail Vismay Shah has been punished with five years in jail for the 2013 Vastrapur hit-and-run case. He was held guilty of rash driving and hitting a scooter, killing two youths – Rahul Patel and Shivam Dave. Shah fled the spot and appeared before police after a couple of days. During his trial, he was refused bail for 13 months. His conviction has been upheld by the Supreme Court, which last year ordered him to surrender and serve the remainder of his sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/speedster-robs-3-kids-of-their-mother/articleshow/83968789.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan BJP to revamp its disciplinary committee to effectively check loudmouth leaders||JAIPUR: The state BJP is set to revamp its disciplinary committee to check anti-party voices. The existing committee’s silence on leaders making controversial statements, not in sync with the party line, has not gone down well with BJP national president Arun Singh. The state unit is set to serve notice of engaging in anti-party activities to three leaders, including an MLA, an ex-MLA and an ex-MP. The committee is headed by former Rajya Sabha member Omkar Singh Lakhawat who has been coming to the party office for a few months. “A view is emerging that for long anti-party activities are happening at the behest of senior leaders, while no action from the committee has only encouraged the situation to continue,” said a party source. TOI called Bhajan Lal Sharma, a member of the disciplinary committee for his comments, but he didn’t respond. Sharma had signed the notice served to former MLA Bansur Rohitash Sharma for his comments that the party didn’t do anything during Covid times. “The silence of the committee, which has the mandate to take action, has not reacted to Sharma’s statements after he was served notice,” said a party source. The disciplinary committee came to the focus after BJP national in-charge Arun Singh during his visit to Jaipur made a public statement that those making ‘uncalled’ statements and damaging the image of the party will face strict action. He said the disciplinary the committee was preparing a list of leaders who have not stopped despite being given reminders. “The names of leaders violating the code are known to all since they are very vocal in their uncalled statements. The state disciplinary committee is empowered to call out leaders whose action is causing damage to the party as per the party’s constitution but they have not used their powers,” said a party source. These leaders are considered close to Raje and primarily under the scanner for making statements projecting Raje as the mass leader in the state. Other leaders under the watch are MLA Chabbra Pratap Singh Singhvi, Former MLA Bhawani Singh Rajawat and former MP Bharatpur Bahadur Singh Koli. He was served notice for his comments on the party being inactive in the second wave of Covid. He, however, is among the leaders who are vocally batting for Raje as the only leader in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-bjp-to-revamp-its-disciplinary-committee-to-effectively-check-loudmouth-leaders/articleshow/83968628.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, hearing a PIL on Covid-19 management, was told by his advocate Milan Desai that Sood seeks to be heard. “We’ll hear him on the next occasion,” said the CJ. Sood’s application said after the second wave in April, there was a scramble for lifesaving medicines. “Therefore he decided to be a conduit between the two ie connecting the bona fide needy people with the places where the aforesaid drugs were available so that the latter can directly send the drugs to the needy patient,” his application stated. It added that it involved a two-stage process of requesting patients to submit documents such as Aadhar card, Covid report, doctor’s prescription and verification by contacting the hospitals. He denied purchasing or procuring medicines for trade, adding he “merely guided” the needy patients to the pharmacy where the medicines were available. Sood said the petitioner, Pune-based fi-lm producer Nilesh Navlakha, without making efforts to find out the truth had proceeded to make “false, baseless, reckless, defamatory allegations”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sood-says-he-was-conduit-denies-buying-meds-for-trade/articleshow/83970776.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Except for Jodhpur, where about 1,200 citizens received their first dose, the rest of the centres grappled with vaccine shortage. At 145 vaccination centres, boards proclaimed: ‘No Vaccine Available’. The ambitious aim of vaccinating 1 lakh Amdavadis a day seems like a pipe dream currently, with just 25,500 being vaccinated on Tuesday. Gujarat’s cities are indeed facing a jab scarcity. But more worrisome, a huge vaccine divide lay exposed in the state on Tuesday. In the tribal district of Dang, just 71 people were vaccinated on Tuesday at three centres. In districts like Valsad, Panchmahal, Gir-Somnath, Kutch, Gandhinagar, and Amreli a very small number of vaccination centres were open and a few hundred people were vaccinated. The bulk of the vaccines were being consumed by cities over past nine days, said senior health department officials. Surat citizens were better off with close to 36,000 getting vaccinated on Tuesday, the highest in the state. Irregular vaccine allocations is one of the primary reasons for short supply, officials said. In Ahmedabad, the number of vaccines made available was 12,000 on Saturday, 13,000 on Sunday, and 35,000 on Tuesday. Similar was the case with Rajkot, Vadodara, and Surat cities. “Vaccine availability will be lower in July as a large population in Gujarat has been vaccinated,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vax-populi-a-pipe-dream-ahmedabad-suffers/articleshow/83968691.cms||Paul John
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 300 Covid orphans to get educational funds, mental health care||MUMBAI: With more than 300 children in the state orphaned due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the department of women and child development (WCD) on Tuesday announced educational funding and mental health support for their well-being.  In association with non-profit groups, the department will take care of their academic fees for the next three years. That apart, access to mental health counsellors will be provided, particularly for adolescents. Losing both parents forced some of the orphans to move to their hometowns to live with extended families or change schools due to their guardian’s inability to afford fees. The WCD will transfer fees directly to the school or college where the child is enrolled. “We want to ensure that education is not disrupted and there is continuity,” said WCD minister Yashomati Thakur, adding in the next phase, the department will extend academic funding to children who have lost either parent to the pandemic. There are more than 9,800 such children in Maharashtra at present. A task force has been going door-to-door to identify children orphaned due to the pandemic to provide them assistance and shelter and ensure that there is no trafficking. WCD officers will prepare a report on each case which will include the child’s education status and requirements. “Relatives looking after orphans may be stretched at the moment and education may not be an immediate priority. We are looking at supporting other needs, besides academic fees, such as a tablet or a phone for accessing online education or a bicycle for transportation in rural areas,” said Shishir Joshi of NGO Project Mumbai that is jointly working with WCD. A monitoring team will be set up to periodically check if the child has been attending school or college and if he or she is facing any difficulties. An 11-year-old, taken in by her grandparents after her parents died of Covid, was worried about her future. WCD counsellors will be visiting such families and interacting with kids to look out for any signs that need intervention. The counsellors are being trained by the Indian Psychiatric Society. “We are also gathering details about Covid widows whose husbands were in debt. Our teams located two such widows in Thane. We will attempt to help them out,” said Mahendra Gaikwad, district WCD officer, Thane. Project Mumbai’s mental health helpline, started for civic schools, will extend to Covid-hit families. “We intend to rope in experts for child sexual abuse counselling as well,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-300-covid-orphans-to-get-edu-funds-mental-health-care/articleshow/83966570.cms||Nitasha Natu

Sources alleged 14 to 20 students are living in Aravali and DBN hostels on Rajasthan University campus. These students, who stay in nearby villages, have returned in order to resume studies. An RU student said, “There are some students who with the help of authorities have started staying in the hostels. Although girls’ hostels are shut down, some students who have good terms with the administration in the university are living without permission.” Varsity chief warden Rajesh Sharma refuted the claims. “There are no students living in the hostels. We are getting applications of students, but that is not possible to allow without the orders of the government. There are however, some students who have arrived to take their clothes or books back to their homes as they have been stuck there since pandemic. We have just allowed them, but no one is staying for the night.” Several complaints have also been received by the registrar of the university, K M Dhuria, regarding the staying of boys in the hostels. “I have received these complaints and I will look into the matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/students-illegally-staying-in-hostels-raj-varsity-denies/articleshow/83968663.cms||---

While many universities have given conditional offers based on semester marks, some students still need the final semester marks. “The exam schedule has been the primary concern since the whole process of studying abroad has already started. Every decision is coming down to the last minute because of the delay in exams,” said a VTU student who has an offer from University of Birmingham. “A lot of universities abroad are also not able to help because the schedule is not even out yet. Only the first internals have been conducted so far. There are two more to go in addition to seminars, project reports and internship reports.” Rama N, mother of a student who wants to pursue studies abroad, said: “Without the graduation certificate, admission confirmation and visa-processing becomes difficult. Visas take a long time now, even otherwise. With this delay, students will not be able to attend classes on time. Students who have taken education loan will suffer.” Firms extend joining dateManu (name changed) said: “I wanted to study in Australia. The classes were starting from July 26. I was unable to get documents on time. Now, I am joining University of Massachusetts, Lowell, where I have to submit them before the completion of first semester,” said Manu, who had applied for markscard extract on May 19. “This uncertainty and ambiguity may delay travel plans in a situation where huge amounts of money will have to be spent on flight charges and accommodation that run on first come, first served basis. We cannot proceed in these matters until our university provides a schedule,” he said. “Several companies have been considerate in extending their joining date. Some of them have also said they could give leave before the exams. But I have been requesting firms to extend the date as students will not be able to put in their best at work or in their exams,” said Savitha Rani M, head, training and placement department, at Ramaiah Institute of Technology. “Some have started working virtually. The firms had onboarded them as paid interns and after the exams, they will be taken as full-time staff,” said Usha Rani, placement officer at Cambridge Institute of Technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-exam-dates-vtu-students-say-time-running-out-at-foreign-univs/articleshow/83972604.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The court is hearing a petition filed by Domestic Workers Rights Union. The petitioner has contended that the May 28, 2021 order issued by the state government makes registration on the Seva Sindhu portal mandatory for getting Rs 2,000 benefit. The petition has said that such an insistence would disentitle a large number of eligible domestic workers from receiving the compensation. CJ: Labour dept should learn from legal authority reportThe service charges and commission fee were part of Karnataka State Legal Services Authority’s report on Seva Sindhu Kendras. A division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka noted that the detailed report should work as an eyeopener to the labour department. “The report details how difficult it is for workers to register themselves for getting a small amount of Rs 2,000. The procedure appears to be very cumbersome. It is such that a majority of eligible (workers) will be deprived of the benefit. In fact, the reports throw light on the manner in which registration of other category of the unorganised sector is being made in the Seva Sindhu portal,” the bench added. The report stated that it was learnt that during the June 28 visit of para-legal volunteers and the PRO of KSLSA BangaloreOne and an adjacent computer centre (Koramangala area) would charge Rs 100 to Rs 150, and Rs 100 to obtain gazetted officer’s signature required for submission of application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/250-fee-for-2k-aid-hc-summonsstate-labour-secy/articleshow/83972606.cms||---

In a few places in western Ahmedabad health officials were accompanied by police personnel to distribute vaccine tokens fearing a backlash. Meera Shah, a housewife from Ghatlodia’s Seher Society said that 75 people were asked to return home at her centre by noon as the civic health centre had run out of Covishield vials. “At Jodhpur’s Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation health centre five people were asked to return as a new vial consisting of 10 doses had to be opened and the rest would have gone waste. We were disappointed,” says Akash Sheth, a shopowner near Riddhi-Siddhi apartments in Jodhpur area. At the airport vaccination centre, 240 individuals including passengers and residents from nearby Sardarnagar area were vaccinated. Also, a second representation before the AMC’s municipal commissioner was made by industry associations of the city in Odhav, Narol, Vatva, and Naroda where factory owners had persuaded lakhs of daily wagers and workers to get vaccinated. With just 16,000 to 22,000 vaccines arriving daily, the AMC has not been able to fulfil the demand from these association members. “We had convinced some 65,000 workers in Narol and Naroda industrial clusters to get themselves and their families vaccinated,” an industry association member said. “Now we fear their interest may wane if we cause further delay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shortage-at-city-centres-hits-jab-for-all-campaign/articleshow/83968880.cms||---

Several villagers have called out block development officer, gram sewaks and sarpanchs to clarify on the order and expressed their anger. Later, in the day, Jaiswal clarified that the order means that they will be identified only to encourage and motivate them for vaccination. “The order never says they will be denied of the benefits if they are not vaccinated. It only means that once they will be identified we will approach them to for vaccination. The ration dealers will be trained to dispel their myth and counter misinformation related to the vaccines,” said Jaiswal, who said that vaccines can’t be the criteria for getting benefits of the schemes. Explaining the need of such an initiative, he said that Dholpur’s 60% population is covered under the social welfare schemes. “I see this as an opportunity to reach out to 60% of our population by utilising the available human resource,” said the collector. He said that so far 40% of the population has been vaccinated at least one of the doses. “My target is to vaccinate 90% of my district’s population.

The woman brought the drug from Mumbai to sell it in Ajmer. The market cost of the seized drug is around Rs 3 lakh. The accused woman’s husband and brother-in-law are in jail in Indore for trafficking drugs. Police are now trying to uncover the network of drug trafficking at work in the city. According to police, they got a tip-off that a woman was trying to sell drugs in Civil Lines area. Police reached the spot and nabbed the woman and seized the drug from her possession. The woman has been identified as Farzana (39), a resident of Lohakhan. Police claimed that during interrogation, the accused accepted that she brought the drug from Mumbai to then sell it in Ajmer. She was in need of money as her husband Razaak has been declared a history-sheeter and was arrested last year with his brother Khurshid. They were out on bail and then started drug trafficking again. Later this year in January, they were caught by Madhya Pradesh police with drugs and at present, they are both are in Indore Jail. There are 22 cases of drug trafficking registered against Razaak and Khurshid in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and also in Rajasthan. Police said that the accused accepted that after her husband and his brother were caught, she took on the charge of drug trafficking and brought Mephedrone from Mumbai in stock and was selling it in small packets, mostly to youngsters. Police are now working with their counterparts in Mumbai police to share the information received from the accused during interrogation and are probing the larger network at play in Ajmer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/woman-held-for-selling-narcotics-worth-around-rs-3l/articleshow/83968701.cms||---
---||Goa||United Goans Democratic Party questions Covid vaccine certificate for visitors||MARGAO: United Goans Democratic Party (UGDP) has lashed out at the state government for declaring that those entering Goa should produce the two-dose Covid-19 vaccine certificate or the RT-PCR negative certificate, saying that the government has displayed utter ignorance or has deliberately launched a misinformation or misleading campaign for promoting tourism, party president Dr Jorson Fernandes said. Fernandes said the the vaccine is not 100% efficacious, which means any one who has taken both the doses of the vaccine may bring the Delta Plus strain into Goa. “What has Delta Plus strain transmission got to do with two doses of vaccine,” he asked. He said that the decision is not in the interest of Goans but aimed at making it easy for tourists to come in. “Fully vaccinated people have a low risk of severe Covid-19, but surges in coronavirus cases could still impact their health in other ways,” Dr Jorson said. He said that with the spread of the Delta Plus variant, coronavirus cases could spike in parts of Goa, especially in areas with low vaccination rates and, still worse, Goa, being a touristic state, may become the hub for the variant. The strain, especially, could be able to adversely affect the healthcare system, something akin to what was observed in the second wave. That apart, children under 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination, and this leaves them at risk of illness, hospitalisation and other complications of coronavirus infection, Dr Jorson said. He said that there was need for strong enforcement of protocols, which call for an effective, professional working by the law enforcing agencies. More than the people, the government has lowered the guardand this is where the danger lies, Dr Jorson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ugdp-questions-covid-vax-cert-for-visitors/articleshow/83968715.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Vehicle pollution doubled in 5 years in Mumbai, shows study||MUMBAI: Tiny, deadly particles in Mumbai’s air from vehicular movement have nearly doubled over the past five years, making it the biggest contributor to the city’s already deteriorating air quality. A 2019-20 source estimation analysis for PM2.5 pollutants recently done by System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), under Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune, revealed that the share of PM2.5 emissions coming from the transport sector is 30.5% in 2019-20, compared to 16% it was in 2016-17. Air has suspended particulate matter (PM) of different sizes. Many are a complex mixture of dust, pollen, soot and smoke, and are hazardous. Of this, PM 2.5 is the smaller kind, with a diameter not more than 2.5 micrometers (fine particles).  The carcinogenic PM2.5 is considered to have a very significant health impact, as it can stay in the air for days or weeks, and is small enough to invade the lung airways. SAFAR said the contribution to PM2.5 emission in 2019-20 from industries and power units was 18%, which was 36% in 2016-17. Similarly, from municipal waste, the contribution is 21.5% in 2019-20; quantification of it was not available in 2016-17. Municipal waste contribution includes municipal solid waste (MSW) plants, MSW open burning, crematoriums, aviation sector, incense sticks and brick kilns. Interestingly, residential burning, which includes residential cooking in households and slums, trash burning, cow dung burning, emission from street vendors and wood burning has gone down to 15% in 2019-20, as against 27% in 2016-17. Pollution due to wind blown dust is 15% as against 21% earlier. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, Central for Science and Environment, said, “The city has not been able to leverage its overall public transport system in terms of metro and suburban rail to reduce dependence on private vehicles.” Dr Gufran Beig, senior scientist and founder project director, SAFAR, said that the change was a result of a combination of both increase in vehicles in Mumbai and more stagnation at traffic junctions, leading to congestion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vehicle-pollution-doubled-in-5-years-in-mumbai-shows-study/articleshow/83970799.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Some nations are exploring a booster dose against Covid with other vaccines. Similar research is being considered in India too, said ICMRNIV director Priya Abraham. Essentially, a booster shot, given after the first two doses of avaccine, may have to be given regularly (after a year or two, or later). A person receiving a booster will not have to repeat an entire two-dose schedule. Covaxin booster shot may work on coronavirus variants: ICMR-NIVAbraham said, “Covaxin could be more effective at tackling variants. It can play a useful role as a booster vaccine because both antibodies and cells of the immune system (mounted by Covaxin) are able to recognise and neutralise more proteins of the virus, apart from the spike protein.” Booster shots with a whole virus inactivated vaccine have proven to work well after two doses of any vaccine. “Inactivated vaccines, in general, can trigger a strong immune reaction, though it may not be the same as the immune response to live attenuated vaccines. So a person may need booster shots to ensure long-term protection,” Abraham said. Some companies, like the French pharma firm Valneva, have started to focus on developing booster shots. “Valneva’s inactivated vaccine, VLA2001, is part of a UK government-funded trial looking at seven different Covid booster vaccines. Covaxin can be considered as a booster dose as and when that becomes a recommendation in India and also in other countries,” Abraham said. One of Covaxin’s key selling points is its apparent ability to mount a broader immune response against the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, instead of just focusing on the spike protein. Various studies have found that the vaccine is effective against different Variants of Concern. “The hitherto identified and characterized variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Alpha, Beta and Delta) in India have been neutralized, though variably, by the antibodies in the sera from Covaxin recipients. This is because the whole virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines present to the immune system other proteins of the virus in addition to the spike protein, which helps to generate a broader immune response,” Abraham said. She added, “The adjuvant (algel-IMDG) in Covaxin also stimulates a good antibody as well as a cell-mediated immune response.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covaxin-booster-shot-may-work-on-variants-icmr-niv/articleshow/83968729.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: AAP will end free units for Dalits, BCs, allege Akalis||CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has alleged that far from giving any relief to the common man through subsidised power, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would even do away with the 200 units per month free power provided to the poor, including scheduled castes and backward classes, if elected to power in Punjab. After a press conference by AAP convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday, SAD’s Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljit Singh Cheema said he had clearly admitted that the party’s promise of 300 free units per bill cycle would only be applicable in case the consumption was less than 300 units. “This amounts to playing a cruel joke on Punjabis as a majority of them will not be eligible for any benefit under this scheme,” said the SAD leaders. They said the poor and disadvantaged would lose out on the 200 unit free power facility “that was introduced by former CM Parkash Singh Badal” and was applicable without any conditions. Stating that Kejriwal was trying to introduce a flop model which had already failed in Delhi, Majithia presented power bills of Delhi consumers which showed that they were charged Rs 5.30 per unit for bills slightly above 200 units and not extended any benefit of subsidised power. “Similarly, power tariff of shops and the domestic sector in Delhi, which constitute the lion’s share, is extremely high,” said the SAD leaders. Suggesting that Kejriwal had been wrongly briefed by his team, Majithia said the former was tom-tomming Rs 6,500 crore power subsidised in Delhi in six years forgetting that the free power facility extended to farmers in Punjab by Badal had given them a benefit of Rs 90,000 crore. Cheema said the Delhi CM had landed in Punjab after 4.5 years to befool people in the 2022 elections. “Earlier too, Kejriwal tried to hoodwink Punjabis by raising the issue of drug trafficking and sacrilege,” he added. “Punjabis will now hold Kejriwal accountable for raising the issue of sacrilege by patronising former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap, who was indicted by the high court for conducting a politically-motivated probe into the Kotkapura firing incident. The AAP convener had taken divergent views on the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal by stating that it should not be constructed when speaking in Punjab even as he went on to demand its construction when he returned back to Delhi or even went to Haryana,” Cheema pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-will-end-free-units-for-dalits-bcs-allege-akalis/articleshow/83968709.cms||---

The state set a record by administering 11.6 lakh doses on June 21. In Bengaluru, BBMP administered 1.74 lakh doses, of which 1.64 lakh were the first jab. However, there was a sharp decline the next day with state and city recording 3.95 lakh and 43,901 doses respectively. While the drive saw a downtrend since then, the total number of doses administered in the state was 1.24 lakh doses on June 27 before rising to 3.4 lakh on Tuesday (June 29). With supply dwindling, the number of vaccine centres in Karnataka has come down from 5,700 on June 21 to 4,528 on Tuesday. ‘Need to ensure 3 lakh people get jabbed daily’The supply was adequate till last Friday when we inoculated 9,500 people. Now, the doses are rationed and we’ve been asked to limit it to 200 doses per day although people are queuing up,” said an official at the Vani Vilas centre in Bengaluru. This centre was given 400 doses once in two days after last Saturday but the stock dried up on Tuesday. “We’ve been told fresh stocks will arrive on Wednesday morning,” he added. The official said the government’s priority to vaccinate teachers and non-teaching staff ahead of SSLC exams is taking away a major chunk. Dr Sudarshan, nodal officer for vaccination in BBMP limits, said the agency which covers 640 centres, gets 40,000 doses once in two days and it has 36,000 doses of Covishield and Covaxin (90:10). “We have to ensure at least 3 lakh people are inoculated every day, including 1 lakh in Bengaluru, if we want to minimise the third wave’s impact,” said a member of the taskforce. Health minister K Sudhakar will request Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in New Delhi on Monday to increase vaccination allocation for Karnataka. “We have a stock of 5 lakh doses and the next consignment will arrive shortly. We’re maintaining a daily average of inoculating 2-3 lakh people daily. The stock has never dried up,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/supply-hit-vax-drive-slows-in-ktaka-after-yoga-day-record/articleshow/83972614.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||India||Kejriwal’s Punjab poll promise: 300 units of free power, dues waiver||CHANDIGARH: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday promised 300 units of free electricity - 100 units more than what his government provides to every family in Delhi - to all domestic consumers in Punjab if his party wins the next assembly elections. He also promised waiver of electricity bill dues and uninterrupted power supply. "This is Kejriwal's guarantee, and not Captain's (Punjab CM Amarinder Singh) promises," he said at a press conference here. However, AAP later clarified that its promise will not apply to general category people who consume more than 300 units a month. In such cases, all the units will be chargeable. Other beneficiaries like SCs, BCs, BPL families and freedom fighters will be exempted from this rule and will have to pay for only units in excess of 300. Punjab minister Charanjit Singh Channi accused Kejriwal of stealing Congress's idea of offering free power, which the former said had been conveyed by the party high command to Amarinder as part of the 18 points of public welfare initiatives to be launched before the next assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kejriwals-punjab-poll-promise-300-units-of-free-power-dues-waiver/articleshow/83972599.cms||---

---||Kanpur||SGPGIMS, IIT-Kanpur sign MoU, set to nurture smart healthcare||KANPUR: Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow and IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday signed an MoU to advance innovation in accessible healthcare through indigenous solutions. Under the MoU, the institutes will set up a centre of excellence in telemedicine and healthcare robotics to nurture smart healthcare with an overarching objective of strengthening healthcare systems. The MoU was signed by Prof. R. K. Dhiman, director, SGPGI and Prof. Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT-Kanpur. Professor Karandikar said, “Through this initiative, two leading institutions of the country will join hands to uphold their vision of a robust, indigenous healthcare system, focused on promoting interdisciplinary innovation. The MoU is a timely step in the right direction to enable an exchange of ideas across engineering and medicine, as professionals from IIT-Kanpur will receive the opportunity to collaborate with specialized doctors at SGPGIMS, Lucknow.” Through this MoU, IIT-Kanpur and SGPGIMS have agreed to establish an R&D set up for promoting telemedicine aided by information and communication technologies (ICT) and 5G, and point-of-care testing and diagnostics. An integrated network of mobile health vans in rural areas and smart kiosks in urban locales will ensure last-mile connectivity to ascertain availability of emergency healthcare services. Commenting on the initiative’s vision, Prof. Dhiman said, “We will jointly launch courses in various fields of digital health which are not available in any engineering and medical educational institutions in the country at the moment. Current Corona pandemic has made telemedicine technology very popular and useful tool to bridge the gap between care providers and citizens so there is a need to develop indigenous technology platforms and systems on a large scale which can be affordable and made available widely.” “This will promote entrepreneurship and develop a rural health system which can be deployed far and wide to strengthen the health system. The future holds the key for a hybrid healthcare system for which the bond between engineering and medical discipline needs to be strengthened. In that context the timing of handshake between the two major institutions is appropriate which is going to yield immense benefit to the society,” he added. A telemedicine system is about creating a network of expected beneficiaries and medical experts and integrating them together in a digital platform. A cost-effective platform consisting of hardware sensors and IOT controller devices needs to be developed for collecting patient health data. The system has to be integrated with cloud servers and mobile apps. In this regard, the role of IIT -Kanpur will include development of such portable IoT enabled health care systems along with point-of-care testing and diagnostics, designing customized mobile vans and kiosks equipped with AI-based diagnostics, integrating multi-lingual avatars with systems to give patients the feel of the presence of a doctor or a caregiver. The avatars would especially be essential for patients with mental health disorders and elderly care. SGPGIMS had set up the School of Telemedicine & Biomedical Informatics in the year 2006 with the objective of teaching and training healthcare personnel and clinical engineers tools and strategies of ICT-enabled health care. It has received a major grant-in-aid from ministry of electronics & IT, government of India in 2007 to elevate the school to a national resource centre in telemedicine & biomedical informatics which was continued for five years. Later, from the year 2007 till date the facility and trained technical human power has been supported by the ministry of health & family welfare, government of India to develop and manage the National Medical College Network as the national resource centre. With the collaboration with IIT-Kanpur and the Centre of Excellence, the engineering aspects of clinical application of digital technologies can be addressed. Backed with two decades of experience in application-oriented telemedicine research, development, and deployment, SGPGIMS’s collaboration with IIT- Kanpur will foster synergies to cultivate an ecosystem at the intersection of technology and healthcare through capacity development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sgpgims-iit-kanpur-sign-mou-set-to-nurture-smart-healthcare/articleshow/83968745.cms||---

For this, it is necessary to get a maximum number of Corona tests conducted and contacts traced, so that each patient can be immediately identified, isolated and treated. There should be no laxity in this task. Chouhan said that Madhya Pradesh is ranked 32nd among all the states and union territories of the country in terms of Corona infection. The infection is at the lowest level, but we cannot afford to be careless. We must adopt Covid Appropriate Behaviour and strictly adhere to Corona protocol. He further said that vaccination is going on at a fast pace in Madhya Pradesh under the Vaccination mega campaign. Madhya Pradesh ranks fourth in the country in terms of vaccination. As much as 33% of the 18 + population in the state have been vaccinated, while 40 percent in this category have been vaccinated in Gujarat and Rajasthan and 38 percent of eligible persons in Karnataka. The chief minister was reviewing the status of Coronavirus pandemic and vaccination work in the state through video conferencing in Mantralaya. Chouhan instructed that Corona tests should not be reduced in any district of the state. Instructions were issued to increase testing in Alirajpur, Vidisha, Gwalior, Dewas, Sehore, Raisen, Dhar, Tikamgarh, Rajgarh and Barwani districts. Chouhan further said that 712 patients of black fungus are still undergoing treatment in the state. Special attention should be paid to their treatment. Ensure availability of ‘Amphotericin-B’' injections and other medicines for their treatment. Under the ongoing vaccination campaign in the state, 17 lakh 42 thousand people have been vaccinated in the state on 21 June, 11 lakh 6 thousand on 23 June and 10 lakh 10 thousand persons on 26 June. On June 24, 7 lakh 06 thousand people were vaccinated and on June 28, 4 lakh 65 thousand persons were vaccinated. No new case of Corona has been reported in 37 out of 52 districts in the state.

They also demanded a high level probe into the delay in levying of the fees, causing a revenue loss to the BMC. Times ViewThe fire brigade should have collected fire service and annual fees regularly since 2014. At a time when residents are battling the pandemic, collecting it retrospectively will put a huge burden on housing societies and residents. At the same time, it is important to recover the amount meant for strengthening fire-fighting infrastructure. The BMC must conduct a probe and fix responsibility on officers who caused the delay.Meanwhile, the fire brigade has said the total outstanding fire service and annual fees pending since 2014 till 2021 will be recovered from builders alone. Housing societies will only have to pay the annual fees from 2021. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking him to stay the decision. “This is a Rs 5,000 crore scam since the BMC and the state government have lost revenue. But we will not allow the BMC to loot the common man. No charges should be levied on residents. The municipal commissioner is not fixing the responsibility on fire brigade officials. There must be a probe by the central vigilance commission (CVC) and an FIR must be filed with the economic offences wing (EOW) of Mumbai police,” Mishra said. On June 7, the fire brigade had issued a circular to recover the one-time fire service fee and annual fee from builders and housing societies retrospectively since 2014. Last month, municipal commissioner I S Chahal sanctioned the recovery of the amount and the fire brigade will soon begin issuing notices to builders and housing societies for the purpose. Officials said the fire service fee is calculated at Rs 10 per square metre for all buildings. The annual fee is 1% per year of the total fire service fee. BJP MLA Ameet Satam wrote to Chahal demanding a CID enquiry, adding no amount should be recovered from housing societies. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said, “We shall oppose this move of the BMC. With over Rs 80,000 crore unspent taxpayers’ money kept in deposits, the BMC has no right to levy new taxes or cess in the pandemic.” A senior fire brigade official said the amount to be recovered was not as high as Rs 1,400 crore. “We are collecting the data and will calculate the total fire service fee based on the gross builtup area of all buildings that were given an OC after 2014. Then we will calculate the fees. The total fire fee outstanding will be recovered from builders. Residents will only have to pay the fee from July 20121 with property tax.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-stay-retro-recovery-of-fire-service-fees-probe-revenue-loss-says-netas/articleshow/83966634.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No case for cruelty, HC tells man residing in city who filed for divorce from Canadian wife||Mumbai: Bombay high court last week refused to interfere in the dismissal by a Bandra family court of a husband’s divorce petition holding that he had not even made out a case of cruelty or desertion against his wife, who is an overseas citizen of Canada. Both are dual citizens of India and Canada but he resides in Mumbai now. Their minor son lives with the mother in Canada. They had married in 2004 in Mumbai, He had in 2016 sought divorce on grounds of ‘willful desertion’ by wife. His case was that when he went to visit her and his child in 2013 he was not ‘well received’ and in 2015 he was treated with ‘mental cruelty’, so he filed for divorce on grounds of cruelty by desertion. The HC observed that the wife’s desire to settle in Canada was actuated by the fact that it was the husband “who had first consciously decided to settle abroad. As such, the wish of the respondent cannot be branded as an act of selfishness or the act on her part cannot be said to be unjustified’’. The couple had mutually decided to shift to Canada forever for better prospects, the HC noted. The HC found the husband’s evidence “quite vague insufficient’’ and said no way could it be said that wife meted cruelty by deserting him. The HC bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and P K Chavan on June 24 said he made out no case to interfere with the family court order and added, “We hope that there is still scope for the couple to restore the bond, at least for the sake of their child”, as “it would be very difficult to construe that the marriage… has deteriorated to such an extent that it would be impossible to unite the couple’’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-case-for-cruelty-hc-tells-man-residing-in-city-who-filed-for-divorce-from-canadian-wife/articleshow/83969006.cms||---

Locals of the area, who visited the gaushala found that there were more than 1000 animals in the gaushala, out of which six were found dead while 12 have fallen ill. Subsequently, they brought the matter to the knowledge of senior district authorities and asked them to constitute a team of veterinary doctors to inspect the gaushala and conduct post-mortem of the dead cows to ascertain the cause of their death. “We have come to know about the incident. The district veterinary officer has been asked to inspect the gaushala and submit his report. The cause of death of the cows is being ascertained”, said SDM Sadar Siddarth. The gaushala is run by the management of Sankat Mochan Balaji temple. The people working in the gaushala said the animals are dying due to shortage of food. Manager of Sankat Mochan Balaji temple Manish Yadav Patre blamed the authorities for not releasing funds for the cows. “There are more than 1000 cows in the gaushala. We have not received funds from the block development office. We informed the authorities in February itself about shortage of funds but to avail,” Patre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/six-cows-die-12-fall-ill-in-gaushala/articleshow/83968817.cms||---

These associations, mostly from south Delhi, including Chhatarpur Enclave, Green Park, Hauz Khas, Mayfair Gardens and Navjiwan Vihar, have together prepared a list of 215 such people so far. Most of these people are either domestic workers or the underprivileged who don’t have an Aadhaar or voter ID card. “We created a Google form, got names of such people and took Aadhaar details of their employers/relatives for reference. After compiling data in an Excel sheet, we contacted the district magistrate, south, Nidhi Sarohe. She directed us to contact nodal officer Dr Ranga Rajan who later coordinated with the district immunisation officer for the drive,” said Ruby Makhija, secretary, Navjiwan Vihar RWA. On Monday, 60 people were vaccinated for free and most of them were administered the first dose of Covishield. To help people such as saints, beggars, homeless, etc who do not have any of the seven prescribed identity cards like Aadhar, voter ID, passport, driving licence, PAN card, NPR smart card and pension document with photograph, or mobile numbers, Delhi government has started a special vaccination drive recently as per the Centre’s guidelines.  It has been decided that a district task force will be formed in each district and a nodal officer designated to prepare vaccination plans, identification of centres, registration on CoWin app (without capturing mobile number) and extending facilities to needy people. “On June 28, we had our first vaccination session in the district. We kept a target of 100, but 60 turned up. We are looking forward to more RWAs coming forward and performing the role of ‘key coordinator’. We use the details of ‘key coordinators’ to enrol such needy people on the CoWin app. The messages for their vaccination are forwarded on the coordinators’ number. We have also mapped the beggars in the area and will soon start the vaccination drive for them,” said an official from the south district office. The next vaccination session for remaining registered people will take place on July 5. “We only asked for birth proof (to ensure that the person’s age is above 18 years) but in some cases, people were facing problems in providing that also. We are looking for a solution for this,” said Vani Aggarwal, secretary, Chhatarpur Enclave who was also present at the vaccination site to ensure that the entire process goes smoothly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rwas-districts-join-hands-to-help-those-without-id-cards-get-vaxed/articleshow/83968843.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Tourist guides find no succour in Sitharaman’s relief package||JAIPUR: It seems finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s relief package for tourist guides does not have many takers. Tourist guides in the state said the relief in the form of loans would further burden them and as such they don’t have any income and cannot repay the amount. Jitendra Shekhawat, president of Federation of Tourist Guides, Jaipur, said despite the tourism sector taking the maximum hit due to the pandemic, the Centre ignored them in the previous Atmanirbhar packages and when it finally announced it on Monday, there was nothing for them. “What we wanted is some direct benefits, not loans. How can we repay the loans when we don’t have income? The foreign tourists are not going to come anytime soon. There is a big uncertainty about global tourist movement. So, we will not have any income at least for a year. That’s why the relief announced is as good as no relief,” said Shekhawat. Similar sentiment was expressed by others. They said if the Centre wanted to give only loans, no grants or direct support, then they should have made the loan interest free. “If loans were the only thing that the government could afford, then they should have made it interest-free. Secondly, the banking system is such that if you apply for a loan, they come up with several reasons to deny you the loan. The workings of the banks and the government announcements hardly run in tandem. That’s why the loan promise if a false hope,” said Anurag Sharma, a tourist guide, registered with ministry of tourism. While the finance minister said that 10,700 tourist guides, both regional level tourist guides recognised by Ministry of Tourism and those by the state governments, would be eligible for Rs 1 lakh, about 1,000 Travel and Tourism Stakeholders (TTS) or tour operators, can take loans up to Rs 10 lakh. Sanjay Kaushik, a representative of the tour operators association, said that the announcements will not have much impact on tourism. “While the exemption of visa fee for 5 lakh international travelers creates a good vibe, the material impact of the announcements will not bring any relief to the stakeholders of the industry. Given that the tourism sector suffered the most due to the pandemic, more could have done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tourist-guides-find-no-succour-in-sitharamans-relief-package/articleshow/83968824.cms||---

Police reached the killer and one accomplice after the picture of the woman was found in the dead man’s pocket. Police have detained the accomplice as well. Superintendent of police Dharamveer Singh said, “The body found with a gunshot wound in Khatapur village on June 26 was identified to be of one Rajveer Singh, a resident of the same village. He was a milkman by profession. Police had registered a case under relevant sections against unidentified assailants based on a complaint filed by the deceased’s wife.” During inspection of the spot, police found the deceased’s wallet which had his Aadhaar card, some money, the picture of a girl and an empty box of a newly purchased jewellery item. The probing team identified the girl to be a resident of Mukarpur Gadai, a village from where the deceased, Rajveer, collected milk. It was later found that the milkman had fallen in love with the girl. When the police questioned the girl’s 16-year-old brother, he spilled the beans on how he along with his friends had hatched a plan to eliminate him over his sister’s illicit relationship with Rajveer. He told the policemen he felt insulted as his friends used to taunt him over their relationship. According to the police, on June 25, one of the minor’s accomplices had spotted the milkman stepping out of the girl's house. That day, Rajveer had gifted a gold chain to the girl. He kept its box in his pocket which was later found by the police. The 16-year-old along with one of his relatives and a friend waylaid Rajveer near a field on June 26 morning and shot him dead, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/photo-of-a-girl-18-found-in-pocket-of-murdered-man-helps-up-cops-reach-culprit-girls-brother-16/articleshow/83964491.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Kiran Kumar admits to multiple assaults||KOLLAM: Kiran Kumar, husband of Vismaya who was found dead at the former’s house at Poruvazhi in the district on June 21, admitted to the investigation officers that he had subjected her to physical and mental torture before and after marriage. The probe team led by Sasthamcotta DSP P Rajkumar took Kiran to his house for collecting evidence and recording his statement on Tuesday. He told the investigators that he had physically assaulted her five times after the marriage. But he told them that he hadn’t beaten her up on June 21 night. Kiran is trying to portray his brutal behaviour towards Vismaya as the fallout of his drinking habit. But police will seek psychologists’ opinion about this change in behaviour. The police team also conducted a dummy test inside the toilet of Kiran’s house and asked him to show how he broke open the toilet to save her. Police recorded these visuals in the camera. Forensic experts also examined the spot. On Tuesday morning, investigators checked the bank locker at SBI Sasthannada branch and seized 42 sovereigns of gold. Bank officials said both Kiran and Vismaya came together one week after their marriage to keep the gold there. Thereafter, the locker had not been opened. According to police sources, Kiran has admitted to the police that he had assaulted Vismaya even on the street and at the Ayurveda College at Pandalam where she was studying for BAMS. Once, while going to his house at Sasthannada, Poruvazhi, from Kollam he had broken the windshield of the car as he was not satisfied with the car’s performance. On the same night he assaulted Vismaya inside the car. As the assault was intolerable to her she managed to escape from the car when the car slowed down. As she sought shelter in a nearby house of one Aldrian, a home guard, Kiran followed her to this house. When people in the neighbouring houses gathered there, he left the place leaving the car and Vismaya there itself. Police said Kiran used to assault Vismaya citing the car and dowry whenever he took Vismaya out in the car. Police said three days were not enough to complete the evidence gathering and police custody for two more days would be sought. They plan to interrogate Kiran along with his parents, sister, brother-in-law and friends. His close friends, including some of the assistant motor vehicle inspectors at Kollam RTO, also would be summoned for interrogation. Police doubt that some of these friends had mocked Kiran saying that the car he had received was not a top brand. This must have hurt his ego and he had unleashed assault on Vismaya. As confusion is prevailing on the death of Vismaya, the doctors who conducted the postmortem also visited Kiran’s house to ascertain whether it was a murder. Police doubt whether it would be possible for Vismaya who had 166cm height to hang on an iron bar at a height of 185cm. A conclusion on whether it was a case of murder or suicide could be arrived at only after the medical team’s report is made available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kiran-admits-to-multiple-assaults/articleshow/83966680.cms||---

It is given according to weight of the child. My son weighs 15kg and his treatment will cost around Rs 65 lakh per year,” said Rafiq. He is not the only parent, but there are others who are running from pillar to post to seek help for the treatment. They wrote to CM, “We wanted to bring to your attention the current health condition of several eligible patients, who have been awaiting institutional support from the state government for a long time. Despite assurances from the state that budgetary provision would be made to support these young patients, lack of any decision has put their lives at risk.” At least two out of the 10 children, who had sought the state’s help, passed away last year while awaiting support from the government. Nine out of these 10 patients – all in the age group of 1.5 to 10 years – have been diagnosed with Gaucher disease, which is a serious inherited, chronic, debilitating condition, caused due to a build-up of certain fatty substances in certain organs, particularly the spleen and liver. Patients with this rare condition require long term, specialised treatments and management through Enzyme Replacement Therapy. An auto-driver in Churu, Jamil’s six-year-old son is also suffering from Gaucher. “I lost my daughter, who was suffering from Gaucher and now my son has the same disease. My son requires Rs 50 lakh yearly and as he gains the weight, his cost of treatment will further increase. At individual level, it is difficult to arrange the cost of treatment, which is why, we need govern ment support,” said Jamil. The parents of these children explored all possible options seeking treatment, but to no avail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parents-seek-cms-help-for-treating-ailing-kids/articleshow/83968935.cms||---

Police said Banne Singh was sleeping on a bed outside his house near Bagichi Mohalla when shortly after 4am an unidentified man attacked him. Singh woke up bleeding profusely and found himself confronting the killer. According to police, Singh sprung out of his bed and scaled a wall to evade the killer. Though he cried for help but soon collapsed due to excessive bleeding. His family members woke up and frantically dashed outside but by that time the assailant had fled. “Singh was already dead by the time we arrived. An ambulance was called and FSL teams collected samples from the spot,” said a senior police officer. Police said that Singh worked as a labourer and preferred to sleep outside in the summer.  “The killer attacked him between 3am and 4am. We have spoken to family members to enquire if they suspect someone,” an official said. Singh’s body was taken to the mortuary at a local hospital and handed over to family members after post-mortem for cremation. Alwar police have not ruled out crime for gain, but prima facie evidence indicate a grudge may have been the prime motive behind the brutal killing. “It appears to be some kind of revenge killing. We are probing other angles too,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-kills-labourer-by-slitting-throat-hunt-on-for-accused/articleshow/83968862.cms||---

The counterfeit painkillers and antibiotics, mostly made of chalk, were being passed off as branded firm medicines. According to sources in FSDA, they had been working on the racket for quite some time. On June 21, two men were arrested with fake drugs in Kanpur who gave clues about its manufacturing in Muzaffarnagar. On Monday night, a surprise raid in Muzaffarnagar’s Mandi police station area led to the seizure of machines and drugs worth Rs 70 lakh. Another raid in Baghpat led to the arrest of a man, Surender, who was involved in the packaging of these fake drugs. At least six men have been arrested by UP STF so far. Love Kush, FSDA’s drug inspector, said, “Investigation is on. Several other members of this gang are yet to be arrested.” The FSDA official said that after the Kanpur’s arrests, an operation across western Uttar Pradesh was launched.

The incident happened on November 7 when her father had gone to Rajasthan leaving the girl and her mother at home. The suspended officials are former Kumily sub-inspector and present Kaladi sub-inspector Prasanth P Nair, grade sub-inspectors Bertin Jose and Akbar Sadath of Kumily police station. The special branch had given a report on the lapses on the part of the officers. The report said that the girl was found hanging inside the home and the postmortem report revealed that the girl was sexually abused. Though the police had booked a Pocso case, they failed to include the mobile phone of the girl which was recovered from the room as evidence. Then Kattappana DSP also conducted a probe and submitted a report to the Ernakulam range IG, based on which the action has been initiated against the officers. As the family members knew only Guajarati, police found it difficult to collect the details. After the incident the family had left to Rajasthan and returned to Kumily recently. Kumily SHO Sajeev Kumar said that the suspension of the officers was due to the lapses on their part. “Now, the district crime branch unit is probing the case,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/3-cops-suspended-for-lapses-in-probe/articleshow/83966690.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Lockdown gave Earth its own ‘quiet moment’: Gujarat geologists||AHMEDABAD: When the hubbub of human life was silenced by lockdown, Gujarat geologists could measure the earth’s seismic voice dropping into a calm hum — the planet was enjoying its very own “quiet moment”. The geologists from the Institute of Seismic Research in Gandhinagar measured the earth’s whir between March 25 and May 7, 2020, when Covid had shut down everyday life. The geologists tracked the sound with seismometers planted deep inside the earth at 12 locations. The ISR noted 79% to 87% drop in seismic noise levels around ceramic factories of Morbi and a fall of 27% to 79% in urban areas. There was a 29% to 35% drop in noise levels in the populated zones of rural areas and a 7% to 18% slide in remotely located seismic stations in the state. The ISR and the National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, recorded an overall lowering of 1 to 19 decibels in noise levels across the state. The reduction was recorded mainly in Kutch, Saurashtra, South Gujarat, and the mainland Gujarat region. This measurements were made possible by the drastic curtailment of the sources of human bustle such as factories, transport, machinery, mining explosions, and construction. These factors are usually responsible for high-frequency vibrations that contribute to a background buzz or noise inside earth. “We have considered the median human activity related background noise values in the frequency range of 5-15 hertz to depict the change in the anthropogenic seismic noise levels during the lockdown period across 12 stations in Gujarat,” said the research paper. ‘Anthropogenic’ means originating in human activity. The paper was published in the April edition of ‘Nature’ and has been authored by ISR’s Ketan Roy, Jyoti Sharma, and Santosh Kumar. M Ravi Kumar was the co-author from the NGRI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lockdown-softened-the-earths-whir-to-a-whisper/articleshow/83968980.cms||---

Out of these 312 villages declared as flood-prone, 25 are critically endangered as they are directly on the banks of the Ganga. People living in these villages fear that the river may one day swallow their entire land, rendering them landless. In the absence of proper flood control measures due to paucity of funds, villagers have to fend for themselves. Talking to TOI, a villager, Shravan Kumar, said, “We dread the monsoon. Earlier, the Ganga was the source of our prosperity bestowing our land with fertile soil. But over the past few years, it has changed its course, wreaking havoc on our villages, eroding our agricultural land and destroying standing crops worth crores. By changing its course every year, it has already destroyed around six villages in the Khadar area.” To curb the massive devastation, the villagers have been pleading with the authorities for building permanent embankments along Ganga from Kanav Ashram to Balawali, where the river enters UP, but their pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears. What is worse is that several existing bunds have not been repaired. The grim situation can be gauged by the fact that besides the Ganga, Bijnor is criss-crossed by several of its tributaries like Malan, Baan, Nakata, Gangan, Banaili, Chhoiya, Kho, Ramganga, Pili and Feeka, that turn into raging rivers during the monsoon. On its part, the administration has already sounded the flood alert following a warning by the Kalagarh dam authorities in Uttarakhand. Recently, the Ganga had crossed the danger mark before receding. But at the ground level, precious little has been done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/monsoon-brings-no-cheer-to-people-of-312-villages-along-river-banks-in-bijnor/articleshow/83964496.cms||Harveer Dabas

This was announced by divisional commissioner Ajay Shankar Pandey. Talking to TOI, the commissioner said the decision would help in warding off dirt and filth that is visible all over the city due to a network of open drains which are also a source of many diseases. The covered big drains would be converted as green belts or be used as parking slots, he said.  He asked the officials to carry out all the scheduled works under the smart city project within the stipulated time and budget. “As Jhanas is being made a small city project, the officials concerned should start a project for e-profiling of all the patients coming to the district hospital which will help in keeping records of the patients and also help in tracking them”, he said. The other issues discussed in the meeting included constructing an elevated corridor at Gwalior Road Railway crossing, latest processing plant for garbage disposal, a hockey museum in the memory of late Major Dhyanchand, a multi-level parking, a cancer hospital and a blind school. The commissioner asked the officials to appoint a nodal officer for each project, who will be reviewing the progress of the works on a regular basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/jhansi-to-be-made-a-city-free-from-open-drains/articleshow/83968933.cms||---

Mucormycosis which affects sinuses, lungs, eyes, skin and brain, now requires help from dental surgeons too. Losing teeth and perforation in palatal region, with discolouration has been found in many patients. “Medically speaking, the blood supply of the facial bone is cut off in such cases. In turn, it leads to hampering of basic body movements. In extreme cases, it can cause regurgitation of food too,” said HoD dental surgery, GMC, Dr Anuj Bhargava. “In the last few days, many patients who had previously undergone surgery and got discharged have returned for treatment. Some of them are now reporting involvement of upper jaw and palatal lesion. It was not something common previously,” said HoD, ENT, head and neck Surgery, GMC, Dr Smita Soni. Other infections are also affecting these immunocompromised patients. A systematic review and line of treatment that involves removing of palatal maxilla or bone, has been done on a few patients. Lifelong cosmetic issues may also have to be addressed by medical experts. The age of affected ranges from 30 - 65-year-old diabetic who underwent successful surgery on Monday. Mucormycosis is an uncommon yet serious infection that complicates the course of severe Covid-19 infection. Patients with diabetes and multiple risk factors are considered to be at a higher risk for this infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/post-discharge-black-fungus-patients-return-to-hospitals-with-dented-upper-jaw-palatal-lesion/articleshow/83964495.cms||Jamal Ayub

The decision of the government to approve setting up of five new TSDF sites in different geographical areas is likely to help in reducing the cost incurred by industries in handling of hazardous waste. There were seven such TSDF sites in operation, which have either crossed their optimum capacity or will reach saturation level in the next 3-6 months. On the basis of recommendation by a technical advisory committee, the government as approved setting up of five new TSDF sites. A notification has to be issued by the government on TSDF sites under the Hazardous Waste Rules 2018. Key sources close to development informed that hazardous solid waste from industrial units needs to be disposed of at scientifically constructed TSDF sites. “Due to large scale of chemical industries in Gujarat, the state currently generates about 30 lakh MT of industrial hazardous waste annually. Out of this, approximately 10 lakh MT of landfill industrial waste is disposed at TSDF sites. The rest of the industrial waste is disposed of through incineration, recycling or co-processing in the cement industries. The capacity of TSDF site currently in state was about to touch saturation level in 3-6 months so it was under active consideration of government to notify new TSDF sites,’’ sources informed. “Locations for new sites will be at Khambhat-Anand, Mahisagar, Bharuch-Jambusar and Zagadia and Surendranagar district. This decision will make xnew sites operational soon which will ease pressure on hazardous industries handling such waste.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-approves-five-sites-for-disposal-of-hazardous-waste/articleshow/83968985.cms||Kapil Dave

The HC has also ordered the authorities to keep the post of senior treatment supervisor (STS), which was earlier being manned by the petitioner, till the next date of hearing. Justice Arun Monga passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by Rajuddin, a native of Nuh district of Mewat area of Haryana. The petitioner was appointed as senior treatment supervisor under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2014 by the civil surgeon at Mandikhera in Mewat. Petitioner’s counsel, Mohd Arsad, submitted before the court that the petitioner had been serving uninterruptedly since 2014. However, merely on a vague allegation/suspicion of the petitioner having participated in the strike call given by farmers at Tikri border, Delhi, on December 5, 2020, the petitioner’s services had been summarily terminated through an order passed on February 25, 2021, without holding any inquiry or giving any showcause notice or opportunity of being heard in person. The court was also informed that due to the current pandemic situation, the petitioner was earlier unable to challenge the termination order as the courts were earlier working under certain restrictions which had only been relaxed recently. The court asked the state authorities why the termination order should not be stayed.

They said the allegations were being fabricated as a sequel to the disputes in the ‘independent Catholic church’ called ‘Emperor Emmanuel Church’, based in Muriyad near Chalakkudy. This church is also known as Zion. They said that they had been active members and trustees of the church from 2007 to 2017. Mayookha and her family have been members of the church since 2010. The dissidents said they quit the church following differences between the person who had assumed leadership after the death of its founder and supreme leader Joseph Punnar in 2017. They said there were about 50 cases in six different police stations filed at the instance of the church followers against the defectors, and the rape case was one among them. The dissidents claimed that they had filed a complaint before the DGP in 2018 seeking police protection against the false cases being filed against them. They said that 60 people from Ernakulam district who had quit the movement had sent complaints to several state and central authorities, including the President and Prime Minister,on August 28, 2019, against the church. They also denied the allegations that Johnson had threatened Mayookha. Biju Philip, who claimed to be the chairman and managing trustee of Zion from 2007 to 2010, said that Johnson was not accessible over phone since Monday and hinted the possibility of Johnson approaching court seeking anticipatory bail. Mayookha reiterates charges Meanwhile, Mayookha refuted the allegations and said, “No woman would risk her personal reputation and make a rape allegation for winning a church dispute. “We have strong evidence to prove the rape charge. There are CCTV visuals to prove that a friend of the accused had come to the house of the survivor to plant notices to blackmail and threaten her. CCTV visuals at the shopping mall in Kochi would establish that the accused had threatened me there,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rape-charge-a-sequel-to-church-dispute-say-friends-of-accused/articleshow/83966716.cms||---

This came even as the candidate, Mamta Kishore, and her husband Jai released a video from Bharatpur in Rajasthan saying they are "400 km away from Baghpat along with 14 supporters" and there is no way they could have travelled to UP on Tuesday to withdraw the nomination. In between the two statements, the city witnessed a massive protest by workers of the Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal. "Sitting in Bharatpur, how can Mamta KIshore withdraw her nomination for which she has to be physically present," a local RLD leader asked. The 14 supporters, the SP-RLD claimed, were district panchayat members -- and it is they who elect the chairperson. As soon as the poll panel intervened on Mamta’s complaint, the administration said that her candidature was "intact and it was not withdrawn". Tuesday was the last date for withdrawal of nomination for the district panchayat chairperson election, which will be held on July 3. Withdrawal of Mamta’s candidature could have led to the BJP candidate winning unopposed for the seat. In the video, Jai Kishore can be heard saying, "We are still in Bharatpur. The UP government is playing dirty politics. I will complain to the Election Commission. This is injustice. I will commit suicide with my children if the UP government does not make amends." RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary, who was in Delhi, left for Baghpat as did hundreds of his supporters from Muzaffarnagar and other parts of western UP. When TOI spoke to ADM Baghpat Amit Kumar, he said, “A woman by the name of Mamta had come for withdrawal of nomination.” A few hours later, district magistrate (DM) of Baghpat, Raj Kamal Yadav, told TOI, “No nomination withdrawal has taken place. It is just that a woman by the name of Mamta had come and sought to withdraw her name from the election. But officials present there became suspicious as she was alone and was not accompanied by her proposers. Strict action will be taken against the woman who gave the fake affidavit. An inquiry has been set up. We also spoke to the real candidate on a video call to ascertain the truth. No withdrawal has taken place.” This comes three days after Mamta and her husband met Baghpat’s BJP MP Satyapal Singh in Delhi. Sources said that Mamta was planning to join the BJP but soon after their return to Baghpat the couple held a press conference and announced that they were “coerced into” meeting the BJP leader and that they had no plan to join the saffron party. Ahead of the polls for district panchayat chairperson, 21 BJP candidates are set to be declared elected unopposed. Opposition SP has alleged foul play on several seats. It said that in some seats, including Gorakhpur, its candidates were not allowed to file nomination papers on the last day. The BJP, on its part, said that the opposition SP could not "find" candidates. “The SP was unable to find candidates and workers in several places and that’s why it even expelled district chiefs at 11 places, majority of them in places where they were unable to put up candidates,” UP BJP’s spokesman Manish Shukla has said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/district-panchayat-chairperson-polls-sp-rld-neta-says-someone-else-withdrew-papers-on-her-behalf/articleshow/83964543.cms||Sandeep Rai

The accused has been identified as Rajbhadursingh Chauhan (59), a resident of Natraj Society. Police said Chauhan had met the complainant woman when she had requested for lift on his two-wheeler to file a complaint against her in-laws in 2005. In the complaint, the woman accused Chauhan of promising to marry her and sexually assaulting her from July 1, 2005 to July 11, 2020. Police said Chauhan was already married. But when he refused to keep his promise, the woman lodged a complaint against Chauhan with Gittikhadan police. In another incident, Tehsil police have booked a man from Rajasthan for sexually exploiting a city girl between January 26 and January 29 last year after promising to marry her. Police said the complainant had met the accused Pritamsingh Tanvar (23, a resident of Buhana, Rajasthan) on a social networking site in 2019. The two later fell in love. Tanvar proposed her for marriage and visited the city in early 2020. The complainant met him during his three-day stay at a city hotel where Tanvar allegedly raped her. He then left for Rajasthan and the duo stayed in touch for over a year. However, in June this year, he started ignoring the complainant’s calls and messages. The girl then approached him, but Tanvar allegedly refused to marry her. She then lodged an FIR against Tanvar with Tehsil police.

Annu Rani, who had trained her sights on the Olympic qualifying mark of 64.00 m, opened with a throw of 62.83m to improve her own meet mark by nearly three metres. Assured of victory, when her subsequent throws did not travel the distance she would have liked, the world no. 13 stepped over the line each time to register no more legal throws. It was the 10th time in her last 11 competitions, dating back to August 30, 2019, that she went past the 60m mark. More importantly, she would be pleased with the fact that she has won each of the five competitions at home this year with such throws. She is ranked 14th in this year’s top list and is confident of making her presence felt in Tokyo-2020. Tajinderpal Singh Toor, who achieved Olympic qualification with a new national record of 21.49m here last week, showed a praiseworthy consistency with each of his five legal puts over the 20m mark. Despite securing the meet mark with 20.63m on his second try and being assured of victory with 20.96m on his fourth visit to the circle, he uncorked a final out of 21.10m. According to PK Srivastava, honorary secretary, UP Athletic Association, Annu Rani had broken her own meet record which she had set in the year 2016 in Hyderabad. Ajay Kumar Saroj (Uttar Pradesh) won 1500 mtr event clocking 3:42.55. Another UP athlete Yugant Shekhar Singh stood second in long jump event after taking a leap of 7.63 mtrs.

Since then, his mobile phone was not reachable. Police have registered a murder case and were searching for the woman’s husband on basis of his last mobile phone location. Police suspect that he strangled the woman to death and left after locking the house.

---||Bhopal||Online fraud racket busted, kingpin hails from Jharkhand||BHOPAL: Cyber Crime branch on Tuesday arrested five online fraudsters from Jamtara in Jharkhand and neighbouring areas of West Bengal. The accused, posing as bank officers, had siphoned Rs 10.40 lakh from a retired BHEL officer’s bank account on pretext of KYC verification/update.  They ran an organised online fraud racket, kingpin of which is a BTech graduate, while one of the nabbed accused is a law graduate. The kingpin speaks English fluently and is well-versed in banking procedures. Police were shocked to see the bank statements of the accused and they are suspected to have duped more than 1000 people across the country to the tune of more than Rs 10 crore. They lived in luxurious houses in their native villages on Jharkhand-West Bengal border, with sophisticated alarm systems, sensor-based doors and voice command light systems. Police seized an SUV and other goods, including a bank passbook, 13 mobile phones, 11 ATM cards, and 50 forged SIM cards from their possession. Villagers provided them a protective cover whenever police raided the area, due to which, the accused were able to dodge the cops and carried on with their criminal activities. They made calls posing as bank employees to victims across the country from agriculture fields and woods. ASP (cyber crime branch) Ankit Jaiswal said, on the basis of technical investigations, police zeroed in on the accused, who stayed in far-off villages of Jharkhand and West Bengal.  Acting on information, a police team was sent to Asansol from where they nabbed five accused, including the kingpin of the gang.  Jaiswal said, the accused were identified as Mohammed Imran Ansari, a resident of Jamtara Jharkhand, Abhishek Singh, a resident of Chitranjan in WB, Mohammed Afzal, Gulam Mustafa, both residents of Asansol in West Bengal, and Sanju Debnath, a resident of South 24 Parganas. Imran is the kingpin of the gang and he communicated with the victims on phone posing as a bank officer. ASP said that Imran transferred the money into fraudulent bank accounts after taking the details and OTPs from the victims. Afzal and Sanju withdrew the cash from bank accounts through ATMs and gave it to Imran so that the kingpin was never caught on any camera fitted at the ATMs. The accused duped thousands of people in the past 3-4 years from MP, Delhi, UP, Maharashtra and other states. Cops are going through their bank details to assess the amount illegally siphoned by them from victims’ bank accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/online-fraud-racket-busted-kingpin-hails-from-jamtara/articleshow/83964549.cms||Sudeept Mishra

Customs team, probing the gold smuggling attempt linked to Ramanattukara gold heist bid, had recorded his arrest on Monday night While passing the order on the custody petition, the court said a detailed investigation is needed to find the truth. "Having regard to the nature of involvement of accused Arjun, more investigation is required with reference to his complicity and link with persons involved in smuggling activities from dispensing end and receiving end. Joint interrogation of the accused Mohammed Shafeeque Melathil and Arjun appears to be essential to unearth the truth," it said. Though customs sought a 14-day custody, the court said that 14 days appeared too long for the purpose of investigation. "The investigating officer is unable to swallow statement of accused Arjun without a pinch of salt. It is the burden of the IO to collect corroborative evidence after interrogating the accused. The custody for a period of maximum 7 days is sufficient to meet the ends of justice," the court said. In the custody petition, customs said Ayanki has strong links with the gold smuggling network. They added that ousted DYFI leader C Sajesh, who is the registered owner of the car used by Ayanki to reach Karipur airport, is his benami. "From the inputs received, it appears that the accused had connections with smuggling rackets with interstate connections and the present incident is only a tip of the iceberg. Further interrogation is required to acquire clarity as to the modus operandi and details of other accomplices behind this smuggling activity, without delay," the petition said. Customs said investigation revealed Ayanki was living a luxurious life without known sources of income. He lured many youngsters into gold smuggling; they were used as carriers, for snatching smuggled gold and giving protection for smuggled gold. Ayanki presented himself before the investigation team without his mobile or proof of identity which is a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence. His statement is contrary to the statement of the carrier, Mohammed Shafeeque, who had deposed that the gold was smuggled to be given to Ayanki, who was present at the airport. WhatsApp chats and voice clippings prove that he was directly connected with the passenger and the mastermind of the smuggling, the petition said. Ayanki on his way to the court told the media that he would prove his innocence. On Tuesday, customs issued notice to Sajesh asking him to appear for interrogation on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/customs-gets-7-day-custody-of-ayanki/articleshow/83966720.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Parthiv Sahaswat (10) and Rohit Ashwin (8). Repalle town police said the boys, along with their mother Uma Devi, were staying at their maternal grandmother Vijayalakshmi’s house in Repalle due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Uma’s younger sister Sarada Devi and her husband Katuri Srinivas Rao also live in the same house and often quarrelled with each other over various family disputes. On Monday evening, Srinivas took Uma’s kids, who were playing outside, into the house and brutally thrashed them with a wooden stick. He also used an iron rod to bash them up, leaving them lying unconscious in a pool of blood. Family members rushed them to a nearby hospital where doctors pronounced Rohit as brought dead. Prathiv too succumbed to his injuries while receiving treatment. Police said both kids had deep gashes on their heads which resulted in their death. Srinivas Rao later surrendered to the police. Explaining the motive behind the murder, police said Rao, who has been unemployed for a long time, felt humiliated due to the treatment meted out to him by his in-laws and took out his frustration on the children. A case under section 302 of IPC (murder) has been registered against Srinivas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jobless-man-thrashes-two-of-his-nephews-to-death-in-ap/articleshow/83970971.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The discovery during the ongoing excavation by the state archaeology department near Gangaikonda Cholapuram in Ariyalur district revealed the remains of a Chola-era royal palace. Since the beginning of the excavation in February, the state archaeology department has identified 758 antiquities in the Malikaimedu excavation site. The study to explore and record the architectural style of the Chola dynasty has found 22 courses of bricks in one of the four trenches. In another spot, burned bricks in three courses were spotted during the excavation, mud mortar of 2cm thickness binds the bricks. Asserting the remains were that of a residential area, possibly a palace, officials said. The structures were square or rectangular. Lime mortar was also found to be used as binding material. Ash patches with charcoal and burned bones (animals) suggest that the bricks used were burned like contemporary red bricks made in kilns. At present, the state archaeology department is exploring a 2,500sqm area in Malikaimedu, a village that was historically known for accommodating the palaces of the Chola kings who once dominated southeast Asia. R Sivanantham, commissioner (FAC), state archaeology department said: "We have planned to study the water management practice and drainage infrastructure in the Chola palaces. The antiquities we unearthed from the site were moved to the state museum in Gangaikonda Cholapuram. There are proposals to develop the excavation site and museum," Gangaikonda Cholapuram that served as the capital of the Cholas for 250 years had trade links with China and several present-day Asian countries. Historians said the Kollidam river was used as a maritime route to connect the landlocked town to the ports on the east coast. Gangaikonda Cholapuram development council chairman R Komagan believes the archaeology department must explore the habitation sites too to get a clear picture of the Chola capital. "MGNREGA workers can be involved to reduce the expenses of excavation," he said. The state archaeology department has permission from the Central Advisory Board of Archaeology (CABA) to conduct excavation till September 1. Kollankuzhi, a place near Sambaodai village near the excavation site is identified by historians as the hub of pottery and foundry activities for the erstwhile Chola capital. Pointing out the presence of pottery fragments frequently recovered from the surface, historians pitched for excavation to expand further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/remains-of-chola-era-palace-amid-artefacts-at-ariyalur-excavation-site/articleshow/83972857.cms||Deepak Karthik

Virar police said that though the exact motive is not clear, the passengers and driver had an argument over filling fuel. The brothers told the police that an argument erupted and they bashed up Jha. He died and the brothers panicked and disposed off his body in the jungle. On June 17, Santosh Jha (45) left his Virar home saying he had to drop a passenger to Panvel. He later called to inform his family that the journey had extended to Khandala. On June 19, when the family could not contact Jha, they registered a missing complaint with the Virar police. The family told the police that Jha’s debit card was used to purchase diesel at a petrol pump in Khandala. Khandala police was alerted who informed that an unidentified and decomposed body of a male was found in the jungles of Khandala. The body and its belongings were identified as that of Jha. Investigations revealed that the brothers had paid Rs 700 for the journey till Panvel. On reaching Panvel, the accused asked Jha to take them to Khandala and promised him Rs 5,000.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘State should set up a disaster response force’||In his keenness for micromanaging police affairs and multitasking, DGP Loknath Behera always want his subordinate officers near him during the long hours he spent in his office. His workaholic nature is evident from his schedule for his last four days in office –– 20 ‘official’ programmes and numerous ‘unscheduled’ ones. In the midst of all this he took time to speak to TOI during his morning walk on the day before stepping down as the state police chief. Excerpts: How equipped is Kerala Police to counter new-age terrorist attacks like the recent drone strike in Jammu? We are fully equipped to tackle ground and coastal attacks, but attacks like the one using a drone is a matter of serious concern. Anti-drone systems are extremely expensive and are not readily available. We have already proposed that the government seek help from the Centre and agencies like the DRDO and NTRO regarding this aspect, as we have several critical assets to protect. How equipped is the force to handle natural disasters, especially in high altitude and inaccessible terrains like Pettimudy and Kavalappara? To begin with, we have introduced disaster management in the induction training syllabus for constables and sub-inspectors. All battalions have also been given training in rescue and rehabilitation. We have also set up a high-altitude training centre at Kuttikkanam in collaboration with the ITBP. But what we lack is a state disaster response force on the lines of NDRF. Our proposal in this regard is under the consideration of the government. There is a criticism that the police are spending more time and resources for activities like social policing, compromising grass root policing. Not because of social policing. Usual policing duties have been affected to some extent due to the recent natural disasters and the current pandemic. At least 30,000 police personnel are put on Covid-related duties every day. For the first time, police faced criticism from the CAG on fund utilisation and purchases. Wouldn’t that be a blot on the Kerala Police and also your tenure? Not at all. The CAG has only pointed out technical aspects and not propriety issues. We have explained all the points raised, with facts, before the public accounts committee which is the only body that can take cognizance of these matters. For example, regarding the shortage of guns, we physically counted them and explained that we have not lost any of them. There is criticism on changes in the police power structure. Transferring the powers of SHOs from SIs to circle inspectors has cut down the supervisory control of DPCs over SHOs (as DPCs have the power to transfer only up to the level of SIs). How would you comment on that? This is only the view of some officers who want the power to be vested with them. In fact, we have received feedback from the public that this was a good decision as an experienced officer like inspector becomes a SHO instead of an inexperienced sub-inspector. Also, by handing over charge of SHOs to inspectors, we could divide the police stations into law and order, investigation and social policing divisions under separate SIs as envisaged by the Supreme Court. Kerala Police has been criticised for the recent Maoist killings. There are allegations that this was done to ensure central funds for the force.  The charges are baseless. Dealing with Maoism is not about encounter killing. We had even framed a surrender policy, including rehabilitation projects for Maoists. But when you find a person inside a reserve forest pointing a rifle at you, we will have to act. There was news that you were a frontrunner for the CBI chief’s post. Has your career as Kerala Police chief, cost you politically? I have no idea about that aspect. But I was hopeful about being chosen as CBI director as I was the most experienced among the shortlisted officers. When the clause that you need six months of service to be considered for the post was applied, it scuttled my chances. I was sad that day, but I got over it as it is for the government to take the decisions. There has always been criticism that the intense grip of police associations with political leanings on the force has compromised its discipline. What have you done about this in your long tenure as police chief? Trust me, the associations have never interfered in my work or made my work difficult. Their work is limited to the general welfare of the members of the force. It is true that they have given several representations regarding transfers and postings. Several new units and divisions have been introduced in the police, like the 25 new subdivisions. But how effective would they be without increasing the strength of the force? Kerala police is adequately staffed, provided that people are ready to multitask, which is the golden rule in policing. Also, with the introduction of technology, manpower can be saved. Installation of cameras could cut down night patrolling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-should-set-up-a-disaster-response-force/articleshow/83966889.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Hyderabad||In a first, 5 Indian pharmaceutical majors team up for Molnupiravir trials||HYDERABAD: In a first, five Indian pharma majors have joined hands to conduct phase-III clinical trials of investigational anti-viral drug Molnupiravir on mild Covid-19 patients. The companies include Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Cipla Ltd, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd. The companies have entered into a collaboration agreement, as part of which they will jointly sponsor, supervise and monitor the clinical trials in India, they said in a joint statement on Tuesday. The collaboration is a first-of-its-kind for a clinical trial in the Indian pharma industry that is aimed at investigating yet another line of treatment in the collective fight against the pandemic. Following approval of the clinical trial protocol by the Drugs Controller General of India , the trial is slated to be conducted across India between June and September in an outpatient setting on 1,200 patients suffering from mild Covid-19. “As per the directive of the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), Dr Reddy’s will conduct the clinical trial using its product and the other four pharma companies will be required to demonstrate equivalence of their product to the product used by Dr Reddy’s in its clinical trial,” Dr Reddy’s said in a regulatory filing. “On successful completion of the clinical trial, each company will independently approach the regulatory authorities for approval to manufacture and supply Molnupiravir for the treatment of Covid-19 in India,” the joint statement said. Molnupiravir is an experimental anti-viral drug that inhibits the replication of multiple RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The oral drug was originally developed for influenza treatment by Georgia-based Emory University’s drug innovation company – Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory. It was later acquired by Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, which has partnered with Merck Sharpe Dohme (MSD) for further development and the two are now conducting a global Phase-III study on Molnupiravir for treating non-hospitalised patients with confirmed Covid-19. All these companies had, between March and April this year, individually entered into non-exclusive voluntary licensing pacts with MSD to manufacture and supply Molnupiravir in India and over 100 low and middle-income countries (LMICs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-1st-5-indian-pharma-majors-team-up-for-molnupiravir-trials/articleshow/83971044.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Red flags raised on faulty construction in Char Dham road||DEHRADUN: A newly-constructed section of the Chamba-Dharasu road on the Rishikesh-Gangotri National Highway (NH-94), which is part of the under-construction Char Dham all-weather road, caved in a few days ago. After this, cracks appeared in the foundation of houses built close to a 440-m tunnel on the highway. This has led locals to wonder if the initial monsoon rains can cause this, what else is in store? Residents living around NH-94 said they had alerted authorities about the inferior quality of construction done by private companies engaged by the government, but nothing came of it. Tehri sub divisional magistrate Ravindra Juwatha has submitted a detailed report to the district magistrate in this regard. “Other than faults that led to the incident, we have also highlighted the risk the construction poses to residents and their houses. The ‘pushta’ wall that collapsed during Char Dham road construction caused some serious damage. Cracks have appeared in people’s houses. They are scared,” the official said. Over the last month, many instances occurred of construction on the Char Dham road causing damage. A stretch of the all-weather road between Pithoragarh and Ghat had to be closed for six days following landslides in the area triggered by road widening work. LD Mathela, executive engineer, NHAI, said “The team from THDC is in Tanakpur to locate all the vulnerable spots on the 150 km stretch between Tanakpur and Pithoragarh. A total of 51 spots have been identified so far. THDC will prepare a detailed project report and start repair work.” NHAI officials said repairs may take a year. In another such incident, a road connecting Pithoragarh to Almora was blocked for 48 hours after boulders fell on the highway. Vehicles on the road remained stagnant for two straight days until the road was cleared. Prakash Pandey, a resident of Pithoragarh, said, “The construction on Char Dham road causes frequent closure of highways. It has affected the commute to and from Pithoragarh. Moreover, prices of fruits and vegetables get inflated as we have to pay extra because of the road closure. We don’t know when this will end.” On Monday, landslides were also reported in Joshimath where Char Dham road work is ongoing. Boulders fell from Hathi Parvat on the road. The road was slightly damaged and traffic movement disrupted. Sankesh Thapliyal, a resident of Joshimath, said “The boulder came tumbling down with force and ended up in the river below. Fortunately, no one was passing through the road at the time or they would have been seriously injured.” The 900-km Char Dham All weather road, which aims to seamlessly connect all four Char Dham shrines – Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri – is being built at a cost of Rs 12,000 crore. The project ran into controversy for improper slope cutting, muck dumping in rivers and widespread deforestation. Environmentalists have often red flagged how the project adversely affect the hills.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/red-flags-raised-on-faulty-construction-in-char-dham-road/articleshow/83964617.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Though seven women corporators are in the race, party mayoral candidate V Radha Dheeraj Reddy (RK Puram) is set to be made the floor leader, while Gudimalkapur corporator Devara Karunakar is most likely to be named deputy floor leader. Sources said that BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar will take a call and the announcement is likely by this weekend. At a recent meeting of the city BJP unit, several corporators expressed their keenness to take up the floor leader post. Though Shankar Yadav’s name was pitched strongly, sources said that a woman corporator will be chosen as party floor leader considering that mayor and deputy mayors are women. Meanwhile, the appointment of GHMC floor leader was part of agenda in the state executive meeting to be held on Wednesday. However, the virtual meeting has been postponed over technical reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-to-pick-ghmc-floor-leaders/articleshow/83969124.cms||---
---||Chennai||Buying power at higher rate and calling Tamil Nadu surplus unacceptable: Electricity minister V Senthil Balaji||Tamil Nadu electricity minister V Senthil Balaji plans to avoid ‘extravagant’ spending on power purchase and strengthen the state-run power utility within three years. In an interview with Julie Mariappan he talks about his plans to transform Tamil Nadu from a power-deficit state to a power surplus one. Excerpts: Q: Where does TN stand now in the power sector?The electricity board has reached a state of near total shutdown. The board is burdened by a debt of `1.6 lakh crore with `15,000 crore interest per annum. This debt burden has increased over 10 years and our job now is to rescue the utility. They (the previous government) obtained loans to repay the loans at a rate of interest that ranged between 9.6% and 13%. The governor’s address to the assembly clearly mentioned that Tangedco and Tantransco are facing severe financial crises due to mismanagement in recent years. A study of the finances and governance structure will be carried out. We are now in talks with banks to reduce the rate of interest and in the process save `2,000 crore. How can we run the administration with payment of interest of this size? The AIADMK kept saying TN is a power surplus state. How could they have claimed that when 4.2 lakh farmers are waiting for connections under free power, tatkal and other self-financing schemes? Neither were they able to generate power nor give connections. Their objective was to reduce generation and procure power at a high rate from private players. They managed the situation with the state’s share from central generating stations. To me, Tamil Nadu is a power deficit state, since we could not meet the requirements on our own and purchased power at a higher rate. We are purchasing power even now. It is ok if you say you buy electricity at a low cost in the country and it is less than your generation cost, but purchasing at a higher rate and calling it surplus is unacceptable. Q: The CAG report pulls up public sector undertakings for giving undue benefit to contractors and incurring wasteful expenditure, thereby causing loss to the exchequer. Your comment?There was criticism when the DMK purchased power. But it was at an average rate of `3.58 per unit. In the last five years of the AIADMK government, power was purchased at `5.02 per unit. In certain cases, they purchased at `7 per unit. The CAG report detailed the way the power sector undertaking suffered losses. The previous government should have controlled the expenses. Our action will be based on the study outlined by the governor in his address. We have embarked on a mission to reduce the losses and ensure the minimum cost of production of a unit is between `3 and `3.5 from our installed capacity and private players. Q: The power sector undertakings get substantial financial aid from the state by way of equity, interest-free loans and grants. Why does the aggregate net worth continue to remain negative?Assets are created based on the cost estimates, but the management will decide on its fate. If they could generate only 2,400MW despite augmenting installed capacity of thermal stations, it means there is something wrong. Q:How do you plan to clear Tangedco’s massive debt?First, we have to provide uninterrupted power supply to the people. The debt burden cannot be solved in a day, week or month, but it can be sorted out within a certain period. There is a need to implement new schemes to generate power at a lesser rate. It will take one or two years upon which the purchase can be reduced. We have to get ready for alternative generation plans and it requires time. In future we can certainly steer the management without losses like what the CAG said, and avoid paying high rates of interest and taking loans. We have to increase our generation and revenue. It can be called a service department only if it delivers to the people, not by spending extravagantly on power purchase. Our aim is to reduce the debt burden of `1.6 lakh crore in a gradual manner and see there are no losses in the sector. Q:Is revision of power tariff on the cards?It has been only two months since we took over and the administrative machinery led by the chief minister is relentlessly working on Covid prevention. The CM has begun department-wise review. We are assessing how to reduce expenditure and serve the people with the support of government funds and grants. Q:There are frequent complaints of power cuts. How do you plan to deal with it? There was no maintenance in the last nine months of the AIADMK regime, leading to power outages. Now we have taken up work on a war-footing and power shutdown is only to maintain the infrastructure. Monthly maintenance of two to three hours a day is unavoidable. We will work towards providing uninterrupted supply. Q:Tangedco is unable to meet the requirements without additional purchases from private parties. How do you plan to reverse that?In the past five years, the previous regime could give only 51,700 connections for streetlights and water schemes. The earlier DMK regime gave 1.7 lakh connections. Breakdowns recorded during the DMK regime were 17.8 lakh while it was 53.9 lakh in the AIADMK in the past five years. The DMK gave 45.4 lakh power connections for all categories, but the AIADMK gave only 46 lakh connections despite dubbing it a power surplus state. There were 2.04 lakh connections for farmers in the five years of the DMK, but in the 10 years of the AIADMK regime, they gave only 2.08 lakh connections. The DMK gave 1,357 high tension (HT) service connections but the AIADMK gave 1,267 HT connections. The AIADMK lacked administrative efficiency and that is what the governor’s address to the assembly pointed out. They call it a service department, but everyone knows who it served. Q:You have alleged a scam in the previous government in power purchase. On what do you base your allegations?Their aim was to purchase power instead of continuing the DMK schemes. For instance, they floated a tender for 1,000MW for 15 years, but signed an agreement for 3,300MW in 2013. The average fixed cost itself was `4.9 per unit. Today, we get power at `3, `3.25 and `3.5 per unit. It is surprising that they signed for a long-term purchase at a higher rate. These are the reasons for additional expenses. Q:By how much did Tangedco’s installed capacity increase in the past 10 years and what are the plans to meet the estimated peak demand?The installed capacity was 5,600MW when the DMK exited in 2011. It increased to 7,158MW during the AIADMK regime after implementing the three DMK schemes. A plant was decommissioned in between. The board manages with the share of 5,800MW from central generating stations and power purchase. The AIADMK purchased four lakh million units through private players in the past five years, while the DMK purchased only two lakh million units in five years. The projects in Ennore (1,200MW), North Chennai (800MW), Udangudi (1,320MW) and Kundah pumped storage hydro-electric project (500MW) will be completed in three years. Q:What is the priority of the government?Our CM wants the state to become power surplus. He has directed us to give power connections immediately to farmers and industries. We are working towards restoring the energy sector, prevent losses and make the state power surplus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/buying-power-at-higher-rate-and-calling-tn-surplus-unacceptable/articleshow/83972941.cms||Julie Mariappan

Police said Tausif Ansari alias Berry, 23, has as many as nine offences lodged against him on the railways. ‘Fatka’ thieves clamber on railway poles, typically carrying a stick, and strike passengers standing on the doors of moving locals. They later pick up valuables dropped by the passenger and flee. On Monday, 28-year-old Reema Pandey stood at the door of a Borivali-slow local after it had passed Santacruz station. Pandey was listening to songs on her phone. Near Milan Subway, around 7.30pm, she felt a sharp whack on her arm and dropped her phone. A man perched on a railway pole had struck her. Pandey approached the GRP and lodged a complaint. The police combed the Vile Parle-Khar belt and located Ansari the same day. While conducting a search, they found two phones on him. “One belonged to Pandey. Ansari said he had stolen the other off a male commuter on June 25. But the commuter did not approach us to press charges,” said senior inspector Vilas Chougule. The commuter, Anwar Shah, was traced by the cops and called to the police station on Monday to lodge a formal complaint. Shah, a tailor, said he had been travelling in a Churchgate fast local when someone on a pole whacked him near Khar. Police said Ansari lives at Kherwadi and is a drug addict. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-nab-fatka-theif-who-struck-twice-in-4-days/articleshow/83967560.cms||---

According to the local residents, the issue of drainage overflow was persisting for over 15 days before the officials took stock of the matter recently. “With the onset of the monsoon season and fear of seasonal infections, the dirty water overflowing from the manhole was becoming a huge concern for the commuters and residents in the area. Thanks to the civic authorities for promptly addressing the leakage which was brought to their notice just a week back,” said Abdul Aleem, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. As the monsoon sets in, residents also fear that the issue of waterlogging on the roads may worsen if regular maintenance is not done. “The sewage overflow has been fixed but there is still water that accumulates on the road everytime it rains. This usually happens because of the garbage that flows into the manholes along with the water and blocks the flow. I request the authorities to take measures to resolve this issue and also create awareness among the people to see that they don’t dump waste in the open,” said Syed Anwar, a local resident. Meanwhile, the GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi who has been inspecting the sanitation works across the city directed the GHMC officials to clear the garbage and urged citizens to not dump the garbage on roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/osman-nagar-venkatapuram-road-now-a-smooth-stretch-for-motorists/articleshow/83969163.cms||---

An engineering student and his friend were arrested in the fatal drunken driving case. Father of the student was also arrested for trying to mislead cops by forcing their family driver to own up to the accident. Madhapur police said the Audi cruising at great speed hit the auto from behind near My Home Abhra apartment complex at 5.30 am amid pouring rain. Y Umesh Kumar, who worked in the pub in Gachibowli, was in the auto heading to his house in Begumpet when the accident occurred. “Due to the impact of the crash, Umesh was thrown out of the auto. He fell on the edge of the footpath and died on the spot with severe head injuries,” Madhapur inspector P Ravindra Prasad said. Auto driver Srinu, who also suffered injuries, is undergoing treatment at a hospital. The Audi was on its way to Inorbit mall from Ikea junction. Police shared a video of the reckless driving on their Twitter account on Tuesday. The high-end luxury car was registered in the name of V Raghunandan Reddy (55). At the time of the mishap, his son Sujit Reddy (24) was at the wheel. His friend Ashish (25) was also with him. “Ashish and Sujit consumed liquor at a friend’s guest house in Madhapur before the accident,” the inspector said. A case under IPC sections of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, reckless driving, causing disappearance of evidence of offence, intentional omission to give information of an offence by a person cheating by impersonation, criminal intimidation, etc., was registered against the three accused, police said. Raghunandan is a correspondent of a private school in Uppal, while Sujit Reddy is a civil engineering student in a private institute in Goa. Ashish works in a software company in Madhapur. Police said after the accident, Sujit and Ashish abandoned the car after it developed a flat tyre. They removed the registration plates of the car and fled from the accident site in another auto. While cops were searching for the accused, Raghunandan approached Madhapur police on Monday morning. He brought along his 55-year-old driver Prabhakar. “Raghunandan came to the police station with his driver and said Prabhakar was driving the car at the time of the fatal accident. Prabhakar has been working for Raghunandan for the last 20 years. He also said he was at the wheel,” the inspector said. “However, we confronted them with CCTV visuals and technical evidence to prove that their claims were false,” he said. Cops picked up Sujit from a flat in DD Colony in Secunderabad, while Ashish was arrested from his house in Krishna Nagar. Raghunandan was arrested from Uppal for hiding his son and trying to mislead police during the probe. Prabhakar was served a notice asking him to appear before the investigating officer. The three arrested accused were produced before a magistrate in the early hours of Tuesday and sent to judicial remand. The accident comes close on the heels of a Mercedes SUV knocking down a pedestrian and ramming an auto and other vehicles in the city last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/speeding-audi-rams-auto-kills-pub-worker-dad-and-son-held/articleshow/83971086.cms||---
---||Madurai||Federal system must for tackling pandemics: Tamil Nadu finance minister PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan||MADURAI: Tamil Nadu finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan on Tuesday highlighted the importance of a federal approach in situations like the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the CoWIN portal, where the details of the Covid vaccinations are maintained, is a classic example for why “we need a federal approach in some situations.” He pointed out that the details of the vaccinated citizens are available only with the Centre and not with the states, as it should be. This posed a hurdle to the states while preparing to face the third wave of Covid. The minister was speaking to reporters after inspecting vaccination camps in Madurai, in the presence of minister for commerce P Moorthy. Thiagarajan said Madurai had successfully brought the second wave under control and the district was fairly well prepared in terms of infrastructure. There were sufficient beds, oxygen concentrators, oxygen generators, Covid care centres and others, he said. “Now, on the instruction of the chief minister M K Stalin, we are going to implement a pilot project to identify the vulnerable people and monitor them continuously,” the minister said. Suggestions by the economic advisory council based on studies at the global level research, are to be used in the pilot project to control the spread in the third wave. The sero survey, where 38 clusters had been identified and randomization model, demographic analysis data, and the door-to-door to survey, during the second wave had helped collect most of the data for the pilot project. But, only full data of the vaccinated population was not available with the district administration, the minister said. “Five lakh people have received the vaccines in Madurai. About 4.17 lakh have received a single dose and 90,000 have received their second dose also. But, as the CoWIN portal is a centralised system, the details of vaccinated people are available only with the central government. Hence, this is a hurdle to implement the pilot project. We don’t have the 100% details of our vaccinated population,” he said. “This is why we have been stressing on the need for a federal system, where the management will be better within the states if they have their own data,” he said. The minister said that they were also going to write to the central government seeking details of the vaccinated population in Madurai district. “We have about 70% of the data through camps conducted in Madurai, but 30% still remains with the Centre and we have to access it for better management to know which part of the city has a larger number of vaccinated people and where it is low. This information is a must to tackle the third wave, and let’s hope the Centre shares the details in the next few days,” he said. From Wednesday, the Madurai district administration would keep a tab on its vaccinated population. This would go a long way in helping to control the spread of the disease, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/federal-system-must-for-tackling-pandemics-ptr/articleshow/83966879.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: No ramp, wheelchair at vaccination centres, seats not enough||LUCKNOW: A few facilities for beneficiaries at Covid-19 vaccination centres were found to be lacking in a TOI reality check on Tuesday. While social distancing among beneficiaries was not being enforced at several hospitals, waiting areas and rooms for observing adverse effect following immunization (AEFI) were not up to the mark at some community health centres. Overcrowding was found at most places, including SPM Civil Hospital. Vaccination booths at Avanti Bai Hospital and TB Hospital were on the first floor. Wheelchairs were missing at TB hospital and railway hospital. Instead of chairs, only a folding bed was found in the observation room at Silver Jubilee CHC. Thakurganj resident Karuna Mishra, 70, who came to TB Hospital for the vaccination, said that despite pain due to knee transplant he had to use stairs as there was no arrangement of wheelchair. “Besides there was no ramp or lift,” he added. The AEFI observation room was not functional at the BRD Hospital booth for 45 years and above. “There were a few chairs and the waiting area was so congested that we left soon after getting the jab,” said Suchita Tewari, (65), who came to BRD hospital. District immunization officer Dr MK Singh said, “Instructions will be given to vaccination centres to ensure availability of wheelchairs in adequate numbers. Besides, there should be enough space in rooms meant for post-vaccination observation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-ramp-wheelchair-at-vax-centres-seats-not-enough/articleshow/83969158.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Hyderabad||Found joy in donating hair for a cause||HYDERABAD: During the initial months of lockdown, I felt a little disoriented. I was soon going to step into my teenage years and it was a time I had imagined to be filled with excitement. But alas, all that came to a screeching halt when the lockdown was enforced. All my extracurricular activities came to a stop. Gradually, my guitar and kathak classes resumed virtually. Via online classes, I learnt a lot about the different virtual platforms like zoom, google meet etc. and their technical nuances which otherwise I might have learnt at a much later stage. Soon my friends and I began connecting online, and this too gave me a chance to explore various dimensions technology had to offer. Finally, there was something positive to look forward to. It was because of the lockdown that many teachers across the globe started offering online courses. These classes gave me a chance to pursue many of my passions. I got to be a part of a theatre workshop and a story-writing course based out of Mumbai. If it had been normal times, I would’ve missed out on these opportunities. Being at home freed me from the time constraints and I was able to hone my skills. I penned down a few poems, experimented with baking and came up with some recipes of my own. As time went by, I started getting concerned about the suffering all around. The grim news of people losing their lives got me thinking about doing something to contribute to society. After much contemplation I decided on donating my hair to the cause of cancer. It was indeed a satisfying deed and it made me feel as if in my own way I had done something worthwhile. In addition to this, I participated in a fundraiser for heal -a child foundation and successfully completed my goal. In a nutshell, though lockdown sounded like a dead end at first, it really opened new avenues to learn and grow for me. I’m sure that at the other end of this tunnel, I will be more grateful for this period in my life as it allowed me time to reflect and give back to the world in my own small way.

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Construction of new units at Kudankulam plant begins||TIRUNELVELI: Construction of the 2,000 megawatt (2 X 1000) units 5 and 6 at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) commenced with the ‘first pour of concrete’ on Tuesday. The project, to be completed at an outlay of Rs 49,621 crore, was launched by chairman of the atomic energy commission and secretary of the department of atomic energy Kamlesh Nilkanth Vyas through videoconference. KKNPP comprises six units of light water reactors with a capacity of 1,000 megawatt each. It is set up in technical cooperation with the Russian Federation. The project is being implemented in three phases with 2 X 1000 MW in each phase. Construction of units 3 and 4 is underway in the second phase and these units with a total capacity of 2,000 MW are nearly 50% complete. The ceremony was marked by pouring 6,200 cubic metres of concrete. Construction of units 5 and 6 will be completed in 66 and 75 months’, respectively. Construction of these two units will be executed by Larsen and Toubro (L&T) Limited that is engaged in the ongoing construction of units 3 and 4 that are almost 50% complete. Works to be carried out by L&T at Rs 2,305 crore include construction of the reactor, reactor auxiliary, turbine and diesel generator buildings and safety structures. While KKNPP was dependent on Russia for every component used in the first two reactors (units 1 and 2), it is learnt that around 36% of the components to be used in units 5 and 6 will be fabricated in India. On completion of these projects, the six units in KKNPP will generate 6,000 MW of clean electricity by the latter half of 2027, making it the largest power producing complex in India, Vyas said. The chairman expressed confidence that the reactors at KKNPP will place India among the frontrunners of nuclear energy producing countries globally. It will also make a significant contribution for the growth of Tamil Nadu, he added. He termed the construction of KKNPP reactors a stellar example of Indo–Russian strategic cooperation, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Both the countries are determined to complete the construction in the scheduled time, he said. Director general of the Russian State Nuclear Energy Corporation (ROSATOM) Dr Alexey Likhachev who virtually addressed from Moscow, said the third generation plus light water reactors built in KKNPP will have cutting-edge technologies to make the reactors the safest. Chairman and managing director of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited Satish Kumar Sharma said that units 1 and 2 have generated more than 57.4 billion units of carbon free green energy since they were commissioned. While global warming is a serious issue of concern world over, KKNPP plays a vital role in generating green energy. The contribution will be more when the plant generates 6,000 MW, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/construction-of-new-units-5-and-6-at-kudankulam-power-plant-begins/articleshow/83966904.cms||M K Ananth

The amendments are aimed at changing provisions of Centre’s farm laws, which have been criticised as anti-farmer. The delegation had earlier met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and NCP chief Sharad Pawar. “The Centre introduced the farm laws in a hurry in Parliament. We want to state government to introduce amendments after due discussion since it is an important issue,” said Shetti. The amendments make it mandatory for traders to take a licence if they intend to buy agricultural produce outside Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raju-shetti-patkar-for-delay-on-farm-bills/articleshow/83969244.cms||---

However, the highlight of the day was the rise in second dose recipients, which means an increasing number of people are now getting fully immunised by completing the two-dose vaccine course. Total 18,340 people took the shot. Of them, 5,620 (31%) persons were second dose beneficiaries, the highest number so far. The figure will increase in coming days as more people who have completed the required gap will come for the second shot, said officers. “Supply was adequate for the 18-44 years group who book slots online in advance. For 45 years and above, who can come directly for vaccination without booking the slot, more vaccines were supplied in the second half. This helped in increasing vaccinations in comparison to Monday,” said a senior officer. District immunization officer Dr MK Singh said that daily vaccination numbers will increase from July 1 because of more supplies by that time. Huge turnout at gurdwaras: Vaccine camps at two gurdawars continued to witness huge turnout. While Naka Gurdwara recorded 824 inoculations, 325 people were vaccinated at Sadar Gurdwara. Beneficiaries were also served snacks and fruit juice at both the places. “People are coming in large numbers because of better facilities at Naka Gurdwara,” said Rajendra Singh Bagga, president, Lucknow Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee. President of Sadar Gurdwara Committee, Harpal Singh Jaggi, said, “Many went disappointed because we got less vaccines.” Special care was given to elderly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jab-numbers-improve-18000-get-vaccinated/articleshow/83969209.cms||---

They made a representation to the chief minister through fisheries and animal husbandry minister Anitha R Radhakrishnan on Tuesday. PMANE coordinator S P Udhayakumar told reporters that unit 1 of KKNPP that has been shut for 70 days from last week for annual maintenance and refuelling has remained off the grid for more days in comparison to the days it generated electricity. “Unit 2 was also shut thrice in May due to repairs,” he said. Stating that the DMK government has been continuously opposing many projects, such as the hydrocarbon and Chennai-Salem eight lane, they appealed to the state government to oppose the KKNPP and the away from reactor spent fuel storage facility. They said that they will continue their democratic protests against KKNPP to protect Tamil Nadu and adjoining Kerala and the livelihood and people of this region. Thanking the chief minister for withdrawing cases against KKNPP protesters, Udhayakumar added that they would soon be meeting the CM to petition their grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stop-kknpp-expansion-pmane/articleshow/83966921.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||State police chief of Kerala Loknath Behera hangs up his boots today||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State police chief Loknath Behera will retire on Wednesday after 31 years of service in the IPS. The officer from 1985 IPS batch was posted as the police chief when the LDF government came to power in 2016. He was posted after removing the then police chief TP Senkumar, who then fought a legal battle against his removal that lasted almost a year. Government had to reinstate him on the basis of SC order and he served as police chief from May 6 to June 30, 2017, after which he once again handed over the baton to Behera. When Senkumar was reinstated, Behera was made the director of vigilance and anti-corruption bureau, making him the only officer to head the police, vigilance, fire and rescue services and prisons. Though he was the blue-eyed boy of the LDF government, Behera’s stint as police chief wasn’t smooth or devoid of criticism. His ways of prioritizing the end result over rules and procedures earned him many critics, even to the extent of CAG making vehement remarks against the police for fund diversion, extravagant expenses and more. As police chief, he focused on modernization of the force using technology and state police gave thrust to use of technological tools in every aspect of policing, including investigation. Behera has vast experience in multiple investigating agencies. He was a founder-member of NIA in 2009, where he served for five years and handled the high-profile Mumbai terrorist attack case. He was the key member of the team that interrogated David Coleman Headley, the mastermind of the attacks, in US prison. Earlier, he served in CBI for 11 years as SP and DIG and he investigated Purulia arms drop case, IC-814 aircraft hijacking case, Madhumita Shukla murder case, Mumbai serial blasts case, Uphaar fire case, Satyendra Dubey murder case, Haren Pandya murder case among others. A native of Berhampur in Odisha, Behera joined the service as ASP Alappuzha. He served as ACP (Kochi city), SP (Kannur), commandant of KAP-4 battalion, commissioner (Kochi city), IG (police HQ), ADGP (modernisation), DGP (prisons) and DGP (fire and rescue services). He has also received several awards, including the President’s police medals for meritorious and distinguished services. He will hand over the post to his successor at police headquarters by 4pm on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/behera-hangs-up-his-boots-today/articleshow/83966947.cms||---

The mortality data, which is still emerging, has raised concerns about the real toll of Covid-19 and the extent to which it was missed by the reporting systems. Data from the civic corporation obtained through an RTI application shows that there were 14,484 deaths due to all causes in April this year, an 89% jump from deaths in April 2020 (7,648). The number of deaths in April 2019 were 6,572; in April 2018 the number was 6,719, and in April 2017, it was 6,234. If a four-year average of deaths in April is considered (6,838), this year has seen a 112% jump. Deaths for the months of January and February this year didn’t show any remarkable shift from the previous years. March saw a 12% rise compared to 2020. Records for May and June are still being collated. The significant spurt in all-cause mortality for April, which includes deaths due to both Covid and non-Covid reasons, is concerning since the city’s official Covid toll for the month was just 1,479. It means the city had almost 6,200 ‘excess deaths’ in April, if compared with the average of previous years. ‘Excess deaths’ is the gap between the number of people who die from any cause in a given period and a historical baseline from recent years. “Covid accounts for only 10% of the April deaths. Considering that railway and road traffic deaths have reduced in Mumbai due to the lockdown, it is unlikely that so many deaths would be non-Covid,” said Soumitra Ghosh of School of Health Systems Studies, TISS. He said the excess deaths warrant an urgent scientific survey of mortalities in Mumbai, including triangulation of data from sources such as crematoriums. Sharad Yadav, an RTI activist who obtained the data, accused the BMC of under-reporting Covid deaths to show “everything was good on paper”. April was the peak of the second wave for Mumbai, when the city was recording an average of 9,000 cases every day for the first three weeks. This year’s highest single-day detection of Covid cases was on April 4, when 11,206 cases were found. But as per BMC figures, Covid deaths started rising only towards the end of April before peaking in mid-May. Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the Covid death audit committee, said that gauging the actual Covid toll is a challenge, although there is no denying there has been a notable rise in all-cause deaths. “In Mumbai, every death of a confirmed Covid patient is reported, but there is a possibility that victims who did not test positive for coronavirus before dying are missed,” he said. Importantly, the pandemic and lockdown had made it harder for people to commute and access health services. “That may have indirectly caused an increase in fatalities from diseases other than Covid such as heart attacks, cancer, etc,” he added. Dr Supe said that a national exercise is being planned to analyse the true extent of Covid deaths. A civic official said that the all-cause numbers for 2021 are provisional and will continue to be updated. “BMC has been very transparent with numbers. We have even counted those deaths where the person didn’t have a positive report but had a chest CT scan suggestive of Covid,” an official said. In 2020, Mumbai had nearly 21,000 excess deaths. Ghosh said it is crucial to know the death burden to plan better for the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/112-more-all-cause-deaths-in-city-this-apr/articleshow/84004059.cms||Sumitra Debroy

A recycling firm was roped in by the civic body to receive, transport and reuse the chicken and fish waste. With around 150 stalls in each of the four zones, the shops were generating around 1.5 to 2 MT of poultry and fish waste per day per zone. On Sundays, the quantity would surge to 3 MT per zone. While a few shops were handing over the waste at the micro compost centres (MCC), a majority of meat stalls were dumping the waste at vacant sites and water bodies. To overcome this, the corporation has invited a Dindigul-based recycling unit to collect and process the chicken and fish waste. The waste is recycled as feed for fishes grown in inland aqua farms. “The firm has provided us bins to store the chicken waste being collected at the micro compost centres. Shops were strictly told to hand over the leftovers to MCCs, erring shops caught dumping the poultry waste in open space are being penalised,” a source in the corporation said. “The process of sending the poultry and fish waste to the private firm for recycling has reduced the burden of more than 30 MCCs in the city. Workers are focusing on residential waste collection. The complaints on dumping the poultry waste near residential complexes have come down too,” the source added. The civic body maintained that they are not spending anything on the recycling initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corporation-initiates-recycling-of-chicken-fish-waste/articleshow/83966967.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lake levels better than last 2 years, 17% in stock||Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials reviewing stock of the water levels in the seven lakes that supply water to the city feel that the city may not need a cut currently, as the water stocks are better when compared to the past two years at the same time. Last year at this time water level in seven lakes was 8% and 6% in 2019. The lakes need to have over 14 lakh million litres of water in it till the end of monsoons for the city to go without a water cut. The seven lakes which supply water to Mumbai have 17.44% water stocks in them or 2.52 lakh million litres. This is a five percent rise in the levels when compared to the last ten days when the total stocks stood at 12.90%. BMC will review the water stocks in mid July. The lakes which supply water to Mumbai have 17.44% water stocks in them or 2.52 lakh million litres.

---||Hyderabad||Think before you click to avoid online fraud, says Hyderabad additional commissioner of police Shikha Goel||HYDERABAD: Shikha Goel, additional commissioner of police, Crimes & SIT, Hyderabad, answers queries from TOI readers on red flags to watch out for during online transactions, common cyber crimes and what people can do in case they are defrauded. Q: Following an advertisement to rent my apartment, I was approached by a man who claimed to be an Army personnel and said he’d transfer the deposit – of Rs 26,000 – once I scan a QR code. Instead of receiving any money, the person withdrew Rs 25,000 from my account. I have complained with my bank and cyber crime cell. Should I raise the issue with any other authority. Also, is scanning QR codes not advisable? —Dheerender AmbatiA: This is a classic QR code scam. It takes advantage of the victim’s lack of knowledge of how the UPI systems of payments and receipts works. It also exploits the gullible person’s trust. One may need to scan a QR code only when payment is to be made to someone else. To receive money, the other person (payee) must scan your QR code or directly use your UPI address. When you scanned the fraudster’s QR code, your screen would have clearly indicated: “Proceed to pay,” rather than ‘’Accept Payment”. However, because victims trust the fraudster, they do not pay adequate attention to what is notified on their own screens and such losses are incurred. Q: The rapid digitalisation, while making processes convenient in many ways, has also increased the risks of online transactions. What measures must people take to protect themselves from frauds? Also, are cyber crime sleuths taking any measures to create awareness among people? —P R Vittal RaoA: You are right in terms of overall increased vulnerability to cyber crime, owing to exponential increase in online transactions. However, cheating, impersonation are age-old crimes. Now, these have infested the internet-connected virtual world as well. Most crimes occur because of either of the following or a combination of the same: Lack of adequate information/ sensitivity on part of victim: There are a large number of first-time users of technology currently in India. While the apps and wallets are quite easy to use and have inbuilt security measures, we must be very careful of how we use them. Sufficient training on how the technology really works will go a long way in reducing instances of such crime. Paying close attention while transacting online is also critical. Plain old greed: Thousands of victims fall for the ruse of a jackpot or a quick financial gain. We should remember that if some proposition offered by an unknown party on the internet seems too good to be true, it is probably a con job. Do not fall for it. Shame/fear of loss of reputation: We have seen in matrimonial frauds, WhatsApp video-based sex chat frauds etc., that the fear of loss of reputation leads the victims to fall for blackmail and extortion. I request all citizens to step up without fear and notify authorities. In such matters, adequate confidentiality is maintained by police. Q: After lodging a cyber complaint, how often is a victim successful in recovering his/her money? —Anirudh IyengarA: In case of online financial frauds, it only takes a fraction of a second to incur huge losses. Add to that, fraudsters divert their ill-gotten funds within minutes into multiple bank accounts spread all over the country and sometimes abroad. Most times, they withdraw the entire amount immediately leaving limited or no money trail. In such scenarios, it is a Herculean task to catch the suspect. Even when they are caught, the chance of recovering the defrauded amount is minimal. Q: I frequently receive SMSs/ emails saying that huge amounts of lottery or leftover assets are available. The sender asks for all sorts of details. Are all these frauds? Should we report them? If yes, what’s the procedure? —A S R SarmaA: The maxim that there are no free lunches stands true in such cases. One should not believe such messages. THE REPORTING OPTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS:When received through SMS, the consumer can register his/ her preference(s) in NCPR by dialing 1909 or by sending SMS to 1909. You can also register using the TRAI DND 2.0 mobile app. After registering, in case any subscriber receives unsolicited commercial communication after expiry of seven days from the date of his registration in NCPR/DND, he/she may lodge a complaint with the service provider through voice call or SMS to toll free short code 1909 or through DND App within 3 days of receipt of such UCC. If you receive such potential spam messages on WhatsApp, you can check for reporting options here: https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-andprivacy/staying-safe-onwhatsapp/?lang=en l If you have received an email, especially one that looks like from your bank, all banks have notified phishing reporting email ids where you can send details. You should also block the message in your email tool. In addition, you can report to the jurisdictional cyber crime police station. Q: How safe is it to share mobile numbers while transacting with people online? And does it help to block the number later, if it raises any suspicion? —Sunitha ReddyA: There is no danger in sharing your mobile number but doing so with unknown persons may pose unforeseen risks in future. So, it is always advisable to err on the side of caution and refrain from sharing your personal mobile number with strangers. Several apps, including some stock apps in leading brands of mobile phones now provide the ability to block a number. You may choose to block a number once you are sure that the caller is pesky or makes you uncomfortable or suspicious in any manner. Q: I was recently trying to sell used furniture online and realised 9 out of 10 people approaching me were fraud. As soon as I mentioned ‘cash payment’ they withdrew their interest. Is that a sign of a fraudster? Also, is it safe to agree for payment through to GPay or PayTm? —S S MurthyA: While we cannot substantiate the percentage, we do agree that a significant number of buyer ids on such websites may belong to potential fraudsters. There are safety guidelines available within the portals themselves which may be closely followed. There is a significantly higher risk of falling prey to cyber crime when the person on the other side insists on only digital payment. However, please understand that you cannot lose money when using a payment tool if you are paying sufficient attention and know how the digital payment networks work. Q: Now-a-days there are a zillion online trading sites selling everything from clothes to household items to electronic appliances. Many of them are very lucrative as they have great offers. How does one ascertain if an e-commerce platform is genuine or not? —Prakash KishoreA: It is difficult to ascertain the genuineness of an e-commerce site. You are already aware of leading e- commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart etc. It is relatively safer to purchase things from such sites owing to their internal policies and support mechanisms against fraud. The safest way to explore new options is through word-of-mouth reference from friends and well-wishers. Have heard about friends who were defrauded when they clicked on a link sent to them on email, supposedly from their bank seeking some details. Though they did not furnish any information, just clicking on the link led them to losing money. Q: How does one save themselves from such high-tech frauds? — Kirthi ParekhA: This is rare, but certainly very plausible. If the shared link, when clicked, enables downloading of a malware, then such programme can initiate action on your device without you being aware of it. It is a best practice not to click the links sent by strangers or from seemingly dubious ids. Even though the victim doesn’t knowingly reveal any confidential information, there is a chance that the device/system may get compromised when such links are clicked. Later criminals may take advantage of the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/think-before-you-click-to-avoid-online-fraud/articleshow/83969232.cms||---

The camp planned at Periyamilaguparai urban primary health centre (UPHC) will vaccinate only second dose of Covishield only. Documents such as Aadhaar, passport, Visa proofs and other travel particulars are mandatory to get the second dose. The vaccination camp will commence at 9am. Officials said that only a limited stock is available. As there is significant demand from people flying abroad for professional, educational needs, the respective countries demand provisional certificates for vaccination against Covid-19. While some of the flyers have taken the first dose, the second dose has also been made mandatory by the other countries. For vaccinating such people on priority, the Trichy Corporation has allotted Periyamilaguparai UPHC for the camp. Meanwhile, vaccination camps for the public in Trichy urban and rural stands cancelled on Wednesday due to poor vaccine stock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/special-vax-camp-for-flyers-in-trichy/articleshow/83966953.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Election for assembly speaker likely on July 6||MUMBAI: Election for speaker to the state legislative assembly will be held on July 6 if the plan is approved by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. Congress legislature party leader and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said a proposal will be submitted to Raj Bhavan. “We are keen that a new speaker is elected during the two-day monsoon session of the state legislature, preferably on July 6. We will submit the election schedule to the Governor in a day or two,’’ Thorat said. NCP leader and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar too said the election will be held during the monsoon session of state legislature. Senior Congress leader Nana Patole was elected speaker of the legislative assembly unopposed on November 30, 2019. On February 5, he quit the post following his nomination as state Congress president in place of Thorat, in keeping with the AICC policy of one-man-one-post. Parbhani legislator Suresh Warpudkar, Mumbadevi legislator Amin Patel and Bhor (Pune) legislator Sangram Thopte are frontrunners for the post. However, the AICC may favour Thopte since there is no representation for Pune in the state cabinet, while the NCP has three cabinet posts, including that of deputy chief minister. “AICC is keen that the speaker’s election is held as soon as possible. MVA will approach the BJP for an unopposed election,” a senior Congress leader told TOI. The Congress leader said it should not be difficult for the Congress to retain the speaker’s post in view of Maha Vikas Aghadi’s strength in the legislative assembly. In the house of 288, the Congress leader claimed MVA has the support of 174 legislators. BJP has 105 members, while Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have 44, 54 and 56 members each. Several members of smaller parties and independent legislators have supported the MVA, taking the total strength to 174.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-election-for-assembly-speaker-likely-on-july-6/articleshow/83969324.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

In a statement issued on Tuesday, Ashraf said he had contacted the office of the chief minister and Kasaragod collector and was informed that no orders were issued to change the names of places in the district. Ashraf added that he had brought to the attention of authorities the mistakes which have happened regarding the names of some places due to technical issues in the ration card management software. The officials have told that steps have been taken to rectify errors, he added. “We suspect that the false campaign by certain sections to inflame the sentiments was aimed to create a division among the people of the district who are proud of their multiple language traditions,” he said. Authorities also said that there were no moves to rename places in the district. The issue started after Karnataka Border Areas Development Authority submitted a memorandum to Karnataka government alleging that Kerala government was planning to change the names of many places. The issue was taken up by Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa and former CM HD Kumaraswamy who wrote to Kerala chief minister. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/no-plan-to-rename-places-in-kasaragod/articleshow/83967024.cms||---

Owners of at least 20,000 gymnasiums in the state, including 300 centres in the city, and people associated with the sector are facing acute financial distress and have requested the government to allow the centres to resume operations. According to people associated with the sector, gymnasium and fitness centres in the city used to clock a monthly business of Rs 12-15 crore before the pandemic. President of the Uttar Pradesh Body Building and Fitness Association, Sajid Ahmed Qureshi, said about 10 lakh people in UP were associated with the sector and were under financial distress. Qureshi has written to government authorities and also met deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma recently to put forth his demand. “Since March 2020, when the first wave of the pandemic struck the city, business was hit due to closure during lockdown. Our revenue reduced to Rs 5-6 crore a month when the establishments reopened for a few months after the first wave. All earnings again came to a grinding halt ever since the closure of gymnasiums was ordered during the second wave of the pandemic in March,” Qureshi said, adding that urgent steps were required to revive the sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fitness-centres-gyms-seek-govts-nod-to-resume-ops/articleshow/83969275.cms||Fazal Khan

---||Lucknow||Routine immunisation of kids today across Lucknow||LUCKNOW: Routine Immunisation (RI) of children for vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) will be held in government hospitals and community/primary health centres across the district on Wednesday in place of Covid-19 vaccination. District Immunization officer Dr MK Singh said, "RI will be done in rural and urban community health centres and women and child hospitals on Wednesday from 8 am to 5pm. ANMs (auxiliary nurse and midwife) have been alerted for the drive. If state government will allow, we may continue RIs on every Wednesday in coming days He also said that orders have been issued to take a break from Covid-19 vaccination at all the government centres on this Wednesday, hence online slot booking has not been done for the day. However, in order to cover up the loss in Covid-19 vaccinations, the number of booths will be increased from Thursday (July 1) to ramp up inoculations.” If the government approves the plan, said officers, Covid-19 vaccinations at government centres will take place on all working days in a week, barring Wednesdays. The loss will be compensated by increasing inoculations on the rest of the five days. Private centres will hold immunisation against Covid-19 all through the week. The RI session on Wednesday will be the first in 2021-22 year. It was supposed to start in April, but could not take off because of the raging Covid-19 second wave and then the government took up vaccination against Covid-19 on a priority basis in view of the immediate threat posed by the deadly disease. Under the RI programme, children are given vaccines to prevent several diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, Hepatitis B, Polio, measles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus and typhoid among others. The decision comes two days after TOI highlighted how RI for children to be given from birth till five years of age has been hit for the second consecutive year due to the pandemic.

Senior leaders, who addressed the state committee meeting, said the attack against Surendran was not personal but a political one aimed at resisting BJP gaining more political ground in the state. “You can criticize K Surendran in party forums, if you wish so. But, you cannot criticise the party state president. Criticism against the state president is criticism against the party. All of you are supposed to buckle up and defend the party when political opponents try to disarm or discredit the party,” said senior BJP leader CP Radhakrishnan who was in charge of the party during assembly elections in Kerala. There was no threadbare discussion on the issues that plague the party. Nor did the state committee delve deep into the reasons that led to the unexpected electoral debacle in the assembly elections. A meeting of state committee office-bearers scheduled to be held in the first week of July would take up such points for discussions, said a senior party leader. BJP national vice-president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who inaugurated the meeting online, said, “Kerala has become a den of communalism, criminals and corruption. The smuggled gold heist at Ramanattukara points at CPM-SDPI-Muslim League nexus,” he said. Party core group members and prabhari CP Radhakrishnan attended the meeting in person. Union minister V Muraleedharan joined the meeting online from Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-to-fight-charges-against-party-state-prez-politically/articleshow/83967094.cms||---
---||India||Stocks dry up, vax drive in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka stalls||JAIPUR/BENGALURU/RANCHI: The nationwide Covid vaccination drive has been halted or severely slowed down in at least three states - Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka - as they have run out of stocks. In Jaipur, almost all government vaccination centres remained closed for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. The situation was the same in several other districts across Rajasthan. Rajasthan is one of the leading states in vaccination and has set up facilities to administer 15 lakh doses daily. However, the state received only 60,000 doses of Covaxin on Tuesday, a day after it received two lakh jabs. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, said only if the Centre provides doses regularly, people of the state will get vaccinated on time and the risk of third wave will disappear. The drive came to an unexpected halt in the Chhattisgarh capital Raipur on Tuesday after most vaccination sites run out of both Covishield and Covaxin doses. With most districts also running out of stocks, the state-wide drive will stop from Wednesday, health officials said. As of Monday evening, the state had just a little over 82,000 doses for all its 24 districts. The next consignment from the Centre is due to arrive on July 2. Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said, "Barring four workplace vaccination sites, we were unable to carry out the drive at most of our session sites owing to lack of doses. The doses are allotted to us on a daily basis by the state health department and there was no allotment today. Since we do not have any stock now, we cannot carry out vaccinations on Wednesday." Though Jharkhand has been allotted 24 lakh vaccine doses for July, it will receive a little over nine lakh doses between July 1 and July 15. The state is vaccinating a little over one lakh beneficiaries daily. In Karnataka, the vaccination drive slowed down due to short supply of doses and this has nixed the government's plan to cover at least 80% of the adult population by October when the predicted third wave is expected to hit. The state set a record by administering 11.6 lakh doses on June 21. In Bengaluru, BBMP administered 1.74 lakh doses, of which 1.64 lakh were the first jab. However, there was a sharp decline the next day with state and city recording only 3.95 lakh and 43,901 doses, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stocks-dry-up-vax-drive-in-rajasthan-chhattisgarh-and-karnataka-stalls/articleshow/83972970.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Healing touch: Uttar Pradesh government clears aid for 2,224 Covid orphans||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has cleared government aid for 2,224 children, including 121 in Lucknow, who have lost their parents to Covid. The development came after TOI highlighted that Covid orphans were unable to get the government aid as they did not have documents to prove that their parents died of coronavirus infection. The officials of the state women and child development department told TOI that the government aid has been approved for 2,224 out of total 3,900 registered Covid orphans in the state. Among the 2,224 cases, 163 cases were of those minors who lost both parents. Under the state government scheme, a Covid orphan will receive Rs 4,000 per month till he/she attains the age of 18. Further, their education will be free in Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya and Atal residential school. The government will also give laptop or tablet for children who are in Class 10 or above for online classes. As per conservative estimates, UP government is likely to spend around Rs 11 crore annually on 2,224 orphans as financial aid. “Due to gradual awareness among citizens, we are still receiving distress calls about Covid orphans and the numbers are likely to increase. We will ensure that no kid is left behind,” said director, women and child development, Manoj Rai. To provide aid, a district task force has been formed with district magistrate as the nodal officer. The other team members comprise chief development officer, district probation officer, and chairperson of child welfare committee. “The orphaned child’s relative or single parent needs to submit either Covid test (RT-PCR or Rapid antigen) report, blood or CT/x-ray test, certificate from Covid portal or papers related to Covid treatment at any hospital. It’s the responsibility of women and child development department team to reach to such families and fill their forms and complete the formalities to ensure the children can avail government aid,” said Rai who emphasized that all DMs have been given written order to not force victims to get required documents, as it would be inhumane on our part to trouble those who are already in trauma. He added, “Minor orphans who don’t have documents to prove about their parents’ death due to coronavirus will be given financial aid under sponsorship yojana jointly run by the central and state governments on 60-40% contribution. Currently, under the scheme, Rs 2,000 is given to an orphansed child every month till he/she turns 18 but we have sent a proposal to the government to increase the aid to a significant level.” According to ChildLine latest data, Lucknow alone has 264 minor Covid orphans and only 46% cases have been cleared for aid. But as per NCPRC Bal Swaraj Covid Care, only 202 orphans have been registered. “We will add the remaining kids as well, no one will be left behind,” stated Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/healing-touch-govt-clears-aid-for-2224-covid-orphans/articleshow/83969399.cms||Arvind Chauhan

There was a man and a woman in the SUV,” he added. Marado police post in-charge ASI Subhash Chand said, “Sachdeva deals with a Janta Nagar trader and they exchange payment every evening.

The state government had sent the samples for genome sequencing to Delhi-based Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) establishment. “The samples were sequenced for different strains of coronavirus and over 80% were found to be of Delta variant. No sample was isolated for Delta Plus strain,” additional chief secretary (ACS), information, Navneet Sehgal, said, adding that the report was tabled before the CM in the meeting of Team-9 on Tuesday. According to experts, Delta Plus variant could trigger the anticipated third wave of coronavirus pandemic. More than 50 cases of Delta Plus strain have been detected in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerela, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jammu & Kashmir and Karnataka. The CM has directed the officials to undertake containment and surveillance measures along the entry points in districts. He has also issued instructions for regular genome sequencing of samples at laboratories in the state. Labs at Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), King George’s Medical University (KGMU) and Institute of Medical Sciences at Banaras Hindu University (IMS-BHU) have already started work. Earlier, an assessment by the Union ministry of health and family welfare indicated that over 90% of cases during the second wave in UP were caused by Delta variant. Experts have urged the people to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour and get vaccinated as these are the only available defences against any strain of coronavirus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-delta-plus-case-detected-in-up-report/articleshow/83969428.cms||Shailvee Sharda

It’s the first district in the state to achieve this milestone. Nilgiris collector J Innocent Divya said they had completed the first phase of vaccination of all the eligible 21,800 tribals belonging to the communities such as Todas, Kotas, Kurumbas, Paniyas, Irulas and Kattunayakans from 438 hamlets in the district, which has a tribal population of 27,500. “We conducted vaccination camps at tribal hamlets across the district to make it easier for them to get inoculated,” collector J Innocent Divya Divya said. After hearing about the special vaccination camps for the tribal communities, health minister Ma Subramanian had assured the district administration of special quota of vaccine doses to inoculate them all by the month end when he visited the hill retreat on June 6. “With the assurance from the health minister, we put in place a concrete action plan to complete the task. We also roped in various NGOs working with the tribal groups to assist us and create awareness on the importance of vaccination through local songs and memes,” the collector said. ‘Vandhu vaccination podu, super starra thirumbi po’ (come, get vaccinated and return as a super star) was one of the punch lines of the awareness campaign. Alwas, a representative of Nilgiris Adivasi Welfare Association, said they focussed on the tribal areas at Kotagiri, Coonoor, Ooty and Gudalur. “We had to walk 5-10km through difficult terrain to reach some tribal hamlets. Health officials accompanied us without grumbling. Sometimes, we had to wait till late evening for the residents to return from work. We had to visit some hamlets at least thrice to inoculate all the eligible population,” he said. Association for Health Welfare in the Nilgiris and Nilgiris Wynaad Tribal Welfare Society were also involved in the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/all-eligible-tribals-in-nilgiris-get-first-dose-of-covid-19-jab/articleshow/83969436.cms||---
---||Delhi||Super premium retail vends to give Delhi a high||NEW DELHI: The capital will very soon boast of five spacious ‘super-premium retail vends’, which will offer the most sought-after liquor brands, tasting rooms and other high-end products like cigars and liquor chocolates, apart from high-value bottle openers, ice boxes, bar glasses, etc. Delhi government has floated tenders for five such super premium vends under a new license — L-7SP1 — along with tenders for grant of 32 zonal retail licenses for the year 2021-22 under Delhi Excise Policy, 2021. The super-premium vends was one of the recommendations of a group of ministers, headed by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, which was constituted to draw up a new excise policy. The recommendation was approved by Delhi cabinet in March this year. While a usual licensed vend can be opened in an area of not less than 500 sq ft, but not bigger than 2,000 sq ft, the minimum carpet area of a super-premium vends must be 2,500 sq ft. These can remain open till 11pm, instead of 10pm like other vends. These vends will be allowed to sell only those products that have a retail price of Rs 200 or more for beers and Rs 1,000 or above for all other spirits like whisky, gin, vodka, brandy, etc. These vends will need to stock at least 50 imported liquor brands, including wines. Super-premium vends can set up a tasting room within the premises in an enclosed area not visible from the rest of the store. This room can only hold training and tasting sessions. The vends can dedicate up to 10% of their space to sell ancillary products, such as cigars, liquor chocolates, high-end art paintings, etc, and high-value merchandise such as bottle openers, ice boxes and bar glasses. These vends can also have displays of various brands in exclusive shelves, so that the customers can walk-in to select products. The government has issued separate tenders for each of the 32 zonal retail licenses, which is one of the aims of the Excise Policy 2021-22. The policy aims at ensuring equitable access of liquor supply to all the wards of Delhi so that there are no un-served and under-served localities. The 32 zones include the 272 wards in 68 assembly constituencies divided into 30 zones. Each zone can have a maximum of 27 retail vends, with an average three in each ward. New Delhi Municipal Council and Delhi Cantonment assembly constituencies have been allocated 29 vends together and there shall be 10 retail vends at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Excise Policy for the year 2021-22 mainly aims to transform the consumer experience, simplify the complex and heavily regulated excise structure and to eradicate the sale of spurious liquor and non-duty paid liquor in the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/super-premium-retail-vends-to-give-city-a-high/articleshow/83969452.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||Launched in 2007-08, Madhya Ganga canal project to be completed this year||Lucknow: The government is targeting completion of the Madhya Ganga canal project, launched in 2007-08, by the end of this year. The irrigation project is aimed at benefiting about 1.47 lakh hectare land in 12 blocks of western UP. A delay in completing the project, a government spokesperson said, has resulted in escalation of the cost of the project by over five times, from an initial estimate of Rs 806 crore to Rs 4,417 crore. “Under the previous governments, there were delays in land acquisition and problems in availability of funds. When the current government came to power in 2017, it took up the project on fast-track mode. Of the Rs 4,417 crore, it has already spent Rs 3,403 crore till March 2021. About 68% of the work has been completed,” he said. The official added that out of 3,218 hectare land earmarked for the project, 2,755 hectare has been purchased while of the 1,242km of proposed canals, 480km has been completed. In addition to this, 666 concrete works out of 2,022 have been completed. The project will impact about 15 lakh farmers in 168 villages of Amroha, Sambhal and Moradabad districts. The canal is expected to improve the level of groundwater in the region and increase the acreage of kharif and rabi crops in the area. The spokesperson said that of the 12 blocks to be covered, 11 fall in the dark zone. Data provided by the government shows that on completion, the project will irrigate 71,000 hectare land in Sambhal, 59,000 in Amroha and 16,500 in Moradabad. “This will be the first canal network under the western command of the irrigation department and benefit farmers engaged in cultivation of both kharif and rabi crops. We are expecting 1.46 lakh hectare of additional kharif crop to get irrigation through this, including 0.79 hectare for paddy. The government is also focusing on completing projects like the Saryu canal and Arjun Sahayak project,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/launched-in-2007-08-madhya-ganga-canal-project-to-be-completed-this-year/articleshow/83969461.cms||---
---||Delhi||User-friendly clicks: 180 Delhi government department sites under 1 window||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is planning to upgrade its website delhi.gov.in into a user-friendly common portal, which will bring together 180 websites of its different departments and institutions.  The portal in its new avatar is planned as a one-stop solution for addressing all the needs of Delhiites with user-friendly features, like login through social media accounts. Although all the associated websites of the state government are linked to www.delhi.gov.in, users have to visit many websites for different information as the main website redirects them to departmental ones. The upgraded portal will be a one-stop source for all the government information and services. The government has floated a request for proposal (RFP) for design, development, hosting, operation and maintenance of Delhi State Portal and associated websites. “The portal aims to provide accurate information in various fields. Easy access to information is the key in promoting good governance,” the RFP document stated. With the launch of the portal, Delhi government aims to have a single interface consisting information on various government departments, such as education, health, transport, environment. Citizens will also be able to avail information on policies of the government, including EV, tree transplantation and anti-pollution policies. The portal will serve as a gateway for citizens for all services and departments. The primary aim behind an improved and one-stop portal is to ensure information given on the government websites is easy to access, understand and share for the public. Therefore, all websites will also have features like ‘Facebook Instant Articles’ ready. The government also wants consistent information across various departmental websites, along with a consistent look and feel, which is missing currently. There will be one login for all the government websites for the citizens for which they will have the option to sign-up and sign-in through social logins through Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. However, verification through mobile number will be mandatory whenever a new account is created. Once the upgraded portal is launched, all the existing government websites will migrate there so that all Delhi government information is available at a single place and in a consistent manner. All services provided by the government will be available at the e-district website and departmental ones will redirect applicants there. The website and content management system (CMS) will have to be built in such a way by the agency that data and information can be transferred from one department or server to another through secured connection. The agency that will be roped in will also have to ensure all the websites are 100% mobile compatible with bi-language features. The e-forms on websites will also need to be “mobile responsive” and users be able to upload basic information and download forms, upload documents, photographs, signature and other related Information in the required language and submit the form seamlessly. Building a responsive e-form feature will be a part of the content management system. Whenever a form is submitted, it will create a "form number" and send acknowledgement on the user email id with the filled form as a copy in attachment in email.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/user-friendly-clicks-180-delhi-govt-dept-sites-under-1-window/articleshow/83969496.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The effect of the virus on the brain, especially on the sleep-inducing chemicals could be the possible reason mechanism,” he said. Experts say progressive muscle relaxation techniques, mindfulness meditation, regular exercise and therapy can help boost an individuals confidence as well as improve the ability to deal with anxiety provoking situations. Withdrawal symptoms, particularly after being in isolation is very common among recovered Covid-19 patients too. “Withdrawal symptoms are being seen more in patients who remained away from family due to Covid-19. In one case, a patient, after staying in isolation for 15 days and in hospital for about a month, became very distant with his family and avoided neighbours. After nearly four months of recovery, he was unable to concentrate on anything, and could not get back to normal life,” said Dr Ajay Kumar Joopaka, assistant professor of psychiatry at Gandhi Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/anxiety-sleep-disorder-add-to-patients-agony/articleshow/83970797.cms||Amrita Didyala

Shinde posed as a police officer while his wife pretended to be a senior central government officer. Deepak Mundada (51), a shopkeeper from Shaniwar Peth lodged an FIR with the Faraskhana police station on Monday. Mundada did not respond to TOI’s several attempts to reach him on Tuesday. Shinde was produced before a city court on Tuesday and has been remanded in police custody till Thursday. “We seized 15 uniforms of different ranks — from police constables to senior police officers — from Shinde’s possession. We are probing as to why he stitched so many uniforms,” inspector Rajendra Landge of the Faraskhana police said. According to the FIR, In 2014-15 Shined introduced himself as a police officer to Mundada. In 2017, Shinde falsely informed Mundada that his wife works with the central government and the duo could get Mundada’s son and nephew jobs in the customs department. “Shine then started demanding money from Mundada ‘to pay to higher authorities for securing a job’ and took Rs51 lakh in instalments. Whenever Mundada demanded a job letter, Shinde gave lame excuses,” Landge said. A team headed by sub-inspector Shrikant Sawant of the Faraskhana police arrested Shinde from Kasba Peth on Monday evening. At the time of arrest, Shinde was found wearing a uniform of sub-inspector with a nameplate of the assistant inspector. “Shinde is a graduate and quit his job after he started making more money out of cheating. He moved to Hadapsar from Ghatkopar a few years ago and we are suspecting that he may have cheated people in Mumbai as well. We have sought details from Mumbai counterparts,” Landge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-arrested-for-cheating-a-shopkeeper/articleshow/83967283.cms||---

The agitated farmers blamed Prakash for not helping get a passbook to a farmer, who got electrocuted on Monday, and whose family eventually did not get insurance money under Rythu Bima scheme. Before dousing the tehsildar with diesel, the farmers attempted self-immolation. However, people surrounding them thwarted their attempt. A farmer Balu of Tallapally Thanda in Shivampet village in Medak district got electrocuted on Monday. Other farmers from the village came to know that Balu will not get Rs 5 lakh insurance under Rythu Bima as he did not get a passbook for his agricultural land. They took his body to the MRO office of Shivampet in a tractor and staged a dharna. As Bhanu Prakash did not come out of his chamber, an enraged farmer came into the office. The farmer poured diesel on the tehsildar after he came out of his chamber. Two years ago, Abdullapurmet tehsildar, Vijaya Reddy, was set ablaze by a farmer Suresh in her office over a land dispute. The farmer also succumbed to burn injuries. Medak additional collector G Ramesh told TOI that Balu was cultivating two acres forest land in his village and asking for a passbook. “As per government rules, passbooks cannot be given to forest land. On the farmer’s request the district administration had sent his request to the government, which was pending since it was a policy matter. He died of electrocution and his family is not eligible for insurance as per Rythu Bima norms,” the additional collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/enraged-farmers-pour-diesel-over-tehsildar-for-passbook/articleshow/83969547.cms||---

He has directed all department heads to draft proposals and send them to the Centre at the earliest so that it can release funds meant for the state at the earliest. In the Covid relief package announced by the Centre, Rs 1.1 lakh crore has been set aside as a guarantee scheme for the MSME sector in which Rs 50,000 crore will be loan guarantee for the health sector and the rest for other sectors. Yogi said the funds which will be provided for the health sector will be used to strengthen basic infrastructure. The focus of all planning should be small towns and cities which have so far been ignored and do not have sufficient facilities. He said that every district should get a medical college while Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Agra, Kanpur should get super speciality hospitals on PPP mode. The CM added that the tourism sector had been affected severely by the pandemic and to breathe life into it again, the Centre had announced several schemes in its relief package. An example of this, Yogi said, were 5 lakh free tourist visas till March 31, 2022. Assistance would be given to 11,000 registered tourist guides and guarantee free loans of up to Rs 11 lakh to tour agencies. The Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme has been extended to March 31, 2022. Under this, Rs 1.01 lakh crore credit guarantee scheme and another Rs 1.50 lakh crore additional credit guarantee scheme have been announced. The CM said that UP had benefitted most from similar schemes earlier. Another Rs 2 lakh crore is to be spent on the Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana to provide foodgrains to the poor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/central-funds-to-help-boost-health-infra-cm/articleshow/83969510.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||After virus, Telangana draws up roadmap to tackle surge in mental health cases||HYDERABAD: Identifying the need to ramp up resources to deal with the mental health crisis that has taken shape as a result of the pandemic, the state health department has drawn up a list of psychiatrists, stored up on necessary medications, and is focussing on initiating treatment at the earliest. Along with other issues, mental health is now being flagged as serious problem in Covid-19 patients, ailing and recovered. As part of the state’s plan, 90 psychiatrists in government hospitals across the state have been identified while physicians have been told to be on the lookout for possible cases. Covid-19 patients with history of substance abuse will also be closely monitored for withdrawal symptoms as part of the state’s plan. Officials have drawn up a comprehensive plan to identify cases and begin treatment along with Covid treatment, so that no patient requiring psychiatric treatment is discharged without counselling or medications as may be the case. “In the designated Covid-19 hospitals, regular physicians doing rounds will identify those patients who are developing mental illness issues...and refer them to in house psychiatry departments. The concerned specialist will evaluate and start the treatment which ranges from counselling to medication,” according to the blueprint prepared by the state health department for handling the crisis. In addition to Institute of Mental Health, Erragada, which has been the nodal centre for dealing with such cases, 27 qualified psychiatrists and 42 senior residents and PG students have been identified in the nine government teaching hospitals. This, in addition to 21 qualified psychiatrists in hospitals under the Telangana Vaidya Vidhana Parishad is on the government’s list. Healthcare workers in hospitals have been put on various training sessions to help them be empathetic and compassionate towards patients. Counselling is also being provided to patient attenders to ensure that they are equipped to provide care once the patient is discharged from the hospital. A previous study conducted at the Gandhi Hospital, the nodal centre for treating Covid-19 cases, had revealed that 5 per cent of hospitalised patients suffered from depression, 3 per cent from anxiety disorder, 22 per cent from distress, 13 per cent from mild distress while 9 per cent had moderate distress. Put together, these cases account for over half the hospitalised patients. “While the study — A cross-sectional study of psychological distress in patients hospitalised for Covid-19 — was conducted during the first wave, mental health was put under focus by the government by the end of the first wave and a more aggressive approach will now be taken up,” said a senior official from the state health department adding that psychiatric medicines have also been stocked up to deal with the crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-virus-t-draws-up-roadmap-to-tackle-surge-in-mental-health-cases/articleshow/83968852.cms||Amrita Didyala

Each vehicle has been given the task of administering 150 jabs and vehicles asked to be parked at busy shopping areas and even vegetable markets. Except Ranga Reddy district’s rural areas, other parts of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) saw sizeable crowds. The mobile vehicles will provide jabs between 9 am and 4 pm. “In the urban areas, the response is tremendous. Young people are coming forward for the vaccination as in mobile vehicles, there is no necessity of prior booking of slots,” a health department official said. The mobile vehicles have flexis displaying the availability of doses, but the idea of campaigning with mikes was dropped. “Top bosses felt that it would lead to more rush at the vehicle,” a health department official told TOI. Vaccination at the mobile vehicles began in both Ranga Reddy and GHMC areas with nearly 100 vehicles deployed for jabs. Initially the vaccine was administered for people above 30 years. Now primary health centres are providing jabs for them. Initially, the people above 30 years were given jabs at the special vaccination centres in GHMC identified for high risk groups, and people below 30 years were asked to go to PHCs. “Now, we are giving vaccine for all, and if the doses are less we are insisting on giving the preference to those who have booked slots,” another official said. Public health expert Professor Dr Subodh Kandamuthan said that in rural areas, if fear over vaccine persists, state should conduct awareness drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/100-mobile-vans-deployed-to-push-states-vax-drive/articleshow/83970824.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Genco took the decision as many labourers working in the Yadadri Thermal Power Plant (YTPP) at Damarcherla had left for their native states due to lockdown and fears over the pandemic. This facility, which came up on the premises of the under construction power plant, was opened by energy minister G Jagadish Reddy and Genco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao on Tuesday. “In the first wave of Covid-19, several workers from Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh had left for their home states. The plant was supposed to be ready by 2022, but the works are getting delayed due to the migrant worker problem. In this second wave also, many labourers had gone to their states,” Jagadish Reddy said. Over 8,000 workers were engaged for the work, but only 1,200 to 1,500 are currently available. “Following an assurance on their health, over 4,000 migrant workers came back. The government was able to prevent some more workers from going to their states,” the minister said. He said over 1,000 migrant workers have been inoculated so far. It was also decided to provide more facilities to the workers at the plant and measures are being taken to restore confidence among the workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/genco-opens-30-bed-hosp-for-migrants/articleshow/83970920.cms||Koride Mahesh

Even when Covid-19 cases were peaking, Rao was running errands on his bicycle to deliver medicines, ration, and other essentials to those in need. Rao, a retired Air India employee, also helps Hyderabad Relief Riders in checking whether a request is genuine or not. “I want to do whatever little I can do for the society,” the 70-yearold told TOI. Rao, a resident of West Marredpally, has been attending requests within a six to seven kilometre from his residence, even sponsoring their requirements in some cases. “Whenever I go to deliver, I make it a point to see their condition and do my bit,” he says, adding that his wife was a little hesitant in the beginning but is now very cooperative. “My children, who are currently living abroad, however, are not completely on board with me stepping out amid pandemic,” he added. Rao said that he spends about 2 hours every day playing table tennis and mostly uses his cycle to travel. He said that on multiple occasions he came across people trying to misuse their service even when they have a healthy adult at home, who is capable of doing chores. “When I come across such cases, I counsel them and encourage them to step out and shop for their needs,” he added and said that he even served people younger than him in the last couple of months. Rao’s fellow riders volunteering at Hyderabad Relief Riders said that he is an inspiration to many. “Apart from delivering, he also helps us in verifying requests,” said Ravi Sambari, a cyclist. 82-year-old Nirmal Verma, who lives alone in the city, said that Rao delivered her groceries on Monday after she placed a request with Hyderabad Relief Riders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/retd-70-yr-old-ai-employee-now-a-hero-on-2-wheels/articleshow/83970894.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

They questioned why the decision of removing the bins overnight was not brought to the notice of corporators in several areas. “We have submitted an entire breakup of the total number of houses and the number of bins that were removed from each circle,” said Zafar Khan, AIMIM corporator. “We have also brought the issue of inadequate auto tippers allotted to households in certain areas. For instance, in Mehdipatnam Circle, each auto has been allotted 800 to 830 houses as against affidavit submitted to National Green Tribunal (NGT) in which it was mentioned that each auto will be allotted only 400 to 450 houses.” The corporators suggested that each circle be allotted at least three sanitary supervisors and 25 workers under each sanitary jawan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mim-questions-removal-of-dustbins/articleshow/83969492.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Engineering students in Hyderabad develop oxygen concentrator from water purifier||HYDERABAD: Engineering students from a private college in the city have developed a dualuse 25 litre oxygen concentrator from a water purifier. The concentrator costs about Rs 20,000. “We have taken a purifier, removed RO candles, and replaced them with Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) system, in which air compressor, silica gel and zeolite (13X) pellets are major components, to convert it into a concentrator,” said Shaik Mohammed Rayyan, a student of Lords Institute of Engineering & Technology, who led the team that developed the concentrator. Rayyan said that this innovation belongs to the medical domain or where there is a need for pure oxygen for the patient for its survival. He said that right now, they are able to produce 85 to 92% of pure oxygen at 25 litres per minute. He said that the concentrator has two exit nozzle points and can be used by two patients at one particular point. “For medical use, we need 95% pure oxygen. To achieve that we need to upgrade zeolite pellets from 13X grade to lix grade, but they are currently not available in the market and are hard to procure. Also, air compressor needs to be upgraded from 1 hp to 2 hp,” Rayyan told TOI, adding that even after upgrading the components, the manufacturing cost of the concentrator will be about Rs 20,000 only. The students have attached a humidifier with oxygen flow meter and oxygen pipe with an inhaler to the purifier to convert it into a concentrator. Touseef Ahmed, vice-chairman of the institute, said “We at Lords Institute of Engineering & Technology had always been in the forefront in encouraging students to be part of innovations and develop products that bring in change to the society. The present innovation of developing oxygen concentrators from water purifiers is an important innovation considering today’s time and the higher usage of oxygen among patients suffering from Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/engg-students-develop-oxygen-concentrator-from-water-purifier/articleshow/83970948.cms||---

With instances of Maoists succumbing to Covid-19 in recent times, cops are telling the families that the surrender would mean that the Maoists would not only be provided medical help and treatment but also rehabilitation. DGP M Mahendar Reddy has put the onus on police chiefs in the districts to convince the families of Maoists to bring them round. Some district SPs are already visiting villages to bring out Maoists who have gone underground. In Dedra village in Adilabad, 75-year-old Anjana Bai made an appeal to her 38-year old daughter Sumana to leave the jungles and come back home. District SP M Rajesh Chandra, who visited Dedra and spoke to the family, did not find it easy to convince the mother to make the appeal. “If my mother were to make an appeal to me, I being her son would definitely listen to her. Similarly, your daughter too, I am sure, will react positively to your appeal,” he told Anjana Bai. The mother gave vague responses to the SP for sometime but after villagers explained to her in her dialect what the SP was saying, she made an appeal and asked her daughter to think positively on her appeal to surrender. Sumana alias Seethakka had gone underground for last 20 years. Rakshitha Murthy, DCP, Malkajgiri zone in Rachakonda commissionerate limits, also visited two families, urged them to make similar appeals. Accompanied by additional DCP, Kushaiguda, Shivakumar, the DCP went to the house of Alwal Chandrahas, an underground cadre of Maoists, and spoke to his family , including his elder sister Alwal Parvathi and brother-in-law Alwal Narsing Rao at their residence at Yapral in Medchal mandal. She also visited Pallepati Balaiah (60) and Pallepati Pochamma (55), parents of Pallepati Radha, who is an underground cadre of the Maoists. The family resides at New Indiranagar in Kapra mandal of Medchal district. They were explained about the rehabilitation that would be provided to the Maoists if they surrendered. Mulugu district SP Sangram Singh Patil said the top leadership of Maoists and also cadre were suffering from Covid-19 and assured them that if they surrendered, they would be given proper medical treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/police-tap-kin-to-make-maoists-surrender-assure-rehabilitation/articleshow/83971033.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

In Delhi, April and May have been particularly severe. Under these circumstances, it is possible that our teachers and students, too, have faced deep trauma. It is necessary that they are given time to share their grief and reconnect with each other before moving on to regular work. Our teachers must start reconnecting with their students soon. But before that, they need to be prepared to not just overcome their grief and stress, but also be emotionally ready to support their students,” said a circular issued by directorate of education. As part of the plan, Delhi had engaged professional counsellors from Children First to work with mentor teachers and help them process their emotions and provide a space for engaging with their peers.

The accused, posing as bank officers, had siphoned Rs 10.40 lakh from a retired BHEL officer’s bank account on pretext of KYC verification/update.  They ran an organised online fraud racket, kingpin of which is a BTech graduate, while one of the nabbed accused is a law graduate. The kingpin speaks English fluently and is well-versed in banking procedures. Police were shocked to see the bank statements of the accused and they are suspected to have duped more than 1000 people across the country to the tune of more than Rs 10 crore. They lived in luxurious houses in their native villages on Jharkhand-West Bengal border, with sophisticated alarm systems, sensor-based doors and voice command light systems. Police seized an SUV and other goods, including a bank passbook, 13 mobile phones, 11 ATM cards, and 50 forged SIM cards from their possession. Villagers provided them a protective cover whenever police raided the area, due to which, the accused were able to dodge the cops and carried on with their criminal activities. They made calls posing as bank employees to victims across the country from agriculture fields and woods. ASP (cyber crime branch) Ankit Jaiswal said, on the basis of technical investigations, police zeroed in on the accused, who stayed in far-off villages of Jharkhand and West Bengal. Acting on information, a police team was sent to Asansol from where they nabbed five accused, including the kingpin of the gang.  Jaiswal said, the accused were identified as Mohammed Imran Ansari, a resident of Jamtara Jharkhand, Abhishek Singh, a resident of Chitranjan in WB, Mohammed Afzal, Gulam Mustafa, both residents of Asansol in West Bengal, and Sanju Debnath, a resident of South 24 Parganas. Imran is the kingpin of the gang and he communicated with the victims on phone posing as a bank officer. ASP said that Imran transferred the money into fraudulent bank accounts after taking the details and OTPs from the victims. Afzal and Sanju withdrew the cash from bank accounts through ATMs and gave it to Imran so that the kingpin was never caught on any camera fitted at the ATMs. The accused duped thousands of people in the past 3-4 years from MP, Delhi, UP, Maharashtra and other states. Cops are going through their bank details to assess the amount illegally siphoned by them from victims’ bank accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/online-fraud-racket-busted-kingpin-hails-from-jamtara/articleshow/83967377.cms||Sudeept Mishra

Titled ‘long-term literacy training and its impact on cognitive functioning’, the project was sanctioned to Prof Ramesh Kumar Mishra, Center for Neural and Cognitive Sciences (CNCS), School of Medical Sciences through the IoE scheme. It involves an intensive training programme on a large number of participants (approximately 120) and a wide array of tasks for measuring cognitive functioning. The project was inaugurated at the Government Primary School, Serilingampally on June 27. “The current IoE project extends these experimental approaches to bilingual illiterates from low socio-economic strata in India for the first time. A key novelty of the project is to examine if literacy training in two languages is more beneficial than training in one language. The outcome of this project has serious implications for policy-making with regards to improving literacy in India,” read a press release issued by UoH. The research team, which will carry out the testing and training, will be headed by Vaishnavi Mohite, a third year PhD student at CNCS. The inauguration ceremony ended with the participants registering themselves for the study. The pre-training phase of data collection will begin in the next week, which will be followed by the eight-month long training programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/project-to-investigate-impact-of-literacy-training-on-cognitive-functioning/articleshow/83969614.cms||---

Saying that BJP was indulging in drama, BSP chief Mayawati said the party ignored Dr BR Ambedkar and crores of his followers for the entire duration in which they were in power and now, when the assembly elections are round the corner, the government is laying the foundation stone for a cultural centre. “BSP is not against any centre that is built or set up in Dr Ambedkar’s name but to do this for political gains is nothing but being deceitful. If UP government had undertaken this project earlier, the President would not have been laying the foundation stone for it but inaugurating it which would have been better,” she said. She held all parties guilty of drama and deceit in the name of Ambedkar, saying that they were identical when it came to harassing Dalits and backwards, meting out injustice to them and trampling upon their rights. “Lakhs of reserved posts for Dalits and backward classes in the government are lying vacant and grand memorials and parks made by BSP government in the name of the gurus, seers and well known persons from these communities are lying in neglect since the time of the previous SP government.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court refuses to take up former Union minister Y Sujana Chowdary’s plea||HYDERABAD: Justice K Lakshman of the high court on Tuesday found fault with the counsel representing former Union minister and Rajya Sabha member Y Sujana Chowdary for insisting on granting permission to allow the MP to fly to the US to attend a seminar there as an invitee without furnishing to the court particulars and copy of the invitation. The MP has a lookout notice against him that prevents him to fly to foreign nations without valid reasons. CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) had earlier registered cases against Best and Crompton Engineering Projects company for certain financial frauds. The MP was once a director in the company, but later claimed he exited the firm. The probe agencies initially called him as a witness, but later started confronting him with more material against him. He started questioning the summons issued by the probe agencies in various high courts. Against this backdrop, CBI and ED got a lookout notice issued against him through immigration officials. The advocates representing him have urged the court to grant them an order enabling the MP to fly abroad. CBI counsel K Surender opposed any such relief, because he was not informed about the efforts of the MP’s advocates. The judge then verified whether they filed any proof of the seminar and invitation. On being told that no material of that sort was placed before the court, Justice Lakshman declined to take up hearing on an urgent basis. He posted the case to July 7. The judge also closed another petition filed by MP Sujana earlier challenging notices issued to him by CBI in Best and Crompton Engineering Projects case. CBI counsel Surender said the MP had earlier appeared before the CBI and the case was progressing. Investigators might call him if they need. The judge asked the CBI to issue him a fresh notice if it wants to call him again and asked the advocates for Sujana to challenge the fresh notices if they have any grievance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-refuses-to-take-up-sujanas-plea/articleshow/83969646.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

On Monday afternoon, he and his wife had gone to a banquet hall in Bavdhan to attend a marriage,” Ramekar said. They had hired an autorickshaw from Kasba Peth, but its driver had dropped them at Chandni Chowk. “They were waiting for public transport to reach the hall, about 2km from Chandni Chowk,” Ramekar said. He said a white car stopped near the couple around 11am. The person sitting next to the driver asked the elderly man where they wanted to go. When he told them that they would go to Bavdhan, the suspect told him that he would drop them to the hall because he and the man in the driver’s seat were going in that direction. “The duo drove the car towards the expressway instead of going to Bavdhan after the couple sat in the car,” Ramekar said. The elderly jewellery businessman, out of fear, did not ask the duo where they were going. The suspects stopped the car along the expressway at Kivale after driving about 20km from Chandni Chowk. “The duo threatened to thrash the couple and removed two gold chains and ring collectively worth Rs1.5 lakh from the elderly man’s wife and drove away,” Ramekar said. He said the complainant could not note down the registration number of the car. “He told us that the duo were about 35 years old and speaking in Marathi,” Ramekar said, adding that the Dehu Road police had decided to put up boards along the Pune-Mumbai Expressway and the highway to alert people that they should not take or offer lift to/from unknown people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/duo-rob-elderly-couple-on-expressway-after-offering-lift/articleshow/83967394.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Lucknow||Dr BR Ambedkar espoused welfare of all, says President Ram Nath Kovid||LUCKNOW: Laying the foundation stone for a cultural and research centre dedicated to Dr BR Ambedkar in Lucknow on Tuesday, President Ram Nath Kovid hailed the architect of the Constitution as an educationist, economist, jurist, politician, journalist, sociologist and social reformer who also contributed to culture, religion and spirituality. “A message strongly espoused by Ambedkar in his life and work was that in a democracy, it is the responsibility and duty of the government to ensure the welfare of every single person. I am happy to say that the current government is working on realising the basic principle behind this,” the President said. President Ram Nath Kovind presenting his book, ‘Loktantra Ke Swar’, to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on TuesdayKovind said that important places associated with Ambedkar have been developed into pilgrimage sites. He pointed out that Lucknow was his ‘sneh sthal’ as Bodhanand, whom he revered almost as much as his Guru and Pragyanand, who gave Amabedkar his diksha, both lived in the city. “Ambedkar used to visit Lucknow frequently to see them. I thank the UP government for choosing this day to lay the foundation stone for his memorial as this was the day in 1928 that he launched the weekly paper 'Samta'. His life was focussed on establishment of a samta mukul, a sentiment which is present even in the Preamble. His contribution to nation-building and his well-rounded personality give us an introduction to his extraordinary capabilities,” the President said. Governor Anandiben Patel credited Ambedkar for ensuring that the Constitution was not just a legal document but also a social document. She said that she hoped the cultural centre would be an inspiration for the youth. “He was of extraordinary character and his life as an inspiration for all of us. His contribution in working for India’s independence and in the making of the Constitution will be written in golden letters. Ambedkar fought for Dalits, backward classes, equality for women and against ignorance and superstition,” she said. The Governor added that Ambedkar’s focus on ensuring that education brings light to the lives of people helped in the construction of the nation. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that Ambedkar was not just revered in India but every time when Dalits, backwards and marginalised societies were discussed anywhere in the world, Ambedkar’s contribution is remembered. “In 1928, 93 years ago, he started the weekly paper 'Samta', aimed at a samta muluk. The fight for independence was on then and despite all hurdles, he completed his education and also contributed immensely to what India is today. I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ensuring that all sites associated with him, like his birth place in Mau, the centre of his social life in Delhi, Mumbai and even the house in which he lived while he was in London, have been converted to memorials,” he said. The Bharat Ratna Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar Memorial and Cultural Centre, located in Lucknow’s Aishbagh, will feature a 45-foot statue of Ambedkar, an urn containing his ashes, a library, auditorium, research centre etc. The project is expected to cost around Rs 50 crore and sources indicated that a portion of the Centre may be completed by the first week of December so that it can be inaugurated on Ambedkar’s death anniversary on December 6, just ahead of the 2022 UP assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ambedkar-espoused-welfare-of-all-says-president-kovind/articleshow/83969651.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Nagpur||Finally, Essel World is out of Gorewada zoo project||NAGPUR: Finally, the joint venture company (JVC) formed to implement the Gorewada international zoo project in the city has split with the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) deciding to issue a termination notice to its partner Essel World. On October 9, 2020, TOI was the first to report about the JVC running into rough weather after the state law & judiciary department gave the nod to terminate the joint venture for breach of tender conditions. “Recently, the state government issued a letter in this regard. Based on the state direction, two weeks ago, we first issued a letter to Essel on ‘intent to terminate’. The JVC partner also replied asking us to issue a termination order. We will soon issue a formal order,” said N Vasudevan, managing director of FDCM. The joint venture between FDCM & Essel World Leisure Private Limited, Mumbai, was signed on September 6, 2018, to implement the Rs 452-crore Gorewada zoo project on a PPP basis with 51:49 stakes. Essel was roped in by the BJP-Shiv Sena state government to expedite the project. Of the Rs 451-crore project, viability gap funding (VGF) by the government was Rs200 crore while the remaining amount was to be invested by Essel, which was not done. The firm paid Rs 3.81 crore to a consultancy firm to change designs and layouts of the project. BL Gautam, former managing director of FDCM Essel World Gorewada Zoo Private Limited, who quit the joint venture, said, “The bone of contention was the 26 hectares revenue land adjoining the Gorewada forest. The FDCM was to hand over the piece of land to us for commercial development.” Gautam added, “We had plans to develop an adventure park, hotels and resorts to match international standards and bring in global tourists. For this, we had roped in acclaimed zoo designer Bernard Harrison. The land was not handed over and we couldn’t wait longer. No attempts were made to listen to us. Though we are waiting for a formal termination order, we had decided to quit the joint venture even before its inauguration in January this year. We expect an honorable settlement.” On the future of the project after the JVC muddle, Vasudevan said, “Either we have to go it alone or find another partner. Essel had to bring in Rs 250 crore but it never came. The state alone spent Rs 140 crore on Indian Safari. Till a new partner is found, we will take the responsibility of African Safari whose designs have already been approved by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA). We are confident of completing the project.” BREAK UP * Essel fails to pay Rs 9 crore performance guarantee and also withdraws EMD of Rs 2.25 crore * After state government clears break up, 2 weeks ago FDCM issues order to Essel intending to terminate JV * In 51:49 JV, Essel has shares worth Rs 4.90 lakh and FDCM Rs 5.10 lakh * Essel has spent over Rs 3.80 cr on designing the zoo project * FDCM needs another partner or go it alone||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/finally-essel-world-is-out-of-gorewada-zoo-project/articleshow/83967420.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Bhopal||Pragya Thakur voices concern over relocation of 3 EME Centre||BHOPAL: BJP Lok Sabha MP Pragya Thakur has supported the demand made by the All India EME Army Civil Personnel Association to call off the relocation of the EME centre from Bhopal to Secunderabad in Telangana. The Bhopal MP on Tuesday said she will discuss the matter with the concerned authorities and even write a letter to defence minister Rajnath Singh, urging him to keep the centre at the Madhya Pradesh state capital. “Members of the EME association had approached me with a demand letter against the shifting of the Bhopal EME centre to Secunderabad. I will verify and discuss with the authorities about the decision. In case they are firm on relocating, I will write a letter to the Union defence minister in a day or two, urging him to intervene and stop the relocation of the EME centre,” Thakur told TOI. The BJP MP further said, “The EME centre should not be relocated from Bhopal because the cost of shifting will be huge. Many people will suffer, especially those who are established here, for so many years. Some are affected due to the gas tragedy, some face financial problems. They will suffer and the running cost of the centre will also increase. Employment will also be hit. I will discuss all these issues.” The demand letter submitted by the association members stated that the 3 EME Centre, is an added facility in the state capital. The soldiers had helped civilians many times and even played an important role in the 1984 gas tragedy and the 1992 communal riots. Similar decisions to shift the EME centre were taken in 1952, 1957 and 2012, but they were cancelled on the instructions of the then defence ministers. “Most of the employees working in the centre are natives of Bhopal. Many of them are still suffering from the after-effects of the gas tragedy. Treatment facilities for them are being provided only in Bhopal hospitals and not in other states. Relatives of the employees are working in government or non-government organisations in and around Bhopal, whose transfer to other states is not possible,” read the memorandum. “EME being the technical core, the personnel are present throughout the year at the centre and they are always available to tackle any emergency situation and to assist the state. Geographically, the Bhopal-based centre is also a suitable place for Army training,” the memorandum added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pragya-voices-concern-over-relocation-of-3-eme-centre/articleshow/83967441.cms||Rajendra Sharma
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Double murder case cracked, three held||HYDERABAD: An unemployed man along with two contract killers was arrested for a double murder in Mancherial on June 18. The assailants strangled to death the jobless man’s wife and his mother-in-law. In the early hours of June 18, P Vijaya Lakshmi, 47, a widow from Brindavan Colony in Mancherial, and her daughter Raveena, 27, were found strangled to death at the former’s house. Initial probe revealed that Raveena fell in love with K Arun Kumar, an unemployed man she came in contact through a social media platform’s video game page, in 2019 and they married in June 2020. After the marriage, the couple moved to Bodhan and Arun reportedly harassed Raveena for dowry. Unable to put up with his harassment, Raveena returned to her mother’s house in Mancherial in December 2020. Suspecting that Lakshmi encouraged Raveena to terminate her pregnancy, Arun planned to eliminate both. Subsequently, two domestic harassment cases were registered against Arun at Mancherial Women police station and Mancherial Town PS, Mancherial ASP Akhil Mahajan said. After the murder, the accused escaped with some gold jewellery and a laptop found at the house. During investigation, police noticed Arun’s movement in the town and cell phone activity. They arrested Arun from Nizamabad and, based on his confession, arrested J Roshaiah alias Bittu and D Venkata Subba Rao alias Subbu from Vijayawada on Monday. They were remanded in judicial custody on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/double-murder-case-cracked-3-held/articleshow/83969653.cms||---

They also attempted to rob a grocery store in Bibvewadi after assaulting its owner. The incidents took place on the evening of June 27. Two FIRs were registered with the Kondhwa police and one with the Bibvewadi police on Monday. Deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Namrata Patil told TOI, “A three-member newly-formed gang is involved in the serial robberies because they have used the same modus operandi -- threatening their victims with a sickle and travelling in an autorickshaw.” Patil said, “We have arrested one of the suspects Shoaib Abdul Razak Phulari (29) from Meethangar in Kondhwa after his images were caught by a CCTV camera at the Bibvewadi grocery store. Police teams are looking for his two accomplices on the run.” “Phulari is a first-time offender. They may have committed petty offences, but such cases have not been reported to the police. The robberies committed by them are serious,” she said and appealed to people to come forward and register their complaints. In the first two incidents reported at Saibabanagar in Kondhwa, the trio threatened bakery owners Rauf Mansuri (26) and Raifuddin Ansari (36) and their staff with a sickle and stole cash Rs12,000 and Rs20,000, respectively, from the cashboxes. In the third incident, Phulari barged into a grocery store at Bibvewadi, assaulted its owner Hanuman Chaudhary (26) with a sickle, snatched his mobile phone and threw it away to prevent him from making phone call, and threatened his staff with dire consequences. Phulari attempted to rob money from the cashbox, but the owner raised an alarm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gang-targets-two-bakeries-in-kondhwa-grocery-store-in-bibvewadi/articleshow/83967465.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||Special drive to bring more farmers under PM crop cover scheme||Lucknow: Initiating a major farmer outreach, the BJP government in UP is set to roll out a special drive to enroll farmers under the PM’s crop insurance scheme, provisioning financial cover to crops that sustain damage due to adverse weather. The seven-day drive, starting July 1, will focus on 75 development blocks in the state – many of them being Dalit-dominated – where enrollment of farmers under the crop insurance scheme is low. The move comes amid prolonged agitation by farmers against the new farm laws, which is attaining political overtones to threaten BJP’s electoral prospects in states, including UP, where assembly elections are due next year. The Centre has identified eight blocks in different aspirational districts – Bahraich (Rakabganj), Shravasti (Sirsiya), Balrampur (Utraula), Siddharthnagar (Lotan), Fatehpur (Hathgaon), Chitrakoot (Ramnagar), Sonbhadra (Bagni) and Chandauli (Niyamtabad) – where crop insurance enrolment is low. Besides these, the state government has identified Varanasi (Sevapuri), Gorakhpur (Campierganj) and Deoria (Patherdeva) where the number of farmers covered under the scheme is inadequate. Additional chief secretary (agriculture), Devesh Chaturvedi, said special vans would be sent to rural precincts to get farmers covered under the scheme at their doorsteps. Talking to TOI, the ACS (agriculture) said a number of insurance companies had come forward for the campaign. The drive, scheduled to be flagged off by UP agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi on July 1, also coincides with the government’s ‘Bharat Ka Amrut Mahotsav’ campaign which is being organised to mark the 75th Independence Day next year. The Centre has decided to dedicate January 13, 2022, to the PM’s crop insurance scheme. “The first week of July and December will be dedicated to Kharif and Rabi crops, respectively. Under the campaign, not only insurance companies but also banks and Jan Suvidha Kendra (JSK) will be engaged to ramp up the participation of farmers in crop insurance schemes,” Chaturvedi said. In a communique to all district magistrates, the ACS (agriculture) has also pitched for the use of social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, to project the benefits of the schemes. He added that the message of the scheme should also be telecast through audio-visual means and regional TV channels. The agriculture department has asked district officials to decide the route of campaign vans in such a manner that maximum blocks and nyaya panchayats get covered. Officials have also been directed to camp in villages and hold meetings to assess the progress of the campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/special-drive-to-bring-more-farmers-under-pm-crop-cover-scheme/articleshow/83969705.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED accuses Deshmukh of ‘misrepresenting facts’||Mumbai: Former state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday sent a letter to ED through his advocate, in which he said investigating officers (IOs) can record his statement through video-conferencing. In the letter, Deshmukh stated that the case against him is politically motivated and an attempt by the Central government “to suppress and oppress their political opponents like me”. Sources said the ED decided to reply to Deshmukh’s letter by stating that under the law, it’s the discretion of the IO to decide the mode/manner of questioning, and a suspect cannot dictate terms to him. In its reply, the ED reportedly stated that Deshmukh is misrepresenting facts by stating that ED officials had recorded his statement under PMLA’s (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) Section 50 on June 25. His statement was recorded under PMLA’s Section 17, which they do after searching any premises of a suspect for evidence, the agency said. The ED’s investigation found that Rs 4.7 crore illegally collected from bar owners by Waze was transferred to Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based educational trust by his son Hrishikesh, the money having been routed through hawala operators and shown as a donation. The money was allegedly collected on the instructions of Anil Deshmukh, who resigned as home minister after the controversy. The ED last week arrested Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande (an additional collector rank officer) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde in the money laundering case. The two have been remanded in ED custody, and officials are questioning them about Deshmukh’s illegal cash transactions. The ED has summoned Deshmukh for his statement under PMLA’s Section 50, where the person is bound to attend in person or through authorised agents, as an officer may direct, to make statements and produce the required documents. In the letter to ED on Tuesday, Deshmukh asked for a copy of Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-accuses-deshmukh-of-misrepresenting-facts/articleshow/83969709.cms||Vijay V Singh

He said 6,968 paddy purchase centres were opened across the state in the first week of April and 92 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured. Paddy from 15 lakh farmers was collected. “As against 13.24 lakh tonnes purchased in the summer season of 2014-15, 92 lakh tonnes was procured this Yasangi season,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/92-lakh-tonne-paddy-procured-in-telangana/articleshow/83969679.cms||---

The Rajya Sabha MP demanded action against those who spread “false propaganda against the Indian National Congress, its members and its leader on Twitter and other social media platforms”. In his letter, Digvijaya claimed that by way of a “premeditated strategy, the image of Congress is being maligned and tarnished on various social media platforms”. “I would like to bring to your notice that on 12/06/2021 an account by the name of ClubHouse Leaks was created on Twitter. On the same date at 04:03am, a tweet was posted,” Digvijaya wrote. “In the tweet, an audio clip of a ClubHouse app meeting was attached. The context and the audio data were edited and posted with the intention of defaming me,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/diggy-writes-to-union-min-on-twitter-handle/articleshow/83967477.cms||Suchandana Gupta
---||Goa||Goa: BJP ready to go it alone for state polls, ‘but gates open’||PANAJI: Even as the political undercurrents in the state are not very favourable to BJP, its state executive meeting, held on Tuesday, focused on boosting the morale of the cadre and sent a clear message to its karyakartas and functionaries that they all have to unitedly work hard to get a simple majority in the 2022 assembly elections on its own. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, state BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said, “Today (Tuesday) BJP has decided to contest the next assembly election independently, on its own strength, but BJP is keeping an option open.” The BJP leadership tried to nullify and counter the perception that the government failed miserably in Covid management, leading to more than 3,000 deaths in the state. Top party functionaries tried to impress upon the executive committee members that chief minister Pramod Sawant did his best in Covid management and now the state is “marching ahead” in vaccination. A lot of time was devoted in heaping praises on the chief minister for “ably leading” the state. The party’s state executive condemned “the machinations and false propaganda” against the BJP government and expressed full confidence in the leadership and performance of the Sawant-led government. Sawant and organising secretary Satish Dhond’s message to the committee was clear that the organisation has to be galvanised at the grassroots level, and that they need to counter the opposition “lies”. Dhond was terse in his speech wherein he said that the party has to get a majority “at any cost”. He emphasised that the party will, as of now, go it alone to the polls. While BJP has lately seen several of its functionaries staking claim for the ticket in their respective constituencies, there was no discussion of it at the state executive. Former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar (Mandrem), Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar, Sidharth Kuincalienker (Panaji), and former sports minister Ramesh Tawadkar (Canacona) have all staked claim for BJP tickets. It was only later, at the briefing, that Tanavade said that the party has informed its executive committee members not to go public expressing their desire to contest the next assembly election. Stating that he has a positive outlook towards the claims made by BJP senior functionaries about contesting the next assembly elections, Tanavde, however, said, “We can only recommend names for the tickets and the parliamentary board will decide.” The executive committee meeting was attended by the chief minister, ministers, MLAs, former chief minister, BJP district president and BJP senior functionaries. Sawant said that BJP has started preparations for the next assembly elections. Tanavade said that the elections will be held as scheduled in February. When asked if some of the MLAs who joined BJP have expressed no desire to contest the next assembly election on the BJP ticket, Tanavade said that all BJP MLAs were present at the state executive committee meeting and that he has faith in them. “Nobody has brought any such thing to my notice,” he said. The party said that with more than 7.45 lakh persons getting vaccinated till Monday, Goa has earned the distinction of being the first among all states to vaccinate more than 70% of its population. The party said that its government has successfully completed four years in office in the state, with a stable development-centric government under the leadership of Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-ready-to-go-it-alone-for-state-polls-but-gates-open/articleshow/83969716.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Four get life in jail for killing constable in Rajkot||RAJKOT: Four people were sentenced to life imprisonment for brutally killing a police constable and injuring his cousin in a village of Gondal taluka of Rajkot district in 2018. The Gondal sessions court on Tuesday convicted and sentenced to life Rajendrasinh Jadeja, Madhubha Jadeja, Mayursinh Jadeja and Kripalsinh Jadeja for the murder of constable Narendrasinh Jadeja. A minor accused (now an adult) involved in the crime is facing trial in juvenile court. Special prosecutor Narendrasinh Zala told TOI: “The incident happened on May 12, 2018. Rajendrasinh was being elected as sarpanch in Mespar village for the last 30 years and he was acting like a dictator. People were petrified of him, but many youngsters from the village joined the police force and created a panel against him in the panchayat election. This enraged Rajendrasinh.” Narendrasinh was deputed as the commando of an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) in Rajkot. His friend Anirudhsinh Jadeja had decided to contest the panchayat polls against Rajendrasinh. According to the case details, the four accused had intercepted the bike of Anirudhsinh and hit him on his head with an axe. Thereafter, Jadeja put his hand on his head and chopped his four fingers with the second strike. The fingers were found at the place of the incident. The assailants thought that Anirudhsinh had died and were preparing to leave the spot. However, in the meantime, the victim’s cousin brother Narendrasinh came on the bike but before he could understand anything, the accused also attacked him with sharp-edged weapons. They took Narendrasinh’s body to their farm from where it was recovered. Aniruddh’s life was saved but he has suffered debilitating injuries which has left him bed-ridden. However, he was the eyewitness and described the ordeal before the court. “After considering the arguments of both the sides, the court convicted the accused and sentenced them to life imprisonment,” Zala added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/4-get-life-in-jail-for-killing-constable/articleshow/83962880.cms||---
---||Dehradun||I will contest and win the assembly by-poll: Dehradun chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat||DEHRADUN: Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Tuesday said that he will contest and win an assembly bypoll. On the sidelines of an event at Ramnagar, he said, “Around half a dozen MLAs have offered me their constituency. I will follow the party instructions and contest from a seat assigned to me.” This was in response to Congress’s allegation that state is on the verge of “constitutional crisis” as chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat needs to win an assembly seat before the elections, likely to be held last year, and he cannot contest a bypoll when the assembly election is less than a year away. Nav Prabhat, who was transport minister in the Harish Rawat government, had pointed out that provisions of section 151A of the Representation of the People Act mandate that a bypoll cannot be held in a situation where only a year is left for state polls. “CM Tirath Singh Rawat’s six-month tenure ends on September 10, BJP will have no option but to name a new chief minister,” Prabhat had told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/i-will-contest-and-win-the-assembly-by-poll-cm-rawat/articleshow/83965300.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Goa||Goa: Fed up of patchy internet, Sattari students march to BSNL office||VALPOI: Fed up with the continued struggle with their online classes due to network connectivity issues and no response from the authorities despite repeated appeals, students from the remote villages of Kodal, Satre and Derode in Sattari taluka, on Tuesday, marched to the BSNL office at Valpoi in protest. While the connectivity issue is not new, and was faced even during the last academic year, the students were hopeful that things would be different this year as the state government had a year to put measures in place. Somnath Gawas, a student from Satre, said that they had written to the panchayat stating the challenges faced by them in attending online classes. “The letter was even forwarded to chief minister Pramod Sawant, but till date there has been no reply from him,” he said. Class X student, Chaya Gawas’ frustration is very apparent when she says that they have to travel 16km from Satre to the neighbouring village of Ambedem-Nargargao just to get network connectivity. Adding to their woes is the poor transport facility. Families of many of the children do not own vehicles and the children are forced to make their own way to the neighbouring village. “Since we don’t have proper transport facilities, many times we have to walk to Ambedem-Nargargao to attend our online classes,” Chaya said. Somnath said that he is forced to take a lift from strangers at times. TOI had recently reported how the problem is exacerbated in remote villages with students even forced to trek through remote forests, literally putting their lives at risk not only because of the wild animals, but also because of the jungle paths that can become treacherously slippery during the monsoon, just to reach higher ground in search of network connectivity. The sight of students huddled under temporary tarpaulin structures has become a common sight in the state since the past year. However, walking to the closest village with network connectivity does not seem to be the solution for these students. Another student said that even in Ambedem-Nagargao they don’t get proper network and are frequently disconnected from their online classes. “Since we are unable to connect to our online classes we will be left out and other students, those who have good network connectivity, will excel in their exams,” Somnath said. The students have now demanded that BSNL set up proper connectivity in their villages. They have said that if the government or officials don’t take this issue seriously, then they will once again march to the BSNL office in large numbers and hold a protest. BSNL officials at Valpoi told the students that they would look into the matter and will solve the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fed-up-of-patchy-internet-sattari-students-march-to-bsnl-office/articleshow/83969755.cms||Afaq Khan
---||Lucknow||Proposal to rename Jhansi railway station after Lakshmibai||LUCKNOW: After Allahabad and Mughalsarai, now there is a proposal to rename Jhansi railway station after the local warrior queen Lakshmibai, the leading figure of India’s first war of Independence in 1857. The Jhansi DM confirmed to TOI that a proposal in this regard has been sent to the state government. According to highly placed sources in the government, the proposal is likely to be forwarded to the Centre soon for further action. “The local MP had recommended the change of the name of the railway station. We have given consent on the name-change and sent it to the state government,” Jhansi DM Andra Vamsi confirmed to TOI. Jhansi MP Anurag Sharma told TOI that the proposal to rename the railway station was mooted about two years ago during a Railways zonal meeting, adding “the proposal was made in the presence of people's representative of Bundelkhand region.” “The decision was mentioned in the minutes of the meeting and now has gone to the state government for its views,” Sharma added. After coming to power in 2017, the BJP government has changed names of three prominent places -- Allahabad, Mughalsarai and Faizabad. Allahabad is now Prayagraj, Mughalsarai is Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar and Faizabad is Ayodhya. While names of Allahabad and Mughalsarai railway stations were also changed, Ayodhya Junction railway station already exists. Unlike Allahabad and Faizabad, there is no proposal to change the name of the city in case of Jhansi. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has been indicating that the state government would go ahead with the name-change wherever it found necessary. “We did what we felt was good.

A huge task force of officials visited residences and issued showcause notices before disconnecting power lines. Some were in slums or chawls while others were in buildings across MMR. “We have to recover arrears of pending electricity bills to the tune of Rs 568 crore across MMR. Efforts are being taken and the teams are working under supervision of chief engineer Suresh Ganeshkar,” said an MSEDCL spokesperson. Of those who faced temporary power disconnections, 2,869 are in Mumbai, 7,384 in Thane, 2,614 in Nerul, 5,376 in Panvel area and 3,308 in Vashi, among other places in MMR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-electricity-for-34000-in-mmr-over-unpaid-bills/articleshow/83969824.cms||Somit Sen

His name is on the panel of three officers prepared by the Union Public Service Commission out of which the UP government has to make its selections. The other two officers on the panel are 1986 batch officer Nasir Kamal, and Goyal's batchmate RP Singh. However, Goyal's name as the top choice started doing the rounds on Tuesday when he was spotted meeting some bigwigs in the government. Goyal at present is posted as the ADG, Border Security Force. Nasir Kamal is posted director, National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science, New Delhi. RP Singh is the DG, Economic Offence Wing (EOW) in UP. The race for UP's top cop's post began when it became clear that the present DGP HK Awasthy, who is retiring on June 30, declined to take an extension. Since then the state government was waiting for the UPSC to hold a meeting to finalize the names. The commission eventually met on Tuesday to prepare the panel. As per the set procedure, UPSC would send the panel of three names to the state government on Wednesday. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath would then select one of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mukul-goyal-front-runner-to-take-over-as-up-police-chief/articleshow/83969796.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

Getting fresh water to quench their thirst in the salt marsh of the Thar desert was like a mirage for the Border Security Force (BSF) soldiers. But that has changed thanks to the efforts of Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB) which has secured their water demands at Genda check post or 1079 border outpost in BSF’s jargon. Around 20 jawans are posted at one chowki. There are 40 such chowkis, located at 5 km distance between them, securing the 125 km border. So far, water to these chowkis came through tankers from Khavda, situated around 90 km away. But absence of proper roads made it difficult for vehicles to reach the check post. Since 2012, a team led by M G Thakkar from Kutch university’s geology department and GWSSB hydrologist Naresh Gor had started searching for freshwater stream in GRK. Using radio carbon dating, they started studying sediments that dated back to 50,000 to 1,00,000 years. Satellite imagery data from NASA and Hyderabad-based National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA) showed that a river system existed in the area centuries ago. Although a source for fetching sweet water was known in 2018, it was still not potable. “We drilled the ground with the assumption that there is a stream of Saraswati river flowing underground. The total dissolved solids (TDS) of water in this area is as high as 70,000-1 lakh. We drilled specific points where there was a possibility to fetch water of Saraswati river. We got water with 9,000 TDS which could be brought down to 200 TDS after filtering,” Gor told TOI. GWSSB provides 1 lakh litre treated water to BSF daily with each litre costing around 37 paise. Although this water is not enough, it has eased the hardships of jawans as well as the board. For all its chowkis, BSF requires 3-4 lakh litres water per day. Current filtration plant’s capacity is 7,000 litre per hour. But there is no surface water in 80 km area and the groundwater too is saline. “After we drilled borewell deeper, we started getting sweet water. We believe that this underground water is coming from Rajasthan which is on the upper plate,” said GWSSB’s executive engineer Ashok Ladhar. Since the last three years, the borewell is providing 7,000-8,000 litre water without use of any machinery. Water collected in a tank of BSF and four plastic tanks of 10,000 litres capacity each installed by GWSSB is distributed to all the chowkis. Dependency on water tankers to end GWSSB has dug two more underground borewells near Sandip post and Khardoi post, located 5 km and 20 km respectively from the existing outpost that is equipped with a borewell. Water from these borewells is flowing naturally. As TDS levels of this water is in the range of 10,000-11,000, it can be treated and distributed among BSF jawans. The Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) and ISRO have studied the requirement. BARC has agreed to provide two more filtration plants. “We are also planning one more borewell near Narayan Sarovar. After that BSF would not require water tankers from Khavda and Bhuj,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sweet-water-stream-found-in-kutch-desert/articleshow/83963027.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Delhi||Malaria may get notifiable disease tag in Delhi soon||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is likely to declare malaria a notifiable disease soon. When a disease is declared notifiable, it is required by law to report every case to the government. The collation of information by the authorities helps in better monitoring of the disease and giving an early warning of a possible outbreak. In a videoconference meeting held by Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday, where minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain were also present besides others, Dr Harsh Vardhan emphasised on the need to make malaria a notifiable disease so that each and every case of malaria could be tracked and treated and the transmission could be identified. This issue was taken up with Delhi government last year also, the minister stated. “Delhi had originally planned to eliminate Malaria in 2020. The deadline has now been shifted to 2022,” the minister said, adding that capturing actual data from the hospitals and taking preventive actions in the areas of infection is critical to achieve elimination. “So is the regular reporting from the private sector essential for taking timely preventive measures and for accuracy of data pertaining to incidence of malaria,” Vardhan said. The process of notification is underway, an official said. Notification is necessary to bring all malaria cases on the state radar because after notification the private health facilities are mandated to report all malaria cases they treat to the local health authorities.  The LG stated that Delhi can’t afford to have an outbreak of malaria, dengue or chikungunya during Covid-19 pandemic. “The three municipal corporations will spearhead the action on controlling vector in their localities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/malaria-may-get-notifiable-disease-tag-in-city-soon/articleshow/83967613.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Drug peddlers using passwords, digital payments for deliveries, says NCB||PANAJI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has said that its recent raids have revealed that drug peddlers are increasingly using digital payments and passwords to figure out if the customer is genuine, and to deliver the drugs. The NCB has noted that until a passcode is shared by the customer, the dealer doesn’t deliver the drugs. In two separate narcotic raids this week, the NCB arrested three people, including two Nigerians and one local, and seized drugs worth Rs 30 lakh. NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede said that in these operations, the bureau intercepted three persons at various locations and seized a total 60 tablets of ecstasy/MDMA, 350g of Nepali charas and 20 blots of LSD. In the first case, Wankhede said that on the basis of reliable information, a joint team of NCB Mumbai and Goa conducted a raid at Gaum Waddo, Anjuna, and seized 37 tablets of ecstasy/MDMA and a substantial quantity of charas, and intercepted one Roque Jose Fernandez. In a follow-up operation, an NCB team recovered 340g of Nepali charas from his two-wheeler parked at Anjuna. He also said that based on Fernandez’ preliminary disclosure, NCB intercepted one Nigerian namely Chidi Osita Okonkwo alias Benjamin with 23 tablets of ecstasy/MDMA. Wankhede said that Benjamin was intercepted after a 500m on-foot chase in the jungle. Three NCB officials were injured in the pursuit. “Benjamin was the main supplier of the drugs,” Wankhede said. “Fernandez is a notorious drug trafficker of North Goa. He was earlier booked in two NDPS cases and is presently out on bail.” Wankhede also said that Fernandez owns a hotel in Anjuna. “Fernandez operates the drug racket from his ice-cream parlour-cum-grocery store,” Wankhede said. “The drugs are booked at his ice-cream parlour and he delivers the drugs from one guest house in Anjuna. The payments were done digitally by using Google Pay, etc.” He also said that Fernandez also provided drugs to tourists and consumers in front of the guest house. Some complaints have been received from the neighbours and some tourists regarding the peddling of drugs. The NCB has said that Nepali charas is the pure form of charas. It is imported from Nepal and costlier than Indian charas. In the second operation, Wankhede said that the NCB intercepted one Nigerian, Onayeka Egike, and seized 20 blots of LSD at Bardez. “Preliminary investigation has revealed that the said accused uses a unique modus operandi to deliver the drug consignment — he uses passwords to identify genuine customers. He changes his delivery location multiple times, and makes the customer wait for 5-6 hours to ascertain their genuineness,” Wankhede said. Wankhede said that Egike used his two-wheeler to make the deliveries, and that the bike has also been seized. He was earlier booked in an NDPS case in 2019 by the crime branch, and is currently out on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/drug-peddlers-using-passwords-digital-payments-for-deliveries-ncb/articleshow/83969785.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Pune||PMPML plans to operate 1,500 vehicles up to 7pm||PUNE: The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) plans to run 1,500 buses daily despite the fresh restrictions and continue to operate till 7pm to enable people to reach their home. “There are fresh restrictions and establishments have been told to shut down by 4pm. However, we are not thinking of reducing the number of buses,” PMPML’s chairman-cum-managing director Rajendra Jagtap told TOI. He, however, said the transport body would act in accordance with the guidelines issued to them by the district administration. “The services of the PMPML will be curtailed in accordance with the guidelines given to us by the police. After 5pm, anyone taking the bus will be asked why he or she is travelling and if the reason is valid, they will be allowed to travel. Also, the services will be operational for those involved in essential services. We have decided that the buses will run till 7pm,” the CMD said. Another PMPML officials said, “There are many people who come to work in the city from as far as Rajgurunagar or Purandar. Even if they leave their offices at 4pm or 4:30pm, they will need at least two to two-and-a-half hours to reach home. As a public service provider, we need to ensure that buses for such people are available till late evening. Similarly, passengers with booked tickets need to reach home from the railway station.” Currently, the transport body operates 1,000 buses and ferries more than a lakh passengers daily. “Reducing the number of buses will lead to chaos and our earnings will also get affected. On Monday, the PMPML earned highest per day income of Rs53lakh since we resumed operation earlier this month. We plan to increase the number buses to 1,500 and keep them running till 7pm. After 7pm, we will tell all depots to reduce buses on all routes. However, a decent number of buses will still be on road till late evening on busy routes like the Pune Railway Station,” another official said. The official said that all the busy routes have been identified and additional buses will be plied on these routes to improve frequency. “We will try to ensure maximum number of buses on the road between 4pm and 7pm so that there is no crowding,” the official said. Meanwhile, the PMPML has submitted a depot development plan to the board of directors for approval. “The board will decide how things should move forward and what should be the mode of financing and operations. The idea is to focus on increasing the non-fare revenue and reduce operational losses. The plan focuses on making the depots self-sustainable,” another official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-plans-to-run-1500-buses-till-7pm-to-help-people-reach-home/articleshow/83967601.cms||Joy Sengupta

Ajit alias Vasudev Pai, from Khawat in Poinguinim, had bought 2,000 dragon fruit plants from Shirdi, Maharashtra, and, to his pleasant surprise, they have borne fruit in less than a year. The central government is promoting the cultivation of the lucrative exotic fruit, and, with Pai’s yield, Goa will be the latest addition to the list of states producing it. The latest batch of dragon fruit, or Kamalam, was exported from Sangli in Maharashtra to Dubai on Saturday. “The plant is highly suitable to Goan soil and to its humid climate. One can plant it even where soil may not be fertile. Since this plant is from the cactus family, it requires very little water. It can grow in any soil. I got results within one year of planting it. And each plant gives around 30 fruits,” said Pai, who earlier won the state’s Krishi Vibhushan award. The only investment required is cement poles for support (it’s a climber) and, once it reaches a height of five feet, a ring for resting. The dragon fruit contains fiber and is rich in nutritional value, as it helps repair the cell damage caused by oxidative stress and reduces inflammation, while also improving the digestive system. The fruit saw PM Narendra Modi praising the farmers of Kutch for its cultivation in his ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme in July 2020. It is a totally new plantation in Goa, with Pai being the first progressive farmer to adopt and raise this crop in a commercial manner. “The branches of the fruit are cut and used as saplings for further cultivation. It doesn’t need a regular water supply except during extreme summers. The fruit is harvested from May to October. It has a very low mortality rate too,” said Pai. In local markets, the dragon fruit can be purchased for Rs 50-75 a piece depending on availability, which is a better rate than farmers can fetch for existing crops like banana and pineapple. Pai has already started promoting its cultivation in his neighbourhood in Canacona. Ulhas Phaldesai has now cultivated 100 of the plants in a 1,000sqm area, while Babu Komarpant has raised 200 plants over an area of 2,000sqm, taking the saplings from Pai. In the high elevation areas of Canacona taluka, where water availability is increasingly an issue, dragon fruit could emerge as a solution for affected farmers, they feel. At present, the fruit, which already has a market in Goa, is being imported from Malaysia and Thailand. The farmers of Canacona are hoping to meet the local demand in the state with their production. Canacona zonal agriculture officer Kirtiraj Naik Gaonkar said that the fruit is best suited to tropical climates like Goa. Saturday saw agriculture director Nevil Alphonso visit Pai’s farm to inspect the dragon fruit plants. “It’s probably the first dragon fruit crop in Goa,” he said. “We are now growing these plants in our farms at Kodar and Kalay as a demonstration to observe its performance. Once we are confident of its economic viability, it will be promoted among the farmers in Goa.” From this year, the state agriculture department will grant subsidy to the growers of this exotic crop, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/enter-the-dragon-in-canacona-a-new-exotic-fruit-takes-root/articleshow/83969811.cms||Albert Fernandes
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid now the leading cause of death among new moms||MUMBAI: Haemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disorders and tuberculosis have for years been the leading causes of maternal mortality in Mumbai. In 2020-21, however, Covid-19 has raced past all to contribute to the biggest share of maternal deaths, according to data from the BMC. An analysis of 193 maternal deaths in Mumbai from April 2020 to March 2021 showed 16.5% were caused due to complications arising out of Covid-19. Sepsis, a life-threatening blood infection, came second contributing to 12% of deaths, TB and haemorrhage accounted for 8.8% each and heart ailments for 4%, as per RTI information gathered by Chetan Kothari. The city’s overall maternal mortality numbers (193) dropped 20% in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20 (241), possibly because of fewer deliveries amid the pandemic. From an average of 1.50lakh child births, deliveries dropped to 1.20lakh in 2020. A cause analysis in pre-Covid 2019-20 shows that up to 12.5% maternal deaths were caused by haemorrhage, 10% hepatitis (10%), nearly 8% sepsis and 7% by hypertensive disorders. The share of tuberculosis in maternal deaths though appears to have increased from 5% in pre-Covid times to 8.8% in 2020-21. A BYL Nair Hospital doctor said Covid does add to complications of the lung and other organs in a small percentage of pregnant women. “In our experience, most stay symptomatic and mildly symptomatic. Many found out they had Covid at the time of delivery,” the doctor added. The hospital has handled nearly 1,500 pregnancies since it was turned into a designated centre last April. In the second wave though, there has been a spurt in deaths in pregnant women. A total of 43 maternal deaths took place in April-May 2021, of which 28, or 65%, have been due to Covid-19. According to Dr Arun Nayak, head of gynaecology at Sion Hospital, Covid can become a precipitating factor in some cases, but there should be detailed studies to understand if the basic etiology of maternal deaths has changed. “Traditionally, sepsis, haemorrhage, hypertension have been some of the commonest causes and those continue to be formidable,” he said. Dr Nayak advocated for vaccination of pregnant women so that even the small ratio of deaths can be avoided. Some gynaecologists believe pregnant women have a major threat from Covid and should be vaccinated on priority. “Second wave has shown us the rate of maternal deaths, complications, still births and premature births was at least 7-8 times more in pregnant women. People make the mistake of comparing Covid incidence and deaths in pregnant women with the general population. They should compare pregnant women with Covid and pregnant women without Covid to understand the big difference in mortality,” said Dr Alpesh Gandhi, president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI). “The government should start vaccination of pregnant women without a day’s delay if they want to avoid deaths in young women,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-now-the-leading-cause-of-death-among-new-moms/articleshow/83967663.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||Twitter Booked Over Access To Child Porn||New Delhi: The Delhi Police Cyber Cell has registered a case under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Information Technology Act against Twitter after a complaint made by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights that links as well as material pertaining to child sexual abuse were available on the social media platform. Police registered the FIR on Monday. Chinmoy Biswal, PRO, Delhi Police, confirmed the registration of the FIR by the Cyber Crime unit and said investigation had started. According to the FIR, NCPCR received a complaint about online threats and repeated stalking of a minor girl on Twitter by Mohammed Zubair bearing Twitter handle @zoo_bear. He allegedly harassed, threatened and stalked the minor girl and his followers too posted indecent and disgraceful comments regarding the minor girl’s photos. The FIR reads, “The Commission took cognisance of the complaint under section 13 (1) (j) and (k) of CPCR Act, 2005, since the picture of a minor girl was seen to be circulated and posted by various twitter handles with indecent and disgraceful remarks/comments, which is violation of POCSO Act, 2012 and IPC, 1860, and forwarded the complaint to Delhi Cyber Cell for deemed lawful action, and also to Twitter for prompt action against the handle, as it is violation of aforesaid Acts and the policy and laws of US. An FIR was registered by Cyber Cell last year against Mohammad Zubair in the matter. However, the Twitter handle of Mohammad Zubair is still active and there seems to be no action initiated or taken by Twitter against the aforesaid person, who has exposed a minor to harassment in the virtual world.” The FIR states that the commission conducted an enquiry and “found evidence on the availability of such sites on the Dark and Deep Web. In this regard, total 31 sites were explored by NCPCR on dark web, of these, five were pertaining to Indian territory; 19 were seen to be possibly of Indian region and the rest were identified as international sites.” A Twitter spokesperson responded, “Twitter has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual exploitation and we have a proactive approach to combating sexual exploitation of minors on our service. We will continue to invest in proactive detection and removal of content that violates the Twitter Rules and work with law enforcement and NGO partners in India to tackle the issue.” It said it used the PhotoDNA technology, its own proprietary tools, and other systems to detect behavioural signals and remove media, or new accounts linked to this type of content, even before such content was posted. It also claimed that all viewing, sharing or linking to child sexual exploitation material, “contributed to the re-victimisation of the depicted children and is prohibited on Twitter platforms”. Additionally, Twitter said that in 2019, it launched a feature in its search prompt aimed at deterring child sexual exploitation in collaboration with the Union home ministry and Indian NGOs. It blacklists specific CSE search keywords in Hindi, English, Bengali and Kannada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/twitter-booked-over-access-to-child-porn/articleshow/83967691.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Four more BJP-backed candidates win Zila Panchayat chairman polls||LUCKNOW: In what furthered up its political victory over rivals, four more BJP-supported candidates got a walkover in Zila Panchayat (ZP) chairman elections after opposition- backed candidates withdrew their nomination on Tuesday. The four districts where opposition supported candidates took back their nomination are Saharanpur, Bahraich, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur. With this a total of 21 saffron party supported candidates have got elected as ZP chairperson, unopposed, in what marked BJP's key electoral victory in the run-up to UP assembly polls due next year. The other 17 districts where the BJP supported candidates got elected unopposed included: Chitrakoot, Agra, GB nagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Amroha, Moradabad, Lalitpur, Jhansi, Banda, Shravasti, Balrampur, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Mau and Varanasi. In Etawah, SP-supported candidate and party chief Akhilesh Yadav's cousin Anshul Yadav won unopposed as BJP did not field a candidate. The unopposed election of 21 BJP-supported candidates comes amid allegations of opposition, mainly Samajwadi Party, accusing the ruling party of rigging and orchestrating withdrawal of nomination by opposition-backed candidates for political gains. There will be an electoral contest for the ZP chairman seat in the rest 53 districts. Polling and counting of votes in these districts will be held on July 3 between 11 am and 3 pm, said state election commissioner, Manoj Kumar. The direct contest between the BJP and opposition-backed candidates will be in 38 districts including Ayodhya and Mathura, the nerve centres of Hindutva politics. In Bahraich, SP-supported Neha Ajiz withdrew her nomination making way for BJP's Manju Singh. Things took an interesting twist in Shahjahanpur where SP-supported candidate Beenu Singh walked into saffron camp, allowing BJP's Mamta Yadav to get elected unopposed. In Pilibhit, SP candidate Swami Pravaktanand took back his nomination allowing BJP- supported Baljeet Kaur to win. Pravaktanand was primarily a BJP-backed candidate who won Zila Panchayat ward elections. He, however, walked into SP fold after the BJP did not support him in the ZP chairman election. On Tuesday, the BJP managed to convince him and he withdrew his nomination. In Saharanpur, BJP-backed Mange Ram Chaudhary got a walkover after BSP-supported Jaiveer alias Johnny withdrew his nomination papers. The development came a day after BSP supremo Mayawati announced that her party would not support any candidates in ZP chairperson elections. The former UP CM had cited rigging as the key reason for staying away from the rural local bodies chairperson elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/4-more-bjp-backed-candidates-win-zp-chairman-polls/articleshow/83969849.cms||Pankaj Shah

As per the agreement signed with Kerala Government, further actions were taken. Land was acquired for the apparel park and the detailed project report was ready. Without pandemic affecting the work, our target was to finish the project by 2025,” Jacob said. It is difficult to continue operating even existing industrial units within Kerala – during the past one month, officials conducted surprise inspections 11 times in our premises. Forty to fifty officials come down in ten or fifteen vehicles and storm into each floor of the buildings and question workers, including women and take down their name, address and phone numbers. Each time, they spend three or four hours questioning 300-400 people, but they haven’t told us why they are conducting the inspection or what they have found, Jacob said in a statement. Of the 29 states in India, Kerala’s rank in ease of doing business is 28, he added. The only other state lagging behind Kerala is Tripura and it is evident from this fact that how far Kerala is business-friendly. States that were traditionally lagging like UP, Assam, Odisha and Jharkhand have improved their rankings. UP, which was far behind, came second, emerging as a hot destination for investors, he said. “During 1970s and 1980s, it was trade unions that killed the industries in Kerala, but now, it is the pseudo-environmentalists, bureaucrats and politicians who are killing the industry now. They will try to scare away those who won’t yield to their interests,” Jacob alleged in his statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kitex-to-drop-projects-worth-rs-3500cr/articleshow/83965461.cms||---

A local fisherman, Bhushan Pednekar, was surprised to find a larger than usual spot-fin porcupinefish with sharp spines in his net. “The fish was over a foot long and half a foot wide and weighed about two kilos,” Pednekar said, adding that he has netted this species earlier too, at least six times over the last 30 years, but those were smaller sized ones. Not a fish that is netted often, Keri locals say they have spotted it on rare occasions. The porcupinefish (Diodon Hystrix) inflates by swallowing water or air to avoid being swallowed by bigger fish. In fact, some of the bigger fish are known to keep away from it due to its sharp spines. “This fish can live up to 10 years and is generally seen in holes of shallow coral reefs. It is not normally used in cooking, except in some foreign countries,” ICAR fisheries scientist G B Sreekanth said. After clicking photos of the fish and checking for other details, Pednekar released it into the water. “The fish is highly poisonous, so I put it back in the river,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/spot-fin-porcupinefish-netted-in-tiracol/articleshow/83970048.cms||---

The wholesalers said they feared a drop in demand for vegetables and fruits, especially from eateries because the facilities were now allowed dine-in services only till 4pm. An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official said they were closely monitoring the daily crowd at the market and additional restrictions would be imposed in case of overcrowding. Madhukant Garad, chief administrator at APMC, said, “The vegetable and fruit market has been allowed to function at full capacity. But the traders have to strictly follow the guidelines. Wholesalers and retailers with valid passes will only be allowed to enter the market premises. The wholesalers are also told to avoid retail business.” Garad said squads have been told to conduct regular checks on the market premises to ensure that all Covid related norms were followed. The wholesalers were restricted to operate at 50% capacity till last month. They were recently allowed to function at full capacity. Vilas Bhujbal, head of the wholesalers’ association, said, “The market was functioning at half capacity for many months. The traders were functioning on alternate days. Only recently all traders were allowed to function on all days. We had requested the APMC administration not to curtail daily business again. The functioning of the market at full capacity is also benefiting the farmers. The closure of hotels and eateries at 4pm could lead to a drop in demand for vegetables.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gultekdi-veggie-fruit-market-to-function-at-full-capacity-timing-reduced-to-2pm/articleshow/83967686.cms||Sarang Dastane

Prima facie, it appears that brakes of a lift failed, which led to its sudden collapse and the fall of the labourers. Police said a mechanical inspection would be carried out to ascertain the exact cause of the incident. According to police, a call was received around 3pm about the incident. The caller reported that some labourers fell from a height at a DDA construction site. “Three of them were rescued and rushed to Shree Hospital in Sector-12, Dwarka while another was rushed to Tarak Hospital at Dwarka Mor. Panna Lal Yadav (50) was declared brought dead at Tarak Hospital, while Basant and Mangal Prasad Singh were declared brought dead at Shree Hospital. Another labourer, Surender Rai, (48) is under treatment for grievous injuries and doctors said he was unfit to give a statement. A case under appropriate sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered,” said Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police, Dwarka. Police said four of the labourers were working at the construction site and took the lift to go downstairs when it suddenly collapsed. So far, it is not clear if the labourers fell out of the lift or collapsed along with the lift. Senior DDA officials stated that a residential housing complex was under construction at the site. “An inquiry committee is being constituted to look into the matter and appropriate action will be taken based on the findings of the report,” said a DDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-labourers-die-after-lift-collapses-at-dda-site/articleshow/83967745.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad authorities, citizens wait for vaccine supply||AURANGABAD: After recently achieving a record 18,000 plus vaccinations in a day that largely included citizens aged 18 and above, Aurangabad continues to face an acute shortage of fresh stock of vaccines. Aurangabad city on Tuesday registered only 589 vaccinations as compared to a record 18,148 vaccinations done on June 26. For the second consecutive day on Wednesday, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has declared only one vaccination site for the first and the second dose of Covishield. Immunization officer with AMC Dr Smita Nalgirkar said that no official communication has been received from the state-level authorities as to when the fresh supply of stock will arrive. “Both municipal limits of Aurangabad and rural areas of the district are facing a shortage of vaccines. We hope that the fresh stock of vaccines arrives shortly to resume the immunization drive in a rigorous manner,” she said. The vaccination site at a shopping mall in the CIDCO area is scheduled to administer only 300 vaccine doses on Wednesday with authorities appealing to the citizens not to crowd the centre concerned. Besides, existing vaccination sites located at Kranti Chowk, Raj Nagar and MIT Hospital would continue to administer only the second dose of Covaxin. Besides health authorities, many citizens, especially those above 18 years of age, said that they were eagerly awaiting vaccine supply. “I completed stipulated period of three months after recovering from Covid-19 and was planning to take the first dose of vaccine. The death of vaccine doses being felt all of a sudden is very disturbing as many are citing apprehensions about possible third wave of Covid-19,” said Nilesh Dharashivkar, a city-based private professional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-authorities-citizens-wait-for-vaccine-supply/articleshow/83963040.cms||---

Even after five years, the acquisition process is yet to be completed! According to officials with the revenue department, back-to-back hurdles delayed the acquisition. “It was when the takeover process started that we came to know that it is not a normal acquisition and there are a lot of complications involved in it. The owner of the land was Regina, a woman from Fort Kochi. She took a loan of Rs 7 lakh from a person called Syed Mohammed and Rs 2 lakh from another person in Fort Kochi. She had given the land as surety to the money lenders,” an official with the revenue department said. “Later, she mortgaged the land and took a loan of Rs 15 lakh from the erstwhile Punjab National Bank. It was for paying all these debts and also to give compensation to the landowner, the government allotted Rs 91.44 lakh. But when the land acquisition process started, the loans and cumulative interests exceeded the allotted fund. Thus, the first attempt to acquire the structure and land stumbled upon shortage of funds,” the official said. Later, the government granted additional funds required for the acquisition in 2018. “As the acquisition process progressed, the funds had been diverted. The flood and pandemic situation led to fund crunch. Now, the government has again allotted adequate funds required for the acquisition,” sources said. According to officials associated with the acquisition, they are in the final stage of the process. “We have fixed the land value and compensation amount. We are preparing the final award, which is the procedure for giving compensation. We expect that the compensation amount can be given within a few days,” the officials said. Though the revenue officials tried to repay the loan, the bank authorities who agreed to settle the loan by paying Rs 30 lakh backtracked. The reason for the bank backtracking was that the revenue department couldn’t give the money before the deadline given by it. Moreover, those who lend money to the owner of the land also have moved the court demanding the amount with interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/5-years-on-revenue-dept-yet-to-take-over-synagogue/articleshow/83965612.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 881 encroachments identified in 11 water bodies of Ameenpur||Hyderabad: Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) has informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that 881 encroachments have been identified in 11 water bodies in Ameenpur. Even state-built Indiramma houses were on the encroached lakebed. Notices were issued to 780 structures under Section 23 of the Telangana Water, Land and Trees Act (WALTA). TSPCB has informed that remaining notices could not be issued as owners could not be identified. “Ameenpur municipality had issued notices to 637 identified encroachers under the Town & Country Planning Rules. So far, 259 replies were received from the encroachers, submitting that they have been residing in those houses for the past 20 years with necessary permissions,” PCB said in its reply. PCB prepared an action plant along with other stakeholders, including HMDA, for removal of encroachments and restoration of water bodies of Ameenpur. Notices will be served and encroachments removed. It was decided to construct pillars all along the water bodies’ FTL boundaries to prevent further encroachment. And, Rs 64 lakhs has been sanctioned for the purpose, it said. “The FTL and buffer zones are fixed for all the lakes. The Lake Protection Committee Meeting was conducted and vigilant teams, comprising members from revenue, irrigation, municipality, HMDA and police, to safeguard and protect the water bodies were formed. Tahsildar has been appointed as ‘point person’ for each water body under their jurisdiction. Display boards erected at every water body mentioning the name and phone number of the ‘point person’, while the girdawar of the mandal concerned has been made supervisory officer,” PCB added. Authorities took up restoration of the lakes under Mission Kakatiya programme and works were taken up with a sanction of Rs 5crore. Storm water drains have to be built to divert excess water flow from upstream areas to Uskebavi and Shambuni kunta, PCB said. “Underground sewage network is under progress,” the reply added. Authorities had identified 10 industries in upstream of Ameenpur Pedda Cheruvu. The fingerprint analysis of samples collected from the tank and the drains in April 2020 indicate no discharge of industrial effluents into the lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/881-encroachments-identified-in-11-water-bodies-of-ameenpur/articleshow/83967718.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Former Surendranagar collector K Rajesh, who was transferred to the state home department as joint secretary, law and order, was transferred again within a week and on Tuesday, he was posted as joint secretary, administrative reforms and training division (ARTD) in the general administration department (GAD). Complaints were made against Rajesh in the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) during his stint as Surendranagar collector. A high-level inquiry is on against him by a retired ACS-rank official. The government apparently transferred Rajesh out of the home department, as the ACB functions under the home department. Eyebrows were also raised over the transfer and reinstatement of collectors of Kutch and Panchmahal districts within a week. Praveena D K, who was transferred as collector of Panchmahal district from Kutch collector last week, was transferred back as collector of Kutch district on Tuesday. While the reason is unknown, informed sources believe she was transferred out following representations by local leaders. However, it is not known why was she transferred back to Kutch in such a short time. Sujal Mayatra, who was appointed as Kutch collector last week from his post of Panchmahal collector, has been re-appointed as Panchmahal collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mystery-shrouds-transfer-of-3-officials-in-a-weeks-time/articleshow/83967701.cms||---

The area being a congested one, the fire department had to manually carry the equipment for rescue to the site. Fire officials said that at about 8.50am, the building collapsed and the three persons got trapped in the debris. The fire department rescued three members of a family — Pirbhai Shaikh, 70; Irfanbhai Shaikh, 35; and Reshmabanu Shaikh, 32 — the father, son and the daughter-in-law. The officials said that the timely action by the fire department saved them as the three received only minor injuries. The building was very old and needed urgent repairs. “Had the house collapse horizontally, it would have damaged the other two houses in the vicinity,” said a fire official. A senior official of the fire brigade said that every year, about 10-odd such incidents are reported soon after the onset of monsoon. The estate department already has a list of such dangerous or dilapidated houses. But apart from giving out notices, the AMC has failed to act. “Such buildings need to be repaired immediately or the residents should be forcibly evacuated,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/house-collapses-in-lakhota-pol-3-injured/articleshow/83967759.cms||---

However, this may turn into a prickly issue for the MVA government. There are 2,900 police quarters spread over the chawls at Naigaum in Dadar, N M Joshi Marg and at Worli. Of these, 2,100 have been allotted to serving policemen, while the other 800 are occupied either by retired policemen or families of deceased policemen.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Probe reveals more frauds by vaccine conman, 2 aides held||KOLKATA: The SIT probing the fake vaccination case rounded up two more associates of mastermind Debanjan Deb on Tuesday, taking the total count of the arrested to six. The arrested were Deb’s cousin Kanchan Deb (37), a resident of Naktala, and Cossipore resident Sarat Patra (52), the compounder who had administered the fake vaccines. The investigators have also come across other con jobs Deb had conducted, including a fake raid on a fuel pump, impersonating a vigilance officer. He had reportedly got a person arrested by the local cops. In another instance, Deb had arranged for a supposed West Bengal Employees’ Federation elections and subsequently, declared himself the winner. The people who cast their votes were his own staff members, police said. Deb apparently took “credit” for both the incidents and boasted to people about them but the authorities apparently never noticed that they were fraudulant acts. Deb, who was produced in Alipore court on Tuesday again and sent to a further seven days’ police custody till July 5, is suspected to have targeted several other government departments after committing multiple frauds in the name of KMC and I&CA department. Deb’s mother, who was present at court, said he should be punished if proven guilty. “I want justice to prevail,” she said.  “Deb’s arrested cousin, Kanchan, was aware he was not an IAS officer. As a result, Deb couldn’t antagonize Kanchan and risk being exposed,” said joint commissioner (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “Kanchan was in charge of Deb’s Kasba office, which he passed off as a KMC office. Kanchan often arranged the fake camps and quote twice the amount, which Deb would be forced to pay up.” Police said Patra was not a formally trained compounder but he learnt the skills from a doctor, who was now dead. “Sarat worked for a doctor in Taltala. From him, he learnt how to dress wounds and administer injections,” said Sharma. Kanchan and Patra were produced in Alipore court and sent to police custody. Deb had told police on Monday that he was a frequent visitor to government offices. “The forensic analysis of his laptop and mobiles will help us identify the people he met,” said an officer. Deb’s defence lawyer Dibyendu Bhattacharya claimed he was undergoing psychological treatment and that he was a victim of circumstances. “His motive was social welfare. He had not charged a rupee from anyone. No one fell ill after taking the vaccine,” Bhattacharya argued. But public prosecutor Sourin Ghosal refuted the claim, saying Deb was a master fraudster. “We will need to take him to different places to further our investigations,” Ghosal said, adding the government wanted to add sections 274, 275, 276 and 188 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/probe-reveals-more-frauds-by-vax-conman-2-aides-held/articleshow/83967889.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Sources said the central agency submitted the FIR before its exclusive court in Patna on Monday. Besides, the sources said, NIA sleuths from Delhi flew to Hyderabad in Telangana for a full-fledged investigation into the case after four suspects, including two brothers, were detained and interrogated by Telangana counter-intelligence sleuths and a team of Bihar police. The explosion took place on June 17 when the parcel booked in Secunderabad was dumped on the platform number 1 of Darbhanga railway station in Bihar, causing a loud bang and minor fire. It was a small glass bottle containing a complex inflammable liquid, wrapped with adhesive tape and kept in the parcel of clothes, which caused the explosion. The consignment was booked in the name of one Mohammad Sufiyan, who was also named as the recipient. Meanwhile, sources said NIA and intelligence agencies are gathering information about any incident of use of liquid explosives to trigger a blast in any passenger aircraft.“Suspicion is high that it was destined to be picked up by someone. No untoward incident happened in the train while the parcel was in transit. Explosion probably took place due to mishandling,” a source said.

Surgery was performed and blood clots were removed on June 27. However, after the surgery the doctors declared Modi as brain-dead. Modi was active in promoting cadaver donation throughout his life. He used to organize cadaver donation awareness programmes at various institutions. “As soon as Modi was declared brain-dead, his brother-in-law Rajesh Dhabuwala and his wife Rinku contacted us for cadaver donation,” Nilesh Mandlewala, Founder of Donate Life, told TOI. “My husband devoted his life to creating awareness about cadaver donations. Like him, we also want to see smiles on the faces of those patients who are in urgent need of organs. This would be a real tribute to him,” said Modi's wife Rinku (45). Modi is survived by his wife (45), daughter Dr Mona Patel (27) who is settled in Canada and son Rishi Modi (22), who studies in Canada. “As there were no patients in need of a heart or lung in Gujarat, the State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) informed ROTTO ( Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation) in Mumbai. But as there was no requirement, the heart and lungs were allotted to one patient in Hyderabad,” said Mandlewala. However, as the heart was not in a condition to be transplanted, the lung also could not be used as both organs were allotted to one person, added Mandlewala. The liver was transplanted into a 54-year-old man from Nadiad under treatment in Ahmedabad. One kidney was given to a 45-year-old man from Bharuch and another to the Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC) for transplant. Two corneas were donated to Surat-based Lok Drishti Eye bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/brain-dead-accident-victims-organs-to-give-new-life-to-five/articleshow/83963169.cms||---

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced a slew of decisions to help the travel sector recover from a prolonged slump. A statement by the association said that they expected more direct relief to their members rather than ‘limiting it to 904 stakeholders registered with the Ministry of Tourism (MoT)’. TAAI’s president Jyoti Mayal, in the written statement, said that they all expected much more than what was announced. “The outreach of this relief is miniscule” said Mayal. “Only those registered with the Ministry of Tourism (MoT) will benefit. Most of our members are registered with the state tourism department,” said Mayal. She claimed that registration of many of TAAI members was still pending due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The association’s vice-president Jay Bhatia said, “Only 10% of the actual stakeholders will benefit as per the FM’s package. To widen the scope, the FM must include those registered under MSME. We request that all those registered under GST and have been contributing to the exchequer over the years should be the recipients of this package.” Shreeram Patel, treasurer of TAAI, said, “We had appealed to the government to grant tax holiday to our employees and members for the next five years. Furthermore, we requested a moratorium on EMIs/interest payable for the next two years by the same beneficiaries.” Bettaiah Lokesh, honorary secretary general of TAAI, said the importance of the sector cannot be ignored. “This being the largest service sector in India generates over 9% to the national GDP,” said Lokesh. TAAI’s Nagpur chapter chairman Rajesh Agrawal said, “It’s very important that the government steps in to provide relief to our sector. The Covid-19 induced lockdown has badly affected our businesses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/miniscule-say-travel-agents-about-finmins-relief-package/articleshow/83967853.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Pune||Collectors, civic chiefs told to focus on liquid oxygen plants||PUNE: State additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas has directed all collectors and municipal commissioners to focus on setting up more Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) plants, instead of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) units, to help the state tide over the peak of the anticipated Covid-19 third wave. Maharashtra currently produces about 1,300 metric tonnes(MT) of LMO per day. During the peak of the second wave (during April-May), the requirement had scaled up to 1,800 MT per day. In a detailed letter, Dr Vyas told the officers to draw an oxygen supply plan. He said 70% of oxygen supply would come from LMO plants, only 20% from PSA units and 10% via oxygen cylinders. The letter mentioned that the experience with PSA plants had not always been good and it needed a lot of maintenance. As many districts have already sent proposals regarding PSA plants, the letter categorically stated that the districts should not see it as the only source of medical oxygen. With a huge number of plants proposed, the letter stated that districts should have alternate arrangements of oxygen supply. It has been decided that no new PSA plants should be set up at public health institutions other than medical colleges, district hospitals, general hospitals, women hospitals, sub-district hospitals and major civic hospitals. “There should be exceptional reason for setting up PSA plants at levels below sub-district hospitals and there would be assessment whether the plant would be put to optimum use in post-Covid situation too,” Dr Vyas said, advising against setting up any new PSA plant at any rural hospital/primary health centre. During the second wave, the state had pushed for PSA plants with each district pushing for more than 25-30 such plants. The latest plan will require many of the districts to roll back their plans, especially for rural hospitals. The additional health secretary has categorically stated that adequate LMO storage would help tide over the crisis and focus on the storage capacities in each of the districts to fill it up in consultation with the medical education department and the FDA. With many districts having to depend on other states during the peak, the focus should be on LMO plants to enable the state to draw down from this storage to meet shortfall between production within state, Dr Vyas said. Health officials said the plan was to have 50% LMO storage at district headquarters and the remaining 50% at locations in sub-divisional areas to be decided by collectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/focus-on-lmo-units-for-oxygen-supply-during-possible-third-wave-dr-vyas/articleshow/83967850.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: A whiff of whisky and you are in trouble!||AHMEDABAD: Cops, who are considered the frontline warriors in the times of Covid-19 pandemic, have been coming up with innovative ideas in their attempt to deal with law breakers. In this sequence, the police are now experimenting with ‘whiff test’ to nab drunk people and at the same time avoid catching the Covid virus. According to city police officers, the cops have decided to rely upon winds to check if the person, who is suspected of being drunk, has really consumed alcohol or not. “We will make the suspected person stand straight in front of cops. Then we will find out the wind direction and ask the person to stand in such a way that the wind passes from him towards us. This way, we will come to know from the smell that he or she is drunk,” said a police officer. The officer said that one such complaint was already filed with city police on June 26 where a 48-year-old man from the Naranpura area was booked using the same method. The FIR in the case reads, “As the Covid-19 pandemic is spreading with great intensity, it was not proper to smell the mouth as it may invite the deadly infection. We made him to stand still and then found from the wind that an intense smell of liquor was coming from him. We ascertained that he was drunk and then booked him.” Earlier, the traffic cops had introduced a field sobriety test which is practised in the US to file a case of drunk and driving. This test was brought into the place as the use of breathalyzers was found to be risky which could spread the infection. When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, the cops stopped smelling the mouth of suspects to avoid infection. Instead, they began checking the suspect’s eyes. If found red, they would book the person under prohibition charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-whiff-of-whisky-and-you-are-in-trouble/articleshow/83967858.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Thane||Maharashtra Covid cases down 2/3rds from 11.4L in May to 3L in June||MUMBAI: While 11.4 lakh people across Maharashtra were down with Covid-19 in May, the cases have dropped by two-thirds to 3 lakh in June (so far). The second wave of Covid-19 is clearly ebbing from its peak in April, when 17.9 lakh cases and 14,164 deaths were recorded in Maharashtra. There are fears that in pockets of Kolhapur and Sangli or even in the Andheri-Borivli stretch of Mumbai, a “rebound” or small blips could be underway. While there is no doubt that the second wave has been bigger and worse than the first one last year, there is a question mark over the daily death burden. Maharashtra has been carrying out a death data reconciliation exercise since May 17. Of the 52,760 deaths added in May (26,531) and June (26,229) so far, 25,266 were classified as “old deaths” with no information on the day/date these deaths occurred. And, as per the daily death calculations, 7,170 deaths occurred in June and 20,324 in May. In Mumbai, the second wave had a curve similar to the state. While April was the peak for cases -- 2.3 lakh -- May was the peak for deaths at 1,723. In June, the cases as well as deaths were about a third of the May counts at 20,550 and 588 respectively. Despite this massive drop from April to June, experts say the main cause for worry is the “thick tail” of the decline in both Mumbai and Maharashtra. While cases in other states and cities have dropped to a fraction of their peaks in the second wave, both Mumbai and Maharashtra continue to record high daily incidences as compared to, say, Delhi or Karnataka. On Tuesday, for instance, Maharashtra recorded 8,085 cases and 231 deaths, while Mumbai registered 556 cases and 12 deaths. The fatalities in the state crossed the 200 mark after a gap of 9 days. The state’s total caseload has touched 60.5 lakh and the city’s is 7.2 lakh. Total fatalities rose to 1,21,804 in the state and 15,426 in the city. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said people have to remember that the second wave isn’t over yet. “We still detect thousands of cases every day. Yes, the second wave is on a decline, but we have to guard against a rebound or a reverse bump, as is happening in some districts such as Kolhapur,” he said. He said such blips are responsible for the “thick tail” in Maharashtra’s Covid graph. “Even in Mumbai, suburbs of concern have developed, especially in the Andheri-Borivli belt where there is poor adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he added. Health minister Rajesh Tope said though cases were on the decline, it should not discourage people from getting vaccinated. “Vaccination should be done on priority. There are so far only 21 Delta-plus cases reported in the state, so it is not a cause of immediate worry,” Tope said. He said if the state can vaccinate 70% of its targeted population, the severity of the third wave can be reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-covid-cases-down-2/3rds-from-11-4l-in-may-to-3l-in-june/articleshow/83973501.cms||---

The accused used to run a guest house there so that no one would get suspicious. “Eight managers and 10 customers were arrested while 10 women were rescued from the centre after a raid in the house,” a police officer said. According to police, the managers are identified as Abhishek, Akash, Shivam, Ramesh, Yogesh, Pramod, Puja Nagpal and Milan Thakur. The organisers and managers were running a spa from Sector 18 market but it had been shut down earlier this year. Police suspect that the spa may also have provided sex services to customers most of whom had been informed about the guest house facilities. Police also recovered phones used for bookings, account books, contraceptives etc from the spot. The accused used to charge between Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000 as per demand from the customers. Ranvijay Singh, DCP (Noida) told TOI that the accused were using the residential house as a guest house and used to take booking through WhatsApp message or call only. “Police received a tip-off about the racket following which a raid was conducted at the house. Eight managers were arrested along with ten male customers who were from the Delhi-NCR region. Ten women were also rescued from the place,” he said. “During questioning, the women told police that they had worked earlier at the spa. After the closing of the spa, they were forced by the managers to work in this racket and were threatened with loss of income in case of refusal to work," DCP said. The accused have been booked under sections 370A(2) (exploitation of a trafficked person) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, 1956 at Sector 49 police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/sex-racket-busted-in-guest-house-18-arrested/articleshow/83969995.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

---||Kolkata||Demand-supply gap hits Kolkata Municipal Corporation vaccination drive||KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation vaccination clinics across the city on Tuesday received scanty supply of vaccines which led to a resentment among those who queued up in front of these clinics since early morning but were refused vaccination. According to a KMC health department official, the supply was so meagre that most of these clinics couldn’t inoculate more than 50 citizens each. The official conceded that the total number of recipients dropped on Tuesday compared to last week when on a single day the civic body had set a record by inoculating over 60,000 citizens across 200 vaccination centres. According to a KMC health department official, thousands across 144 KMC wards had queued up in front of the clinics to get the second Covishield dose. However, a majority of them could not be administered the vaccine as out of the paltry supply, the civic officials tried to strike a balance between the recipients of the second dose and the priority group. The inability to vaccinate those in queue led to major chaos. At some places, KMC health officials had to call cops to control the situation. For instance, cops rushed to a KMC vaccination centre in the Baghajatin-Sri Colony area when irate people started demonstrating against non-availability of vaccines. According to local ward coordinator Debasish Mukherjee, over 300 people stood in the queue from early morning with the hope of getting the jab. “But when the registration counter was opened, those in the queue were told that the supply of vaccines was so scanty that only 50 could be given the jab. This announcement made the situation worse as people turned restless,” Mukherjee said. The scene at Atabagan Garia clinic was similar. As the day progressed, the queue grew longer. But here, too, people were asked to visit the next day as the clinic had only 50 doses to offer for over 400 citizens. Bivas Maity, a resident of Garia who on Tuesday went to the clinic and stood in the queue for over two hours, felt dejected when he was told to visit the clinic on Wednesday. “I was hopeful as I heard about the record inoculation of over 60,000 citizens by the KMC clinics on a single day last week. But my hopes were shattered when I was told that only 50 people would be vaccinated. I don’t know what will happen tomorrow,” Maity said. Sandip Chatterjee, a resident of Tollygunge, was, however, lucky as he along with wife Subrata had their second Covishield dose from a KMC clinic at Anwar Shah Road. “I consider myself lucky compared to thousands of those who couldn’t take their second dose in time. I hope the situation will get better soon,” Chatterjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/demand-supply-gap-hits-kmc-vax-drive/articleshow/83965644.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Delhi||Woman in HC over harassment after wilful conversion||New Delhi: A woman who claims to have converted to Islam willingly moved Delhi High Court on Tuesday seeking protection from vigilante groups and pressure from Uttar Pradesh police. In her plea, she has said that she works in Delhi and belongs to Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh. Seeking protection for herself and her family as also her right to privacy, the woman complained that because of her conversion to Islam, she and her family are being targeted and malicious content is being published in media, which should be stopped immediately. “The petitioner (woman) is an adult and she is protected by the Constitution to choose her own faith and she cannot be targeted and harassed for the choice she makes with regard to the religion she follows,” the petition said, seeking the court’s intervention. The plea informs the court that Renu Gangwar alias Ayesha Alvi converted to Islam on May 27 in Delhi and since June 23, when she was in Shahjahanpur, she started recieving calls from media requesting for a meeting, which she refused. It said the media still descended on her place and took her photographs and videos and soon she started getting calls threatening that her conversion news would be published in the media and she would be arrested. “Some of the mediapersons forcibly took Rs 20,000 while others tried to extort money from her and her family,” the plea alleged, adding that “absurd and imaginary details are being reported in the media regarding her conversion.” The woman, in her plea, said that she gave a complaint to the Delhi Police commissioner on June 24 seeking immediate intervention for her protection with regard to her conversion to Islam on her own free will and without any threat or coercion from anyone, but no action has been taken on her complaint yet. She wants a direction to authorities to ensure that the woman is not taken away from Delhi by force or coercion by any government agency or person and she and her family be granted protection and not harassed or interrogated regarding her conversion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-in-hc-over-harassment-after-wilful-conversion/articleshow/83967951.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

NIA sources said that one of the accused had travelled more than once to Pakistan and received instructions from a Pakistan-based Indian suspected of having links with ISI and the target of the accused was to create arson on the train. Among the two brothers, who are natives of Kairana town in Shamli district of UP, one has been operating from Hyderabad for over 20 years. His brother had moved to Hyderabad a year ago. “The elder brother married a Hyderabad woman. Both brothers went to Secunderabad railway station and booked the parcel weighing 55 kg containing garments and bottle containing explosive material in the name of Mohammed Sufiyan by giving a fake ID proof on June 15,” said an NIA source. However, after the explosion at Darbhanga railway station on June 17, police focused on the mobile number mentioned by the accused while booking the parcel. “Though the accused gave someone else's phone number to hoodwink security agencies, through technical analysis of the active phone numbers at the railway station and the call details of the mobile number mentioned by the accused, we could identify the suspects," said an intelligence official. NIA sleuths who reached the city from Delhi along with counter intelligence sleuths are taking the two brothers to various places in the city for scene reconstruction. NIA might produce the accused before the local magistrate to take them to Delhi on transit remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1-of-2-brothers-held-married-city-woman/articleshow/83967859.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Nagpur||From all patients in Nagpur hospital year ago to few serious ones in second wave||NAGPUR: The number of patients now admitted to dedicated Covid hospitals (DCHs) are now quite less than what it was exactly a year ago. As on date, less than 100 patients are admitted in government DCHs and DCHCs in the district, though there are 231 facilities to treat and isolate positive patients. On June 29, 2020, the district had 277 patients admitted to DCHs at two medical colleges. Later, AIIMS Nagpur too started admitting a limited number of patients followed by inclusion of private hospitals in the Covid fight from August. The over 7,400 vacant beds in the daily chart and handful of active cases come as a huge respite to the health and administrative officials, who spent sleepless night battling the crisis at its peak. Though the district still has 396 active cases, some 133 are admitted or staying in institutional quarantine centres as per revised guidelines. In the same period last year, all those testing positive had to compulsorily get admitted at GMCH and IGGMCH. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said the disease remained pretty much under control then as all Covid positive patients were admitted. “The patients then were more but manageable, while now they are few in number but all of them serious,” he said. Dr Gawande’s observation signifies the dynamic nature of the novel coronavirus, which became lethal in the second wave. Dr Shishir Shrivastav, director of Kunal Hospital, pointed out that the patient flow has suddenly stopped. “Between first and second wave, we had average 30 Covid patients at a time in our hospital. Around 14 days after May first week, there was no Covid patient admitted,” he said. The doctors are happy as well as awestruck by the sudden withdrawal of the pandemic in the district. Shortage of drugs like remdesivir, tocilizumab, oxygen and beds would hound them for days on end, are now a thing of the past. Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) president Dr Ashok Arbat said problems only increased from March to April as compared to August-September last year, but doctors never got discouraged. “With so many recovering from Covid infection, many getting vaccinated, and exposure to the situation, the society had gradually accepted the disease,” he said. Fear and apprehensions regarding the disease too disappeared with time. People would often oppose Covid facilities in their areas till the end of the first wave. “Every one was scared as there were a lot of rumours. No one knew exactly what danger it posed. Private hospitals were of the view that we should treat all Covid patients at a big, single facility like GMCH. First wave was mild but we were not prepared. Gradually health care workers gained experience. When second wave arrived in February–March, many serious patients recovered and returned to normal life,” he said. Another interesting fact of the two waves was that it divided nearly all hospitals into Covid and non-Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/from-all-patients-in-hospital-year-ago-to-few-serious-ones-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83967924.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Pune||Only 13 districts in Maharashtra register more RT-PCR tests than RAT||PUNE: Only 13 of the 35 districts in Maharashtra have registered more RT-PCR tests than RAT checks in the past three days. The state government had on June 25 ruled that the weekly positivity rates for its district-wise multi-level unlock plan would be calculated only on the basis of the RT-PCR reports and not on the Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) for imposing restrictions in administrative units, irrespective of the weekly positivity rates and oxygen bed occupancy percentage. Previously, the state’s multi-level unlock plan had looked at the positivity rate of both RT-PCR and RAT. The government made the change in the policy amid fears of the Delta-plus variant of Covid-19 emerging in the state. Maharashtra has around 235 RT-PCR laboratories and almost an equal number of RAT laboratories. Until last week, RAT constituted 60% of the Covid tests and the remaining 40% were the RT-PCR tests. Once the new order was issued, the RAT percentage dropped to 55 and RT-PCR tests went up to 45% . Though big cities such as Pune, Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Thane and Raigad have more RT-PCR tests, many districts were still banking on RAT due to lack of necessary facilities. Health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday directed health officials to assess the testing infrastructure in all districts and ramp up laboratory facilities. He said the government has directed the laboratories to increase testing shifts and focus more on RT-PCR. “We want the existing laboratories to maximise their potential by increasing the capacity and have staffers working in shifts. We have the potential to conduct 2 lakh RT-PCR tests per day and this should be utilized. For districts that are not having the facilities, these laboratories will provide support to collect the samples,” Tope told TOI. Three days after the orders were issued, Parbhani is the only district in the state to conduct up to 90% of RT-PCR tests, followed closely by Mumbai suburban (82%) and Pune (65%). Districts such as Gadchiroli continued with RAT (86%). Similar was the trend in Hingoli (81%). In western Maharashtr, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur and Solapur districts have registered nearly 70% RAT checks. A senior health official said the districts had been given necessary instructions and the laboratories were working accordingly. “There are some genuine issues, mostly related to infrastructure and manpower, at some places. These issues will be separately addressed. The time taken to collect the swab samples and furnish the final reports has to be within a specific time frame. The weekly positivity reports will be assessed on the basis of these reports,” an official said. Apart from the change in the weekly positivity rate calculation, the state government has added stricter restrictions by doing away with the first two levels of its unlock plan that allowed several relaxations such as opening up of malls. Now, Level 3 is the base, resulting in districts that were eligible for Level 1 and 2 restrictions slipping to Level 3. As per the revised formula, any change in status can occur only after a two-week’s “declining trend” as against one week previously. The official added that if the districts continued to depend on RAT, the outcome would not be assessed in the weekly positivity rate even if the percentage of the test was higher, stated health officials. The official said with lower RT-PCR tests, the positivity rate would increase and the districts would move to the levels of higher curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/only-13-dists-in-state-register-more-rt-pcr-tests-than-rat/articleshow/83967910.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: ‘Ajeeb dastan’ of out-of-work Bhagwan and his violin||KOLKATA: Violin player Bhagwan Mali, an out-of-work hotel musician who has become an internet sensation for his renditions of Bollywood numbers at Beadon Street and Girish Park crossing, was gifted a new violin by Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra on Monday. Mali had earlier received financial assistance from the community policing wing of the force. Earlier on June 21, director Raj Chakraborty had met him in Goabagan after seeing a viral video of him playing ‘Diwana Hua Baadal’ by Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi from the 1964 movie ‘Kashmir ki Kali’ and Lata Mangeshkar’s ‘Ajeeb dastan hai yeh’ from the 1960 movie ‘Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai’ on social media. Bhagwan Mali, accompanied by his wife Sabita, plays violin at a north Kolkata neighbourhood.“When I met him, he played two songs from my films. Since he happened to be in the Shyampukur assembly constituency, I got in touch with MLA Sashi Panja. She organized a place for him to stay. He stayed there for a day before Kolkata Police offered help,” Chakraborty said. He plans to give Mali an opportunity to perform in his forthcoming music reality show and if all goes well, even give him a break in one of his forthcoming movies. Mali, who has so far refused any financial help stating that he will only accept money after performing, has also been provided a roof to stay at Burtolla by the Burtolla police. “We have arranged some performances for him at some of the leading hotels and restaurant chains in the city. He has begun performing for the past one week,” said Tanmoy Roy Chowdhury, additional CP-IV, Kolkata Police. Mali, who hails from Gujarat but had moved to Malda after a devastating earthquake, used to make a living by performing in hotels and restaurants in Darjeeling and Siliguri. But with hotels shutting down during last year’s lockdown, he lost his earnings. Around the same time, his daughter, married and settled in Kolkata, was at an advanced stage of pregnancy. Ever since his daughter delivered a baby, Mali and his wife have been living on the street as the one room in which their daughter and son-in-law live doesn’t have enough space for them. “Mali told us that he began performing on the streets to arrange food for himself and his wife. Whatever extra that he saved was spent in buying baby food and fruit for the baby and the mother. However, disaster struck yet again and Mali’s violin got damaged a couple of weeks ago,” said a police officer. That was when Burtolla police — and later the community policing wing — decided to step in. Burtolla police pooled in money and arranged for his food initially. “An NGO has now been contacted that is arranging food for him with help of the money we raised. Several NGOs and individuals had come forward and visited him. We hope this will be a beginning and others will pitch in. We will not let a talent of Kolkata stay on the streets with financial trouble. This is a city that holds performers like Mali close to its heart,” said a top official at Lalbazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ajeeb-dastan-of-out-of-work-bhagwan-and-his-violin/articleshow/83965691.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Neutron star-black hole collision G-waves spotted||PUNE: Gravitational waves have been observed from a collision of a neutron star and a black hole for the first time by detectors from the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Till now, the gravitational waves (G-waves) had been gauged only from the collision of two black holes or two neutron stars, but never a hybrid combination. The observations will help scientists understand the formation and relative abundance of such binaries, the behaviour of matter at extreme densities and probe the effects of systems under extreme gravity. Such binaries of black hole and neutron stars will help scientists learn about the acceleration of the universe, Tarun Souradeep, LIGO-India spokesperson, said. “With more detectors like the LIGO India detector coming up, we will have more accuracy in calculating the distances and hence the expansion rate,” Souradeep added. When massive cosmic bodies like black holes and neutron stars collide, ripples travel across the fabric of spacetime and are called gravitational waves. In this particular detection, the first collision event was detected on January 5, 2020, by the LIGO-Livingston and Virgo observatories and the second one was gauged on January 15 by three observatories__ LIGO-Livingston, LIGO-Hanford and Virgo, an official release said. A tool called parameter estimation was used to understand the exact nature of the objects that collided over a billion years ago. It was found that the mass of the heavier object is in the range of the black holes as observed indirectly by conventional telescopes while the mass of the lighter companion is in the range of theoretically and electromagnetically observed mass of the neutron star. While there are many signals that the detectors receive, taking out the important bits, knowing that the information detected contains gravitational waves while filtering out the unwanted noise is a huge task for researchers. The scientists use match filtering to achieve this. Parameswaran Ajith, associate professor from International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, said if they have models of expected signals, it is easier to extract them from noisy data like picking up words from our own language in a noisy crowd. “This is because our brain keeps a “template” of known words, which matches the audio data collected by our ears. Similarly, we have theoretical models of the expected gravitational wave signals from Einstein’s theory. These theoretical templates can be matched with the observational data to identify the presence of signals in the noisy data,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/neutron-star-black-hole-collision-g-waves-spotted/articleshow/83967937.cms||Ardhra Nair

The cost of constructing both the STPs is around Rs 259 crore.At present, 190 MLD of water is being treated through four STPs in the city. Once the two new STPs will be ready, 400 MLD of water will get treated across Noida, which aims to become a ‘zero-discharge' city. Initially, the new STPs will have a capacity to treat 180 MLD of water, which will be enhanced to 265 MLD later. “We will complete the civil construction work by December as we have expedited the work by nearly 100 labour per site after restrictions were lifted. Only mechanical and equipment fixing work will be left, for which we will need a month,” said Firoz Ahmed, manager outer agency department handling STP work in the Authority.According to CEO Ritu Maheshwari, the STPs will benefit the residential areas near the project sites. Also, 36 sewage pumping stations have been set up to uplift the sewerage and carry the sewage up to the STPs. “The water after treatment is used for irrigation and horticulture purposes to save depleting groundwater levels. Under the Master Plan 2031, the aim is to save more groundwater through these STPs,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-nears-zero-discharge-target-may-get-2-more-stps-by-december/articleshow/83970030.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Fourteen people from Maharashtra and Bhilad in Valsad were arrested after branch manager of ICICI Bank had approached police in May. The bank complained that 17 customers had taken 20 gold loans by mortgaging 803.6 grams of fake gold between August 2019 and November last year. Police said that the bank realized about fake gold during an audit. “The audit revealed that EMIs of these loan accounts were not being paid. When the quality of gold was checked, it turned out to be fake,” said sub-inspector B H Rathod of Bhilad police station. He added that the mastermind of the scam was Suraj Sahu, a resident of Virar in Maharashtra. “He and his two accomplices had found customers of the loan in Bhilad,” Rathod said. Sahu’s unidentified friend from Rajasthan from whom he had purchased the medicine and two others who pretended to be customers are yet to be nabbed. To fox the bank officials, the accused had done thick gold plating on the jewellery. Police officials said that they were aware of the stone rubbing test and nitric acid test done on the jewellery to ascertain whether it is genuine or not, but by thick gold plating, the duplicity can be revealed only by cutting the jewellery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fake-gold-mortgaged-for-rs-21-lakh-bank-loan/articleshow/83963277.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Baby with rare glaucoma gets back vision, early medical treatment can save sight||PUNE: Aatmaram and Sangeeta noticed something 'seriously wrong' with their six-month-old son's eyes, they seemed very large and blue. The diagnosis when they took him to eye surgeons in Pune pointed at glaucoma, a vision-robbing disease affecting only the older adults. “We heard about it when our grandparents were diagnosed with glaucoma. We were shocked to know our six-month-old baby had it,” they said. Glaucoma is largely diagnosed in people older than 60 and is one of the leading causes of blindness in senior citizens. But rarely does the disease can strike infants, experts said. The signs and symptoms of glaucoma in children are different from the adults. While an eye surgeon will be the one to definitively diagnose and treat childhood glaucoma, parents are the key to early diagnosis and treatment, experts said. “It was a clear cut case of already delayed presentation of congenital glaucoma which needs very early surgery,” eye surgeon and glaucoma exert Pankaj Bendale of the National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO), Pune, said. The child had photophobia (fear of light) and the eyes watered. “There was some hope. I told parents that the child needed early surgery for both eyes together under general anaesthesia,” Bendale said. They had income documents that made them eligible for availing free treatment under the indigent category at the NIO, a trust hospital. The child underwent surgery for both eyes recently. “The baby opened his eyes and smiled the next day. The pressure in both his eyes had normalized. The front portion of the eye was clear and he could see much better than before,” Bendale added The parents were relieved and over the next month, successive follow-ups showed smooth recovery. “Not all children with this kind of rate congenital glaucoma are lucky because of poor awareness about this disease. Timely decisions for surgery are required,” eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar, director of NIO, said. With timely treatment and periodic follow-up to monitor vision changes and other eye functions, many children can have good vision, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baby-with-rare-glaucoma-gets-back-vision-early-medical-treatment-can-save-sight/articleshow/83967950.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kochi||Bulbous bow can save fuel use: Cochin University researcher||KOCHI: High fuel consumption has been one of the banes of fishing vessels. Organizations working on improving efficiency in the fishing technology sector have been focused on various aspects of ship building to incorporate elements that could help in bringing sustainable solutions for the fisheries sector. Using state-of-the-art technology, a researcher at the department of ship technology of Cochin University (CU) has come up with a solution to the crisis being faced by the fisheries sector due to use of low fuel-efficient vessels. “A bulbous bow attached to the fishing vessels at the front of the hull of the vessel below the waterline can reduce water resistance of the vessel approximately by 17.5% at a given speed,” said researcher Baiju M V, who is also a senior scientist at the central institute of fisheries technology (CIFT). “Most boats have pointed edges to cut through the water. If we can fit such a bulbous structure, then there could be a 5 to 8 percent reduction in fishing costs through a huge difference in fuel consumption,” he said. This is made possible with specially-designed stem parts (forward most regions of a vessel). He said that it was a culmination of extensive and diverse research with the help of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, which is the latest technology that analyzes the dynamic movements of ocean going vessels. Visiting several states, he used data from 35 of the 145 high-efficiency conventional fishing vessels across the country for his research work. The Goa Shipyard has used this technology while building the ship called F V Sagar Harita. Baiju has been involved in the technical committees set up by successive governments in the state to bring in sustainable changes in the fisheries sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bulbous-bow-can-save-fuel-use-cu-researcher/articleshow/83965770.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Kochi||Kochi: ‘Flying object’ could be jet plane, says Harbour cops||KOCHI: Amid the reports of drone attacks in Jammu airport, a ‘drone-like’ flying object with flashy lights was reportedly sighted in the skies near Cochin Port Trust at Willingdon Island in Kochi, in the early hours of Tuesday. The indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC), which is under construction at Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) and awaiting sea trials, is currently berthed at the Cochin Port and the area is under strict security surveillance. According to the Harbour Police, a flying object with its lights flashing was seen in one of the CCTV cameras of the CISF in the port around 4.50am on Tuesday and they alerted the police. However, nothing suspicious was found in the initial police investigation and they are yet to confirm whether there was any flying object then in the skies. Though the police are conducting an inquiry, there are no official complaints or cases registered in connection with the incident. Moreover, police assume that it could be a passenger aircraft, based on reports that a Trivandrum-Kochi Indigo flight flew over the island exactly around the same time. “We were alerted by the control room that a flying object with lights, similar to a drone, was seen by the CISF personnel. It was captured by one of the CCTV cameras. But we have not found anything suspicious and are trying to validate what it was. It was found that an Indigo Airbus flight had passed over the Willingdon Island at 4:47am before landing at the Kochi airport. We assume it could be the flight. More data from radar will be checked and details are being collected,” said a police source. The CIAL website’s flight schedule confirmed that an Indigo flight landed at 4.56am at its runway. The data from Flightradar24, an internet-based real-time commercial aircraft flight tracking service also, showed that the aircraft passed over the island at UTC 11:17 (approximately 4.47am in Kochi), which validates the police assumption. The IAC, expected to be commissioned into the Navy by mid-2022, will be one of the most potent assets of the force. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had reviewed the project’s progress on 25 June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/flying-object-could-be-jet-plane-cops/articleshow/83965721.cms||---

The Himachal Pradesh government has resumed inter-state bus movement from July 1. While electric bus service between Manali and Keylong is successfully running, tourists can also enjoy luxury bus ride from Delhi to Keylong from Thursday. The Himachal Roads Transport Corporation (HRTC) Keylong depot runs the only bus service connecting Delhi with Ladakh Union Territory. The 1,026 km-long journey crossing three major mountain passes above 16,000-ft takes nearly 30 hours. Passengers will have to pay a fare of Rs 1,548. As taxi fare on this route remains close to Rs 35,000, the bus will bring relief to budget passengers and tourists. The bus will go through Manali, Atal tunnel, Keylong, Baralacha pass (16,052ft), Nakeela pass (15,540ft), Lachulung pass (16,616ft) and Taglangla pass (17,582ft) and end its journey at 11,500ft in Leh. The bus will be at maximum altitude of 17,582ft at Tanglangla pass of Ladakh. On Thursday, the first bus will leave for Leh from Keylong, the direct bus from Delhi will start from Friday. HRTC regional manager at Keylong Mangal Chand Manepa said the bus will have small halts and meal breaks at various places including Mandi, Kullu, Manali and Keylong. “The route is challenging but our drivers are best. People eagerly wait for us as our service is reliable and cheap. The bus will negotiate hundreds of hairpin bends, high mountains and deep valleys. The seasonal bus service stops in September when snowfall blocks the highway,” he said. Meanwhile, HRTC is starting its Volvo bus service between Delhi and Keylong from July 1. Taking luxury buses to tribal Lahaul valley was not possible until Atal tunnel was built. Tourists and local residents can now directly board the Volvo bus from Delhi to Leh. The electric bus service is also running between Manali and Keylong in Lahaul for few weeks now. The bus is plying the high altitude roads without problem. Famous Chandratal lake of the state, which is connected by a narrow dirt road, will also get bus service from Manali very soon as after conducting a successful trial run, the officials have requested PWD to maintain some dangerous and damaged spots. Once road conditions are improved, the bus service will start for the first time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/delhi-leh-bus-service-to-resume-after-21-months/articleshow/83967948.cms||---
---||Chennai||HC asks Tamil Nadu government if it took SC nod while appointing NEET panel||CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday questioned the Tamil Nadu government over its decision to set up a committee to look into the impact of NEET in medical admissions, asking it whether it had obtained the permission of the Supreme Court and whether the move would not violate the apex court ruling. When Tamil Nadu advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram, responding to a PIL against Justice A K Rajan Commission, said it was a policy decision backed by the demand of people and election promise of the ruling party, the first bench remarked: “May be. But if it is contrary to the Supreme Court order, then it cannot be permitted.” The bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy later adjourned the hearing to July 5 with a direction to the state to file its response. It will also be open to the Union government to indicate its stand, the judges added. The PIL was filed by BJP’s Tamil Nadu secretary K Nagarajan, who wanted the court to quash the June 10 order constituting a committee headed by Justice Rajan to study the impact of NEET on socially backward students. Advocate V Ragavachari, representing the petitioner, submitted that the setting up of the committee was an exercise in futility since any recommendation that such committee might make could not be implemented in the light of the view taken by the Supreme Court on NEET. Citing the Supreme Court order on NEET dated August 22, 2017, Raghvachari said the apex court had recorded in the judgement that ‘Tamil Nadu shall not make any kind of distinction or discrimination between the examinations conducted by various boards; and admissions shall be effected as per the result of the NEET examination.’ Therefore, there can be little room for the state to set up any committee for the purpose of ascertaining whether the NEET based admission process has prejudicially affected socially backward students, he added. “Tamil Nadu government ought to have noted that NEET is introduced in national interest, and any attempt to alter the same would derail the object and purpose of introduction of NEET,” the petitioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-asks-tn-if-it-took-sc-nod-while-appointing-neet-panel/articleshow/83963302.cms||Sureshkumar

The minister inspected refugee camps at Vazhavandhankottai and at Kottapattu. The minister also recalled chief minister M K Stalin’s assurance to provide financial assistance of Rs 4,000 each to 13,553 families of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees residing outside refugee camps. The government allotted Rs 5.42 crore for the financial assistance. In Tamil Nadu, 18,944 families of Sri Lankan refugees have been residing in 108 refugee camps. They have already been entitled to get Covid-19 relief cash assistance of Rs 4,000. The minister gave an audience to the refugees in the two camps to air their grievances and demands. The minister assured that the DMK government would make efforts to clear the air over conferring Indian citizenship to the Sri Lankan refugees. During the interaction, the refugees pointed out the lack of infrastructure such as drinking water and education development. The minister got the approval of Trichy collector S Sivarasu to construct an anganwadi centre at Vazhavandhankottai camp. The minister also assured that his department would sort out 75% of their grievances within a month. On the issue of detention of refugees on criminal charges at the special camp in central prison in Trichy , the minister said that the chief minster has asked for complete details of the inmates to sort it out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sl-refugees-wont-be-sent-back-says-min/articleshow/83965723.cms||---
---||India||Parliamentary panel gives Twitter two days’ time||NEW DELHI: Taking umbrage to Twitter’s decision to block information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on its platform temporarily, the Lok Sabha Secretariat on Tuesday sought a written explanation from Twitter India in two days. The missive was sent out following the directions of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who chairs the Parliamentary standing committee on Information Technology. On June 25, Twitter had blocked Prasad’s account for an hour on charges of copyright violation, only to apologise and restore it later. Prasad had claimed Twitter was possibly peeved with him for his criticism of the social media platform for not following the new social media rules. Separately, the House Panel on IT met with representatives of Facebook and Google and asked them about their compliance with India’s statutory guidelines for digital platforms. Sources said Tharoor asked Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, about how they could trace the origins of a message if content was end-to-end encrypted. When Facebook's country policy director Shivnath Thukral and general counsel Namrata Singh said it would not be possible to break end-to-end encryption, Tharoor is learnt to have asked how WhatsApp was watermarking messages as “forwarded many times” and that if it could identify and label content as forwarded, it should also have mechanisms to identify where it originated. Facebook, however, is learnt to have said such labelling was different from tracing origins of messages and that it would explain the difference to the panel, in writing. The social media company also raised concerns over criminal liabilities accruing to compliance officers under the digital media rules, 2021 and told the panel it has urged the government to rethink this. Under the rules, compliance officers can face criminal action for content posted on their platforms. Interaction with representatives of Google Inc, on the other hand, saw BJP MP Sumalatha Ambareesh question the platform over labelling Kannada as the “ugliest” language in India. To this, Google India’s head of government affairs and public policy, Aman Jain, and director (legal), Gitanjali Duggal, said this was not a reflection of Google’s views but an aggregation of content available on the platform. Google also said it plans to introduce, in due course, “quality filters” to prevent pejorative content of this variety from showing up. The digital tech company also told the committee that while it has access to metadata collected through the ‘Ok Google’ command, other Google platforms do not read individual emails or private messages, or indulge in invasion of privacy. At the end of the meeting, the panel chairman is also learnt to have expressed displeasure over members “leaking” confidential discussions and said it was not only against the rules, but also unfair to other members. Sources said Tharoor may also approach Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla over the repeated breach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parliamentary-panel-gives-twitter-two-days-time/articleshow/83973050.cms||Swati Mathur

Deputy commissioner of police, south Delhi, Atul Kumar Thakur said that cops of Kotla Mubarakpur police station had received a complaint that a four-year-old girl had gone missing. He said that a team was immediately constituted to trace the girl, given the sensitivity of the matter as the missing kid was a minor girl. “The missing girl was traced near the Babu Park in south Delhi,” Thakur said, adding that no foul play was found in the matter. In the second case, Thakur said that a 15-year-old boy was also reunited with his family. He said that during a routine visit of a team from Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) to observation homes for counselling of children, its members came across a 15-year-old boy. “He was found as a vagabond at Old Delhi Railway Station and was admitted to the CWC Kingsway camp before being sent to the Kasturba Niketan at Lajpat Nagar for isolation,” Thakur said. “During counseling, the boy couldn’t reveal his complete address,” he said, adding that the AHTU team shared the details of the boy with the district control room. “The AHTU team shared the boy’s name and his father’s name with the local police and with their continuous efforts, his parents were finally traced,” he added.

Former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had waived-off Rs 12,110.74 crore of crop and jewellery loans obtained till January 31 by 16,43,347 beneficiaries across the state ahead of the elections to state assembly elections. In a circular dated June 16 to the regional joint registrars and managing directors of central cooperative banks except Chennai cooperative bank, RCS L Subramanian stated that the list of beneficiaries, documents submitted by them, registers, ledgers and documents of the primary agriculture co-operative societies (PACCS) have to be inspected again. The circular comes in the wake of the complaints from farmers associations about alleged irregularities in sanctioning loans to ineligible beneficiaries. The circular also lists out 31 districts where 100 % verification of the process should be done and also another list of districts from which the team of officers from the co-operatives societies should be sent to the respective districts. The registrar also ordered the team to complete the entire process by July 15 and submit a report about the irregularities, if any, to the respective circle deputy registrar. As per the report, a super check on 5% of the loans should be done by the officers of the central co-operative societies. The verification comprises some more process until the complete report should be submitted to the RCS by July 31. While welcoming the constitution of the committee, Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers protection association’s district secretary S Vimalnathan on Tuesday said there should not be any rush in conducting the verification. “If the DMK government really intents to unearth irregularities in the crop loan, there should be a detailed probe which will take a certain period of time to complete. Further, the officers of the neighbouring districts should not be appointed for the verification because they may be easily influenced by those involved in the irregularity. Instead, the officers from other regions can be exchanged between the districts,” said Vimalanathan. A regional joint registrar on the condition of anonymity said that since many of the officers were women, they cannot stay for a longer period in a distant district for a longer period.

In view of cases of Delta-plus variant of Covid-19 emerging in state, government on Saturday announced a “state-level trigger” for imposing restrictions in administrative units irrespective of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy percentage. The state has 235 RT-PCR laboratories and around the same number of RAT laboratories, and was conducting 60% antigen tests, as against 40% RT-PCR till last week. After the orders, in the last three days, the percentage RAT dropped to 55% while RT-PCR tests increased to 45%. While Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur. Thane and Raigad have more RT-PCR tests than RAT, many districts are still carrying out many RAT tests due to lack of necessary facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-only-13-dists-have-more-rt-pcr-tests-than-rat/articleshow/83968007.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Civic panel to screen invites for statues, plaques||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Municipal Corporation has decided to form a screening committee that will examine every invite that private organizations and clubs will send to civic dignitaries for the unveiling of statues and plaques. The move came after the name of Debanjan Deb, arrested for posing as an IAS officer and organizing fake vaccine camps, were found on a plaque below a bust of Rabindranath Tagore in central Kolkata. After Deb’s fraud came to light, his name was wiped out. According to a KMC official, the proposal has been accepted by the KMC board of administrators (BoA). From now on, private organizations and clubs would have to specify the names of the people who would share the dais with civic dignitaries during the unveiling of statues and plaques, a civic official said. According to the proposal, the committee, to be headed by a senior KMC official, will brief the dignitaries about an invite and ask local civic officials to gather information on the functioning of the organization or club sending out the invite for the inauguration a statue, bust or plaque. Other committee members may be asked to visit the place and talk to the residents of the area about the functions to be held. The exercise aims at taking feedback from residents of the area about the organizers. “We are trying to make the arrangements foolproof so that our dignitaries are not caught in an unnecessary controversy. If need be we will go through the credentials of the organizers to steer clear of any controversy in future,” said a KMC official. The official added that before accepting an invite, the civic bosses would be briefed about the organizers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/civic-panel-to-screen-invites-for-statues-plaques/articleshow/83968021.cms||Saikat Ray

The former Delhi BJP chief said that “many houses in northeast Delhi are facing water crisis because they are not connected with piped water connection even though the AAP government claims that it has provided piped connections to every household.” Meanwhile, Delhi BJP announced that Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress general secretary Parveena Sharma along with 40 other workers has joined the saffron party.

CPI deputy secretary of west zone N Chandran said the Union government should take steps immediately to control the rising prices of fuel. “The BJP-led government has been showing step-mother attitude towards Tamil Nadu. It has been supplying only limited number of Covid-19 vaccines to the state. As a result, there is a huge shortage for vaccines. We demand the Centre to increase the vaccination supply,” he added. The protesting members also demanded the central government to provide Rs 7,500 monetary assistance to poor families for six months and grant permission for the state government to manufacture vaccines at the HLL in Chengalpattu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/left-parties-protest-fuel-price-hike/articleshow/83968024.cms||---
---||Trichy||Over 3,000 await second dose of Covaxin in Trichy district||TRICHY: The public health department in the Trichy district estimates that at least 3,000 people are waiting for their second dose of Covaxin, past their due date. The wait for many extends over two weeks and the situation is likely to get worse as people who were vaccinated with Covaxin during special vaccination drives last month will join the waitlist in the coming days. Covaxin was administered to the residents here since the end of May. Many senior citizens believing that it has minimal side effects and those unlikely to go abroad preferred Covaxin over its short duration between the two doses. While the second dose is supposed to be administered after 28 days, residents were forced to wait due to unavailability of the vaccine. “As there was no vaccination camp from the corporation or district administration, I took my second jab of Covaxin in a private hospital,” said S Thyagarajan, a resident of KK Nagar. A majority of those waiting had taken the first jab at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Medical College Hospital (MGMGH). The health department has planned to vaccinate people awaiting the second dose on priority with the doses available with them. “Each of the health centres has prepared the list of people waiting for the second dose with their contact number. We expect a batch of Covaxin to reach us in the next few days but the quantity we are to receive will not be adequate enough to address the demand,” a senior health official said. In the next week, at least 1,000 people vaccinated by the Trichy Corporation in the special Covaxin drives at Kalaiarangam and Thevar halls will also be approaching the authorities for the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/over-3k-await-second-dose-of-covaxin-in-trichy-district/articleshow/83965831.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Delhi||Delhi: Laxmi Nagar under lock and key; shutters, mood down at market||NEW DELHI: Not a single shop on Vijay Chowk Road, the main Laxmi Nagar market and Mangal Bazar opened on Wednesday after the district administration ordered a closure due to heavy congestion and repeated disregard for Covid-appropriate behaviour. On Vikas Marg, TOI found that around half of the shops were operating due to confusion among shopkeepers whether the closure order covered the crowded artery, but there were few shoppers around. The otherwise chaotic Vijay Chowk Road wore a deserted look in the evening. District officials took rounds of the area to ensure Covid relaxation directions were being followed strictly. Miffed with the development, a group of traders met the district magistrate in the evening and argued that controlling congestion on the roads was the responsibility of the administration, not the shopkeepers. Some also accused the authorities of not consulting business owners before taking the decision to shut the markets. Shop owner Raj Garg said, “Since the main bazar connects with neighbouring areas, traffic jams are frequent here. But shopkeepers can only take responsibility for their shops, not the crowd on the streets, which police and district administration should manage.” Late on Tuesday, the East district administration issued an order directing Laxmi Nagar main market, Vikas Marg to Lovely Public School, Kishan kunj, Mangal Bazar, Vijay Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Jagatram Park and Guru Ramdas Nagar to remain closed till July 5, except for establishments dealing in essential goods. A team led by DM Sonika Singh and SDM Rajendra Kumar had visited the areas. Praduman Jain, president of the traders’ body in the main market, said that some shop owners went to the district magistrate’s office with area MLA Abhay Verma and assured of corrective measures to prevent Covid violations. “We promised that the shops wouldn’t encroach on the road space and that we would dissuade hawkers in the market,” said Jain. “But then, we are not the right people to persuade people to wear masks or maintain social distancing.” Sumit Kumar Sharma, president of Mangal Bazar Traders’ Association, felt that the violations should have led to shutting of the market for a day or two. “The decision to close the market for six days is unnecessary and discourages businesses that are already facing losses, having managed to resume operations after two months of zero business,” Sharma said. Criticising the move, Brijesh Goyal, chairman, Chamber of Trade and Industry, said that rather than blame the traders for Covid infractions, the administration and police should diligently enforce discipline on the roads and public places. “The order has created fear among other traders’ associations too. We are jointly going to meet the DMs on this issue. The Kamla Nagar association was also warned about similar action due to congestion,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/laxmi-nagar-under-lock-and-key-shutters-mood-down-at-market/articleshow/84000982.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Customers’ right to change cable service provider’||MUMBAI: Observing that choice of cable service provider is of the customers and they can change it any time, a sessions court granted anticipatory bail to a Ghatkopar businessman after Hathway Digital Ltd accused him of misleading subscribers into taking up his cable connection and replace their set-top boxes. The accused, Paresh Thakkar (54), had a joint venture with Hathaway Cable. The court said the submission that set-top boxes were removed without consent of customers and by inducing them cannot be primafacie believed. It pointed out that of about 6,000 customers, statements of only 9 have been recorded by investigating officers. The court said no statement shows Thakkar induced or forced customers to change boxes. Two FIRs were lodged against Thakkar. “I prima facie find essential ingredients to attract offence of cheating or criminal breach of trust are missing,” the court said. It was alleged that between 2013-16, Hathway provided its set-top boxes to Thakkar. It was claimed that cost of each box was Rs 1,437 and except activation charges, no other charges were recovered from customers towards them. The prosecution said subsequently, Thakkar wanted to replace Hathway’s boxes with his own and began to induce customers to change their preference. It was alleged that in August 2019, 2,610 of Hathway’s set-top boxes valued at Rs 37.40 lakh were removed in Pant Nagar, Ghatkopar. Similarly, 2,126 boxes from Ghatkopar (W) and Vidyavihar valued at Rs 30.55 lakh were removed. Thakkar’s advocates Abad Ponda and Vaibhav Jagtap denied the allegations. The court said with Thakkar willing to to surrender all boxes, his custodial interrogation was not necessary. “Customers have right to change the service provider if they are not satisfied with the service. Applicant (Thakkar) cannot be blamed for that,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-customers-right-to-change-cable-service-provider/articleshow/83970138.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covaxin can be an effective booster shot against variants, say NIV scientists||PUNE: With SARS-CoV-2 variants likely to define the next phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists at National Institute of Virology (NIV) have said that a booster dose of Covaxin may provide a solution to the menace posed by the evolving virus and offer “long-term protection.” A booster dose against Covid is being explored in some countries with other vaccines. Similar research is being considered in India too, said ICMR-NIV director Priya Abraham. A booster shot will come after the first two doses of any vaccine and may have to be given regularly—after a year or two, or later—to keep the immune system primed against SARS-CoV-2 variants. A person receiving a booster will not have to repeat entire two-dose schedule. “Covaxin could be more effective at tackling emerging variants. It can play a useful role as a booster vaccine because both antibodies and cells of the immune system (mounted by Covaxin) are able to recognise and neutralise more proteins of the virus, apart from the spike protein,” said Abraham. Booster shots with a whole virus inactivated vaccine have proven to work well after two doses of any vaccine. “Inactivated vaccines, in general, can trigger a strong immune reaction, though it may not be the same as the immune response to live attenuated vaccines. So, a person may need booster shots to ensure long-term protection,” she said. Some manufacturers have focused solely on making booster shots. One of them is French pharma firm Valneva whose upcoming inactivated vaccine is being currently seen as a prime booster candidate against SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK and most of Europe. “Valneva’s inactivated vaccine— VLA2001 —is part of a UK government-funded clinical trial looking at seven ‘booster’ vaccines. Covaxin can be potentially considered as a booster dose as and when that becomes a recommendation in India and also in other countries,” said Abraham. One of Covaxin’s key selling points is its apparent ability to mount a broader immune response against the whole SARS-CoV-2 virus, instead of just focusing on the spike protein. Various studies have found that the vaccine is effective against different ‘variants of concern’. Asked if the government may consider positioning Covaxin as a booster vaccine against variants, Abraham said: “Such studies are being considered. The Centre has not made such a policy decision yet.” Booster doses could also be helpful for vaccinated people working in certain environme-nts. Healthcare and frontline workers are most at risk. “They are more likely to be considered for a booster dose as and when the country adopts such a policy. Vulnerable groups like the elde-rly or immune-compromised may also need to be prioritized if studies confirm necessity of booster dose,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a national Covid task force member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-covaxin-can-be-an-effective-booster-shot-against-variants-says-niv-scientists/articleshow/83968055.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Nagpur||No Covishield stock, no vaccine in Nagpur Municipal Corporation centres||NAGPUR: With the Nagpur Municipal Corporation keeping 120 of its 122 centres shut due to shortage of Covishield vaccine, inoculation took place only in two. This was happening for the third time in the last seven days since inoculation resumed for the 18-44 age group. Thursday too could see the same story if fresh stock does not land on Wednesday. Vaccination happened at Mahal Diagnostic Centre where only 50 could take the jab. The other centre was operated only for Indian Air Force staff. Covaxin continued to be administered at four centres — 3 for 45-plus and 1 for second dose of 18-44 age group. Totally, only 734 were vaccinated at NMC centres on Wednesday. After a record vaccination of 30,313 on June 26, the numbers have been falling due to lack of doses. Six private centres where vaccination is payable were in operation in the city on June 23. 1,482 people took the jab on that day. Centres increased to seven on June 24 so did the numbers — 1,585. Vaccination dropped to 1,113 despite centres increasing to eight and also there was no free-of-cost inoculation on June 25. Number of beneficiaries increased to 2,301 and 3,356 on June 26 and 27, respectively. Again, numbers dropped to 1,947 on June 28. 2,117 took the jab despite number of centres increased to 10 on June 29. The National Cancer Institute at Jamtha has bought 10,000 doses of Covishield from Serum Institute of India (SII) and giving the jab free of cost. Director Shailesh Joglekar told TOI that “it is their social responsibility”. “We want to facilitate vaccine to those people who are unable to get and yet to take it for any other reasons. Our motive is all people should be vaccinated,” he said. Six more private centres have started payable Covishield and two Covaxin. Wockhardt Hospital is the latest to start Covaxin. Centre head of Wockhardt Hospital Abhinandan Dastenavar told TOI that they are administering both Covishield and Covaxin. “In association with Rotary Elite Club, we are planning a special camp in a hall to vaccinate a large number of people,” he added. Kingsway Hospital was the first to start a private centre on May 31. A 10,188 people (daily average of 1,698) took the jab by paying Rs 1,100 per dose in the first six days. The numbers have gone down since the Centre announced resumption of free-of-cost vaccine. Director Amit Somani said that only corporate companies’ staff are “getting vaccinated at private centres”. “Not many people are coming for the jab, perhaps due to the confusion created by the government. People are waiting for free-of-cost inoculation and avoiding taking it at the earliest. We are facilitating vaccine for a social cause and with a motive that all should be vaccinated as early as possible,” he said. An NMC official said no information related to fresh stock was received on Tuesday. “It is likely that we will not get fresh stock on Wednesday. If this happens, there will be no vaccination on Thursday too,” he said. The Zilla Parishad (ZP) continued vaccination at 59 of its 135 centres. Vaccination declined to 5,070 as against 13,918 a day ago. CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar said around 2,000 doses are remaining with some centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-covishield-stock-no-vax-in-nmc-centres/articleshow/83968018.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Even as he ordered opening of the vaccination to the entire population in the 18-45 age group, subject to availability, the chief minister said the efforts would remain focused on covering the categories prioritised earlier. His government had set a target to immunise all eligible persons in two months, followed by the second vaccine dose as per schedule, he added. At present, 4.8% of Punjab’s eligible population is fully vaccinated, with Mohali leading the chart for both dose one and two. Taking stock of the vaccination progress in Punjab at a Covid review virtual meeting, Capt Amarinder said the state government had already vaccinated more than 62 lakh eligible persons and had been utilising the stock without any wastage. However, he said, there was a gross shortage of vaccines, with no stock of Covishield in the state as of today, and only a small stock of Covaxin available. Pointing out that the state had been repeatedly taking up the issue of inadequate doses with the Government of India, the CM said this had assumed critical importance as Punjab had slowly been opening up sectors conditional to stakeholders having taken at least one dose. He said he would take up the matter again with the Union health minister on an urgent basis and escalate it to the Prime Minister if needed. Punjab health minister Balbir Sidhu questioned the larger number of doses received from the Centre by BJP-ruled states like Haryana and Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-again-runs-of-out-vaccine-capt-asks-centre-to-send-more/articleshow/83968010.cms||---

The cybercrime police have detained a man identified only as Dhruvil, a resident of Nava Vadaj, who has been cheating the complainant for the past two years. The complainant told the cops that he had received a call in which he was told that he can get a VIP number for his mobile phone connection. The accused, Dhruvil, asked him to pay a processing fee. The complainant has been making payments over the past two years and has so far parted with more than a crore. Dhruvil even gave an invoice with the mobile number and said that the sim card would reach the complainant. To gain trust, Dhruvil even returned Rs 11 lakh stating that the payment was excess. Police said that when the complainant did not receive the sim card, he approached the cybercrime cops. Dhruvil was detained with the help of technical surveillance. During the interrogation, the bank account of Dhruvil was checked and the cops recovered Rs 1.40 crore from the account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vip-number-man-cheated-of-rs-1-43cr/articleshow/83968016.cms||---

A private contractor has been appointed to implement the scheme. The traffic department would coordinate with the civic body to inform residents about it. A statement issued by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) stated that the list of all the areas included under the “pay-and-park” scheme had been uploaded on its website www.pcmcindia.gov.in. Shrikant Savane, executive engineer, PCMC, told TOI, “The paid parking will be the beginning of disciplined traffic on the city roads. The project got delayed because of various reasons and was scheduled to be implemented from March 1.” The parking charges would be Rs5 per hour for two- and three-wheelers, Rs10 for cars and tempos, Rs25 for trucks and minibuses, and Rs100 for private buses and heavy vehicles. The scheme was approved in the standing committee meeting in January. Savane said there was haphazard parking across many areas in the civic limits, especially in the busy market areas. The pay-and-park scheme would solve the issue. Since the charges were nominal, it would not create any issues for the citizens as well, he added. The roads under the pay-and-park scheme include Nigdi-Walhekarwadi Spine Road, Telco Road, Spine Road, Nashik Phata-BRTS Road, Aundh-Ravet Road, Thergaon Gavthan Road, Prasundham society, Nashik Phata to Moshi road, Old Mumbai-Pune Highway, Kalewadi Phata to Dehu Alandi road and Tilak Chowk to Big India Chowk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pay-park-scheme-to-make-debut-on-select-roads-in-pcmc-limits-tomorrow/articleshow/83968014.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: INS Agrani warns not to fly drones within three km radius of its premises||COIMBATORE: INS Agrani, Coimbatore, on Tuesday issued a warning that drones should not be flown within 3 km radius of the navy installation in the city. Though there are rules already in force prohibiting the usage of drones near defence establishments, the warning has been issued in the wake of drone attacks on the Indian Air Force Station in Jammu on Sunday morning. In a public notice issued on Tuesday, INS Agrani said flying of non-conventional aerial objects (drones/unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) are prohibited within 3km of the establishment. Any remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) such as drones/UAVs found violating this prohibition will be destroyed or confiscated without any liability and actions may be initiated under sections 121 (waging or attempting to wage a war or abetting waging of a war against the Government of India), 121A (conspiracy to commit offences punishable by section 121), 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of other) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code against the operator. If drone flying is deemed necessary, the operator/agency should obtain approval from the Director of General Civil Aviation (DGCA) through the Digi Sky website and a copy of the approval letter to be submitted to INS Agrani at least one week before the scheduled flying operation. According to sources, following the drone attack at IAF station in Jammu, all the defence installations across the country were alerted by the ministry of defence. “Our entire premises are protected by armed guards round the clock. If anyone is operating the drones above the defence installations, the drones will be destroyed immediately, and stringent action will be taken against the drone operators,” said an official from the defence sector. The Coimbatore district has Sulur Air Force Station, INS Agrani, Central Training College of CRPF, Kurudampalayam, and an international airport. Many youngsters in Coimbatore have been using drones to capture the sceneries and aerial view of the city. Wedding photographers and political parties also use drones to capture the crowds on aerial view. However, most of the operators are not aware of the guidelines to operate drones. To regularize the operation of RAPS or drones in Coimbatore district, collector GS Sameeran is planning to conduct a meeting with Coimbatore city police commissioner Deepak M Damor and police officials soon. The district administration will soon come out with do’s and don’ts while operating drones in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/ins-agrani-warns-not-to-fly-drones-within-3km-radius-of-its-premises/articleshow/83968072.cms||A Subburaj

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice T S Sivagnanam observed, “The state converted a super speciality hospital for covid treatment.

The senior counsel for the state submitted that police are apprehending law and order problems as the family members are staging protests in their village and in front of the collectorate campus. The court directed the Tirunelveli city commissioner of police and Tirunelveli superintendent of police to file a status report. The court was hearing the petition filed by A Pavanasam, seeking a judicial inquiry into the death of his son P Muthu Mano, 27, by a sitting judge of the HC and a compensation of Rs 2 crore. This is the second petition filed by the petitioner. When the case was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that despite granting several opportunities, the petitioner has not complied with the earlier order and has not received the body. Instead, the petitioner had filed an affidavit casting certain aspersions on the court before a division bench. The senior counsel for the state informed the court that the body remains in the mortuary of the Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital for over 60 days. He submitted that the dean had requested the police to take steps . Taking cognizance of the submissions, the judges gave the direction to the police officers. During the previous hearing, the court had made it clear that it would pass appropriate directions to the authorities to cremate or bury the body of the deceased as per customary rights followed by the family of the deceased, if the father is not willing to comply with the earlier order to receive the body of his son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/murdered-prisoners-kin-refuse-to-take-body-even-after-60-days/articleshow/83965878.cms||---

The increase was noted in the ‘Poonam Avlokan’ (population observation exercise during full moon). The exercise was first held last year in June in place of Lion Census 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Gujarat forest department officials said that the lion population could be between 710 and 730. The officials said that the counting exercise will be made an annual affair so that the lion numbers are published every year instead of every five years. The 2020 Poonam Avlokan in the lion landscape had recorded 674 royal beasts with an increase rate of 28.9% over the 2019 figure. The previous high in the growth rate was 27% in 2015 over the 2010 figures. The 2015 count was 523 lions. “We are still analyzing the data,” a senior forest department officer in Gandhinagar said. “However, the preliminary indication is that the lion population has definitely crossed the 700-mark, which is a healthy sign for conservation.” The officials said that the 2020 count had revealed the adult male to adult female ratio to be 1:1.61 and the adult female to cub ratio to be 1:0.53. These ratios have not drastically changed. The officials said that a count of lactating lionesses (adult females with cubs less than one year of age) was also undertaken. This data is being studied. Of the 260 adult females, 23% were recorded to be lactating in June 2020. The officials said that the count in 2021 has revealed that the lions’ range spanned 30,000 sq km and they annexed no new territory over the past year. The distribution of the lions had increased from an area of about 22,000 sq km in 2015 to about 30,000 sq km in 2020, representing a 36% expansion in the range. The officials in Gandhinagar said that the lion population remains the same in Gir, Mitiyala, Girnar, and Pania sanctuaries. The population growth has been mainly in zones outside the sanctuaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-pride-lion-count-officially-crosses-700-mark/articleshow/83968071.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday directed his subordinates to conduct a techno-economic feasibility study on setting up the mega project in the region. The development comes after a delegation, under leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, apprised him of the need to set up the project in Vidarbha. He was accompanied by a team of Vidarbha Economic Development (VED) Council, which made a presentation to him on how the project would be feasible. “We explained to him that the project will not only generate many jobs in Vidarbha but also attract various industries and investment. We told him that a gas pipeline can be brought till Nagpur from Samruddhi highway. The minister took it very positively and immediately asked officials to prepare a techno-economic feasibility study,” Fadnavis said, expressing confidence that the project would be a big success in the region. Reiterating that the standalone petrochemical complex would be Vidarbha’s biggest project, VED president Shiv Kumar Rao clarified that it would be a completely different one from Nanar, where the refinery was proposed. “This one would be gas based and cater to a large number of petro-chemical industries in Central India. Even the minister was not keen to have a refinery here as it would need investors, but a petrochemical complex would be a win-win situation for all industries. The refinery can be looked at later as it wouldn’t bring much revenue here.” He added they were expecting the central team to visit the region shortly as the minister had directly asked petroleum secretary Tarun Kapoor to expedite the feasibility study. VED member Pradeep Maheshwari, who has done exhaustive research on the project, told TOI that it would require an investment of Rs1 lakh crore approximately while the ancillary industries will further be set up for Rs25,000-Rs35,000 crore. “The mega project would have a potential to generate about two lakh direct and indirect jobs.” He said though they had earlier proposed to set up the project at Kuhi Mandal, Fadnavis insisted on showing three to four areas to the visiting team from the petroleum ministry. “The leader of opposition himself gave a presentation and explained the project to Pradhan. We’re also guided by expert in the field Vinayak Marathe, who has over 34 years of experience in working with Reliance petrochemical plant.” Pradhan also tweeted after the meeting that he had discussions on establishing a petrochemical complex in Vidarbha to create opportunities for employment and economic growth in the state. Quoting VED presentation, Fadnavis said fuel consumption in Central India that was about 14-15 MTPA can be met by setting up the project here. “The region will get not only fuel and LPG but also many important petrochemicals used by downstream industries like textiles, soaps and detergents, paints, cement, and steel. Not only the refinery but ancillaries also may ensure a ig prosperity in the region with employment,” he said. About the proposed project It’s a standalone petrochemical complex Total investment is Rs1.25-Rs1.35 lakh crore For the complex — Rs1 lakh crore For ancillary industries — Rs25,000-Rs35,000 crore Employment generation — 2 lakh direct & indirect jobs||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/petrochemical-unit-in-vidarbha-feasibility-study-soon/articleshow/83967982.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The petitioners — Asgar Kadar Sheikh and Mohd Yakub Nagul — prayed for release through the lawyer in view of amendment to the ‘Bombay Parole and Furlough Rules’, enabling prisoners to be released to contain the spread of Covid-19 inside jails.“We’re of the view that the lawyer made an attempt to mislead this court by suppressing the material fact that both petitioners are ineligible for being released on emergency parole as they had surrendered late on earlier occasions,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar said.The bench pointed out that when lawyers make a statement before the court, it’s assumed that it’s made in their capacity as its officers, and not an effort to get a favourable order by suppressing the material fact or binding precedent.“A large number of matters involving intricate questions of law are often disposed of by courts on the basis of a lawyer’s statement. Them being court officers, normally their statement is accepted as true and correct. We’re of the opinion that the lawyer tried to twist the relevant facts and suppressed material facts to snatch a favourable order,” the court observed.The judges said notwithstanding the easy availability of numerous legal software for research, reliance was placed upon an HC judgment which was passed without noticing the earlier full bench judgment.“This is akin to relying on an overruled judgment which results in a waste of judicial time. It may be due to negligence of the lawyer, but the consequence would be an erroneous judgment having precedential value, possibly requiring constitution of a larger bench to correct the error, which crept in due to his failure to perform his duty.”Stressing that such failure in duty is a wrong against justice delivery system in the country, the justices reiterated that advocates’ duty, at all levels, is to double check and verify position of law and facts of the case before making any presentation to court.“A message must be sent to each of the lawyers playing a vital role in the justice delivery system to be responsible and careful in what they present to the court. A lawyer must not hesitate in telling the correct position of law when it is indisputable,” the HC said. The court added, “A view of the law which is a binding precedent even if it’s not in favour of the lawyer’s client, must be brought to the notice of court. This obligation flows from the confidence reposed in the lawyers appearing for either side. Being an officer of court, an advocate must bring to notice the correct position of law, whether for or against either party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-raps-lawyer-rejects-parole-plea-of-2-mumbai-blasts-accused/articleshow/83931459.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Kochi||Trial in Kadakkavoor Sarada murder case nears completion||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The witness examination as part of the trial in the Kadakkavoor Sarada murder case was completed at the district additional sessions court VI here on Tuesday. The case pertains to the horrific murder of 70-year-old Sarada by one Manikantan in 2016. Both the victim and accused were residents of Keezhattingal under Kadakkavoor police station limits. The final hearing in the trial which commenced in March this year is scheduled to begin on Thursday. The judge is expected to pronounce the verdict soon after. The alleged crime related to the case took place on December 10, 2016. Sarada was living alone following the death of her husband. The accused, Manikantan, who was 31 years old then, allegedly tried to molest her at her house and when she resisted, stabbed her on her chest and stomach using a knife which he was carrying. As per the police report, this was the second murder he committed in a span of three days. Three days before, he had allegedly murdered one Manu of Poovanpara near Alamcode, similarly using a knife. He was on the run when he ended up in the backyard of Sarada’s house on the night of her murder. He was in an inebriated state then. He requested her to give some water to quench his thirst. Since she already knew him as someone living in the same neighbourhood, she did not hesitate to help him. But as she was handing over the water, he allegedly tried to grab her. She resisted his advances and tried to fight back. When she screamed for help, he took out the knife and stabbed her before fleeing. While being taken to the hospital, Sarada told the neighbours that Manikantan was the one who attacked her. The police located him and arrested him three days later. It was after that it was revealed that he was the one behind the alleged murder of Manu. The trial in the case related to murder of Manu is yet to commence. Public prosecutor M Salahudeen appeared before the court, representing the prosecution. The prosecution examined as many as 32 witnesses, 49 documentary evidences and 21 material objects against the accused during the witness examination. The trial procedures are expected to finish within a week.

The CS told the HC that the next cabinet meeting was scheduled on July 16. Considering that, the chief secretary, secretary (finance) Amit Negi, secretary (transport) Ranjit Sinha and the transport corporation MD have now been directed to appear before the court on July 19 and inform the court about the developments. The HC on June 25 had slammed the state government for failing to pay wages to thousands of roadways workers for five months, saying the behaviour “amounted to criminal negligence” and ‘begari’ or “forced labour”. The court was informed that a proposal had been prepared by the transport corporation, which includes a request for payment of around Rs 140 crore, so roadways employees can be paid salaries, PF and gratuity, will be presented before the cabinet. The court pointed out that the proposal had lacunae as there was no mention of the expenditure that the corporation would incur from July to December. The court calculated that merely the salary bills for this period amount to over Rs 100 crore. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma has directed the managing director (MD) of the corporation, Abhishek Rohilla, to submit a complete proposal to the government so that it can be presented in the next cabinet meeting. It has also directed for Rs 23 crores of hill-loss amount (funds released by the government to compensate for losses incurred by buses in remote areas) to be transferred to the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-asks-state-to-update-proposal-on-roadways-staff/articleshow/83965939.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Delhi||Woman Battles For Life After Chinese Manjha Slits Throat||New Delhi: A 24-year-old woman was critically injured after a Chinese kite string (manjha) slit her throat while she was riding a scooter on Monday evening. Police have registered a case and are trying to trace the kite string user whose negligence led to the incident. The injured woman has been identified as Nisha, a housewife who lives in Ghaziabad’s Vijay Nagar area with her husband and two sons. Police have found that Nisha had come to Nand Nagri to visit her mother and on Monday, she and her mother and siblings were going to visit a relative in Filmistaan who is unwell. “As told by the witnesses, Nisha was riding a scooter with her mother riding pillion and her sister was on another scooter with their brother. It was when she was going down the Seelampur flyover, a kite string got tangled around her neck. Before Nisha could apply brakes, her throat was slit and she fell off the two-wheeler,” said a senior police officer. Passersby and Nisha’s family members then rushed her to a hospital where she was admitted for treatment and was later shifted to an ICU as her condition deteriorated. After the matter was reported to police, a team of cops also reached the spot for inspection. The team met Nisha’s family at the hospital and recorded their statement based on which a case has been registered at Shastri Park police station to probe the negligence that led to the incident, the officer said. The use of Chinese manjha in kite flying is banned in India, but still, its use kills several birds every year and injures many people as well. Many activists have also repeatedly argued that the manjha ban is only limited to the files and that there’s no implementation or strict action against its users or dealers to curb the sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-battles-for-life-after-chinese-manjha-slits-throat/articleshow/83968087.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After the doctors submitted a report upon examination of the 17-year-old and opined that her pregnancy can be terminated with usual risk, Justice Vipul Pancholi permitted the doctors to terminate the pregnancy with due risk after Ante Natal Care (ANC) profile report. The court ordered the doctors to hand over the tissues drawn from the fetus for DNA identification to the investigating officer, who is probing the FIR lodged with Ajidam police station. The Class XII student had moved the HC last week through advocate H B Champavat after lodgement of an FIR. She requested the HC to grant permission for medical termination of pregnancy by citing the law that the doctors were reluctant for the same because the law does not permit it once the pregnancy is advanced, particularly after 20 weeks. In her case, the doctors said that she had 23 weeks and 4 days pregnancy. The high court had ordered medical examination of the teen and sought report. Upon receiving positive report, the HC has given its nod for abortion.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Sowing rises, agri loans swell 22%||AHMEDABAD: Thanks to a good monsoon, and record sowing in 2020-21, agriculture loan disbursals in Gujarat grew 22%. According to the latest report of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Gujarat, agriculture loan disbursals in 2020-21 rose to Rs 84,788 crore from Rs 69,325 crore. The report was tabled during the 169th SLBC meeting held last week. Banking sector sources said that the main reason behind the increase in disbursals was greater sowing. “The sowing was phenomenally good because of a good monsoon. As a result, agricultural activity picked up pace,” said a senior official of a public sector bank, on the condition of anonymity. The official added: “To increase sowing, farmers seek higher loans in the form of farm credit to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and farm equipment.” As a consequence, he said, agri-loan disbursals went up significantly. According to the data of the Gujarat agriculture department, kharif sowing took place across 87.24 lakh hectares in the state in 2020, up 2.7% against the 10-year average of 84.9 lakh hectares. Rabi sowing showed a 34.2% increase in 2020-21 and took place across 46.15 lakh hectares against the 10-year average of 24.38 lakh hectares. “The sowing was good at the onset of monsoon in 2020. However, there was crop destruction due to heavy rainfall in July,” said a senior agriculture department official. “As a result, farmers had to sow again, which could have contributed to the increase in agriculture loans.” Sources said that more harvesters as well as tractors were bought by farmers to meet their growing needs. Data of the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) suggests that tractor sales increased from 47,067 units in 2019-20 to 55,678 units in 2020-21, up 18% year-on-year. “Sales have remained good due to a good monsoon, not just of tractors but of harvesters too,” said a FADA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sowing-rises-agri-loans-swell-22/articleshow/83968099.cms||Niyati Parikh

SCTL sent letters on this regard to Kunal Kumar, joint secretary and mission director (Smart Cities), ministry of housing and urban affairs, the motor vehicles department and Automotive Research Association of India. SCTL had earlier sent show-cause notices in March and April to the company after complaints surfaced regarding glitches in battery, power and mileage of the vehicles and issues regarding service of the vehicle. SCTL CEO V R Krishna Teja Mylavarapu confirmed that letters have been sent. Officials associated with the project said that the company had failed to address the issues properly in spite of raising it several times. Lack of a service centre further added to the grievances. SCTL had to enter into an agreement with Kudumbasree to engage new beneficiaries for the e-rickshaw project under Smart City scheme. A few beneficiaries had backed out from the scheme citing various technical difficulties, prompting SCTL to look for new beneficiaries. Flagged off by the then mayor K Sreekumar in August, the e-rickshaws were aimed at encouraging shared mobility scheme in the city. The plan to launch shared mobility was put off owing to spread of Covid-19. Although the design was altered to ensure social distancing, it was suggested that shared mobility shall not be initiated using e-rickshaws during the time of pandemic. The beneficiaries chosen for the scheme were given training and directed to run it as normal passenger autos. Some of the beneficiaries raised concerns regarding incurring electricity bills from charging at home and some complained of power delivered by the vehicle. SCTL installed a charging station at Gandhi Park with it taking care of the entire expense. Even then, some of the beneficiaries reportedly stuck with the demand to get e-autos instead of e-rickshaws and four of them even returned the vehicles. SCTL had procured 15 e-rickshaws at a cost of Rs 2.30 lakh each in 2020. The shared auto scheme mainly aimed at promoting two routes which witness highest traffic congestion and short distance trips by many commuters. SCTL had planned that shared mobility would enable an individual passenger to spend less amount for the travel, whereas the e-rickshaw driver can earn more than the fare rate for a point to point travel as passengers have varying pickup and drop off points.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/citys-ambitious-e-mobility-plan-bumps-into-a-hurdle/articleshow/83966023.cms||Aswin J Kumar

No wonder than that for all their civic woes, people reach out to the opposition party’s dashboard to give voice to their grievances after they receive no sympathy from the existing helpline. While Congress managed to get only four seats out of 72 in the last municipal elections, its dashboard, which it had started started online dashboard from June 17, has been flooded with 122 complaints in only 13 days. One such complaint from ward number 8 reads: “Builders show parking area only to get completion certificates, but thereafter construct commercial complexes there. There are many such construction in Nana Mauva area but the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) is doing nothing.” “We don’t get water with full force. While we have registered several complaints on RMC helpline, nobody seems to care,” reads another complaint from ward number 15. The dashboard has received 19 complaints regarding drinking water, 16 of sanitation, 8 of streetlights and 26 of drainage and gutter problems — all from every ward of the city. Leader of opposition in RMC, Bhanuben Sorani said, “We have received over 122 complaints which we have forwarded to the municipal corporation as well as to the officer concerned in the administration.

---||Delhi||3 in 4 adolescents facing sleep disorders: Survey||New Delhi: The Covid-19 pandemic has not just affected the academic schedule of students. An online survey conducted in Delhi-NCR shows that nearly three out of every four adolescents are having irregular sleep-wake cycles. Around 51% of them said staying home all day had affected their eating habits. The prevalence of anxiety and depression among adolescents is also on the rise, said Dr Sameer Malhotra, director and head of the department of mental health and behavioural sciences at Max Saket who led the project. “An action plan is needed to address the issues of mental health, especially among children, to prevent it from becoming a serious crisis as a result of the disruption caused in day-to-day activities due to the pandemic,” he underlined. Earlier, a similar survey was carried out by the hospital to assess the Covid-19 impact on the mental health of adults. Dr Malhotra said the study on adults covering over 1,000 participants from across the country had revealed every second Indian had some signs of anxiety and more than one-fourth of the respondents were experiencing significant depressive symptoms. In the survey involving adolescents, mostly school- and college-going students, the researchers found more than half of the respondents stressed about college and career opportunities after Covid-19. Nearly one in every 10 adolescents reported feeling, almost always, restless or anxious. A few also reported frequent spells of anger and crying. The doctor said 72% of the adolescents had complained about irregular sleep-wake cycles and 58% a change in their eating habits. Psychiatrists also say post-lockdown, they were getting distress calls from families for people suffering from anxiety, depression and thoughts of self-harm. According to Dr Shalini Garg, consultant at Moolchand Hospital’s paediatric ophthalmology department, closure of schools and cessation of outdoor activities have also had a huge impact on the visual health of children. “In our clinic, nearly 90% of the children presenting with ocular symptoms have had induced myopia or increase in their power of glasses. Around 30% with no symptom have developed some myopia or signs of digital vision strain,” she said. Public health specialists stress on the need to encourage healthy physical activity, sports and healthy communication for better mental and physical health. The Union health ministry recently started a campaign to motivate the youth to share stories and content on social media that can uplift, encourage and inspire others to brave the tough times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-in-4-adolescents-facing-sleep-disorders-survey/articleshow/84001054.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Less than 10% of the government hospital beds and 16% private hospital beds are being occupied now. Demand for oxygen supported beds went up drastically and hospitals struggled to meet the demand during the onset of Covid-19 second wave. Following this, oxygen supported bed strength went up to 1,975 in the government hospitals and in May, they were almost fully occupied. However, on June 28, as many as 1,802 beds were vacant with only 173 of them being occupied. Similarly, in the private sector, 1,003 of the total of 1,204 oxygen supported beds became vacant with just 201 patients in all the hospitals requiring oxygen. Demand for ICU beds also went down. Only 25 out of the 169 ICU beds in the government hospitals were occupied and ninety ICU beds out of the total of 448 had patients in them during the same period. Madurai district tested 14,000 people on Monday of which only 74 tested positive. Meanwhile, the Covid care centres in Madurai are fast becoming vacant with only 53 of the 2,280 beds filled with Covid patients.

The transport department meanwhile held a meeting with the state transport undertakings (STUs) for finalising the operation of buses in the city from Thursday. While autos have been flouting the restrictions for sometime now, mostly out of desperation to earn and also because demand for commute has been high ever since offices opened, they began plying on regular routes, carrying four and at times five passengers instead of two that they are supposed to carry from Thursday. In KMC area alone, there are over 10,000 autos plying in more than 300 routes. “At least 50% autos hit the road in our routes on Tuesday,” said Gobindo Mahapatra, a auto union leader at Rashbehari. The autos, though, charged more. If Covid norms are imposed and number of passengers is halved, the unions warned the fare would be doubled. “The fare from Behala to Rashbehari, that is Rs 20, will then be Rs 40,” added Mahapatra. After nearly one and half months, metered taxis, too, ventured out with many operating shuttle service during office hours, carrying four passengers. But most of them demanded higher fare citing diesel prices. “Taxi operators rejoiced after the CM’s announcement and hit the road on Tuesday itself, though we advised them not to,” said Sanjib Roy of Bengal Taxi Association. Roy said never-ending hike in diesel prices posed a threat to cab community. “But it is below the dignity of most cabbies to clamour for extra money. This is why we are sending another letter to transport minister on fare revision,” said Roy. West Bengal Transport Corporation, which serves the Kolkata Metropolitan Area, will run 800 buses on intra-city routes, while South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC) will run 750 buses. North Bengal Transport Corporation will ply 500 buses. But, uncertainty looms over private buses. Most said it will be a huge task to restart operation without revision of fare.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/autos-taxis-hit-the-streets-cloud-over-bus-ops-as-pvt-operators-want-fare-hike/articleshow/83965997.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

A C Kumar, who had completed BSc Chemistry in 1970 and subsequently completed MBBS degree in 1978 registered his name in the Tamil Nadu Medical Council. Though Kumar was selected for the post of civil assistant surgeon, he had applied for the post of part time vocational instructor in a school and was appointed in 1984. Before his retirement on superannuation in 2009, Kumar had submitted several representations seeking to regularise his services as a full time instructor and to provide monetary benefits. However, the authorities in 2009 had rejected his application on the ground that the qualification for the post was fixed as BSc Nursing and the petitioner had qualification of BSc Chemistry and MBBS. It was also further stated that the MBBS degree was obtained from the Andhra University and the same was not equivalent to the MBBS degree issued by the Madras University. Kumar has filed a petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2010, challenging the rejection order and a single judge in 2016 had directed to regularise his services and grant him monetary benefits. Challenging the order, the state government had preferred this present appeal. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed, “We are pleasantly surprised as it is one of the rarest of rare cases where a person who has completed his MBBS degree thought fit to serve in a post which is much inferior to which he was eligible. We have no doubt in our mind that such unique cases will never arise in future.” The judges observed that they find the reasoning given by the single judge to be proper and does not call for any interference. Hence, the judges dismissed the appeal and directed the state to implement the order of the single judge within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/regularise-service-of-doctor-who-opted-to-take-up-an-inferior-job-hc/articleshow/83966059.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra first to start MDA to end hattirog after 2nd wave||NAGPUR: The mass drug administration (MDA) rounds for elimination of lymphatic filariasis (hattirog in local languages) are back. Six districts in Maharashtra — Bhandara, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Gondia, Yavatmal and Nanded will start these rounds from July 1. With this, Maharashtra will become the first state in the country to start such drive after the second wave of Covid-19. Officials told TOI the drive will be completed in 15 days. Last year, this drive was held in 18 districts, including Nagpur. But, as other districts have improved in transmission assessment survey (TAS), now only six districts will have the drive. Five out of these six districts are from Vidarbha, with four of them from Nagpur division alone. Of the six districts, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur and Bhandara will undertake the crucial triple drug therapy (IDA). Combination of three anti-filarial drugs (Ivermectin, Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and Albendazole) will be delivered to citizens in these three districts. Others will get two-drug regime i.e Diethylcarbamazine (DEC)+ Albendazole. This year, the entire drive will be conducted following the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Tablets will be distributed in personalized bowls for every family member. “Bhandara has failed twice in the TAS and hence we have special focus on this district,” said Dr Sanjeev Jadhav, additional director of health services, filaria. “Ivermectin was prescribed to Covid patients often during the second wave of the pandemic. A course of five days was prescribed to Covid patients. Even after recovering from it, they can go for the IDA therapy. We are giving it in very less quantity,” added Dr Jadhav. Dr Nupur Roy, additional director, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), government of India, said public support to this drive is a must. Speaking about the drive in the midst of Covid-19, Dr Archana Patil, director of health services, filaria, said, “Covid-19 has taught us, now more than ever, it is crucial we integrate public health programmes at the systemic and ground level. We will follow all safety measures. The popular unique bowl method will be used,” she said. Under this method, a separate clean and dry bowl is given for every beneficiary in the family and the drug administrator leaves the tablets in that particular bowl. Physical distancing is maintained due to this. The state health department has set target of giving medicine to 65% population in Yavatmal, Nanded and Gondia, while 85% population in Bhandara, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli will be covered. Drug administrators will ensure the beneficiary consumes the tablets in front of him/her. Officials accepted that Covid-19 pandemic situation has created obstacles in the drive against filariasis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-1st-to-start-mda-to-end-hattirog-after-2nd-wave/articleshow/83968114.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Delhi||Six injured in brawl over parking in northeast Delhi||NEW DELHI: Six men were injured after two families clashed over a parking-related issue in northeast Delhi’s Jyoti Nagar on Monday night. Police have registered two separate cases based on the complaints received from each group and are probing the incident. Senior police officers said that there was no communal angle behind the brawl. According to police, a quarrel was reported around 9 pm. On reaching the spot, they found that two families — Om Parkash (70) and his two sons and Shahnawaj (46) and his two sons — who are neighbours in Jyoti Nagar had a fight over parking a vehicle on the street. “All six men sustained injuries in the clash and had to be taken to hospital. Both the parties gave complaints to the police based on which two separate FIRs were registered to probe the assault. Statements of witnesses and other family members of these men are being recorded to know more,” said a senior police officer. Police are also checking CCTV footage from the area to establish the sequence of the incident. “The initial probe has revealed that the matter was not communal and that the fight had started over an issue related to parking. Police have ensured adequate deployment in the area to make sure that the law and order is maintained.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/six-injured-in-brawl-over-parking-in-northeast-delhi/articleshow/83968115.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Mass drug administration against filariasis from July 1||AURANGABAD: Maharashtra is set to become the second state after Chhattisgarh to resume mass drugs administration (MDA) programmes that had come to a halt during the pandemic. Six districts, namely Nanded in Marathwada along with Yavatmal, Bhandara, Chandrapur, Gondia and Gadchiroli districts in the Vidarbha region will have MDA programmes against filariasis between July 1 and 15, covering more than 1 crore people. Dr Archana Patil, the state director of health services, on Tuesday, said Maharashtra was committed to ensuring the last-mile delivery of public health services even during the pandemic. “We will adopt all necessary innovations to safely deliver the essential services under the lymphatic filariasis elimination programme. It is essential that all households in the endemic areas receive and consume the anti-filaria drugs in the presence of healthcare workers. This is the only way we can check the transmission of filariasis,” she said at a media sensitization workshop. Also known as elephantiasis, lymphatic filariasis is considered the second-most disabling disease after mental health according to the WHO. It is transmitted by infected mosquitoes. As per the official data, Maharashtra has 18 lymphatic filariasis endemic districts with close to 31,258 lymphoedema (abnormal swelling in the limbs) and 11,929 hydrocele (abnormal swelling of the scrotum) cases being reported in 2020-21. Dr Sanjeev Jadhav, the additional director of health services, said a unique ‘bowl method’ would be adopted during the MDA to maintain social distancing. “The method involves the use of separate clean and dry bowls for members of every family to administer the tablets. It will avoid direct contact with the beneficiaries and maintain social distancing,” he said, adding that such a method was followed in Chhattisgarh during MDA. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope, in a video appeal, said the anti-filaria medicines to be administered during the proposed MDA programme are completely safe and effective. “During MDA, trained health workers will follow Covid-appropriate protocols and conduct house-to-house visits to provide free-of-cost anti-filaria medicines to beneficiaries in all communities in affected areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mass-drug-administration-against-filariasis-from-july-1/articleshow/83963512.cms||Prasad Joshi

Lobo said that D’Souza told him that the deed of sale has not been executed yet, but that he has taken an advance. On Monday, D’Souza had claimed harassment by officials. Reacting to this, Lobo said, “If anyone has harassed him, he should tell me their name, we will take action if anyone from our department has harassed him.” D’Souza’s post complaining of harassment had notably excluded Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins. “The panchayat has not harassed him,” Lobo said. “The panchayat is close to him. I am meeting him on Wednesday so he will tell me everything related to the harassment.” “For the last two years, he has been telling me that he is selling Tito’s,” Lobo said. “He is a very close friend of mine. I have always supported his business, including Tito’s, Mambo’s and the restaurants. I am the only person who told him not to sell.” “Even if he wants to sell, (he should) sell a small percentage like 30-40%, and keep the larger stake,” Lobo said. “Today he had made up his mind and I don’t know why. I will tell him again not to sell but if he wants to, to sell less than 50%.” On Monday, D’Souza’s post announcing the sale stated, “I personally have suffered the least as I was compensated adequately, and even my future generations won’t have to work. I will also share some with our staff, but in the long term, they now have no jobs.” Apart from Martins, he also excluded CM Pramod Sawant and some others from his harassment allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tell-me-who-harassed-you-will-take-action-lobo-to-titos/articleshow/83970363.cms||---

The team also took stock of the measures being taken against dengue there. Gupta said the visit was to review the steps being taken to check the spread of Covid as well as dengue, the latter because mosquitoes bred especially in the puddles in monsoon. “Both Covid and dengue cases are now low in the area and we want to keep it that way. We visited some markets and had a meeting with BMC BoA, health officials and police,” he said. Salt Lake has three containment zones, two in BF Block and one at Laboni. Officials also visited CK and EC markets and parts of Duttabad. “Sanitisation and awareness drive on Covid and dengue are on,” said BMC BOA chairperson Krishna Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/inspection-to-curb-cov-dengue-in-salt-lake/articleshow/83968116.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||96% Kolkata cops vaccinated||KOLKATA: Almost 96% of the Kolkata Police force have been vaccinated barring those with drug allergies or other problems. This has given the force in the high-risk category a semblance of protection ahead of the third wave. “Despite being vaccinated, senior officers have cautioned that Covid SOPs will have to be followed. This includes staying in separated barracks and ensuring physical distancing from complainants at police stations. All personnel will have to wear masks and use sanitizers,” said an officer. Kolkata Police is set to begin July on a positive note with no fresh cases reported in the past 72 hours. This is the first time this has happened since February, said welfare cell officers. There are only 14 active cases with none in hospital. Lalbazar sources said while initially there were 10-14 fresh cases every day, it rose to around 20-25 right after the elections. The daily average kept hovering in the same bracket till about a week into the enhanced restrictions. “Once the curbs entered the second week, there were two to four cases each day. This is the first time no fresh cases got reported for three days,” said an officer. June had just 26 Covid cases compared to 157 in May, he added. “We still have a few active cases out of the 618 reported during the second wave. Though we lost six colleagues, there have been no fresh death in June,” he said. With the restrictions on local trains and Metro extended till July 15, “the force would ideally like to bring down the number of active cases to single digit by July first week,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/96-kolkata-cops-vaccinated/articleshow/83966036.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The DDMA, which is headed by district collector with other key officials including police commissioner and municipal commissioner as its members, has warned that any non-compliance would invite action. Besides hotels and restaurants, establishments like mess, government and private offices, functional halls, gyms, saloons and beauty parlours among others have also been asked to operate with only 50% capacity of workforce or customers as per the latest order issued by the DDMA detailing out the Covid-related curbs. Resident deputy collector of Aurangabad Anant Gavhane said all the establishments concerned are expected to display boards at their entry points, specifying their total seating capacity. “The simple measure will help people know the restricted 50% seating capacity and avoid crowding. It is essential to avoid crowding at places that are strictly asked to operate with only 50% seating capacity,” he said. Several hotel and restaurant owners said they are fine with following the measures laid down by the DDMA. “We have already put up boards stating that take-away orders are allowed after 4 pm. The mention of seating capacity can be made on the same boards,” Abhijeet Ranjangaokar, a hotel owner from N-11 sector, said. Among other specific restrictions, establishments such as gym, beauty parlours, spas and wellness centres have been prohibited from using air-conditioners as prevention from producing conductive conditions for the spread of coronavirus, it was said.

Greenfield City in Behala that has 4,066 apartments, has tied up with a state-run CVC to vaccinate 1,076 domestic helpers. Till now, 225 have got vaccinated. Earlier, a paid medical camp was held where 1,584 residents were vaccinated, Greenfield City Foundation chairman Sourav Chandra said. Several other housing societies too have sponsored the vaccination of support staff like Ideal Enclave in Rajarhat, New Town, which arranged jabs for all support staff, including security, housekeeping, utilities, domestic maids and drivers. South City and Upohar have vaccinated 300 and 225 support staff, respectively. Urbana, apart from vaccinating its own staff, has also tied up with Indian Chamber of Commerce to organise a free CVC as CSR activity. “We started vaccinating our support staff in June beginning and extended it later to those employed in other houses in the neighbourhood,” said Urbana facility management director and senior VP of Bengal NRI, Debjni Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/housing-complexes-sponsor-support-staff-jabs/articleshow/83966072.cms||---

Bharat Shinde, the assistant conservator of the forest department, Nashik division, said the funds will be used to increase and improve the amenities for the tourists visiting the Nandur Madhyameshwar wetland. Natural tracks, a cafeteria, toilets, watch towers, parking areas, signages, informations boards etc. are on the cards. “Currently, the entry point to the wetland is from the Chapadgaon village near Saikheda. To avoid the crowding of tourists at one site, we are planning three more entry gates to the wetland. These entry gates are being planned at Kothure, Manjargaon and Khandgaon villages. We will soon start the work on developing various tourist amenities,” Shinde added. Located in Niphad taluka, Nandur Madhyameshwar is home to 536 species of aquatic and terrestrial plants, eight species of mammals, 265 species of birds, 24 species of freshwater fish and 41 species of butterflies. Thousands of migratory birds arrive at this wetland between October and March. The tourist footfall also increases during this period every year. In January 2020, Nandur Madhyameshwar was declared a Ramsar site (a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar convention). The coveted tag would help in the scientific conservation of the wetland.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rs-15cr-allotted-to-boost-tourism-at-nandur-madhyameshwar/articleshow/83963592.cms||---
---||Madurai||Remove encroachments from Sivaganga temple land: High court to HR and CE||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Monday directed the HR and CE department to take steps to remove encroachments on a plea moved by a man alleging that some people close to a former AIADMK minister had encroached on a temple land in Sivaganga district. In his petition, T Sengaimaran, a resident of Thiruppuvanam stated that 9.58 acres of land belonging to the Gowri Vinayagar Temple is situated in the district. In May 2020, people close to the former minister had encroached the temple land and started to construct a commercial building. Though he submitted a representation to the authorities in July 2020, no steps were taken as he was a DMK cadre and the encroachers were close to the former minister. Once again on June 19, 2021, he submitted a representation seeking to remove the encroachments and to take action against the encroachers. He further stated that after a news item was published recently about the encroachment in the temple land, the HR and CE department had retrieved the land, but did not take steps to remove the encroachments. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking to demolish the building on the temple land. The counsel for HR and CE department submitted that notices were issued to the encroachers by asking them to remove the encroachments by June 30. Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi directed the encroachers to remove the encroachments as per the notice issued by the HR and CE department, failing with the officials shall remove the encroachments and recover the cost from them. The judges directed to complete the exercise within 12 weeks and disposed of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/remove-encroachments-from-temple-land-hc-to-hc-hrce/articleshow/83966070.cms||---

Those holding Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Technology (BMLT) and Diploma in Medical Laboratory Technology (DMLT) usually run such establishments. Before adjourning the hearing by four weeks, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor issued notices to the respondents, including the central and state governments. Petitioner’s counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni contended that the Maharashtra government through its resolution on May 24, 2016, had barred persons holding DMLT from running a pathology lab and warned of penal action. The GR was, however, withdrawn in two days and Maharashtra Paramedical Council Act was implemented in 2017 in this regard. Quoting rulings from Supreme Court and high courts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, the petitioner said lab technicians not holding qualification of pathologist can’t run any laboratory independently. According to the petitioner, BMLT and DMLT holders can’t give reports directly to any patient, individual or doctor without authentication from a pathologist registered with the Medical Council of India (MCI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-notice-to-centre-state-over-imas-plea-against-path-lab-technicians/articleshow/83968126.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata vaccine scam: Fraudster chose amikacin since vials looked similar||KOLKATA: Debanjan Deb carefully weighed multiple options before selecting a relatively more costly drug to fake the vaccine. Police and KMC believe Deb chose amikacin sulphate, an antibiotic, keeping two factors in mind. “The first concern was that it should have moderate side-effects that would not cause any alarm. And second, the vials had to resemble Covishield vials,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Amikacin Sulphate 500 mg, an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections of the urinary tract, bones, lungs, brain and blood, matched both his “criteria”. So, he went for the drug, that cost Rs 13-Rs 77, depending on the brand, and not cheap saline water. Covid vaccines cost much more and are not available in the open market. “He claims to have contacted Serum Institute posing as an IAS officer and tried ordering Covishield. Rejected, Deb visited the medicine wholesale hub in Kolkata for alternatives,” said an officer. The vials seized from the Kasba camp had Covishield labels without any batch number, manufacturing or expiry date printed on them. The vials were smaller in size and had only four doses. An original Covishield vial contains 10 doses. The fake Covishield labels were designed by Deb on his computer and were stuck over that of Amikacin Sulphate 500 mg. The vials have been sent for chemical analysis. Police said the accused was also insisting on using Aadhaar photocopies, countersigned by the recipients. “Deb told police he wanted to pass off the vaccination drive as genuine and so, insisted on Aadhaar details,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fraudster-chose-amikacin-since-vials-looked-similar/articleshow/83968132.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||BMC responsible for collapse of building at Malwani that killed 12, says report||MUMBAI: The preliminary findings of a judicial inquiry has held the BMC responsible for the collapse of a building at Malwani in Malad (W) in which 12 persons, including 8 children, were killed. “Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) being the local authority for the area, which includes Malwani village, officials of the MCGM viz junior engineer and building mukadam... for Malwani village were responsible for maintaining vigil and supervision in respect of unauthorised development at Malwani village,” states the report by commissioner of inquiry Justice (retd) J P Deodhar. It said that “since the unauthorised construction was on government land, the collector should have maintained a vigil.” The report was submitted on Tuesday to a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni that sought BMC and state government’s response. “There was an old one-storey structure. The owner got changed. Thereafter, he raised three more storeys. These additional storeys were raised without any permission from the corporation or any other planning authority,” the CJ summarised. The report states that although the ground-plus-three structure at Malwani was constructed unauthorisedly in 2012 in gross violation of statutory provisions, neither the BMC officials nor additional collector “visited the site at any point of time, nor issued any notice for taking action against the owner of the structure.” There are 8,485 structures on New Collector Compound, and in the area where the collapsed structure stood, there are 246 structures. The judges said the commissioner has fixed responsibility, “answered all our questions and given in-depth recommendations,” including one for setting up an authority to check encroachments. “There is protection given to encroachers by the government. Because of this protection to encroachers on public land, there is a confusion about who is the authority. Whether it is corporation or government. Therefore, somebody has to take responsibility,” said the CJ. The report mentions that while issuing ration, voting and Aadhaar cards; shops and establishment certificate; or electric and water connections; there is no provision for the authorities to verify whether the applicant is in occupation of authorised structure or not. It recommended making it “mandatory” to consider the legality of the structure so that competent authorities can be alerted for taking appropriate action. When senior advocate Aspi Chinoy and advocate Joel Carlos for the BMC said the pitches at Malwani were allotted for rehabilitation, Justice Kulkarni said, “The agony is that original allottees have created third party interests.” The judges will specially sit to hear the matter on Friday. “Monsoon is setting in. We don’t want any other casualties,” said the CJ before concluding the hearing for the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-responsible-for-collapse-of-bldg-at-malwani-that-killed-12-says-report/articleshow/83970276.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Chandigarh||In Punjab, Covid restrictions extended till July 10||CHANDIGARH: With cases of the Delta+ variant coming to light, Punjab has decided to extend the Covid-19 restrictions till July 10, with certain more relaxations, including opening of bars, pubs and ahatas at 50% capacity, beginning July 1. Skill development centres and universities have also been allowed to open conditional to the staff and students having taken at least one dose of vaccine. IELTS coaching institutes were already allowed to be opened, subject to same condition. Announcing the relaxations at the Covid review meeting, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday made it clear that the bars, pubs and ahatas would have to strictly maintain social distancing protocols, and waiters and other employees should have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. He made it clear that it would be the responsibility of the owners to ensure that the conditions were met. Expressing satisfaction over the decline in positivity to less than 1%, with overall fall in active cases, the chief minister said that the positivity rate in some districts still remained over 1%. Further, the finding of Delta+ variant was a matter of concern, making it essential to continue with the curbs, he stressed. The month-wise whole genome sequencing has shown that more than 90% is a variant of concern, with the original virus having been practically replaced by variants, said the CM. Two cases (Ludhiana and Patiala) have shown Delta+ variant, while in May and June, it was the most prevalent variant, he pointed out. Of the 198 contacts of the Ludhiana patient traced and tested, one was found positive and the sample has been sent for genome sequencing, while in the Patiala case, for which the genome sequencing report was received on June 26, the process of tracing/testing is going on. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan said the variant was found in samples sent by the state in May, whose results were given by government labs recently. Amarinder ordered fast tracking of the establishment of a Whole Genome Sequencing Lab at GMCH Patiala, in association with the international non-profit organisation PATH, to make it operational by July. He also ordered intensification of genome sequences of cases reported from clusters in limited geographical, institutional or superspreader event areas to check the spread of the potential third wave. Health minister Balbir Sidhu suggested a close watch on visitors from countries reporting Delta+ variant cases. Health adviser Dr K K Talwar told the meeting that it was difficult to predict the third wave due to mutation, with the variant already reported from 12 countries and 52 cases reported in Maharashtra. Urging extreme caution, he said it was necessary to see how the mutant behaves. As of now, the existing vaccines were showing effectiveness against the present variants, he said. On Mucormycosis, the CM noted that Punjab has had much fewer cases than most other states, including Haryana and Delhi, which not only saw more cases but more than three times the deaths in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-punjab-covid-restrictions-extended-till-july-10/articleshow/83968119.cms||---

Talking to TOI on Tuesday, the MRU head Prof Royana Singh said, “We have formally started testing Covid-19 positive samples to determine the variant especially for Delta Plus from Monday. Testing for Delta Plus variant has been started for the samples being sent here from the labs of east UP districts including Prayagraj after carrying out a pilot project in which samples of Varanasi and Sonbhhadra had been tested for finding the prevalent variants in the region.” It was followed by another scientific study carried out by MRU-BHU and the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad with collaboratively sequenced genomes of coronavirus variants in Varanasi and adjoining areas in the last week of May, she said. This study report cleared that at least seven major strains of coronavirus circulating in these regions, said Prof Singh mentioning that the pilot phase study was based on the samples from Varanasi and areas around the city, mostly in April 2021. The team at CCMB sequenced as many as 130 samples “Among the Variants of Concern (VoC), the most predominant variant we found in our study was B.1.617 lineage. This variant was also reported to be one of the major drivers of the second Covid-19 wave in India,” said Prof Singh, adding, “Just as in most of India, the B.1.617.2 variant (aka Delta variant) was the most common one in the samples we studied. They were found among 36% of the total samples. Other VoCs such as the B.1.351, detected in South Africa for the first time, were also found in this area.” This study confirmed that the Delta variant is the most widespread coronavirus variant also in east UP region but no case of Delta Plus variant has been detected in the samples tested at the BHU lab so far, she added mentioning that the lab contains the next generation sequencing machines for these tests. The BHU runs the Covid-19 testing facilities at the MRU and viral research and diagnostic laboratory of IMS. The VRDL in-charge Prof Gopal Nath said that this lab was also equipped with three RNA extraction and six RTPCR machines, five bio-safety level-2 cabinets. The existing capacity of both the labs of BHU is sufficient to conduct the testing of minimum 10,000 samples of Covid-19 per day. As menace of second wave is on decline, now the lab is being run on the capacity of 6,000 samples per day. Around 4,000-5,000 samples are reaching the lab every day, he said mentioning that when the second wave of pandemic was on peak these labs had set a record of conducting test of 17,000 samples in a single day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhu-lab-starts-test-on-covid-positive-samples-to-determine-delta-plus-variant/articleshow/83968117.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Laxmi Nagar main market shut till July 5 for Covid violations||NEW DELHI: The East district administration has shut down the Laxmi Nagar main bazaar till July 5 due to increasing congestion and people not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour. An order issued by East district magistrate Sonika Singh and Delhi Disaster Management Authority chairperson on Tuesday stated that the “stretch from Vikas Marg to Lovely Public School, Kishan Kunj and its surrounding markets, like Mangal Bazaar, Vijay Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Jagatram Park, Guru Ramdas Nagar, etc would be restricted to open from 10pm on June 29 till 10pm on July 5 or till further orders”. These restrictions are not applicable on shops dealing with essential goods and services. #Covid norms being violated at Laxmi Nagar #Delhi https://t.co/E6vvEGnwBf— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1624819366000“According to the Preet Vihar SDM’s report, shopkeepers, vendors and the general public in Laxmi Nagar main bazaar were not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Due to large footfall, the market association and shopkeepers were unable to ensure Covid protocols last Sunday,” the order added. DCP (East) has been asked to ensure strict compliance of the order and East Delhi Municipal Corporation needs to get sanitisation done. The market welfare association has been directed to extend support. Traders, however, claimed that neither was their consensus taken nor were they informed about the issue of increasing congestion. Sumit Kumar Sharma, president of Mangal Bazaar Traders’ Association, said that rush was witnessed on a few days because people from the nearby areas kept coming frequently to check whether the patri bazaar had restarted. “The civic body has not given permission to the patri bazaar, but their regular buyers keep coming. Otherwise, the situation remains quite normal here. We got the information after we contacted the local police,” added Sharma. The shopkeepers claimed that the authorities were not helping them in any manner. Anil Rastogi of G&H Block Market Traders’ Association said, “We are making all efforts to maintain social distancing inside shops and the markets despite getting no help from the authorities. The crowd remains normal, except on Sunday evening. If congestion was noticed, then the authorities should have spoken to us first rather than closing the market.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/laxmi-nagar-main-market-shut-till-july-5-for-covid-violations/articleshow/83968164.cms||---
---||Surat||Covid-19: Maharashtra cases rise, Surat on the edge||SURAT: In the start of the second wave of the pandemic, Surat health officials claimed that the rise in cases in Maharashtra pushed rate of infection higher in the Diamond City. Meanwhile, when the neighbouring state is imposing fresh restrictions owing to resurge in Covid cases, top civic officials in Surat city claim that no positive cases have been detected among migrant workers from Maharashtra. On an average, thousands of Maharashtra residents commute to the city daily from their native places through buses and private vehicles for various work. Surat has an estimated four lakh Maharashtrian migrant population and owing to its proximity to the Maximum City, travelling between the two states for social and cultural reasons take place frequently. In Maharashtra, curfew was relaxed to 9pm in various districts, which has been tightened by five hours once again from 4pm to 7am. “The relaxation time has been reduced. Earlier, the curfew started after 9pm but from Monday the curfew will start from 4pm,” said Mukesh Survyavanshi, a resident of Jalgaon. Suryavanshi claimed that the number of daily cases has now increased to 25 compared to 13 to 15 a week ago. In Buldhana district, Saturday and Sunday are total lockdowns. “Due to rise in cases again the curfew timings have been increased and on weekends it remains completely closed. Due to the restrictions, finding transportation from between Surat and Buldhana is challenging,” said Tanaji Jhagde, a Dindoli resident. Sunita Vasekar, a resident of the bordering district of Nandurbar, said, “Due to the revised timing we have to finish routine work before that time. The administration is strictly enforcing curfew again.” When TOI visited Saroli, one of the main entry points for vehicles coming from Maharashtra, all Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) staff were, however, seen relaxed and chatting inside the testing dome without wearing their uniforms. At these centres along with the health team SMC’s security marshals are also deployed to stop outside vehicles and get visitors checked. “There is no rise in positive cases among migrant workers from Maharashtra, who are being tested in the textile market. We are keeping close watch on developments in the neighbouring state,” said officials. Health officials in Valsad claimed that they have discontinued testing at the entry point while at the border entry point in Dang, health officials are conducting random tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/maha-cases-rise-surat-on-the-edge/articleshow/83963695.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Ahmedabad||Going 6,000km on tandem bicycle||AHMEDABAD: With the aim of creating awareness about cycling and the need to keep fit in these trying times, two cycling enthusiasts have embarked on a 6,000-kilometre ride on a tandem bicycle. A 44-year-old mother of two and a 57-year-old ex-serviceman crossed Gujarat’s border and rode into neighbouring Rajasthan on Tuesday. Meera Velankar from Bengaluru and Dinkar Patil from Nashik started off from Bengaluru on June 19 in an attempt to cover the entire ‘Golden Quadrilateral’. Covering 11 states and 6,000km, the duo will pass through Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, New Delhi, Lucknow, Calcutta, Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatanam and Chennai before returning to Bengaluru. The two riders said the journey so far has been memorable. People have not only welcomed them, but offered food, lodging and money as well. Their network of cycling enthusiasts has also come handy, helping by booking hotels and the like. A mother of two girls, Meera Velankar lives in Bengaluru. She has a PhD in life sciences and returned to India after living in South Africa the US. Velankar has been cycling for 10 years, and is among the top long-distance women cyclists, having done the 3,700km from Kashmir to Kanyakumari last year. An ex-serviceman, Dinkar Patil currently heads security at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited at Nashik in Maharashtra. Having taken to cycling as a passion over the past seven years years, Patil has completed several long distance events. “Seventeen years of service made me a strong man, both physically and mentally,” Patil said. “Our aim was to cover about 200km a day. So far, we have been doing good. We have both done long-distance cycling before and knew exactly what to expect on the highway. The first 1,000km were especially challenging because of the gradient,” Velankar told TOI as they cycled through the state and crossed into Rajasthan on Tuesday. The duo had their share of amusement as well. Riding a tandem bicycle and wearing brightly coloured clothes, some bystanders shouted that circus clowns were passing by.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/going-6000km-on-tandem-bicycle/articleshow/83968150.cms||---
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu aspirants call for doing away interviews for government job recruitments||MADURAI: Aspirants in Tamil Nadu have urged the state government to do away with interviews for government job recruitments. The demand came after the Andhra Pradesh government abolished interviews for all state government job recruitments to ensure transparency and improve public faith. Tamil Nadu government is conducting recruitments for various posts through the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC). Separate recruitments are conducted for the selection of candidates for various group posts including group 4, 2 and 1. Marks obtained in the written exam are the only selection criteria for group 4 posts, whereas interview is conducted in addition to written exams for group 2 and 1 posts. Until recently, interview was being conducted only for certain posts within group 2 category. But TNPSC has made interview mandatory for all postings under group 2. P Ramamoorthy of Ayakudi Free Coaching Centre, said that although the interview system has been in place in the state for several years now, candidates could not understand how marks are allotted under the system. For group1 postings, the maximum marks in the interview round are 100, but no one is allotted more than 70 marks. Similarly, for group 2 exams, only 30 marks is the maximum score given out of 40 in interview round. “We have been into coaching for the last 15 years but could not decipher the way marks are allotted under the interview system. Candidates do not have much faith in the interview process. It is one of the reasons why most candidates are happy to settle for group 4 posts,” Ramamoorthy said. V Paranthaman, an aspirant from Madurai, said that it would instil a lot of confidence among aspirants and ensure utmost transparency if the interview system is abolished. “There have been incidents of manipulation of answer sheets with the collusion of officials involved in conducting the exams. The recent one was the Ramanathapuram incident, where 99 candidates were banned for life. When candidates can commit frauds in a highly transparent exam system, how can one believe in the interview process,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aspirants-call-for-doing-away-interviews-for-govt-job-recruitments/articleshow/83966105.cms||V Devanathan

In a notification issued on Tuesday, the state home department has asked all local civic bodies to ensure height of idols at Sarvajanik Ganesh Mandals are restricted to 4ft and 2ft for households. Nagpur Municipal Corporation may replicate the order and issue similar rules for the city. However, Ganesh mandals and sculptors said height restrictions have nothing to do with the spread of coronavirus. Former MLC Prakash Gajbhiye and founder of Ekta Ganesh Mandal, which is credited with installing the highest idol, said the government should reconsider the restrictions for Sarvajanik mandals. According to him, Covid-19 cases were already declining and while the government was advocating virtual darshan, then it should allow at least 10ft-high idols in Sarvajanik pandals. Echoing Gajbhiye, city sculptor from Chitar Oli Narendra Chauriya too demanded to keep the height of idols to at least 10ft. He, however, admitted that this year the state government’s notification came early unlike previous years. “This will help in keeping us prepared for the festival in September,” he said. He was quick to point out about his family’s traditional business of making Ganesh idols from mud and the height restrictions will adversely affect his business. “Only big idols are mostly being made of mud and the new rule will benefit PoP idol makers,” he said. Deputy secretary (home department) Sanjay Khedekar said amid Covid-19 cases and the anticipated third wave, the local bodies should ensure that Ganeshotsav is celebrated in a simple manner. As per the government notification order, local bodies should ensure all Sarvajanik Mandals should take permission for organizing Ganeshotsav. This year too, the state’s home department has asked the local bodies to promote immersion of idols in artificial tanks. Advertisements of mandals should be avoided to curtail rush. Instead of cultural events, the government has urged the organisers to hold health programmes like blood donation camps and awareness programmes for dengue, malaria, and coronavirus among others. It has also urged them (local bodies) to ensure that all organisers and individuals follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. It has asked them to arrange online darshan of mandals through social networking sites, local cable networks etc. Similarly, it directed to ensure no rush during aarti, bhajan, kirtan and other religious programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/for-2nd-year-state-caps-height-of-ganesh-idols/articleshow/83968157.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The Indian embassy said in an advisory that the security situation remained dangerous in several provinces across Afghanistan. Government sources on Tuesday also described as baseless and mischievous reports about external affairs minister S Jaishankar having met some Taliban leaders during his recent visit to Qatar. The embassy said terror groups had escalated "violent activities" and carried out a series of complex attacks including on civilians, adding Indian nationals were no exceptions as they additionally faced a serious threat of kidnapping. It said travelling outside the main cities should be avoided and that any essential movement may be kept as discrete as possible. "Movements especially during peak commuting hours should also be avoided. While travelling on roads, maintain distance from possible targets like military convoys," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/remain-alert-as-taliban-threat-looms-govt-to-indians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/83973080.cms||---

The rural police made seven more arrests late on Sunday night — some support staff at the villas and others from Mumbai — taking the total number of arrests in the case to 29. Among those arrested is also a Nigerian national who had feld to Mumbai at the of the raid. The police had raided a drug party detained 22 individuals who were found in an intoxicated state at two Igatpuri villas on Sunday. Of the 22, 12 were women. Most of them small-time actors and one a contestant of a popular television reality show. Talking to TOI, SP Sachin Patil said the group had purchased the drugs in Mumbai and had carried the same to Igatpuri. An investigation has been launched to find the people who had sold the drugs. According to the police, all the 29 arrested people were produced before the court. Four men, who had played a key role in procuring the drugs, were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and have been remanded in nine-day police custody till July 6. The remaining 25 have been arrested under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) and sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life). They have been remanded in one-day police custody. “We are in the process of collecting the blood samples of all the 29 people to investigate if they had consumed drugs. If traces of drugs are found in their blood samples, more stringent charges would be framed against them,” said Patil. The initial investigation suggests that the group had procured over 5gm of cocaine and other tobacco products in Mumbai before coming to Igatpuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-rural-cops-begin-probe-to-trace-source-of-drugs/articleshow/83933266.cms||Santosh Sonawane

EDMC mayor Shyam Sunder Aggarwal said that the decision has been taken after consensus with other members of the deliberative wing and an official order was also issued in this regard. “It will give relief to 55,000 vendors and people associated with them. Due to the pandemic, the weekly markets were already going through a tough time with no proper source of income for two consecutive years. As of now only one market per zone per day is allowed and this has automatically minimised the chances of each vendor to sell his/her product. Through this rebate in payment of vending fees, each vendor can save at least Rs 3,000 annually,” said the mayor. Vendors will not be charged fees even if all markets are allowed to open all seven days, but officials have given direction to ensure that the decision do not increase illegal vendors. “We are looking for other ways as well to extend support to these people through financial schemes of the government such as the PM Street Vendor’s Atma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi),” said the mayor.

While every year the CBD issues property tax bills in April itself, owing to certain software updates in the accounting system of the board, this year the property tax bills would be issued from July 1. “The CBD has put in place online as well as offline mode of payment of the property tax,” Ajay Kumar, CEO of CBD, said. The revenue generated from the property tax would be useful for taking up certain developmental works as well as paying the salaries of the employees. Former members of the cantonment board said the main source of revenue is from service charge of approximately Rs 30 crore annually from the armed forces. Bhagwan Kataria, former corporator and vice-president of the CBD, said if the flow of service charge from the army is regular, taking up developmental works and paying salaries of the CBD employees becomes easy. The CBD runs the water supply scheme and it is in losses as the expenditure incurred is much more than the revenue collected towards water tax. Similarly, even the expenditure of operating CBD hospital is much more than the revenue generated from it. In view of all such situation, the CBD expects that the payment of property tax from owners is timely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-cantonment-board-expects-to-collect-rs-6-5cr-as-property-tax-arrears/articleshow/83963713.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Ahmedabad||Khimani appointed Vidyapith VC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Vidyapith chancellor on Tuesday issued a notification appointing former registrar of the Vidyapith Rajendra Khimani as its new vice-chancellor. Interestingly, Khimani’s name was dropped soon after he was selected by a three-member search committee on December 10 last year. The reason being the University Grants Commission (UGC) had taken objections that its own nominee was not on the university’s search committee panel that had selected Khimani. Also the UGC was to submit a vigilance report on certain controversial appointments at Vidyapith on January 30. Gujarat Vidyapith celebrates its 100th anniversary year and is the only university established by Mahatma Gandhi. In February, the selection committee sat again to select a candidate, this time headed by former chancellor of Gandhigram Rural Institute University in Tamil Nadu, Renana Jhabvala, Indira Hirve and UGC’s nominee GTU vice-chancellor Navin Sheth. The committee had analysed 50 candidates of which 30 were selected. Sources among Vidyapith trustees claim that the UGC nominee had expressed dissent on Khimani’s name being suggested for the second time. But on Tuesday Khimani’s was invited by the chancellor Ela Bhatt to assume charge as vice-chancellor. Khimani had joined Vidyapith in 2004 and had earlier worked with two agriculture universities in Gujarat. After he retired from Vidyapith in 2019, Khimani was asked to stay back at the university and function as deputy director (extension). Prior to joining Vidyapith in 2004, Khimani had served for 20 years at Anand Agriculture University (AAU) in the horticulture department. Before that, he had served at the Junagadh Agriculture University (JAU). Khimani will take over from the present incumbent Anamik Shah on December 31. “The Gujarat Vidyapith will continue to work on the path set by the Mahatma. There will be no compromise . Our education programmes are clearly defined and we will continue to excel in those,” Khimani told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/khimani-appointed-vidyapith-vc/articleshow/83968195.cms||---

Excavation director M Prabhakaran told TOI that Sivagalai was suspected to be the burial site of a Sivagalai cluster, just like Konthagai in Keeladi cluster. The ASI had given its nod to excavate six places in the cluster. The second phase of excavation was being carried out at Sivagalai at a cost of Rs 34 lakh. So far 40 burial urns had been found. Some of the urns were big measuring about two to four feet in height. Two quadrants that they had started excavating recently have turned exciting, as 15 burial urns have been found close to one another in a small area. The urns started surfacing from a depth of 50cm from the surface and went to a depth of 240cm. Five urns were intact with lids and are expected to hold interesting details. Ten of them are in a good condition but without lids. The rest were damaged. The urns are to be opened soon in the presence of faculty members of Madurai Kamaraj University. The samples would be taken for DNA testing. The department has also started excavation in three places in the cluster -- Avarankadu Thiradu, Parakiramapandi Thiradu and Sekkadi. They are yet to take up excavation in Pottalkottai Thiradu, Peruru Thiradu and Vella Thiradu, he said. These were about two km away from Sivagalai, which is expected to be the burial site of this civilization like Konthagai is to Keeladi. While excavating the neighbouring villages, several of potsherds, a smoking pipe, bone point, spindle hole among other interesting artefacts were found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/15-burial-urns-found-at-sivagalai-site/articleshow/83966151.cms||---

However, the girl’s family declined to accept the decision and contacted the police, after which a case of molestation was filed. When the panchayat’s decision went viral on social media, SP Maharajganj on Tuesday directed the police to record the girl’s statement under section 164 of CrPc and get her medically examined. Reports said that on June 23, the girl’s mother, a resident of a locality under Kothibhar police station jurisdiction, made a complaint with the village panchayat that their minor daughter was raped by a village youth. Acting on the complaint, the panchayat asked the girl to take Rs 50,000 from the accused and slap him five times with a slipper in front of the panchayat members to settle the issue. However, the girl’s family refused to accept the decision and contacted the Kothibhari police on June 24. On the family’s complaint, an FIR was lodged under IPC section of molestation and POCSO Act against the accused. The family later made the panchayat decision viral on social media, following which Maharajganj SP Pradeep Gupta on Tuesday directed the police to get the girl medically examined and also record her statement under Section 164 of CrPC. “If rape is reported in the medical test, a case will be registered under the related sections and action will be taken accordingly,” Gupta told TOI on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/take-money-hit-rape-accused-with-slipper/articleshow/83968219.cms||Arjumand Bano

This is the first action by police in recent times after the second wave of Covid-19 subsided in the city from mid-May and restrictions have tightened on account of the possibility of third wave. As per prohibitory orders issued by the city police on June 8, assembly of five or more people is banned. However, the accused, a resident of Deolali Camp, had put up sound system in front of his house for the haldi programme and around 15 guests were found dancing to the music at around 11 pm on Sunday. A patrolling team of the Deolali Camp police, while passing from near Gavali Wada, saw people dancing following which the owner of the house was booked. “Action against the accused was important as the latter had exhibited negligence on his part by calling the guests for the programme. While no programmes are allowed after 4 pm, the accused had continued with the programme till 11pm without following any social distancing norm,” a police officer said. Meanwhile, a group of 35 people was also booked under similar sections by Mumbai Naka police for staging agitation at the District Central Co-operative Bank near Dwarka on Tuesday morning. Bhadrakali police also booked 40 to 50 people for staging agitation in the Dwarka area on Tuesday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/man-booked-for-hosting-nieces-haldi-event-at-11pm-in-deolali/articleshow/83963758.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Police sources said that the MLA belonging to MDMK went to Thanjavur in his car and was returning to his hometown late on Monday night. A staff employed at toll fee collection in lane number 3 identified as Sathish did not provide free crossing despite the MLA showing his identity card and instead quarrelled with him. He did not wear a mask while on duty and refused to wear one even after the MLA asked him. The MLA left the place and directly went to the Melur police station to lodge a complaint. Based on the complaint, a case was registered under IPC section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 369 (act likely to spread infection or disease dangerous to life) and under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act. Road users have urged the authorities concerned to rein in employees at the toll plaza as they behave harshly and threaten their safety frequently. They said they should be given uniform, name badge and identity cards so that those who misbehave with road users can be identified while raising complaints with authorities. S A Sayeed, an exporter from Trichy, who frequents Madurai on business work, said that the employees quarrel with road users if they try to point issues. “When an employee took time to allow my vehicle to pass through the plaza even after the payment was made I questioned him. He picked up a quarrel with me and in no time 10 employees surrounded my vehicle and threatened me,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/toll-gate-staff-booked-for-misbehaving-with-mla/articleshow/83966196.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Salons refuse bookings to clients without jab proof||KOLKATA: Salons in the city were flooded with phone calls for appointments on Tuesday. However, clients without their first dose vaccination certificates were refused appointments. According to salon owners, they cannot risk their hairdressers and beauticians and cannot flout government norms. Clients, however, accepted the decision without any argument. Salons said there would be no compromise on the vaccination clause. AN John, the salon chain that has five outlets in the city, refused several clients who said that they are yet to be vaccinated. The same was the case with Toni & Guy outlets, too. “At the Gurusaday Road outlet I had to refuse at least five very high-value clients because they are yet to be vaccinated. We politely asked them to get vaccinated first and then contact us,” said spokesperson of the AN John chain, Amritaa Chakraborty. Ananya Choudhury Goswami, owner of the Toni & Guy outlet at New Town, too, said: “We refused four high-value clients. We cannot risk the health of our staff. We have ensured that all staff members are vaccinated.” Many salons had announced several new numbers to handle the rush and have also started taking appointments based on queries that were coming on to their social media pages and via e-mails. A number of people were engaged to handle the appointments on Tuesday. The waiting list was long because salons could handle only 50% of their seating capacity to be used for services from Thursday when they reopen. No one will be allowed to walk in without an appointment. After every client leaves, the space will be sanitised, so the next appointment is being kept 10-15 minutes away. Most salons have started sanitising their outlets. Stickers have been designed and placed on chairs that will not be used to maintain distance and to keep with the 50% seating mandate. “We have got professionals to do deep cleaning for us so that our guests feel safe and happy with us. We will continue with our sanitisation of our six outlets till Wednesday,” said Vinay Rungta, proprietor of Eye Catchers. “We have checked out stocks of disposables to be used because after each client leaves, most items used on him/her will be thrown away and replaced with fresh items,” he added. “It was such a welcome move by the government. For women like us, it is such a relief to once again be able to be pampered at the salon where our greys can be covered and our tired skin can be attended to. With the wedding season round the corner, I am sure it will make the beauticians and clients smile,” said Sucharita Roychowdhury, a school principal. But many were sad that they have been pushed down to the waiting list. “I didn’t imagine that there would be such a rush. I have been listed and am waiting for a specific date,” said Soumi Sinha, public relations officer of a city school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salons-refuse-bookings-to-clients-without-jab-proof/articleshow/83966213.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||EWS admissions must in private schools: Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said private schools would have to admit students from the EWS category, even if there were no general category admissions in those schools this year. Sisodia also called for a physical parent-teacher meeting (PTM) to be held from July 19-31 so that parents could learn about their child’s progress. TimesViewThe Covid situation is under control in the city. But we must be smart and sensible about restoring normalcy. Physical PTMs need not be mandatory. Those who want to do it virtually should also be allowed to do so. The purpose can be served either way.“We are aware that the Right to Education Act is in effect across the nation, and in accordance with the Act, private schools have to reserve 25% seats for Economically Weaker Sections of the society. For every 100 seats in schools, 75 are for the general category, while 25 seats are reserved for EWS students,” Sisodia explained. He added that Delhi government had initiated a provision where the government would announce a draw for admissions for seats reserved under the EWS category, based on the application received and information provided by schools on the number of seats available. “When we called for applications under the EWS category, we received around 1.26 lakh applications based on which we announced a draw of 32,500 seats,” the education minister said. At a press conference on Wednesday, the deputy CM directed every private school in the capital to admit students under the EWS category based on the allotted list sent by the government and regardless of the number of admissions in the general category. “Under normal circumstances, private schools admit three general students, and one under the EWS category, based on the allotted list provided by Delhi government. However, considering that the lockdown has derailed the entire admission process, there has been a deference in admission for even general category students.” Sisodia also called for a PTM in government schools, stating that “although Covid had impacted schooling adversely, but learning had not stopped and just taken the online route. Online learning has increased the role parents play in their child’s life.” He informed that the directorate of education has decided to conduct special PTM for parents of all students in government schools. Sisodia claimed that PTMs would also play an important role for students transitioning from municipal corporation feeder schools to DoE ones. “We have created a structure for joint-PTM between civic and DoE schools. PTMs for students of Class VI will be done jointly between teachers of both DoE and corporation schools. This decision has been taken to ease the transition of students from civic to DoE schools and ensure children receive adequate emotional and learning support in newer environments.” TOI on June 24 had reported that many budget schools could not admit EWS students citing that they did not have general admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ews-admissions-must-in-pvt-schools-sisodia/articleshow/84001231.cms||---

The Defence Services Ordinance 2021 brings any industry dealing in production of defence items or providing service to defence sector under its ambit. This takes the ordnance factories out of the purview of industrial disputes acts also. The ordinance makes strikes even before the date of its issuance illegal. This is expected to hamper the unions’ plans to go on an indefinite strike against government plan to corporatize the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and split it into seven entities. The unions have been opposing the move and had declared an indefinite strike from July 26 against the decision. Calls have been made by the unions to raise a voice against the move. The three major unions plan to hold a meet on Thursday to decide future strategy. The ordinance makes strike in defence industries illegal, making a person taking part in it liable to imprisonment apart from other disciplinary action, including dismissal from service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-counters-of-unions-strike-threat-with-ordinance/articleshow/83999309.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Active cases dips to 4,676, recovery rate up in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The district recorded 563 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, even as 986 patients were discharged from various treatment centres, bringing the active cases down to 4,676. The recovery rate has improved to 96.9% with 2,12,285 of the 2,18,990 people, who have tested positive for the virus till date, recovering from the infection in the district. The Covid-19 toll, however, shot up to 2,029 with the state including 12 more fatalities that occurred in the district in the bulletin. While doctors advise even the vaccinated people to take all Covid-19 precautions like wearing masks, social distancing and frequent hand washing to prevent another wave, they have warned against overdoing of some measures like inhaling steam and consumption of vitamin C. Dr Varun Sundaramoorthy, infectious diseases specialist, Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, said, “There is no evidence that steam inhalation can kill the virus. It may or may not prevent the virus. It should ideally be done only when you have a blocked nose. The hot steam loosens the hard mucus and drains it out.” Doctors said the steam inhalation could do more harm than good, if done too often. Dr D Ashwath, paediatrician, said, “When done on a regular basis, it destroys the hair in your nostrils which is the first line of protection against foreign particles like a virus entering the system.” He also advised the people against consumption of high doses of vitamin C or zinc supplements. “We are seeing more cases of people with kidney stones because of the excess intake of vitamin C.” Dr S Murugananth, consultant nephrologist and renal transplant physician, Royal Care Hospital, said the excess of vitamin C in the intestine would turn into oxalate, which gets deposited along the kidney’s tissue and could turn into stones after combining with calcium. “The daily recommended intake of vitamin C is only 100gm and that can be obtained from natural sources. 500mg tablets of vitamin C can maximum be consumed for three weeks at a stretch, once a day, once in six months. Even that is not required for healthy people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/active-cases-dips-to-4676-recovery-rate-up-in-dist/articleshow/83968216.cms||---
---||Kolkata||ISI screens Buddhadeb film on Mahalanobis, pays tribute to legends on Statistics Day||KOLKATA: A film on Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, the father of Indian statistics, made during his birth centenary celebrations in 1993 by filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta, was shown on Tuesday at the Indian Statistical Institute to mark the 128th birth anniversary of Mahalanobis. The day is observed as Statistics Day in the country and ISI, which was founded by Mahalanobis on his sprawling Baranagar property, has always been at the focus of the national programme that sees the attendance of the ministry of statistics and programme implementation. Through the film, the ISI also paid its tribute to late filmmaker Dasgupta, who painstakingly worked on the old and brittle reels of films that were kept at the ISI archives to make his documentary that he christened, Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis – The Tale of a Savant. The film weaves the story of how Mahalanobis, a physics graduate of Presidency College, went to get his tripos from Cambridge and having worked with stalwarts in England, he came back to Presidency College to join the physics department. “However, his return journey was held up by a chance delay in the ship’s timing that got him to visit a library and read up on statistics. He even bought some journals and read them up, which sowed the seeds of statistics in his mind,” said Ashish Chakraborty, a faculty member of ISI, who was behind the idea of bringing Dasgupta’s film out of the archive to screen it on Tuesday. The film shows how Mahalanobis started the study of statistics in his physics laboratory of Presidency College and soon he gave birth to ISI inside the annals of the lab. “But, the then principal did not approve of it. So, he rented small rooms inside Albert Hall (that houses the Coffee House), opposite the college, and continued to work there, before starting the Baranagar campus. He was also the inspiration behind the country’s first statistics department inside Presidency College,” said Bivas Chaudhuri, a statistician and alumnus of the department. Tuesday’s programme focused on hunger and food security, which was this year’s theme. Statistics and programme implementation DG Shailja Sharma, chief statistician of India G P Samanta, chairman of National Statistical Commission chairman Bimal Kumar Roy were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/isi-screens-buddhadeb-film-on-mahalanobis-pays-tribute-to-legends-on-statistics-day/articleshow/83966255.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The 25 individuals were remanded in one-day custody on Monday. Meanwhile, four others, who had played a key role in procuring the drugs and were arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, are already in custody till July 6. SP Sachin Patil said: “We have found certain evidence in connection to the drugs consumption case following which, custodial interrogation of the group became important. We requested the court for an extension in their police custody, which has been granted.” Patil said that one more person, who is the owner of the bungalow, has been arrested from Mumbai. On Sunday morning, the Nashik rural police raided two bungalows in Igatpuri from where 22 individuals, including 12 women, were arrested as drugs and hukka were found in their possession. Most of them were in an intoxicated state. Among the women arrested, at least five have worked in movies. Later, seven more were arrested in connection to the same case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/custody-of-25-accused-extended-in-igatpuri-case/articleshow/83963826.cms||---
---||Mumbai||727 city police officers likely to be shifted out||Mumbai: In a proposed and perhaps unprecedented mass transfer, 727 sub inspectors and inspectors in Mumbai police who have completed eight years of service in the city are likely to be shifted out. The transfers may not happen at one go considering that obtaining replacements will not be easy. A list sent by the city police administration to the director-general of police’s office named 727 officers _ right from police sub-inspectors to senior inspectors _ who have put in eight years in the city police. The list of the officers appeared in the police's daily notice on Monday. The notice, issued by Rajkumar Vhatkar, joint commissioner of police (administration), asked these 727 personnel to fill up forms for new postings and mail it to the given email address by 4 pm on June 29. The notice says a candidate can name three districts as their choices for the transfer, including a ‘preferred’ one. The list has the names of officers, the designations and details of their current posting. They are currently attached to police stations, crime branch units, economic offences wing, security, traffic, bomb detection and disposal, special branch, local arms, Quick Response Team, control rooms, Anti-Narcotics Cell, Airport, etc. Vhatkar told TOI that if there were extraordinary considerations, some of them may be exempted. “In a special case, like if an officer’s retirement is nearing or if there is an application on medical grounds to continue working within city limits, it can be looked into by the establishment board.” As a general rule, an officer’s tenure in a district is up to four years, and in the Range for eight years. In some commissionerates, tenure is six years; in Mumbai Commissionerate the tenure is eight years. A senior officer said it will be difficult to get enough officers from outside Mumbai to replace those on the transfer list. “If you don’t get an adequate replacement, how are you going to cover the deficit? No recruitment of officers has been done in the last two years in the state. A complete list of all those who have completed eight years has been prepared to ensure transparency. We can't handpick a few based on our likes and dislikes,'' an officer said. It is also said that the work pressure in Mumbai, strict supervision, long working hours and the public’s expectations from police are reasons for fewer personnel, from outside the district, wanting to come and work in Mumbai. An assistant inspector, whose name was in the list, said he would prefer going to work in his home district. It is noteworthy that in March this year, as many as 86 police personnel including 65 from the crime branch were transferred to other postings in the city. Crime branch inspector Sunil Mane and API Riyaz Kazi were also transferred to the local arms unit after their names cropped up in the NIA investigation into the Mansukh Hiran murder case. Both were later arrested by the NIA and are currently in jail. In April, 13 policemen from EOW who had completed a five-year tenure in one place were transferred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/727-city-police-officers-likely-to-be-shifted-out/articleshow/83970392.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Pune||Auto driver, aides rob man of valuables worth Rs 1 lakh in Pune||PUNE: An autorickshaw driver and his two accomplices, all carrying sharp weapons, allegedly thrashed and robbed a man (27) of valuables worth Rs1 lakh on the service road along Katraj-Dehu Road bypass in Bavdhan on Sunday night. Balewadi resident Vaibhav Balwadkar filed an FIR with the Hinjewadi police on Monday. The incident happened around 8pm when Balwadkar was heading home from a family function in Dhayari. “I had to stop along the bypass to relieve myself. An autorickshaw stopped near me and a man alighted from it. He then held a knife against my back and demanded to hand over valuables. He also snatched my wallet with Rs8,000 and a cellphone,” Balwadkar told TOI. When Balwadkar resisted and kicked the assailant while banging his head against a tree, the other two suspects assaulted him. The suspects then punched Balwadkar in the face, snatched his gold chain and fled towards Wakad. “I informed my friends about the incident using my other cellphone and began chasing the auto. The suspects hurled one of the weapons at me. In a bid to dodge it, I lost my composure and fell off the bike,” Balwadkar said. “We are looking for the suspects based on the description given by the complainant,” an inspector from Hinjewadi police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-driver-aides-rob-man-of-valuables-worth-rs-1-lakh/articleshow/83966261.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Mumbai||Investigate fake vaccination camp scam, don’t spare any big fish: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: “Those playing with the lives of citizens...should be taught a lesson, whoever they be. Irrespective of any colour. There may be big fish involved and yet to be identified, the probe must be absolutely proper and no one should be left out,” the Bombay high court told the state public prosecutor on Tuesday on the fake vaccination camp scam in the city. As many as 2,053 people have been duped at these fake camps held across the city May 25. The HC bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, however, expressed its satisfaction with the June 29 investigation report of a deputy police commissioner produced in court by prosecutor Deepak Thakare. The report stated that 12 people have been booked and 11 were in custody in seven cases registered so far. A sessions court on Monday rejected the pre-arrest bail plea of the main accused, Dr Manish Tripathi, and he has surrendered, said Thakare. The HC was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by Siddharth Chandrashekhar on streamlining the use of the CoWin app and making Covid-19 vaccines more easily accessible to all. The bench directed the civic administration to submit on Thursday the fresh standard operating procedure (SOP) it plans to bring out in a day, on conducting vaccination camps at housing societies and educational institutions. The HC bench also directed the BMC to inform the steps it proposes to take to ensure that the duped 2,053 ‘beneficiaries’ are checked for antibodies and questioned why the state and civic authorities were yet unable to unearth what they had been administered. “This appears to be a state failure…Whatever tests are required, must be done,” said the bench, adding, “Whatever you are contemplating for these unfortunate people you must tell us.” Anil Sakhare, senior counsel for BMC, said he will apprise the high court on Thursday, the next hearing date, after the bench sought to know the “civic measures for the 2,053 innocent individuals who were duped by the fake vaccination camps...” “Earnest endeavour ought to be made by the investigative officers to book those yet to be taken into custody. We hope and trust the probe is completed soon and a Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code report be filed at magistrate court at the earliest,” said the HC. It sought a further probe report from the police on July 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/investigate-fake-vaccination-camp-scam-dont-spare-any-big-fish-bombay-hc/articleshow/83968226.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Row over for now, shooting of new Bengali serials from today||KOLKATA: The row over shooting of new Bengali serials seems to have finally been resolved. The developmment comes after a meeting of all stakeholders in Tollywood with minister Aroop Biswas, director-turned-MLA Raj Chakraborty and actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee on Tuesday evening. According to Chakraborty, all new serials will face no problem in shooting from Wednesday onwards. Some necessary formalities between Federation of Cine Technicians & Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) and Welfare Association of Television Producers (WATP) will be completed today. “This will be done to ensure that work goes on without any interruption,” Chakraborty added. The work for finalizing the amended MoU will continue. “That will be signed on July 31 and published in the form of a book. That will be the industry guideline for the coming days,” he said. Actor Bharat Kaul, who is the operational head of Surinder Films, is relieved that shooting of new serials will begin. “The fate of two serials — ‘Mouer Bari’ and ‘Mon Mane Na’ — produced by Surinder Films has been hanging in balance. In these difficult times, one must get together and work towards a common goal. I hope good sense prevails,” he said. On Tuesday, actor Debdut Ghosh had to return from Technicians’ Studio without being able to shoot a new serial called ‘Sree Krishna Bhakto Meera’. The actor-turned-Tollygunge’s CPM candidate for the Assembly elections told TOI: “I hope there is a permanent solution to this nagging problem. It is very silly that this industry is facing problems every now and then and is running to a monitor to sort out those issues. I wish this pandemic teaches all of us to behave like professional adults. After all, a lot is at stake if the industry doesn’t function smoothly,” Ghosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/row-over-for-now-shooting-of-new-serials-from-today/articleshow/83966295.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Nagpur||In a 1st, BA-LLB in Hindi for students aspiring to become judges||NAGPUR: In a first, the Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya (MGAHV) would be starting a BA-LLB programme in Hindi for students aspiring to become judges. the Maharashtra National Law University here (MNLU-N) was the first in the country to launch the same course but in English medium. “We’ve received permission for 60 seats initially. An entrance examination will be held in July probably. Depending on the response, we plan to start this degree in five more languages like Marathi, Kannada, Gujarati, Telugu and Bangla in the next session. We aim to start this course in 10-12 Indian languages in the next five years,” vice chancellor Rajaneesh Kumar Shukla told TOI. The Wardha-based university has set up an advisory committee headed by Supreme Court judge Bhushan Gavai. MNLU-N vice chancellor Vijender Kumar, Bar Council of India vice president Satish Deshmukh, NLU Bangalore former VC NL Mitra, BCI Legal Education committee member Prof BN Pandeya, are other members on the panel. They would guide the university to design curriculum and monitor developments. Like MNLU, even MGAHV was inspired by former Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde, who had encouraged them to start a course in Hindi and other vernacular languages for the benefit of students, who find it difficult to study in the English language. The MGAHV had also taken guidance from justice (retired) Ravindra Chavan, who had guided the MNLU to design the syllabus for its BA LLB (adjudication and justicing) course that too was introduced to churn out judges. Students from both institutions need to clear the public service examinations of respective states for becoming magistrates. According to Shukla, the fees for BA LLB would be the cheapest in the country — not more than Rs 1 lakh. In comparison, the MNLUs and NLUs charged in lakhs per year from the aspirants. “The MNLUs produces the lawyers who usually cater to the corporate world. At MGAHV, we would be churning out the graduates who would cater to lower judiciary where functioning usually takes place in the vernacular languages. Unfortunately, we’re still following the British legacy in the judiciary even after decades of getting independence,” he said. The MGAHV has already established the law department on its premises and appointed a professor and two assistant teachers to teach the students. It had also set up a library with over 12,000 books related to the judiciary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-1st-ba-llb-in-hindi-for-students-aspiring-to-become-judges/articleshow/83968231.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
