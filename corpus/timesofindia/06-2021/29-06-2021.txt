On Monday, Karnataka border development authority chairperson C Somashekar met Yediyurappa and apprised him of the development.  The names are either in Kannada or Tulu or a mixture of both with some of them having a centuries-old history. Yediyurappa said the people of Kasaragod — both Kannadigas and Malayalis — have been living in harmony. “It is not appropriate to change the Kannada names of villages which have their own cultural and historical values,” he said Kannada and culture minister Arvind Limbavali said a large number of Kannada-speaking people live in these taluks. “The government should have discussed the matter with residents before taking a unilateral decision. We must oppose the move to protect Kannada culture,” he said. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy said: “It’s the duty of Kerala and Karnataka to protect the traditional feelings of Kannadigas living there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-asks-pinarayi-not-to-change-kannada-names/articleshow/83934405.cms||---

Sia Godika, 14, and Lakshya Subodh, 17, received The Diana Award at a virtual ceremony on Monday night for their humanitarian work. Sia, a student of Neev Academy, won the award for work done by her group, Sole Warriors, while Lakshya, a student of Delhi Public School, Bengaluru East, got the award for his ‘Rural Covid Warriors project’. Diana Award honours youngsters who work to improve others’ lives and is supported by the late princess’ two sons — Prince William and Prince Harry. Koramangala resident Sia started Sole Warriors, taglined ‘Donate a sole, save a soul’, in November 2019 after she was disturbed by the damaged feet of construction workers near her home. “I did some research and found that millions of people contract diseases by walking barefoot, while 350 million footwear is discarded by privileged households, and some are just stashed in cupboards unused,” she says. The initiative has collected over 15,000 pairs of footwear from 4,000 households, refurbished and distributed them among the underprivileged. Bellandur resident Lakshya started his social work since he was in eighth grade. With support from companies owned by family friends, Lakshya helped rural students with micro internships, industry-based opportunities like mentorship and future employability options under his ‘Igniting Dreams’ initiative. “With the pandemic, rural India was no longer looking just for internships, but healthcare and education about Covid-19,” he says. Lakshya then began raising funds to work on a Covid curriculum with the right information and attractive animated videos, which have reached more than 250 families and 5,000 women and youths in villages of Solepura on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, Lakkawaram in Andhra Pradesh and Pauri-Garwal in Uttarakhand over the last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-city-teens-win-diana-award-for-social-work/articleshow/83934453.cms||Farheen Hussain

Authorities have confirmed almost 1,200 positive cases from the outbreak, Spain's emergency health response coordinator, Fernando Simon said.  The partying teens celebrating the end of their university entrance exams last week created a "perfect breeding ground" for the virus as they mixed with others from around Spain and abroad, Simon told a news conference.  Mallorca health authorities carried out mass testing on hundreds of students after the outbreak became clear. It is believed to have spread as hundreds of partying students gathered at a concert and street parties.  Officials have so far traced 5,126 travelers to Mallorca. More than 900 Covid-19 cases in eight regions across mainland Spain have been traced back to the outbreak.  Scores of infected teens are still on the island. Some are being kept in their hotel rooms, while others have been moved to a hotel being used by local authorities for isolation of those with mild symptoms or suspected cases.  Simon noted that the parents of the teens are probably around 45 and 55 years old, and not all of that age group has received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, which could lead to community transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/spain-isolates-5000-after-school-students-party-in-mallorca/articleshow/83934628.cms||---

They have to report to work before June 30, but there is no clarity on the stipend they will be paid. Health minister K Sudhakar said the state recruited 4,000 doctors in the last two months. The graduates were to be assigned 1,001 posts in 18 government medical colleges, 666 in ICUs of taluk and district hospitals, 348 under National Health Mission and 90 at community health centres and three at Nephro Urology Institute, Bengaluru. Doctors said they have been orally told that if recruited under the health and family welfare department, their monthly stipend will be Rs 60,000. If it is the medical education department, it will be Rs 45,000. “There is no clarity on why and how the same batch of students can be paid different stipends in two departments,” they said. According to them, they have been left high and dry vis-a-vis their accommodation at their places of posting. “No accommodation will be provided by the government, directorate of medical education or college. However, the colleges or district surgeon and administrative medical officer can consider their request subject to availability of accommodation,” the notification read. June 8 notificationA notification issued on June 8 by the health department said all candidates who have passed their final MBBS examination in 2021 have to serve the government under provisions of Karnataka Compulsory Service Training by Candidates Completed Medical Courses Act, 2012 (Karnataka Act 26 of 2015), and Karnataka Compulsory Service Training by Candidates Medical Courses (Counselling, Allotment and Certification) Rules-2015. A corrigendum replaced the 2012 Act and 2015 Rules and invoked the Amendment to the Rule 11 of the Karnataka Selection of Candidates for Admission to Government Seats in Professional Education Institutions Rules-2006. On March 30, 2021, the high court had held that the Karnataka Compulsory Service Training by Candidates Completed Medical Courses Act- 2012 is not applicable to candidates who got admitted before 2018-19. No clarity on payThe doctors said they have already lost five months since their course got over and despite buying time, the government has failed to provide any clarity. The fresh graduates had also faced trouble in registering themselves with the Karnataka Medical Council as the government had mandated that registration will be done only after one-year of government service. They have now been issued with the KMC registration after submitting an undertaking, assuming to pay Rs 15-30 lakh in case they fail to do government service. “The government wants us to work selflessly, but there is no clarity about our work, salary and stay. This makes our career uncertain,” said a doctor. The June 23 circular issued by the health and family welfare department stated that those appointed under compulsory rural service will be working as per the directions of administrative medical officers and they shall not manage any medico-legal case. The doctors are those who landed MBBS seats in 2015 through Common Entrance Test (CET) counselling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2053-mbbs-grads-to-report-for-govt-service/articleshow/83935102.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Sunita Nadhamuni will take over in October. Rohini set up the foundation in 2001 and since 2005, has been focusing on water-related issues including groundwater, water quality and sanitation, in rural and urban areas across the country. Rohini told TOI she was retiring to pave the way for a new leadership. “I have been planning retirement for a while because 20 years is really a good time to move on from an institution. I firmly believe all institutions need fresh thinking and a new leadership every once in a while. From October 1, I will walk away from the board, as I did before from Akshara Foundation and Pratham Books (which I cofounded, chaired and funded from 2004 till 2014).” Arghyam, which means ‘offering’ in Sanskrit, was set up after Rohini sold shares of Infosys. She had put all the money and subsequently added more; her personal endowment currently is Rs 150 crore. On her decision to retire when she could have chosen to continue, Rohini said: “I have no regrets even though this is my very personal foundation which has been exclusively funded by me. After all, once the money goes into a trust, it is money meant for public good, right? The team under the new chair, Sunita Nadhamuni, will take Arghyam to new heights of impact, I have no doubt about that. I will miss working with my colleagues, but this is the right decision, I am sure of that. In some sense, after having worked hard for 20 years and hopefully after having made some positive contribution to the water sector, it is only now, with this transition, that I actually can complete my “Arghyam!”  Sunita, trustee, was the first CEO of Arghyam. She is also the head of Dell Giving and Social Innovation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rohini-nilekani-to-step-down-as-arghyam-chief/articleshow/83935147.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Expired 40 days ago: BDA fails to renew website security licence, user data under threat||BENGALURU: In what could lead to a possible compromise of information and threat to Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) site owners, the agency’s website security certificate has expired 40 days ago and information fed to it by users as well as the administrator is no longer encrypted. According to cyber experts, hackers can siphon off information of users and manipulate it. According to BDA sources, as many as 2,000 people have already paid their property tax online and their data is now under threat. Once anyone enters the website to make payment, a message appears: “Attackers might be trying to steal your information from propertytax.bdabangalore.org (for example, passwords, messages or credit cards).” The advanced information shows, “The server could not prove that it is propertytax.bdabangalore.org; its security certificate expired 40 days ago. This may be caused by a misconfiguration or an attacker intercepting your connection.” A senior BDA official told TOI that payment for the firm maintaining the website hasn’t been made and hence there has been no upgradation of the website. Ehraz Ahmed, a cyber security researcher rewarded by multiple agencies for identifying flaws in web applications and networks, said, “After the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate expires, users will no longer communicate over an encrypted HTTPS connection. Users who browse the site with an unsecure connection are prone to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. A malicious user can intercept and see the information transferred between the user and the site.” This will allow the attacker not only to fetch the data of the user that includes ID, password and other credentials, but also manipulate the same, he added. Vineet Kumar, founder, and president of Cyber Peace Foundation, explained, “Nowadays, websites use Transport Layer Security (TLS) to make sure data (mainly username and password) users enter securely reach the server and is not intercepted by any attackers on the way. For this, they use SSL certificates in order to encrypt the data on the way to the server. These certificates have a time limit on them and after that they need to be renewed.” “...It is recommended that users don’t share details on the website and wait till the developer renews the licence,” he added. A senior BDA official said the administration was not aware of the issue and will address it. The official admitted that the vendor was not paid for months and there were some lapses in communication, which are now being sorted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bda-fails-to-renew-website-security-licence-user-data-under-threat/articleshow/83935221.cms||Kiran Parashar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 3 men’s liquor craving during curfew leads police to stolen sheep, goats||BENGALURU: Three bibulous men’s search for alcohol during night curfew hours helped city police trace within 48 hours 20 goats and five sheep that were stolen and ferried away to Andhra Pradesh. On June 22 midnight, three men, who had come in a mini goods vehicle, approached one Ravi (name changed), who was standing outside his house in Kumbarahalli, Soladevanahalli, off Tumakuru Road, asking him if he could help them get liquor. Ravi said he doesn’t drink and had no idea where they could get liquor. The men repeatedly asked Ravi to help them, saying they had come from Andhra Pradesh on work and had to drive back the same night and were desperately in need of alcohol. However, Ravi said he couldn’t help them. Meanwhile, on June 23, K Nandakumar, 54, a resident of Kumbarahalli, lodged a complaint with Soladevanahalli police about five sheep and 20 goats missing from his pen and suspected his assistant, D Raju, to be behind the act. Raju worked with Nandakumar as an assistant for a year. On June 2, he left for his hometown, Dharmavaram in Andhra Pradesh saying a relative had met with an accident and he had to attend to him. Raju’s wife and children too went with him. “On June 22, Raju returned alone and told me that his family will be back in a couple of days. That night, I locked the shed and there were six sheep and 39 goats inside. Next day, around 6.30am I returned to the shed only to find five sheep and 20 goats missing. I immediately called Raju, but his mobile phone was switched off. His room too was empty,” said Nandakumar. Police began questioning people in the area and Ravi told them of the three men who harassed him for liquor and they appeared to be from Andhra Pradesh. “Ravi recalled how the three men forced him to get them alcohol the previous midnight. We found that the suspects had come in a mini goods truck. Inspector Harivardhan collected CCTV footage from closeby roads and collected the details of the vehicle. Another team led by sub-inspector Shivaraj MJ started tracing the vehicle. At Devanahalli toll, we got more details of the vehicle and the phone number of its driver. Tracking the tower location of the driver, we reached Dharmavaram by June 24 evening and found the livestock intact,” DCP Dharmender Kumar Meena told TOI. The driver and his two assistants have been detained for questioning. Prime suspect Raju is missing. “Raju planned well to steal the animals. Pretending to attend an accident victim, he visited Dharmavaram to arrange for the vehicle. Due to the pandemic, he found it a little difficult to arrange a vehicle that he could afford,” an investigating officer said. The goods vehicle arranged by Raju reached Kumbarahalli on June 22 night. “Raju asked the driver to wait for his signal. The vehicle was parked around 700 metres from the shed. Meanwhile, the vehicle driver and two assistants approached Ravi for liquor while waiting for Raju,” he added. “Raju first packed his belongings and shifted them to the truck. Then, with the help of three others, he bundled the animals into the vehicle,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3-mens-liquor-craving-during-curfew-leads-police-to-stolen-sheep-goats/articleshow/83935277.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Referring to the suggestions of a committee headed by Dr. Devi Shetty for decentralising the decision to reopen schools and allow districts to take a call, the minister said, “The task force will decide on when and how to reopen schools. It will also decide on Vidyagama 2.0 which people have been demanding.” The minister said children’s “learning must be continuous and regularly evaluated -- this is what the task force will consider”, adding the department will issue guidelines about the task force soon. However, health minister K Sudhakar said he was not aware of any new task force to be formed. “For advising the government on Covid management, we have a technical advisory committee. Also, a high-level expert committee for the prevention and management of Covid Wave-3 was formed under the chairmanship of Dr. Devi Shetty and the committee has submitted its interim report. I am not aware of the education minister’s announcement on the new task force or the SSLC exam dates,” he said. Suresh Kumar said the exam dates were discussed with the CM. The SOP was discussed at length with the chief secretary and officials of the health department. Online classes will start from July 1 on DD Chandana and Deeksha portal.

Of the 483 students in the two-year MBA programme this year, 347 are from engineering background. Last year, out of the 488 candidates, 423 were from engineering background. In the new batch of PGP, 33% of the engineers are from IITs and 31.1% from NITs. The GMAT median score is 730. Gender diversity is almost the same as last year. There are 144 women and 339 men this time, as against 146 women and 342 men last year. The average work experience is about 23.4 months, and the average age, 23.9 years. Altogether 13 candidates have professional qualification (CA/CS/ICWA). The PGP batch has five overseas candidates (including one from South Korean) and the remaining 478 have gained admission through Common Admission Test (CAT), said a release from the institute. Apart from this, 45 students joined the two-year full-time Master of Business Administration (Business Analytics) — MBA(BA). For PGP-BA, out of a batch of 45, 51.1% are men and 48.9% women, a remarkable increase in diversity from last year’s 13% women. The average age is 23 years and most students here are from engineering background, followed by students from arts, science and management. The average work experience is 31 months. The batches are currently undergoing orientation programme. Welcoming the students, Prof. Rishikesha T Krishnan, director, IIM-B discussed the pandemic and its challenges. “It may be disappointing for some of you to be joining online and being restricted to online learning. Be assured that your health and safety are the primary focus of all our decisions. We are watching the situation closely; once the situation improves, once it is safe again and the government lifts sanctions, we will try to get you to the campus with hybrid learning and then physical classes, and give you the full MBA experience,” he said. Values are of paramount importance, says alumna “I have followed the path less taken. My journey has been a combination of taking people along and not hesitating to ask questions. I would advise you people too to not be deterred from doing something just because it has not been done before. In all this, remember that values are of paramount importance – they stay with us. Hard work and dedication are what will help you become role models,” said chief guest Bhavana Bindra, PGP alumna of the 2001 batch and managing director of REHAU, South Asia, a polymer solutions company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fewer-engineers-this-yearin-iim-b-mba-programme/articleshow/83935361.cms||---
---||World||'Air strikes will deter future action': US secretary of state defends actions in Iraq, Syria||ROME: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday air strikes on pro-Iran fighters in Iraq and Syria sent a "strong message" not to keep attacking US forces, while Baghdad condemned the overnight aerial assault. The second such deadly raid on pro-Iran targets since US President Joe Biden took office, described by the Pentagon as "retaliatory", has sparked fears of a new US-Iran escalation amid faltering efforts to revive Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. "This action in self-defence... sends a very important and strong message," Blinken told reporters on a visit to Rome. "I would hope that the message sent by the strikes... will be heard and deter future action," he added, referring to repeated attacks against US interests in Iraq that Washington blames on pro-Iran groups. Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi decried the strikes as an "unacceptable violation of Iraqi sovereignty and Iraqi national security", while Damascus condemned a violation against both nations. The Hashed al-Shaabi, an Iraqi paramilitary alliance that includes several Iranian proxies and has become the main power broker in Baghdad, said the strikes killed four of its fighters in the Qaim region, near the border with Syria. The fighters were stationed there to prevent jihadists infiltrating Iraq, the group said, denying that they had taken part in any attacks against US interests or personnel. "We reserve the legal right to respond to these attacks and hold the perpetrators accountable on Iraqi soil," the Hashed said. The Pentagon said the strikes targeted operational and weapons storage facilities at two locations in Syria and one in Iraq, all near the common border, and used by militias engaged in drone attacks against US interests in Iraq. Kataeb Hezbollah and Kataeb Sayyid al-Shuhada, two Iraqi Shiite armed factions, were among the "several Iran-backed militia groups" that had used the facilities, the Pentagon said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, which relies on a network of sources inside Syria, said seven fighters were killed in the strikes and at least six more were wounded. The targets included an arms depot near Albu Kamal, a Syrian border town on the Euphrates River, the Observatory said. Syria's state-run SANA news agency said one child was killed, while its foreign ministry condemned the raid as "a flagrant violation of the sanctity of Syrian and Iraqi territory". US interests in Iraq, where 2,500 American troops are deployed as part of an international coalition to fight the jihadist Islamic State group, have been targeted in more than 40 attacks this year. The vast majority have been bombs against logistics convoys, but rocket fire and drones packed with explosive have also been used. Some attacks have been claimed by pro-Iran factions hoping to press Washington into a full withdrawal, leaving Baghdad -- which counts both Washington and Tehran as allies -- caught in the middle. Iraq's foreign ministry said that the government was proceeding with investigations to "prevent any escalation... detrimental" to Iraq's stability, while Kadhemi re-emphasised his country's "refusal to be an arena for settling scores". French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian reaffirmed "France's support for the stability and sovereignty of Iraq", but deplored the "unacceptable attacks... against the interests" of the anti-IS coalition. Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah "strongly" condemned the air strikes. "What the US warplanes have done is a blatant attack on sovereignty... the region will not enjoy stability... until US forces are expelled" from Iraq and Syria, the pro-Iran group said. Some of the militia groups that form the Hashed al-Shaabi have been deployed in war-torn Syria over the years to support regime forces and to further Iran's interests in the country. In February, US strikes on facilities in eastern Syria used by Iran-backed militia groups left more than 20 fighters dead, according to the Observatory. The latest US strikes come days after the United States and France warned Iran that time was running out to return to the 2015 nuclear deal, voicing fears that Tehran's sensitive atomic activities could advance if talks in Vienna drag on. A return to that accord has been a key focus for Biden after the nuclear deal was trashed by his predecessor Donald Trump, who also imposed devastating new sanctions on Iran. The UN's nuclear watchdog said Friday it had received no reply from Tehran over the possible extension of a temporary agreement covering inspections at Iranian nuclear facilities which expired a day earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/air-strikes-will-deter-future-action-us-secretary-of-state-defends-actions-in-iraq-syria/articleshow/83935088.cms||---

Vehicles used for safari will be non air-conditioned and only packaged food will be sold on the zoo premises; no outside food will be allowed. Visitors won’t be permitted to feed the animals. According to sources at BBP, the zoo authorities sent a proposal last week to the health and family welfare department with revised standard operating procedures (SOPs) to reopen the park and forest safari. “We had a new set of SOPs that was suggested to the commissioner of the health department, which included measures to ensure minimal human-animal contact...,” said a senior official.  Zoo authorities had suggested that they would have a batch of only 2,000 visitors at a time and not more than four batches a day. “The SOPs have been approved by the health department and permission has been given to open the zoo. We plan to reopen on Thursday (July 1),” the officer added. Spread over 732 hectares, the park, which includes the zoo, safari, butterfly park and an animal rescue centre, was closed on April 28. The place is home to nearly 2,388 animals belonging to 102 species. The zoo slipped into a crisis after visitor footfall thinned and ticket sale went down to zero during the long lockdown period. The authorities sent out a plea to animal lovers and the general public to contribute towards daily feeding cost and veterinary needs of the animals and the same was met with an overwhelming response. BBP picked for mahotsav The Central Zoo Authority of India has picked Bannerghatta Biological Park to host its 16th week of Aazadi Ka Amrith Mahotsav, to conduct awareness on Malabar Banded Swallowtail, a protected species of butterfly native to the Western Ghats. As part of the event, an online webinar is scheduled to create awareness about the butterfly species and the steps to be taken to conserve it. Online competitions — quiz, drawing, craft, photography and elocution — will be conducted. While the quiz will be held on Tuesday, entries for drawing and craft contest must be sent by Thursday; entries for photography and elocution competition must be sent by Saturday to educationbbp@gmail.com.

According to a decision by city authorities last week, all Moscow restaurants, cafes and bars must only admit customers who have been vaccinated, have recovered from Covid-19 in the past six months or can provide a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours.  As proof of vaccination for entering a restaurant, customers must visit a government website and get a QR code, a digital pattern designed to be read by a scanner.  In one concession to desperate restaurant owners, the city officials agreed that the QR codes aren't needed for the next two weeks at establishments with outdoor terraces. Underage customers won't have to provide documentation if accompanied by their parents.  The new restrictions come as Moscow has registered infection levels on par with last winter and recorded all-time high daily numbers of coronavirus deaths.  "The coronavirus situation in Moscow remains extremely difficult," Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told reporters. "Over the past week, we have registered new record highs of hospitalizations, ICU patients and coronavirus deaths."  Although Russia was the first country to announce a coronavirus vaccine, only about 14% of the population has received the shots.  Officials have blamed widespread skepticism about vaccines, lax attitudes toward taking necessary precautions and a quick spread of more infectious variants.  Amid the surge, 18 Russian regions - from Moscow and St. Petersburg to the remote far-eastern region of Sakhalin - have made vaccinations mandatory this month for employees in certain sectors, such as government offices, retail, health care, education, restaurants and other service industries.  In Moscow, authorities said companies should suspend without pay employees unwilling to get vaccinated, and they threatened to temporarily halt operations of businesses that don't meet the goal of having 60% of staff get at least one vaccine shot by July 15 and both shots by Aug. 15.  Russia's coronavirus task force on Monday reported 21,650 new infections and said 611 people died over the past day. Moscow, the region around the capital and the country's second-largest city of St. Petersburg accounts for the bulk of infections.  Since the pandemic started, Russia has recorded 5.47 million infection cases and 133,893 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/new-coronavirus-rules-enacted-for-moscow-restaurants/articleshow/83935898.cms||---

The fourth named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season formed close to South Carolina's coast and had top sustained winds of 40 mph (65kph) with higher guests at midafternoon. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was located at 3 pm about 60 miles (95 kilometers) east-southeast of Beaufort, South Carolina. The storm was headed to the west-northwest at 16 mph (26 kph) and was expected to dump several inches of rain on some parts of South Carolina and Georgia on its trek inland. Danny emerged from a tropical depression off the coast, and forecasters said rapid weakening is expected after landfall. A tropical storm warning was posted earlier Monday for a swath of the Southeast coast from Edisto Beach to South Santee River, South Carolina.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/tropical-storm-danny-forms-off-south-carolina-nearing-land/articleshow/83935878.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19: In April-June, Karnataka saw 37% of all tests||BENGALURU: Karnataka, which is among only five Indian states that tested more than three crore samples since the Covid-19 outbreak last year, has seen more than one third — 1.2 crore or 37% — of the total 3.3 crore samples tested in just 88 days between April 1 and June 27, 2021. In these three months, the state tested an average of 1.4 lakh samples per day compared to 55,183 in the 388 days before that. However, despite the apparent surge in testing, the positivity rate for this period remains the highest, analysis of data from March 2020 to June 2021 shows. For instance, a third of all tests done in this period resulted in nearly two-thirds of the positive cases in the state so far. The break-up: Nearly 18.4 lakh of the state’s 28.3 lakh cases were reported between April and June this year. This puts the positivity rate for the period at a staggering 14.7%. Comparatively, in the three months between January and March 2021, the state’s positivity rate was just 1.07% — 77,508 cases from more than 72 lakh samples tested (see graphic). No data on individualsThe overall positivity rate in Karnataka is a little more than 8%, while the period between March and December had a positivity rate of 6.5%. While the state has tested more than 3.3 crore samples so far — more than 1.9 crore (58% of total tests) were conducted after December 31 — there is no data on how many people were actually tested. The state has certainly not tested 3.3 crore people as this would mean that nearly 50% of the total population would have been tested. “There are certainly a lot of samples tested during the second wave that belong to the same people who may have been tested earlier too. There are thousands of people who’ve tested themselves multiple times, there is no data specifically on the actual number of people tested,” one official said. RAT vs RT-PCRNotwithstanding the pressure to drastically increase testing, Karnataka has managed to test most of the samples using the RT-PCR, considered the gold standard, even as many other states have drawn flak for relying excessively on rapid antigen tests (RAT). As of June 27, only 18% or 6.1 lakh samples in the state were tested using RAT, and a majority of the remaining samples were done using RTPCR and other methods. This is, in fact, better than the share of RAT that the state had at the end of last year — 26% of the 1.4 crore tests done up to December 2020 were done using RAT. The government doesn’t give a break-up of how many of the 2.7 crore samples tested as on date using non-RAT methods were tested using RTPCR specifically, but officials said a majority of them were done using this method.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/in-apr-june-ktaka-saw-37-of-all-tests/articleshow/83935907.cms||---

The report from Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for Human Rights, offers a sweeping look at the roots of centuries of mistreatment faced by Africans and people of African descent, notably from the transatlantic slave trade. It seeks a "transformative" approach to address its continued impact today. The report, a year in the making, hopes to build on momentum around the recent, intensified scrutiny worldwide about the blight of racism and its impact on people of African descent as epitomized by the high-profile killings of unarmed Black people in the United States and elsewhere. "There is today a momentous opportunity to achieve a turning point for racial equality and justice," the report said. The report aims to speed up the action by countries to end racial injustice; end impunity for rights violations by police; ensure that people of African descent and those who speak out against racism are heard, and face up to past wrongs through accountability and redress. "I am calling on all states to stop denying - and start dismantling - racism; to end impunity and build trust; to listen to the voices of people of African descent and to confront past legacies and deliver redress," Bachelet said in a video statement. While broaching the issue of reparation in her most explicit way yet, Bachelet suggested monetary compensation alone is not enough and would be part of an array of measures to help rectify or make up for the injustices. "Reparations should not only be equated with financial compensation," she wrote, adding that it should include restitution, rehabilitation, acknowledgment of injustices, apologies, memorialization, educational reforms, and "guarantees" that such injustices won't happen again. The UN-backed Human Rights Council commissioned the report during a special session last year following the murder of Floyd, an African-American who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May 2020. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/citing-racism-un-rights-chief-seeks-reparations-for-blacks/articleshow/83937020.cms||---
---||World||Greek police recover Picasso, Mondrian works stolen in 2012||ATHENS: Greek police say they have recovered two paintings by 20th century masters Pablo Picasso and Piet Mondrian, nearly a decade after their theft from the country's biggest state art gallery in Athens. A statement late Monday said the two works were in the hands of the police, but provided no detail on their condition and on whether any arrests had been made. The paintings were stripped from their frames during a well-organized, overnight heist at the National Art Gallery on January 9, 2012. The burglars had also taken a pen and ink drawing of a religious scene by Italian 16th century painter Guglielmo Caccia. They had initially grabbed a fourth work, also by Mondrian, but abandoned it as they fled. Police said at the time that the heist was completed in about seven minutes. The stolen Picasso was a cubist female bust which the Spanish painter had donated to Greece in 1949 with a dedication "in homage to the Greek people" for their resistance to Nazi German occupying forces during World War II. The thieves also took a 1905 representational oil painting of a riverside windmill by Mondrian, the Dutch painter who became famous for his later, abstract linear works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/greek-police-recover-picasso-mondrian-works-stolen-in-2012/articleshow/83936100.cms||---
---||World||Frustrated Detroit-area residents clean up flooded homes||DETROIT: A weekend storm in the Detroit area kept flooded sections of Interstate 94 closed for a third day Monday while disgusted homeowners trudged to the curb with possessions ruined by a gross stew of water and sewage that backed up into basements. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said "old infrastructure combined with climate change" and power outages created the misery. Thousands of people were affected in Detroit, Dearborn and the Grosse Pointe communities.  "Lend a hand to your neighbors and loved ones who are struggling. This is a devastating moment," Whitmer told reporters, standing next to a small lake on I-94.  The National Weather Service said more than 6 inches (15.2 centimeters) of rain fell Friday night and Saturday morning in some areas. Grosse Pointe Park said it measured 8.1 inches (20.5 centimeters) over 24 hours.  Rain for the entire month of June typically is 3 inches (7.6 centimeters), the governor said, so "we had double that in a period of hours."  In Grosse Pointe Farms, piles of spoiled exercise bikes, sleeper sofas, luggage, hockey equipment, toys and family keepsakes were dumped along the curb. The city sent a trash truck out on Sunday to try to make a dent in the mess.  Marcos Bonafede of Grosse Pointe Park said water reached the ceiling of his basement and killed his cat, Pancho.  "This loss paralyzed me," Bonafede said in a Facebook plea for help to clear out the basement.  Flooded homes were linked to a pump station failure in Detroit at 1 a.m. Saturday, Grosse Pointe Park told residents. Detroit officials planned to speak to reporters Monday afternoon.  On I-94, pumps get rid of water on the major highway, where many stretches are below ground level in Detroit. But power outages stymied the effort over the weekend, according to the state Department of Transportation.  Water on I-94 will recede as swollen rivers and creeks are able to swallow more of it from the pump stations, spokeswoman Diane Cross said.  Police, meanwhile, were still trying to tow abandoned vehicles that stalled on I-94 when drivers believed they could get through the water.  Nicole Connaire of Grosse Pointe Park said she was looking for a garden statue of a little boy and girl that apparently was swept away during the storm.  "They floated away somewhere and we cannot for the life of us locate them anywhere. ... It might bring some joy to this otherwise crazy time," she said on Facebook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/frustrated-detroit-area-residents-clean-up-flooded-homes/articleshow/83937137.cms||---

Her announcements were a mix of expansion of existing steps, such as increasing the size of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) from Rs 3 lakh crore to Rs 4.5 lakh crore as the limit was being reached, and fresh measures. So far, over Rs 2.7 lakh crore loans have been sanctioned to 1.1 crore borrowers, based on the government guarantee, with Rs 2.1 lakh crore disbursed, financial services secretary Debasish Panda told reporters. Another Rs 1.1 lakh crore of loans, based on a similar mechanism, has been lined up. Of this, Rs 50,000 crore will be provided to the healthcare sector. More measures needed, say India Inc, expertsCovid-hit sectors such as tourism will get Rs 60,000 crore loans at a maximum 8.25%, with the list of sectors to be expanded over time, Sitharaman said. Welcoming the announcements, PM Modi indicated the fund marked for the health sector would be spent to boost healthcare facilities for children in under-served areas. “The measures will help to stimulate economic activities, boost production and exports and generate employment,” he tweeted. The measures will help to stimulate economic activities, boost production & exports and generate employment. Resul… https://t.co/g9vry4RJWA— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1624886462000Tourism and hospitality sectors have for long been demanding support from the government, arguing that they have been hit hard as Covid has forced people to cut down travel. The Centre offered loans up to Rs 10 lakh to travel agents and Rs 1 lakh for registered tourist guides based on government guarantees. The government also sought to signal that India will be open to welcoming overseas tourists in the coming weeks by allowing free visas for up to 5 lakh foreign travellers by March. “Visa fee is often a tipping point. Industry seems to think that it will have an impact,” finance secretary T V Somanathan said. The government estimated the impact of the measures, including some announced recently, up to Rs 6.3 lakh crore, some of which will be spread over five years, but did not disclose the cost to the exchequer. The measures indicated that the Centre was unwilling to accept demands for a large stimulus in the form or tax cuts or support to big businesses and was, instead, focused on leveraging funds to provide support to small businesses and individuals in targeted groups such as those borrowing from micro-finance institutions, who can now get support even if they have been up to 89 days late in settling their dues. Budgetary support, the government’s moves indicated, will be reserved for core sectors such as creating public health facilities, or for creating farm infrastructure and paying food or fertiliser subsidies that go to the poor. Besides, it seems to be banking on its Budget announcements to boost capital spending and generate demand for steel & cement, apart from creating jobs. Industry leaders, however, demanded more measures. Economists also said steps were needed to spur demand. “Ficci made several suggestions including the need to extend MGNREGA to urban areas, introduce direct cash transfers to vulnerable sections of society, (and) consider issuance of consumption vouchers for driving demand in the near term,” Sanjiv Mehta, HUL CMD, who is also the VP of Ficci, said.

---||World||US judge dismisses monopoly suit against Facebook||WASHINGTON: A judge on Monday dismissed a blockbuster antitrust suit against Facebook filed last year by federal and state regulators, saying the lawsuit failed to "plausibly" establish that the social network had created a monopoly. Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court of Washington DC dismissed the case filed in December by the Federal Trade Commission and more than 40 states, which could have rolled back Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp. The lawsuit "failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element ... that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for personal social networking services," the judge said in a 53-page opinion, while allowing authorities the opportunity to refile the case with revisions. In lawsuits filed in December which were consolidated in federal court, US and state officials called for the divestment of Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that Facebook had acted to "entrench and maintain its monopoly to deny consumers the benefits of competition." But the judge said the complaint "says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had ... it is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist." Facebook shares surged after the decision, lifting the company's valuation above $1 trillion for the first time. The move comes a week after a US congressional panel advanced legislation which would lead to a sweeping overhaul of antitrust laws and give more power to regulators to break up large tech firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-judge-dismisses-monopoly-suit-against-facebook/articleshow/83937406.cms||---

This is being seen as a dire effort by the LJP groups to win the support of loyal followers of the late leader. While Chirag has announced to start a two-month tour across the state from Hajipur, Paswan’s brother, Paras will organise a big celebration at the party office in Patna. Paras had told TOI last week, “We will also have a grand celebration. He was my brother and mentor. He was second Ambedkar." National spokesperson of the Paras-led LJP faction, Sanjay Saraf said, “We will observe Paswanji’s birthday in Patna and Delhi. We will serve food (prasad) to people. He was the messiah of the poor.” In an interview to TOI, Chirag had said he was not starting the yatra (tour) on his father’s birth anniversary for the election. “I am starting this journey on my father’s birth anniversary. We got more than 25 lakh votes in the last assembly election. This was about 6% of all votes even when we put candidates only in 135 seats. I should have gone to people to thank them and seek their blessings. But because of Covid-19 and due to my bad health, I could not do that. Now I need to seek the blessings of people when my own family members, my uncle, have gone against me and backstabbed me when I was ill,” he had said. Last week, RJD chief Tejaswi Yadav said his party has decided to celebrate Paswna’s birth anniversary to commemorate his contribution to the state. He had also said how his father Lalu Yadav sent Paswan to Rajya Sabha even when the LJP did not even have a single MLA and Paswan himself lost the election in 2009.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ljp-groups-rjd-to-celebrate-paswans-birth-anniversary/articleshow/83938025.cms||Dipak K Dash

There is a fierce battle for the seat of Batley and Spen, which was left vacant after Tracy Brabin became West Yorkshire mayor. Kim Leadbeater, sister of murdered former MP Jo Cox, is the Labour party’s candidate. Next to the image, her flyer says: "The risk of voting for anyone but Labour is clear". Labour Friends of India has condemned the leaflet. "It is unfortunate that the Labour party used a picture of the Prime Minister of India, the world’s largest democracy and one of the UK’s closest friends, from the G7 meeting in 2019, on its leaflet," it said. "We ask the Labour party to withdraw the leaflet immediately and will also be writing to the leadership about this. The Labour party has a proud history with India." .@AngelaRayner comes over like butter wouldn’t melt on @BBCr4today but @UKLabour are putting out this 👇 In… https://t.co/HtZa2ABR0M— Richard Holden MP (@RicHolden) 1624872846000Conservative sources said: "Labour HQ will be coordinating this campaign as they do with all byelections. Labour activists are not distributing this flyer in white areas, they are targeting ethnic minority areas to win back votes going to George Galloway." The byelection takes place on July 1. The seat has been in Labour hands since 1997. For Labour, retaining this seat is vital as it lost Hartlepool in May to the Tories. But another candidate, Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Britain, is hoovering up Muslim votes from Labour and the Conservatives, too, have put up a strong fight for the seat. Twenty per cent of constituents are of Pakistani and Indian (mainly Gujarati Muslim) heritage. Conservative MP Richard Holden, who spotted the flyer when out canvassing for the Tories, told TOI: "The British Labour Party has sunk to a new low. In order to divisively try and grab votes they’re now suggesting that if they were in government, they would snub Prime Minister Modi. This is simply disgraceful." "Is Labour policy we shouldn’t be attending G7 meetings or India shouldn’t be attending?" asked Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/labour-uses-anti-boris-modi-byelection-flyer-to-woo-ethnic-minority-votes-in-uk/articleshow/83938099.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The Disney Dream had been scheduled to set sail Tuesday from Port Canaveral, Florida, with 300 employees who had volunteered for the "simulation" cruise. But the trip was postponed until next month, pending approvals, because a small number of employees had inconsistent results for Covid-19, "which is considered positive by the CDC," Disney said in a statement.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, had approved the cruise line's request to conduct a two-night test cruise.  The federal government is starting to allow cruises to sail again, but only if nearly all passengers and crew are vaccinated against the virus. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill banning businesses from requiring proof of vaccination, so cruise lines must prove the effectiveness of their Covid-19 safety protocols on test cruises.  Last weekend, Celebrity Edge departed Fort Lauderdale, Florida, becoming the first cruise ship to leave a US port in 15 months. Saturday's sailing kicked off the cruise lines' return to business with Carnival vessels already scheduled to depart from other ports next month.  Celebrity Cruises, one of Royal Caribbean Cruise's brands, said 99% of the passengers were vaccinated, well over the 95% requirement imposed by the CDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/disney-delays-test-cruise-over-inconsistent-virus-results/articleshow/83938455.cms||---
---||World||Estranged Durst brother testifies: 'He'd like to murder me'||LOS ANGELES: The estranged brother of Robert Durst, the real estate heir on trial in his best friend's slaying, reluctantly testified Monday that the two never got along and he feared his oldest sibling would kill him. "He'd like to murder me," Douglas Durst bluntly told jurors in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Douglas Durst, chairman of one of New York's largest commercial real estate firms, said he had not seen his brother in 20 years and they had not spoken since 1999. He said Robert Durst was angry and bitter over an acrimonious inheritance settlement for tens of millions of dollars. Douglas Durst, chairman of the Durst Organization that owns some of Manhattan's premier skyscrapers and 2,500 apartments, said he and his brother had fought since they were children. "He treated me miserably," Douglas Durst said. "He would fight with me at every chance. He would embarrass me." Despite the bad blood, Douglas Durst said he was not happy to testify against his brother, who is on trial on charges of fatally shooting Susan Berman in 2000 at her Los Angeles home. He said he cooperated with prosecutors under threat of subpoena. "There are other places I'd much rather be," he said. Prosecutors say Berman provided an alibi for Robert Durst after he killed his first wife, Kathie, in 1982 and that he silenced his friend to keep her from telling police what she knew about the disappearance. Robert Durst has pleaded not guilty. Kathie Durst had told Douglas Durst she planned to seek a divorce from his brother, he testified. Douglas Durst said his brother told him that she had vanished a couple of days after he put her on a train to New York City from their lakeside house in Westchester County. Robert Durst said that was the last time he saw his wife. "His tone was very neutral," Douglas Durst said. "There was no great anxiety in his tone. It seemed a little strange." Kathie Durst has never been found, but she was declared legally dead. Robert Durst has long been considered a suspect in her death but has denied any involvement and has never been charged with a crime related to her disappearance. Douglas Durst, tan and wearing a crisp white shirt with French cuffs and a gray mask because of Covid-19 restrictions, cut a much different figure than his ailing brother. A pale Robert Durst, 78, with a shaven head that reveals a massive scar from removing fluid his skull, was seated in a wheelchair and dressed in brown jail scrubs. Durst, who has bladder cancer and several other maladies, stood up and addressed the judge to counter a suggestion by deputy district attorney John Lewin that he was seeking sympathy from jurors by displaying his urine bag. Durst said his head was shaved because it was the only haircut he could get in jail. He said he wants a doctor to remove a catheter. "I am not seeking sympathy from the jury," Durst said in a throaty voice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/estranged-durst-brother-testifies-hed-like-to-murder-me/articleshow/83938326.cms||---

Data show that fatalities from the infection stands at 3,129. Over 85% of those who were diagnosed with the fungal infection had Covid-19. In terms of age group, 32% of those infected were young being in the age bracket of 18-45 years. Addressing a meeting of the group of ministers on Covid-19, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan apprised the members on the trajectory of Mucormycosis infections that occurred coinciding with the recent surge in Covid-19 cases. Of the 40,845 cases reported, 31,344 cases are rhinocerebral in nature, he said. "Of the total numbers, 34,940 patients had Covid (85.5%), 26,187 (about 64.11%) were co-morbid for diabetes while 21,523 (52.69%) of those infected were on steroids," he added. In terms of age group, the health minister shared that 13,083 patients were in the age group 18-45 (32%), 17,464 were in the age group of 45-60 (42%) and 10,082 (24%) patients were 60 and above. Among other concerns related to Covid-19, the health minister also spoke about the Delta plus variant. He informed the GoM that the Delta Plus variant has been categorised as a "variant of concern" and its attributes are being investigated in detail. Intensive surveillance is being carried out wherever its presence has been detected, the minister said, adding that districts of 12 states where the variant has been detected are being monitored. "Scientists are right now studying its (Delta Plus) impact on disease transmission, severity, immune escape and other effects. It is also being cultured in labs and its effect on the vaccine is being studied," the minister said. Additional representative number of samples targeting Covid cluster cases with re-infection, vaccine breakthrough cases, super spreader events and high mortality clusters are also being sent for genome sequencing. Vardhan also said that through the course of this pandemic, the government has been continually scaling up efforts to carry out genome sequencing and tracking different variants of virus for formulating suitable containment strategies. So far labs have carried out genome sequencing in 45,500 samples. Besides this the health ministry teams are also tracking the positivity trends in over 174 districts where these variants of concern were detected. The GOM strongly reiterated the importance of Covid appropriate behavior. Higher level of continued awareness building through sustained IEC campaigns was highlighted. Dr V K Paul emphasised on the benefits of mask wearing and hand hygiene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-85-people-with-black-fungus-had-covid-says-govt/articleshow/83938696.cms||---

"Today is a historic day for liberties," court president Arturo Zaldivar said after the decision was approved by eight of the 11 judges.  The ruling comes after Congress failed to enact legislation legalizing recreational marijuana use by an April 30 deadline set by the country's highest court.  The landmark bill was approved by the lower house in March but still needs final approval by the upper house, the Senate.  In April, the ruling majority in the Senate said it was considering postponing the final discussion of the law until September.  The legalization push is partly aimed at curbing drug-related violence that claims thousands of lives each year in the Latin American nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mexico-top-court-decriminalizes-recreational-marijuana-use/articleshow/83938809.cms||---
---||India||Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee links governor Dhankhar to 1996 hawala scam||KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Monday called state governor Jagdeep Dhankhar "a corrupted man", claiming he was yet to be cleared of his links with the 1996 hawala scam and urging the media to check "whether there was a chargesheet or not" (in the case). Banerjee also charged Dhankhar with trying to "split Bengal", referring to his meetings with "separatist leaders" and BJP leaders demanding a separate state in north Bengal during his Darjeeling visit. She had written thrice to the Centre to "recall Dhankhar", she said, urging Delhi to let go of its "ego" and "consider" her plea. "He is trying to disturb peace in north Bengal. He called and met separatist leaders. He is urging them to launch protests. Is this a governor's duty?" she said. "He went to Delhi for three days and then to Gurgaon before heading to north Bengal," Banerjee said. "Why did he choose to tour north Bengal suddenly? Who did he meet: BJP MPs, MLAs and block presidents?" she added. "Why would such a governor be sent here? Is the central government's only job to disturb state governments? Can't they digest, tolerate, accept their defeat? They use ED and CBI. All these to disturb people when a pandemic is raging," she said. Banerjee elaborated on her "hawala" charge: "Someone sent me this. There was an FIR but they went to court and got their names cleared. Subsequently, however, a PIL or writ petition has been filed. This is pending." Responding to Dhankhar's charge that there was lack of transparency in the running of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) and his demand for an audit by the CAG, Banerjee said: "He should be probed first." She then raised a series of questions: "How many people went with him (to Darjeeling)? How much money was spent on this visit? What happened at the governor's house? Who are the people who meet him regularly? All this should be probed first. An internal audit has already been conducted on GTA. Why CAG? Can't the state probe this? Why are they so angry with Darjeeling?" "This is a dictatorial governor. He is dictating to everyone, from the highest authority in the state to officers. He is calling officers and saying: 'You are under scanner.' He is calling and saying: 'You are under threat.' Who is he to say all this rubbish? I have maintained silence till now but am being forced to speak. I will meet him if called and will respond to his calls. This is my courtesy. There is a constitution as well. And there are duties and responsibilities. I cannot accept that he will keep saying whatever he wants, will keep doing whatever he wants," the CM said. Later, TMC responded to Dhankhar's press conference, reminding him that the governor was nothing but a "magnificent cipher".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-links-governor-dhankhar-to-1996-hawala-scam/articleshow/83939204.cms||---

The village of Lytton in British Columbia already broke the record for Canada's all-time high, with a temperature of 116 Fahrenheit (46.6 degrees Celsius) on Sunday. Temperatures have soared well above seasonal averages from the US state of Oregon to Canada's Arctic territories, with forecasters warning of worse to come. "It's a desert heat -- very dry and hot," David Phillips, a senior climatologist for Environment Canada, told AFP. "We are the second coldest country in the world and the snowiest," he said. "We often see cold snaps and blizzards but not often do we talk about hot weather like this." "Dubai would be cooler than what we're seeing now." Because of climate change, record-setting temperatures are becoming more frequent. Globally, the decade to 2019 was the hottest recorded, and the five hottest years have all occurred within the last five years. On Sunday in Seattle, Washington state, the temperature hit 104 degrees Fahrenheit, a record that surprised residents not used to warmer climes. "Normally it's probably like, maybe 60, 70 degrees is a great day -- everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts -- but this is... ridiculous," one city resident told AFP. "I feel like I'm in the desert or something." Oregon's biggest city, Portland, hit 114 F on Monday, the US National Weather Service (NWS) said, breaking back-to-back records set over the weekend. In nearby Eugene, organizers were forced to postpone the final day of the US Olympic track and field trials, moving afternoon events to the evening. Across the border in Canada, stores sold out of portable air conditioners and fans, while cities opened emergency cooling centers and outreach workers handed out bottles of water and hats as more than 160 local heat records were set, including in the ski resort town of Whistler. Several Covid-19 vaccination clinics were canceled and schools announced they would close due to the extreme heat. In Vancouver, officials set up temporary water fountains and misting stations on street corners, while forest and fisheries services warned of extreme wildfire risks and low lake and river water levels stressing fish. Beaches and pools were packed while emergency services, overwhelmed with calls, warned of delays for ambulances. Several people without cooling at home told AFP they slept overnight in their air conditioned cars or in underground parking garages, some with their pets. Others shared instructions on how to assemble makeshift chillers using a fan attached to a box filled with bags of ice. Environment Canada issued alerts for British Columbia, Alberta, and parts of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, saying the "prolonged, dangerous and historic heat wave will persist through this week." The NWS issued a similar warning, saying the "hottest temperatures of the ongoing historic heat wave are expected across the Pacific Northwest today." The scorching heat -- which is breaking records in Canada and the United States dating back more than 80 years -- has been blamed on a high-pressure ridge trapping warm air in the region. This heat dome poses "serious" health concerns, said Phillips, noting the last major heat in Canada left nearly 70 people dead in 2018. "And it's not just a one-day wonder. It's a seven-day kind of thing," he said, with temperatures forecast to reach 47 degrees Celsius (117 Fahrenheit) or higher. Nick Bond, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, said the freak weather event was not entirely due to climate change, but was exacerbated by it. "Climate change is a factor here, but definitely a secondary one," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/more-record-smashing-heat-forecast-as-canada-us-northwest-bake/articleshow/83938986.cms||---
---||World||Chicago cop who shot man in chase stripped of police powers||CHICAGO: A Chicago police officer who fatally shot an armed man in the back during a foot pursuit in March has been stripped of his police powers, the department confirmed on Monday. Chicago Police Department spokesman Tom Ahern said Officer Evan Solano has been stripped of his powers pending an investigation into the March 31 shooting of Anthony Alvarez.  Superintendent David Brown did not explain why he waited until Monday to announce the move that was recommended by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability at least two months ago. Ahern said Brown told reporters that he made the decision after COPA provided him with more information.  John Catanzara, president of the Chicago police union, didn't respond to a phone call seeking comment.  Solano fatally shot the 22-year-old Alvarez two days after another Chicago officer shot and killed 13-year-old Adam Toledo during another foot pursuit. Video footage of that pursuit shows the teen was carrying a handgun that he either dropped or tossed aside less than a second before he was shot in the chest.  Video footage from Solano's body camera shows a foot pursuit in which the officer can be heard shouting, "Drop the gun! Drop the gun," before he opens fire. Alvarez appears to drop the gun after five shots ring out and he falls to the ground.  The shootings of the teen and Alvarez, both Hispanic, put the department under intense scrutiny and raised further questions about a force that has long been dogged by a reputation for brutality and racism. While COPA did not recommend that the officer who shot Adam Toledo, Eric Stillman, be relieved of his police powers, it did recommend that Solano be stripped of his.  Shortly after the the teenager was killed, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she had ordered the departmen t to draft an interim foot pursuit policy. Last month, the department announced a policy that, among other things, prohibits foot pursuits for minor traffic violations, and bars officers from separating from partners if they can't see the person they're chasing or if the officer or the person is injured.  Though the police department has not said why the officers were chasing Alvarez in the first place, Lightfoot suggested that it was related to a minor traffic offense, saying, "We can't live in a world where a minor traffic offense results in someone being shot and killed."  A key difference between the two shootings is that Stillman was chasing the teen after gunshots were fired nearby, allegedly by a man who authorities say was with Adam the night he died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chicago-cop-who-shot-man-in-chase-stripped-of-police-powers/articleshow/83939341.cms||---
---||World||UN peacekeeping missions prepare for possible shutdown||NEW YORK: United Nations peacekeeping missions globally are preparing for a possible shutdown on Thursday if the 193-member UN General Assembly is unable to agree a new $6 billion budget for the year to June 30, 2022, officials and diplomats said on Monday. Some diplomats blamed changes to negotiating procedures, issues with logistics and tough talks pitting China against Western countries for the delay in reaching an agreement. Catherine Pollard, the UN head of management strategy, policy and compliance, said the world body's 12 peacekeeping missions - most of which are in Africa and the Middle East - had been advised to start putting contingency plans in place in case a new budget is not adopted in time. "At the same time, we remain hopeful and confident that member states will conclude their negotiations," Pollard told reporters. She said that if the June 30 deadline is missed then secretary general Antonio Guterres can only spend money to safeguard UN assets and ensure the protection of the staff and the peacekeepers. UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said missions would be severely limited and unable to carry out such measures as protecting civilians, helping tackle Covid-19 and supporting political efforts and mediation. The United States is largest assessed contributor to the peacekeeping budget, responsible for about 28%, followed by China with 15.2% and Japan with 8.5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/un-peacekeeping-missions-prepare-for-possible-shutdown/articleshow/83939363.cms||---
---||World||Tenth victim pulled from Miami tower rubble; search goes on||SURFSIDE, FLORIDA: Rescue workers pulled a 10th body from the rubble of a Florida condominium tower on Monday, and the mayor said they would keep searching for survivors, five days after the 12-story building collapsed as residents slept. The crews were using cranes, dogs and infrared scanners to identify signs of life in the ruins, hoping survivors could still be alive in air pockets under the rubble. "We're going to continue and work ceaselessly to exhaust every possible option in our search," Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters at a news briefing. She acknowledged the number of casualties could rise, with 151 people still considered missing. Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah said workers have found voids large enough to keep victims alive. "Not to say that we have see anyone down there, but we've not gotten to the very bottom," he said. Jadallah said searchers have heard some sounds, such as tapping or scratching, although he acknowledged that they could be caused by metal shifting. He said there was no set time to stop rescue operations. The teams include experts sent by Israel and Mexico to assist in the search. The cause of the collapse at the Champlain Towers South in Surfside, near Miami, remains under investigation. A 2018 engineer's report found serious concrete deterioration in the underground parking garage and major damage in a slab beneath the pool deck. The report's author, Frank Morabito, wrote that the deterioration would "expand exponentially" if not repaired. Ross Prieto, then Surfside's top building official, met residents the following month after reviewing the report and assured them the building was "in very good shape," according to minutes of the meeting released on Monday. After the meeting, Prieto emailed the town's manager to say it "went very well. The response was very positive from everyone in the room. All main concerns over their forty year recertification process were addressed." Reuters was unable to reach Prieto, who is no longer employed by Surfside. He told the Miami Herald newspaper he did not remember getting the report. 'FAILURE TO ACT' The engineer's report was commissioned in advance of the condo seeking recertification, which is required for buildings 40 years after they are constructed. The tower was built in 1981. An estimate prepared by Morabito Consultants in 2018 put the cost of repairs at $9.1 million, including electrical, plumbing and work on the facade. Guillermo Olmedillo, Surfside's town manager in 2018, told Reuters he did not recall hearing about structural issues in the tower based on the engineer's report. "The last thing I knew was that everything is OK, reported by the building official," Olmedillo said. Gregg Schlesinger, a lawyer and former general contractor who specializes in construction-failure cases, said it was clear the deficiencies identified in the 2018 report were the main cause of the disaster. But Donna DiMaggio Berger, a lawyer who works with the condo association, said the issues were typical for older buildings in the area and did not alarm board members, all of whom lived in the tower with their families. Morabito Consultants said on Saturday that roof repairs were under way at the time of the collapse, but concrete restoration had not yet started. "We are deeply troubled by this building collapse and are working closely with the investigating authorities to understand why the structure failed," the firm said. Some relatives of the missing have provided DNA samples to officials. Family members were permitted to visit the site on Sunday. Over the weekend, a resident filed a lawsuit against the Champlain Tower South Condominium Association, accusing it of failure to act despite warnings that the building was structurally flawed. The resident, Steve Rosenthal, said the association had “breached all of the contractual duties of care pertaining to the timely maintenance and repair of the structure of the condominium building.” Police have identified eight victims, including a couple married for nearly 60 years and a mother whose teenage son is one of the few known survivors. At a makeshift memorial a block away, tributes to the victims and "missing" posters hung on a chain-link fence, with flowers and children's toys strewn about. Given the scores of those still missing, the disaster may end up as one of the deadliest non-deliberate structural failures in U.S. history. Ninety-eight people perished when the roof of the Knickerbocker Theatre in Washington, D.C., gave way from the weight of snow during a silent movie screening in January 1922. Two interior walkways collapsed into the lobby of the Hyatt Regency hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, during a dance party in July 1981, killing 114.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/tenth-victim-pulled-from-miami-tower-rubble-search-goes-on/articleshow/83939499.cms||---
---||India||Jammu hit could be tied to attack on LeT chief's home||NEW DELHI: Pakistan-based terror outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) has emerged as the prime suspect behind Sunday's drone attack on the IAF facility at Jammu with the J&K Police and Central agencies looking at a possible link with the near simultaneous arrest of an operative of The Resistance Front (TRF), a Lashker affiliate, in Jammu with an IED he meant to plant at a crowded 'Hindu-dominated' area, including temples. Apart from the TRF operative, two other LeT men have been picked up, including senior LeT commander Nadeem Abrar who was arrested in Srinagar on Monday and another from Shopian. Sources said they are being quizzed to establish a possible LeT link to Sunday's blasts on IAF camp at Jammu airport technical area. "While the probe is at an early stage, Lashkar is being suspected as the outfit has deployed most of the drones in the recent past, used to drop huge quantities of weapons and ammunition etc. Jaish was involved in an odd case, but Lashkar has popularised arms drop through drones. The possibility of LeT launching drones with payloads, can thus not be ruled out," J&K DGP Dilbag Singh told TOI on Monday. While he did not elaborate further, a theory is that Lashker is irked at the recent bombings outside its chief Hafiz Saeed Mohammad's residence in Lahore, the perpetrators of which are yet to be identified. The drone attack on a military facility in India was possibly to showcase its new capabilities. Sources told TOI that National Security Guard (NSG) has, on the instructions of the ministry of home affairs, deployed its anti-drone surveillance systems at the Jammu airport. An official, however, said the purpose was to test its effectiveness and, if found largely foolproof, extend its use to other sensitive installations. A source told TOI that while the threat of drones has been acknowledged for long, with new anti-drone technologies being acquired and tested by NTRO, NSG etc for last two years, their effectiveness leaves much to be desired.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-hit-could-be-tied-to-attack-on-let-chiefs-home/articleshow/83939608.cms||Bharti Jain
---||World||Joe Biden tells Israel president Reuven Rivlin he won't tolerate nuclear Iran||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden sought to assure Israel that he would not tolerate a nuclear Iran as he met with outgoing Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Monday amid a major shakeup in Israeli politics and growing angst in Tel Aviv over the US administration's effort to reenter the Iran nuclear deal.  Biden noted that he had ordered airstrikes a day earlier targeting facilities the US military says were used by Iran-backed militia groups near the border between Iraq and Syria. The rhetoric seemed to underscore that he would remain tough on malign Iran activity even as he seeks a diplomatic track to stem Tehran's nuclear program.  "What I can say to you is that Iran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch," Biden said at the White House meeting.  The meeting with Rivlin, who is making his final foreign trip of his presidency, took place just weeks after Naftali Bennett became Israel's new prime minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has intensified efforts to revive Iran's 2015 accord with world powers to limit Tehran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. Former President Donald Trump, with Netanyahu's backing, scrapped the accord in 2018.  Biden said he hoped to meet the new prime minister at the White House "very soon."  Rivlin is set to leave office on July 7 after a seven-year term. Isaac Herzog, a former parliament member who most recently headed a nonprofit that works closely with the government to promote immigration to Israel, will take over as Israeli president.  Rivlin was also scheduled to meet with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi later Monday.  Biden said the two would talk about Iran and the aftermath of the Gaza war. The president also underscored his support for continued normalization of relations between Israel and countries in the Arab and Muslim world and planned to reiterate the administration's promise to resupply Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, which was depleted during the 11-day war with Hamas in Gaza.  The latest conflict claimed at least 254 Palestinian lives and killed 13 people in Israel.  Biden has low hopes, at least for the moment, of reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, according to an official familiar with Biden administration deliberations. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said Biden administration officials are starting at square one in building contacts with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, a relationship that eroded during the Trump administration.  The meeting with Rivlin comes one day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met in Rome with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, a centrist who along with Bennett and six other political allies built a fragile coalition government that put Netanyahu in the opposition.  Aviv Kochavi, chief of staff of Israel Defense Forces, met last week with Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and other senior national security officials. Kochavi reiterated Israel's opposition to efforts by the Biden administration to revive the 2015 accord.  Administration officials, however, have countered in talks with Kochavi and others in the new Israeli government that it's worth giving diplomacy a shot at stopping Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapons system, even if it's not guaranteed, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-tells-israel-president-reuven-rivlin-he-wont-tolerate-nuclear-iran/articleshow/83939653.cms||---

Officials said investigators had ruled out foul play but were still trying to determine what happened. The identities and origin of the dead were also under investigation. Fishermen spotted the small boat Thursday morning and alerted the marine branch of the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force, who towed the vessel ashore. The police communications officer, Takara Bain, said in a news release that investigators had discounted foul play and were looking at other possibilities, without giving any specifics. Police Commissioner Trevor Botting said the boat appeared to have come from outside the Caribbean and authorities did not think it had the Turks and Caicos as its destination. ``My investigators are working to establish their identities and how they met their death,'' Botting said. The Turks and Caicos are often a magnet for desperate Haitians seeking to flee that poverty-stricken nation and the territory also has been used as a transshipment point by human traffickers. In June 2020, Sri Lanka-born Canadian citizen Srikajamukam Chelliah pleaded guilty to human trafficking charges before a Turks and Caicos judge and was sentenced to 14 months in prison. He was extradited to Florida and sentenced Feb. 24 to 32 months in prison for conspiring to smuggle people into the United States. Chelliah had been caught in August 2019 skippering a boat carrying 158 people, including 28 Sri Lankans. They told investigators they were bound for the United States.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/20-people-found-dead-on-boat-drifting-in-turks-and-caicos/articleshow/83939702.cms||---

Only four vaccines Comirnaty of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Vaxzervria by AstraZeneca-Oxford and, Johnson & Johnson's Janssen have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Only those inoculated with these vaccines will be given vaccination passports and allowed to travel within the EU during the pandemic. "India has a large population. However, not including Covishield in the EU Covid-19 Vaccination Passport will not allow Covishield vaccinated people to travel to European countries and this will affect students, business travellers back and forth, and cause severe disruptions to our economy and to the global economy," a source quoted Adar C Poonawalla, CEO of SII, as having communicated in a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Sources said referring to Poonawalla's letter, the director of government and regulatory affairs at SII, Prakash Kumar Singh, has also sought Jaishankar's intervention at the highest level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sii-seeks-govt-help-for-adding-covishield-in-eu-vax-passport-list/articleshow/83939786.cms||---
---||Business||Covid relief: No big fiscal dent seen||NEW DELHI: The government's relief measures unveiled on Monday are unlikely to leave a large fiscal dent, although a higher subsidy bill for food and fertiliser, announced earlier, is expected to result in some slippage. While the government pegged the impact of the series of steps at a little under Rs 6.3 lakh crore, it refrained from giving any estimate of the cost of the string of measures. Economists were, however, unanimous in suggesting that the steps will create contingent liability in the form of guarantees, with the impact on spending being muted. CARE Ratings estimated additional spending by the Centre at over Rs 1.5 lakh crore, of which close to Rs 1.1 lakh crore was on account of food and fertiliser subsidy. Among the announcements made on Monday, the Centre will chip in with Rs 15,000 crore for boosting public health infrastructure, while there will be additional outgo of under Rs 10,000 crore this year on the broadband initiative for rural areas. Free visas and revival of North East Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation aren't going to leave a big hole in the Centre's books. "The fiscal impact of announcements made today and earlier is not linear as substantial portion of the package is contingent liabilities. Ignoring these, the immediate impact will be slightly more than Rs 1.23 lakh crore, which will be around 0.6% of GDP," said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, State Bank of India's group chief economic adviser. Ratings agency ICRA's chief economist Aditi Nayar estimated it at Rs 60,000 crore, after setting aside the guarantee schemes and the announcements made earlier. CARE's calculations of an estimated fiscal deficit of 7.7-7.8% of GDP, against the government's budget estimate of 6.8%, has also factored in the possibility of revenue shortfall - both tax and disinvestment - due to the lockdowns on account of the second Covid wave. On its part, the government, however, remains upbeat on the revenue front, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman telling last month that the Centre was on course on the disinvestment exercise. Besides, it believes that direct tax collections so far this year as well as the GST mop-up have not been significantly hit by the lockdown across several states in April and May. Further, bonanzas such as those from the RBI in the form of a higher surplus transfer are expected to come handy in bridging the gap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-relief-no-big-fiscal-dent-seen/articleshow/83939978.cms||---
---||Business||Future workplace will be work from home-office hybrid||MUMBAI: The pickup in the Covid vaccination drive has encouraged several organisations to raise queries with consultants on whether the process of returning to office can begin. However, what's increasingly becoming clear - and large companies are setting an example - is that a 'hybrid' workplace is going to be the way forward. What set the tone of this trend is a LinkedIn post by Unilever CHRO Leena Nair, where she said, "For all the sadness the pandemic has brought and is still bringing, one thing I hope we can take from this is the flexibility it has brought to businesses and to people. It would be dreadful to return to the way so many of us were working - 40-hour weeks, long commutes." Nair said businesses have an opportunity to change for the better, adding that, while Unilever already had flexible and agile working practices, the organisation is embracing that even more. "We're still developing our plan, but one thing is certain: Things will never go back to the way they were before 2020," said Nair. PepsiCo recently announced its global shift in workplace policy for corporate associates under 'Work that Works'. Under the new policy, there will be no default day-to-day workplace for employees in headquarter locations, and associates along with their managers can choose what work can be done remotely and what needs to be done in their office. Citing studies, PepsiCo said employers who offer flexible work see a 15% increase in productivity, 31% less absenteeism and 10% less turnover. PepsiCo India CHRO Pavitra Singh told TOI, "In the past, employers had doubts about it as there was fear of productivity being impacted. However, that myth is busted now. It seems to be a great step forward and the current situation has been instrumental in changing the mindset. Today, people seem to be more convinced naturally of the advantages of a hybrid way of working." Singh said employees love the flexibility but miss the connect and camaraderie at the same time. They would prefer coming to office a few days a week, as it also gives them a break from the usual scenario and an opportunity to meet their friends and colleagues. "If we look at this model through an employers' lens, output is being delivered and, in fact, productivity levels have increased now. I feel that it is here to stay, given that employees have had an experience of how it works and seem to like it as well. We need to understand that employers don't want to compromise on innovation, creative thinking and happiness of the employees and this is where a hybrid model plays an integral role as it helps to create, collaborate, connect, and celebrate," said Singh. Nishith Desai Associates head (HR laws) Vikram Shroff said as the second wave subsides, employers are looking to gradually restart offices. "We are seeing a phase-wise approach with front desk employees and key managerial staff being required to resume office initially. From a duty of care perspective, some employers may prefer vaccinated employees to return to office first. In any case, employees will need to follow the standard operating procedures to help reduce Covid risk," said Shroff. He also added that since the government has announced that vaccination is voluntary, employers may not be able to mandate employees to get vaccinated, irrespective of whether the vaccination drive is coordinated or sponsored by the employer. "The Meghalaya high court recently held that forcing vaccination is a violation of fundamental right. I expect other courts to come up with similar judgments in due course," said Shroff.

Notably, many are contracting these rare co-infections despite not being 'bombed' with steroids or treated for diabetes, underlining the possibility of Covid-19 itself causing massive immune weakening. In a recent case, a 66-year-old patient was admitted to Lilavati Hospital with complaints of breathlessness and fever a week after he had recovered and got discharged. He came with completely white lungs as if his Covid was back. But after running investigations, it turned out to be a case of cytomegalovirus pneumonia (CMV) infection. "We normally see CMV in patients who have undergone solid organ or stem cell transplants. We were surprised to see it in Covid cases," said infectious disease expert Vasant Nagvekar. Around six such cases of CMV, rarely seen in individuals with healthy immune systems, have been recorded among post-Covid patients in Mumbai. At least one has succumbed to it. Similarly, pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a serious fungal infection that causes inflammation and fluid build-up in lungs, has been seen in more than 6-7 post-Covid cases. Till now, PCP was usually seen in HIV/AIDS patients whose CD4 count had dropped below 200. The fungal infection called mucormycosis that emerged as one of the major opportunistic infections is not the only one affecting patients, say doctors, who add that they are fighting a battery of other co-infections among Covid recovered patients, including Covid-19 Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis, herpes reactivation, bacterial infection multidrug resistant pseudomonas and candida auris, an emerging fungus that's considered a global threat. As per Nagvekar, doctors have to stay alert and open to the possibility that these rare co-infections could hit even those without a history of HIV or undergoing a transplant. "If a post Covid patient returns with fever, breathlessness and a worsening of CT scan and X-ray, these opportunistic infections must be suspected," he said. Intensivist at Hiranandani Hospital Arpita Dwivedy said while 70%-80% who have returned with an opportunistic infection have been treated with steroids in her observation, the role of the infection definitely needs study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/infections-seen-among-hiv-patients-hit-covid-survivors/articleshow/83940125.cms||Sumitra Debroy

One can also hire self-drive vehicles for outstation visits. The divisional railway manager of Danapur, Sunil Kumar, told this reporter on Monday that the facility was introduced at the Patna Junction on Sunday in view of a sudden increase in the footfall of passengers after the restoration of several pairs of trains. “The round-the-clock travel desk at the Patna Junction provides pick-and-drop service to the passengers. They can also make digital payments for availing the facility,” he added. The travel desk became a reality after the chief commercial manager of the ECR, Amitabh Prabhakar, showed interest in the project. Senior divisional commercial manager, Adhar Raj, pointed out that the railways had launched the facility on a no profit, no loss basis. “The travel desk has nearly 150 GPS-based vehicles, which include big cars like Innova. They can easily be tracked and the fare is nominal,” he added. Danapur division has also got permission from the railways to launch the facility of rental electric bikes in the city. “We are working on the plan and consulting different agencies for the purpose,” Raj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-book-cars-on-rent-from-patna-junction-to-reach-destination/articleshow/83929799.cms||Kumod Verma

Sebi had also asked FT MF to refund investment management and advisory fees of about two years prior to closure decision, aggregating Rs 512 crore. Relating to this order of Sebi, SAT asked the fund house to deposit Rs 250 crore in an escrow account. The tribunal will again hear the matter on August 30, 2021, a spokesperson for the fund house said. On June 7, Sebi had passed these orders against FT MF, among others, for committing serious lapses and violations relating to categorisation of schemes by replicating high–risk strategy across several funds. Some other violations that the regulator had found were violations relating valuations of debt papers, risk management practices and investment related due diligence. Sebi’s had alleged that as a result of all these violations, the fund house had to decide to close down six debt schemes. The decision caused immense loss to over three lakh investors in these schemes combined, several court cases relating to these schemes had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sat-stays-sebi-order-against-franklin-templeton-mf/articleshow/83936787.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Sebi puts Aditya Birla MF, GoAir IPOs on hold||Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi has put two applications for launching IPOs — by GoAir (now named Go First) and Aditya Birla MF — on hold without assigning any reason. Market players, however, said that there are ongoing investigations against group entities, and not against these companies that have filed the offer documents with the Sebi, and hence the delay in getting a clearance from the regulator. Sebi’s latest updates on the status of offer documents filed for fund-raising from the public showed that its observations on the offer document by Aditya Birla MF was ‘kept in abeyance’. Sebi gave the same reason against GoAir’s IPO. Sebi usually keeps its nod to a fund-raising plan in abeyance if there is any regulatory investigation against a company or its group companies. According to GoAir’s IPO document, Sebi is investigating its group company Bombay Dyeing about financial irregularities and fraud relating to a scheme of arrangement between Bombay Dyeing and SCAL Services. The investigation was started on a complaint by one of Bombay Dyeing’s shareholders. In May, GoAir filed the draft prospectus with Sebi to raise an estimated Rs 3,600 crore. In case of Aditya Birla MF, two of its sponsors — Aditya Birla Capital and the Indian arm of Sun Life Group of Canada — planned to offer 3.9 crore shares of the company to reduce their combined stake by about 13.5%. Sebi is reportedly investigating a series of deals between Aditya Birla Finance, a group company of the fund house that has applied for an IPO, and the promoters of CG Power, the Thapar family. The deals date back to 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-puts-aditya-birla-mf-goair-ipos-on-hold/articleshow/83936709.cms||---

Standard Life has mandated JP Morgan India and BofA Securities to sell 7 crore HDFC Life shares at price between Rs 658 and Rs 678 each, the term sheet for the deal showed. At the lower end of the price band, the offer is at a 5.5% discount to HDFC Life’s Monday closing price of Rs 696 on the BSE, while at the upper end the discount is 2.6%. If the whole of the 3.46% stake put up in the deal goes through, going by data on the BSE website, Standard Life would be left with 5.4% in the private life insurance major — down from 8.9% at the end of March 2021. If there is strong demand for HDFC Life shares, the seller may sell more than the 7 crore currently put up in the deal, the term sheet indicated. In the last three and half years since November 2017 when the life insurer went public, Standard Life has reduced its stake in the company by a little over 20%. At the end of December 2017, the UK-based financial services major had a stake of nearly 29.4% in the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/standard-life-to-sell-3-5-in-hdfc-life-for-rs-5200cr/articleshow/83936858.cms||---

The police clarified that the rally’s organisers did not seek any permission and the police bandobast deployed was based on the local intelligence gathered by the special branch. Superintendent of police R Raja told TOI: “The organisers of Monday’s agitation did not seek any permission, so there is no question of us denying permission. The agitation violated all Covid-19 norms.” For the violation of Covid-19 norms, MLC Dhas and others have been booked on the charges of disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant, unlawfully or negligently doing any act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life, malignantly doing any act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life. In addition, sections of the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act have also been slapped on them. Responding to the call given by MLC Dhas, thousands of Maratha community members and some political leaders, including Gevrai MLA Laxman Pawar, gathered at the Ambedkar statue of Beed town. The protestors then walked to the district collector’s office, where a written representation was made demanding that the reservation issue and other Beed-specific matters be addressed. The gathering at the district collector’s office was addressed by Dhas and some others. They blamed the state government for the sufferings of the Maratha community. Dhas blamed the Maharashtra government for the Supreme Court setting aside the Maratha reservation. He said the MVA government should now explore all the available remedies to ensure reservation for the community. He said, “Nobody questions the MVA when its leaders hold public programmes. Right from Nana Patole to Shiv Sena leaders to NCP functionaries — everyone is holding public programmes. But nobody is raising questioning them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/beed-bjp-mlc-holds-maratha-quota-stir-defying-covid-norms/articleshow/83933422.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The victim was identified as Ismael, a resident of the same village. His father Md Shoaib lodged a complaint with the Jokihat police station against 18 people, who were reported to be absconding after the incident. Police said the victim was caught by a mob when he was reportedly fleeing after committing theft in the house of one Doman Yadav at the village late Sunday night. He was rushed to the Jokihat referral hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. Jokihat police station SHO Vikas Kumar Azad said two of the accused -- Tupesh Yadav and Nitish Yadav — were arrested and sent to jail. “Raids are on to nab the other accused,” he said over the phone. Shoaib alleged that Ismael was caught by some people belonging to a particular community when he had gone to Yadav Tola of the village to fetch milk. The family started searching for him when he didn’t return home till late at night. Later, the family came to know that Ismael had been admitted to the hospital after being brutally beaten up by some co-villagers. “When I reached there, the hospital staff tinformed me that Ismael was dead,” he told the police. Araria Sadar SDPO Pushkar Kumar said Ismael had criminal antecedents. “He was earlier booked in a theft case,” he said. Earlier in Saharsa, a youth was lynched and another was seriously injured when committing theft in a grocery shop at Gandhi Path under Sadar police station area in the district on Saturday. Saharsa Sadar SDPO Santosh Kumar said raids were on to nab the people involved in thrashing the youth, leading to his death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-lynched-on-theft-suspicion-in-araria-2-held/articleshow/83931966.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||‘Any opposition alliance against PM won’t succeed’||PATNA: NDA partners BJP and JD(U) on Monday said the move by some opposition parties to form a national alliance against the saffron party would be “short-lived” and not succeed just like the previous such alliances. “The political parties which attended a recent meeting at the NCP leader Sharad Pawar’s residence neither have credibility nor have a reliable leader who can give a contest to a towering personality like PM Narendra Modi. Moreover, no senior leader attended that meeting. Only the second and third rank leaders of most of the parties were present,” senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi told TOI on Monday. SuMo also said some political parties used to hold such meetings to form alliances against the BJP in many states before the assembly elections. But they could not succeed because they neither have credibility among the masses nor any reliable leader. They are free to make alliances, but today opposition parties have no leader of Narendra Modi’s political stature, he said. “The current move of some opposition leaders to form an alliance against the BJP would not succeed, like the previous many such alliances against the saffron party. Their attempt is just like a ‘water bubble’, which can vanish anytime,” BJP’s state vice-president and former MLA Rajib Ranjan told TOI on Monday. Ranjan also said, “The opposition parties are trying to form an ‘opportunistic alliance’ with some of the leaders who believe in dynastic politics.” JD(U) national spokesperson K C Tyagi said, “We are currently with the NDA and we have no intention to go outside it. The current move to form an alliance at the national level has a ‘negative approach’ to unseat Narendra Modi from power.” Tyagi further said many such experiments were done by political parties earlier but they never succeeded because of their inner contradictions. “In 2015, even our CM Nitish Kumar made an all-out attempt to unite all six offshoots of erstwhile Janata Dal and form a grand ‘Janata Pariwar’. Many meetings were held; Mulayam Singh Yadav was elected as leader of the proposed ‘Janata Pariwar’ of six samajwadi parties. But later, everything fizzled out,” Tyagi told TOI. He also pointed out that in 1977 and 1989, there was a strong anti-Congress move across the country. The opposition parties got united and ousted the Congress from power. “But today, we don’t find any such anti-Modi wave,” Tyagi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/any-opposition-alliance-against-pm-wont-succeed/articleshow/83931842.cms||Madan Kumar

There were 3607 active cases on May 28 and the number on June 28 decreased to 311. There are only 30 containment zones in the district against 695 during the peak pandemic period. As per the state health department data, there were nearly 17,000 active cases in Patna in the beginning of May, which further went up to 22,734 on May 8. However the number on May 15 reduced to 15,864 active cases and further down to 2915 cases on May 29. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said there were only 32 micro containment zones now. He said even though more relaxations were being given, there has not been much increase in the number of new cases. “We are still testing nearly 5,000 people daily, including 2000 through RT-PCR,” said Singh. Slow relaxation has also given hope to businessmen, who were keeping their fingers crossed. “We cannot compare to pre-Covid times, but yes, with relaxations, there has been charm in the market. Wedding season is around and we expect to do some business,” said Maurya Lok Shopkeeper Association president Rajesh Kumar Dabloo. He said the government should continue with the awareness regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour and strictly deal with those violating the norms. “Now, instead of lockdown, stress should be on maintaining all the protocols,” added Dabloo. Raju Kumar, who works in a shoe showroom, said there was not much impact on the business even after relaxations. “Shops should be allowed to open on all days, instead of three days a week,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-records-10-times-fall-in-covid-cases-in-1-month/articleshow/83929179.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Hospitals across the state filled to brim with the sudden surge in the daily infection numbers. The positivity rate touched an all-time high of 25%, making the state buckle under the unprecedented proportions of transmission levels. The rural parts of the state quickly became the epicentre of the second wave, accounting for nearly 60% of the total cases reported from April. There were hardly a few hundred ICU and oxygen beds in the state with major cities like Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada running out of beds for several consecutive days in May. Patients waiting for beds while on supplemental oxygen support in ambulances became a common scene. However, things gradually improved over the last four weeks in the state. Covid-19 recoveries have continued to outnumber the new cases for the last 37 consecutive days in Andhra Pradesh. Since May 23, the state recorded about 3.2 lakh new Covid-19 cases and 4.9 lakh recoveries. Due to this, the active caseload dropped from the peak of about 2.1 lakh to the current 42,000 range. The recovery rate has now improved to 97% from the low of 84% in the first week of May. The state, which required about 650 metric tonnes of oxygen for several consecutive days in May, is currently drawing only about 180 tonnes a day. Even the 104 call centre is now receiving less than 1,000 calls a day from the peak of 15,000 to 18,000 calls a day during the peak of the second wave in May. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said that the Covid-19 situation has improved on all parameters in the state. “The weekly case positivity rate is less than 5% in eight districts. Even the disease epicentre East Godavari is making a gradual turnaround. Of the nearly 15,000 ward/village secretariats, there are less than five active Covid-19 cases in 12,545 secretariats,” said Singhal. Singhal added that the state is currently reporting about 4,000 daily cases from the peak of 24,000 cases in May. “The health department has identified 690 secretariats having more than 10 active cases. We have directed the district officials to closely monitor these secretariats,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/active-cases-fall-to-42k-from-a-peak-of-over-2l/articleshow/83933193.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

This is the lowest one-day case total in over 80 days after the state recorded 2,331 infections on April 7. The toll increased to 12,630 as 31 more patients succumbed to the pandemic. As many as 4,714 patients were declared cured. There are currently 42,252 active cases with 18,27,214 cumulative recoveries and 12,630 fatalities.

Andhra Pradesh tested 71,758 Covid-19 samples on Monday and detected 2,224 new cases, translating to a positivity rate of 3%. This is the lowest case positivity rate in the last three months. Meanwhile, a Covid-19 infection of Delta variant surfaced in Vizianagaram district on Monday. The district medical and health officer Dr SV Ramani Kumari said that the patient and her husband tested positive for the pandemic about a month ago. “We are sending some samples of Covid-19 positive cases to various labs for genome sequencing on a fortnightly basis. And in the recent batch of samples, it was found that the woman contracted the Delta variant of the virus. However, all other family members tested negative. There is no need to panic about it,” said Dr Kumari. Principal secretary, health and family welfare said that the health department has so far identified 3,364 mucormycosis (black fungus) cases in the state. “Surgeries were performed on 1,100 patients. There are currently 1,418 active black fungus cases in the state,” said Singhal.

The government will engage the services of 190 psychiatrists and 16 clinical psychologists who will provide counselling and clear people’s apprehensions surrounding Covid-19. The decision was taken at a review meeting on Covid-19 with officials at the chief minister’s camp office in Tadepalli on Monday. Covid-19 patients in particular, as well as people in general, continue to harbour a fear of the pandemic, officials told the chief minister. While medicine, oxygen and beds are available for Covid-19 patients, fear psychosis has caused some deaths in the state, which need to be addressed. This is possible through counselling, officials said. Officials further informed the chief minister that they would follow ICMR guidelines in providing counselling. This would be executed through the 104 toll free number, which is already providing consultation and assistance on the pandemic, officials said. The chief minister also reviewed the government’s preparedness for the impending third wave. The chief minister told officials to ready paediatric services in government hospitals as this wave is feared to target children. The officials told the chief minister that the government has engaged 150 paediatricians to provide services in the event of a third wave. The chief minister instructed that training be provided to paediatricians through experts from AIIMS and similar institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-to-start-counselling-services-for-covid-fears/articleshow/83933122.cms||Gopi Dara

The students of classes I and II can watch the channel from 3.05pm to 4pm and the pupils of classes III to V can do so between 4.05pm and 5pm every day. The state project director of the BEPC, Sanjay Kumar Singh, told this reporter that virtual lectures were already being telecast for the students of classes VI to XII between 9am and 12pm. “Of the 70 lakh students in these classes, around 20 lakh are being benefited from the lectures on DD Bihar,” he claimed. A decision to broadcast the virtual classes on DD Bihar was taken considering the fact that over 1.9 crore students study in government schools in Bihar. Of these, many cannot afford to buy smartphones for e-classes. “The special classes on DD Bihar will continue till the schools reopen,” Singh said and added, “We have also made arrangements for e-books, study materials and audio-visual classes on e-LOTS to ensure that the process of learning is not disturbed.” The BEPC director claimed that on average, 1.5 lakh students had used the e-LOTS app since its launch a month ago. “We expect the number of users to go up because the app will be beneficial for kids in the long run,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/e-classes-begin-on-dd-bihar-for-school-students/articleshow/83932649.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Jitan Ram Manjhi, Mukesh Sahani rubbish Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s claim||PATNA: It must be a great relief for the ruling NDA when two of its constituents — HAM(S) and VIP -- reiterated on Monday that there was no threat to the Nitish Kumar government as claimed by RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. Tejashwi, during a visit to his assembly constituency Raghopur in Vaishali on Saturday, had claimed that the Nitish government would fall in the next two-three months. JD(U) and BJP, the two major allies, reacted immediately, rubbishing Tejashwi's claims. On Monday, HAM(S) chief and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi said the NDA in Bihar was intact. Taking a swipe at Tejashwi, he said, “There will be no effect on the health of the NDA government in the state even if the Chirag Paswan led LJP faction joins hands with the RJD.” Manjhi was talking to the media in Delhi where he has gone for post-Covid infection check-up at Ganga Ram Hospital. “The HAM(S) is a part of the NDA in Bihar,” he said, adding that the LJP was no longer an ally of the NDA at the Centre after it contested the Bihar assembly elections on its own. Joining the chorus, VIP chief and animal husbandry and fisheries minister Mukesh Sahani said some people have the habit of daydreaming. “Let them do so. What’s harm in it if someone does so?” he said. Tejashwi’s elder brother and RJD MLA from Hasanpur, Tej Pratap Yadav, had called on Manjhi at his residence recently, giving rise to speculation that something was being cooked up in the state politics. Manjhi, however, had described it a personal visit. The unscheduled visit of Sahani to Manjhi's residence had also created ripples in political circles. Reacting to Tejashwi's claim, JD(U) parliamentary board president Upendra Kushwaha said the Nitish government would complete its full term. On the other hand, RJD MLA from Maner Bhai Virendra said if there is no weight in the leader of opposition’s claim, then why Kushwaha is so worried about it. “Agar yah sahi nahi hai to unko bechaini kyo hai (if it is not true, why is he so upset?” he asked. Chirag’s posters repose faith in PM: The Chirag Paswan led LJP faction on Monday put up posters in the state capital on Monday, reposing his faith in the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. The posters released by the party’s media cell in-charge Krishna Singh Kallu said, “Modi hai to mumkin hai. Bihar ki awam hin Hanuman ki shakti hai”. Meanwhile, senior party leaders led by state president of Chirag faction, Raju Tiwari, on Monday reviewed preparations for the proposed ‘ashrivad yatra’ and birth anniversary celebrations of LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan at Hajipur on July 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-sahani-rubbish-tejashwis-claim/articleshow/83932478.cms||Ramashankar

---||Patna||Tejashwi Prasad Yadav move for Congress may find few takers||PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s proposal that Congress should be the axis for the opposition to move around its fight against the BJP and PM Narendra Modi (NaMo) in the next general election sounds pragmatic, but is also fraught with practical political roadblocks, in and outside Bihar. One of the main roadblocks is the leadership issue in the opposition camp as the next Lok Sabha election, likely, will also be contested on who is an alternative to NaMo? Though many people feel it’s a premature move as much water will flow down the Ganges before the 2024 general election, the eight-party meeting called by NCP chief Sharad Pawar in Delhi last week was considered the first baby step towards finding an alternative to NaMo’s BJP. Pawar said Congress will be needed if any alternative alliance is to be formed. Shiv Sena also thinks that any opposition coalition sans Congress is impractical. Tejashwi, in an interview to PTI on Sunday, said Congress, and not any regional party, was in direct contest with BJP on more than 200 out of the 542 Lok Sabha seats. His father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad always favoured Congress as his coalition partner at the Centre but played a big brother’s role in Bihar. The political quagmire may persist with only small groups coming together in the name of a BJP alternative as there are strong regional satraps like Naveen Patnaik in Odisha, Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati in UP and others in the south India, who will not allow to share their electoral bread in the name of projecting Congress leadership (Rahul Gandhi) as an alternative to NaMo’s BJP. Congress, on the other hand, is also not going to concede much ground to them in the Lok Sabha election at the cost of contesting a smaller number of seats and accept the other group’s suzerainty. CPI-M state secretary Awadhesh Kumar said it would be too early to say anything without reaching an understanding. “Congress not only has to play an aggressive role in raising public issues but also should be seen taking initiative. Some people (read Pawar) see election only but the Congress, as national party, should launch a movement against the Centre’s wrong policies affecting the people at large. They are lacking it, badly,” he said. “See the success rate of Congress, which was given 75 seats to contest the Bihar assembly elections last year. Only 19 could win. First the opposition parties should come to one platform to fight for the people’s cause to win their confidence,” Awadhesh said. AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar, however, said in Patna on Monday that the Congress could not hit the streets on fuel price rise and other issues due to coronavirus-induced restrictions which the party did not want to violate. But the political move by Tejashwi is seen as a part of the RJD strategy to recover lost ground as the party had failed to open an account on the 40 Lok Sabha seats from Bihar in 2019, swept by the NDA comprising BJP, JD(U) and LJP that won 17, 16 and six seats respectively. As Congress, which won the only Lok Sabha seat (Kishanganj) from the opposition block in Bihar, is part of the RJD-led grand alliance with Left as new partners, Tejashwi wants Jamui MP Chirag Paswan by his side before the next election, especially after the split in his LJP with uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras leading a coup and becoming the LJP parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha. As LJP, under Chirag and his father Ram Vilas Paswan, had garnered 7.86% votes and won six out of six seats it had contested with BJP and JD(U), his switching over to the opposition camp is likely to benefit Tejashwi, who has planned to celebrate the LJP founder’s birthday on July 5, which is coincidentally the RJD foundation day, to eulogize and ‘lionize’ late Ram Vilas. Now that Ram Vilas is no more and BJP not likely to back NaMo’s self-proclaimed ‘Hanuman’ in his battle against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and his JD(U) as well as his own uncle and party’s five MPs to retain the legacy of his father, Chirag will certainly wait for the next Union cabinet expansion to see if Paras gets a berth before deciding his next move regarding switching allegiance. JD(U) national president RCP Singh does not see any political significance in Tejashwi’s offer to Chirag to join the opposition camp and said both have found a place in politics because of their families, unlike Ram Vilas, who had struggled to rise from the village level. Another important factor in Bihar, particularly its Seemanchal area, will be Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, which won 5 seats in the 2020 assembly election and is ready to contest at least 100 seats in the UP assembly election next year. Many political parties, even in Bihar, are averse to joining hands with them even though they have made significant inroads into the Muslim votes in that area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-move-for-congress-may-find-few-takers/articleshow/83931437.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

Talking to this reporter on Monday, education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said the process of creating new posts of headmasters in all the primary schools and making fresh appointments was underway. “The government is keen on bringing qualitative improvement in educational institutions by filling up the vacant posts of teachers and ensuring infrastructural development,” he added. The minister also pointed out that the government had decided to set up at least one +2 school in every panchayat with a view to promoting education, especially among girls, in rural areas. Meanwhile, the Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC) has constituted four committees that can suggest ways for bringing the much-needed reforms to ensure qualitative improvement in higher education. According to a notification issued by the education department on Monday, BSHEC’s vice-chairman, Kameshwar Jha, has been authorized to coordinate the activities of the committees and ensure implementation of their recommendations. Jha said, “These include the academic reforms committee, NAAC committee, quality assurance committee and National Education Policy (NEP) committee. The panels consist of vice-chancellors, senior academics and experts, who will give valuable inputs for getting the derailed system back on track.” The academic reforms committee will help prepare the state’s higher education plan and provide inputs to the council for smooth functioning of universities and research institutions. It will also undertake a comprehensive study on the state’s higher education system and submit an annual report for its improvement. Besides, it will suggest measures for implementation of the semester and choice-based credit systems. The NAAC committee will assess the baseline of all the institutions of higher education in the state and ensure their assessment and accreditation. The quality assurance committee, on the other hand, will suggest steps for stimulating the academic environment for improvement in learning and research. The fourth committee will suggest policy measures and prepare the road map for implementation of the NEP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/all-schools-to-have-headmasters-soon-education-minister/articleshow/83931380.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Congress flays government over Covid death data, inflation and fuel price hike||PATNA: Congress national general secretary Tariq Anwar on Monday hit out at the Centre and the state government over discrepancies in Covid death data. He also raised the issue of inflation and rising fuel prices. While addressing the media at state Congress headquarters, Anwar said there was a huge difference in the death figures given by various agencies, foreign media and the Union government. “A foreign media stated that 42 lakh died. Some say it was ten times more than what the government’s figures. Still, the central government has not come up with any explanation to satisfy the common people,” he said and repeated the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s demand for a white paper on the issue. He also criticized the Centre for submitting an affidavit in the Supreme Court stating reasons for not being able to pay Rs4 lakh compensation to the families of Covid victims. “For them, the Central Vista project worth Rs20,000 crore is more important than spending Rs16,000 crore to help to the families of Covid victims,” Anwar said. He also raised the issue of high petrol, diesel, edible oil and cooking gas prices, saying common man was facing the brunt of inflation in the country. He mocked the BJP leaders for protesting during Congress’s regime and now remaining quiet over the issue. “But now when the crude oil price is lower in international market, the price of petrol and diesel is being increased in India daily. Our economy is in bad shape and GDP is even lower than smaller neigbouring countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka,” he said. However, state BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel hit back at Anwar saying the NDA government was focusing on controlling the Covid-19 and vaccinating the maximum number of people. “Let them count the number of infection and deaths, our prime focus is to get people vaccinated and we have targeted to vaccinate at least 70 to 80% of the beneficiaries across the country in the next six months,” said Patel. He further said the NDA government was also working on producing an alternative to petrol and diesel so that import of crude oil is reduced. Patel cited the increase in the prices of crude oil in the international market as the reason behind hike in the fuel prices in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/congress-flays-govt-over-covid-death-data-inflation-and-fuel-price-hike/articleshow/83929688.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Patna: 5-10% increase in prices of essential items defies logic||PATNA: A strange irony defying the price fixation mechanism based on the supply and demand economic theory haunts the consumers at Patna, or in any other town and village in the state, as the demand for food and other daily-use items has shrunk, but their prices have been rising dramatically in the range of 5 to 10% in the last one fortnight. Seemingly, everyone is hell-bent on making profit on the available demand. On Monday morning, a housewife Anita (name changed) in village Chandwa in Falka block of Katihar district said on phone that she was surprised when the milkman who also brings her daily-use items from the shop his son runs in his village told her that the price of detergent she uses has increased by Rs5. “No, I have not increased it. The increase shows in the marked price on the packet,” he said, when her expression changed to shock. She had cut the quantity of daily-use items her family consumed to adjust with the rising prices of commodities. Uday, a retail general store owner in the S K Nagar of Patna, that has a mixed population of upper, middle and lower-middle classes, said, “What can I say. Even we don’t understand it. We know that prices of commodities should fall, when the demand falls. But the opposite is happening. The demand has fallen, but their prices have increased by 5 to 10%.” The price movement of a branded cooking mustard oil is a case in point. It was selling at Rs210 per litre with Rs13 more than the market price due to short supply during the lockdown. A fortnight later, the price has fallen to Rs177 per litre, but it has been selling at Rs190/litre. “They say the prices of mustard oil have fallen substantially! Earlier, the price was Rs170/litre,” Uday said. He added: “In fact, consumers are not coming in large numbers, nor are they purchasing items in large volumes. They have cut down their consumption. It is the general pattern. The demand of food and other items has fallen, but the prices have increased. Everyone from the producer down to the retailer is making profit on the limited available demand of the items – what else can one say?” It is learnt that the prices of all brands of biscuits have increased by Rs5/packet, that of detergents by 4 to 5%, of packaged tea by 5%, of toothpaste by 5%, of refined oil-based items (like mixture and other such items) by 10% and cosmetics by 5-7%, and so on. Similarly, among staple food items, rice is selling in the range of Rs25 to Rs50/kg. The prices of packed flour and pulses have also increased by Rs2-4/kg in the last one fortnight. At Patna, due to the high transportation costs amid the rise in the prices of petrol diesel, potato is selling at Rs30/kg and onion at Rs30-35/kg. On the other hand, floods and rain have sent the prices of green vegetables skyrocketing, with ‘parwal’, brinjal and ‘nenua’ selling at Rs60/kg. The autorickshaw owners who earlier used to charge Rs350-380 per trip to bring items from the mandis are now charging Rs400-450. The owners and workers in shops selling clothes, ready-made fabrics or even jewels have to sit idle, waiting for the customers. “The marriage season is around, but the customers are not coming to these shops,” Gopal from Islampur in Nalanda district said. “All this is due to the combined impact of Covid-19, increase in the price of diesel-petrol, loss of jobs and consequent fall in the purchasing power of people,” Gopal said, adding: “The little that the governments, central or state, can do is to cut down the taxes on petrol and diesel and create more stable work opportunities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/5-10-increase-in-prices-of-essential-items-defies-logic/articleshow/83929579.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||No Delta+ case in Bihar, but we need to be alert: Experts||PATNA: As the state is returning to normalcy after the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, some health experts fear that its new Delta-plus variant might dodge immunities and trigger the third wave, if the people failed to follow the coronavirus appropriate behaviour. The cases of Delta-plus variant have recently been found in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Rajasthan. Epidemiologist at IGIMS, Dr Varsha Singh, told this newspaper on Sunday that no vaccine is 100% effective in preventing the virus. So, few people may be reinfected by the Delta-plus variant. “It is important to vaccinate everyone as the vaccine may reduce the severity of the infection in most of the cases, but in a few cases, we may see severity and complications as well. During the second wave, most of the aged population were vaccinated and escaped the infection while the young were vulnerable as they were not vaccinated,” she said and added: “We are little more cautious and prepared this time. The mass vaccination is going on which may create a barrier in virus transmission. But everyone, vaccinated or not, should follow the Covid protocols,” she said. Dr A K Ashu, joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), said there were so many Covid variants and a few of them, including the Delta-plus, are a matter of concern because of its high transmission rate. He said the Alpha variant requires 10-15 minutes to infect a person, but the new variant requires only 5-6 seconds in transmitting the virus. “The Delta-plus variant is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant, which had created havoc in the second wave. So, it is important to be more cautious than to let it spread further be uncontainable,” Dr Ashu said, adding that people need to stick to the Covid-19 safety protocols. Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, nodal officer for Covid-19 at NMCH, said, “The RMRI-Patna is conducting a study and has collected a few samples from the other districts and sent to Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) at Bhubaneswar for test. The result may come by next week. Based on that report, we will be able to predict about the situation in Bihar,” he said. “During the meeting with the RMRI-Patna officials on Saturday, we raised questions about preparations for the next wave, the Delta-plus variant, the patients who are vaccinated but reinfected by the Covid. We are waiting for the report whether the antibody which we are testing has got the absolute specificity that a patient has got full immunity, so s/he may not be infected or will be infected with the other variants. We have to know the status of variants in more specific way,” Dr Sinha said. Former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics-Bihar, Dr Arun Shah said if the new variant escapes the immune response generated by the vaccine and natural infection, then it would be disastrous. “It is still unknown whether the transmission capabilities of Delta-plus is more than the other variants and the neutralising effect on the Covid-19 vaccines. If the variant is able to escape the immunity, the vulnerability of the patients would be high. Abroad, it was proved that the new variant is more aggressive than the previous one,” Dr Shah said. “No vaccine is 100% effective. If a person has taken both the doses, they are susceptible to reinfection only on the efficacy, response of the immune system, comorbid conditions and viral load (determinant of severity and fatality),” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-delta-case-in-state-but-we-need-to-be-alert-experts/articleshow/83929285.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||After decline in Covid-19 cases, black fungus also on the wane||PATNA: After sustained decline in the number of Covid-19 cases, the state has also observed significant fall in the cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) in the past two weeks. At AIIMS-Patna, the number of admissions of mucor patients in the OPD has declined by 60%, compared to the third week of May, said Dr Kranti Bhawna, additional professor and head of ENT department. She said, on an average, 13-14 patients seeking treatment of black fungus infection were coming to the facility daily, but now the figure has come down to 4-5 in the past few weeks. Presently, 94 patients were undergoing treatment in the mucormycosis ward while 199 such patients had been admitted since first week of May. So far 68 patients were discharged and 30 succumbed to the infection. AIIMS-P nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said all those Covid patients who were treated during April and May were diagnosed with black fungus. “The mucor infection was momentary,” he said. The situation was similar at other health facilities. IGIMS-Patna has also seen a declining trend in mucor cases. “The infection rate was high till June first week and many infected patients were coming from various parts of the state for treatment. Now, this figure has come down. At present, 108 patients are undergoing treatment while 215 were admitted so far,” its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said. PMCH nodal officer for mucormycosis, Dr Shaheen Zafar, said no new black fungus patient was admitted in the last 3-4 days. Though around 14 patients were admitted in May. “Earlier, the rate of fungal infection was high. But after the fall in Covid-19 cases, the number of mucor cases also declined,” he said. PMCH has so far admitted 87 mucor patients, of which 65 were discharged and eight died. The hospital claims to have enough vials of Amphotericin B injections for the treatment of black fungus. Twenty-seven cases of black fungus were reported in NMCH-Patna. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, NMCH nodal officer for Covid-19, said six patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital. “As many as 20 patients have been discharged so far and one died,” he said, adding that patients were recovering fast as they had come at the initial stages of infection. The private health facilities also reported decline in black fungus cases. At Paras HMRI Hospital, the number of patients admitted has reduced to three as 21 had been discharged and two died, regional director (east) Dr Talat Halim said. “Initially, two patients died of black fungus as the infection had travelled to their brains,” he said. At Ruban Memorial Hospital, 15 mucor patients had been admitted and three of them died while the remaining recovered. According to hospital’s managing director Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, no patient was undergoing treatment for black fungus at the facility. Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital had admitted two mucor patients while Anugraha Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMMCH) at Gaya referred one patient to Patna. Its superintendent Dr Harish Chandra Hari said two patients were treated at the hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/after-decline-in-covid-19-cases-black-fungus-also-on-the-wane/articleshow/83929206.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||100% vaccination by December 31, says Bihar minister||PATNA: State health minister Mangal Pandey on Monday said the target is to immunise all 18+ population against the Covid 19 by December 31. He said a special drive of ‘six crore in six months’ to be effectively launched from July 1 in all districts is aimed at achieving the target of immunisation of the remaining people by the year-end. The entire road map of the drive has been worked out and vaccines have been arranged for that. “The state has to immunise about 7.22 crore people above 18 years age groups of which about 1.38 crore have already been vaccinated and the remaining about six crore would be covered by December 31,” said Pandey. The minister said immunisation is the the first priority of the state government with a view to save its people from any further wave or infection by new any variant of the Covid virus. The health department has sent samples of some Covid patients for confirmation of the strain, specially the Delta plus variant of the virus, to a Bhubaneswar-based lab and their reports were awaited, he said. Pandey appreciated the East Champaran district administration for achieving total immunisation of 18+ people in its Bankatwa block. He said Bankatwa thus emerged as the first block in Bihar with total immunisation of 18+ population. Pandey said special drive launched by the Patna district administration in different rural areas was also getting good response. All other districts were also carrying out the immunisation drive to achieve the target.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/100-vaccination-by-dec-31-says-minister/articleshow/83929127.cms||VK Tripathi

Addressing RJD legislators at a meeting, Tejashwi said he had written a letter to the CM to allow him to go to the people, but he did not get permission. He said Nitish would have got him trapped in cases had he violated the norms and moved out in the public. He then cited the examples for earlier occasions in which FIR was lodged against him for protesting with common people. The meeting was held to discuss the preparations for party's silver jubilee celebrations scheduled on July 5. Sources said the party will be preparing for a yearlong programme as a part of the silver jubilee celebrations and will focus on cornering the Nitish government. Party MLAs also demanded a physical presence of RJD chief Lalu Prasad in the foundation day programme. Tejashwi has assured him that if doctors permit, the party supremo will come to Patna or will address virtually from Delhi. RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said Tejashwi has also asked his partymen to be ready for any consequences and be there in the field. “Our leader has already said this government will not survive for long. We all have been instructed to be ready to form a new government. After monsoon, there will be a big change in political scenario,” said Tiwari.

---||Business||Future workplace will be WFH-office hybrid||Mumbai: The pickup in the Covid vaccination drive has encouraged several organisations to raise queries with consultants on whether the process of returning to office can begin. However, what’s increasingly becoming clear — and large companies are setting an example — is that a ‘hybrid’ workplace is going to be the way forward. What set the tone of this trend is a LinkedIn post by Unilever CHRO Leena Nair, where she said, “For all the sadness the pandemic has brought and is still bringing, one thing I hope we can take from this is the flexibility it has brought to businesses and to people. It would be dreadful to return to the way so many of us were working — 40-hour weeks, long commutes.” Nair said businesses have an opportunity to change for the better, adding that, while Unilever already had flexible and agile working practices, the organisation is embracing that even more. “We’re still developing our plan, but one thing is certain: Things will never go back to the way they were before 2020,” said Nair. PepsiCo recently announced its global shift in workplace policy for corporate associates under ‘Work that Works’. Under the new policy, there will be no default day-to-day workplace for employees in headquarter locations, and associates along with their managers can choose what work can be done remotely and what needs to be done in their office. Citing studies, PepsiCo said employers who offer flexible work see a 15% increase in productivity, 31% less absenteeism and 10% less turnover. PepsiCo India CHRO Pavitra Singh told TOI, “In the past, employers had doubts about it as there was fear of productivity being impacted. However, that myth is completely busted now. It seems to be a great step forward and the current situation has been instrumental in changing the mindset. Today, people seem to be more convinced naturally of the advantages of a hybrid way of working.” Singh said employees love the flexibility but miss the connect and camaraderie at the same time. They would prefer coming to office a few days a week, as it also gives them a break from the usual scenario and an opportunity to meet their friends and colleagues. “If we look at this model through an employers’ lens, output is being delivered and, in fact, productivity levels have increased now. Therefore, the hybrid model is a win-win situation that provides flexibility to our employees. I feel that it is here to stay, given that employees have had an experience of how it works and seem to like it as well. We need to understand that employers don’t want to compromise on innovation, creative thinking and happiness of the employees and this is where a hybrid model plays an integral role as it helps to create, collaborate, connect, and celebrate,” said Singh. Nishith Desai Associates head (HR laws) Vikram Shroff said as the second wave subsides, employers are looking to gradually restart offices. He said a hybrid approach to working from office is already on the cards, with staggered timings, alternate days, flexi-hours, and the like. “We are seeing a phase-wise approach with front desk employees and key managerial staff being required to resume office initially. From a duty of care perspective, some employers may prefer vaccinated employees to return to office first. In any case, employees will need to follow the standard operating procedures to help reduce Covid risk,” said Shroff. He also added that since the government has announced that vaccination is voluntary, employers may not be able to mandate employees to get vaccinated, irrespective of whether the vaccination drive is coordinated or sponsored by the employer. “The Meghalaya high court recently held that forcing vaccination is a violation of fundamental right. I expect other courts to come up with similar judgments in due course,” said Shroff. In a note to employees on Friday, KPMG India said it plans to reopen its offices in all locations from September 1 this year, subject to central and state government guidelines on the Covid situation. KPMG expects most of its colleagues to be fully vaccinated by August-end. Arjun Vaidyanathan, COO of KPMG in India, said, “We will most probably follow a hybrid model once we reopen. Details will get firmed up closer to the reopening date and the government norms then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/future-workplace-will-be-wfh-office-hybrid/articleshow/83936981.cms||Namrata Singh

Refusing to comment on the controversy over Revanth’s appointment, incumbent TPCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Monday told reporters that he is willing to abide by the party high command’s decision irrespective of him having a post or not. He refused to comment on the issue of party MP K Venkat Reddy opposing the new appointment but added that “there are many activists in the party who sold their properties for the sake of the party and everyone must be given an opportunity.” Expressing gratitude over being given an opportunity to serve as PCC president, he said that he will work towards getting the Congress back in power in the next elections. Meanwhile, Revanth Reddy met several senior party leaders. Important among them was party veteran V Hanumanth Rao who is currently in hospital for a kidney-related ailment. While a few Congress leaders including MLA Sitakka celebrated Revanth’s appointment, Revanth spoke to several other party leaders over the phone on Monday. TPPC vice-president Mallu Ravi hosted a tea party for Revanth along with former deputy chief minister Damodar Raja Narasimha. Moreover, it is being speculated that TRS leader Gandra Satyanarayana, who is close to Revanth, will soon join Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dissent-over-revanth-appointment-ebbs/articleshow/83935820.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Calling the attackers “BJP goons”, Sisodia claimed that they were opposing the construction of the school. Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, however, alleged that BJP workers led by Rohtas Nagar MLA Jitender Mahajan were trying to submit a memorandum to Sisodia when they were attacked by AAP workers at the deputy CM’s behest. Sisodia and PWD minister Satyendar Jain inspected under construction schools at Babarpur, Karawal Nagar, Rohtas Nagar and Gokalpur on Tuesday. “BJP functionaries and goons protesting construction of a school at Rohtas Nagar ransacked the premises, vandalised my official vehicle and misbehaved with female teachers, engineers and workers. Why are the BJP functionaries so irritated with education and construction of schools?” the deputy CM tweeted in Hindi. Jain tweeted that even if BJP took all efforts to stop them, they would continue to serve people. “Even if BJP carries out thousands of such attacks, the AAP government will continue to serve people,” he stated. Bidhuri claimed, “Mahajan had conveyed to the authorities in advance that during the deputy CM’s visit he would like to submit a memorandum to him. The memorandum pertained to the termination of services of guest teachers and non-payment of salaries to teachers. In addition to this, the document also stated that all people who had died because of oxygen shortage should be given Rs 10 lakh compensation and a government job.” “Many BJP workers got injured after being beaten up. Violence has no place in society. It does not behove of the deputy CM to use intemperate language and provoke an attack on the BJP cadres. BJP will lodge a police complaint against the attack. A delegation will soon meet the Delhi Police commissioner and urge him to fast-track investigation into the matter and punish the culprits,” said Bidhuri. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that no BJP worker barged into the school premises and no staffers or labourers were attacked as claimed by Sisodia. “A group of BJP workers only raised slogans when Sisodia refused to meet them,” he added. Police said they had received a complaint and were examining its contents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-claims-bjp-workers-vandalised-official-vehicle/articleshow/83968265.cms||---
---||Business||Top tier IT cos likely to accelerate revenue growth in April-June||Chennai: A rise in overall IT spending post the pandemic and digital transformation opportunities for Indian IT, especially in the outsourcing segment, has set the tone for a standout earnings season in the April-June quarter. Industry trackers expect top tier IT services companies to accelerate the growth momentum and post revenue growth in double digits. Analysts tracking the sector believe that global IT giant Accenture’s stand-out performance last week further reaffirms the view that large IT companies are likely to beat street estimates in April-June with healthy deal wins. But the sector needs to keep a check on rising attrition and employee costs, both of which are likely to put a pressure on profitability, they added. There is a broad-based demand uptick and sustained growth momentum in revenue/order booking of IT outsourcing business in the market, and that bodes well for Indian IT peers, analysts at Emkay Global said. The Nifty IT index rose around 90% in the last twelve months vs 53% rise in the Nifty index, the firm noted. “Accenture’s strong FY21 revenue number indicates the street’s expectations of mid-teen growth for Tier-1 India heritage players — TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech — in FY22 is not misplaced. We are expecting the trio to deliver 13-15% USD growth in FY22,” analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, said in a note. Accenture posted a 16% revenue growth for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 ended May 2021 (Accenture follows a Sept-Aug financial year) beating its top-end of guidance by 3%. It also raised its outlook for the entire fiscal. The research team at Motilal Oswal said there is a strong demand situation, driven by pandemic’s push on digital transformation, and this will reflect in earnings of Indian IT majors. “Strong growth and higher book-to-bill ratio in the outsourcing business (1.2x) (of Accenture) resonates well for Indian IT,” the firm added. However, analysts also cautioned that supply pressures were ramping up in the sector. Anticipating Indian IT firms to post robust growth rates, Prashant Shukla, vice president of Everest Group, said the war for talent in the Indian IT services industry was real and could play spoilsport . “Accenture’s attrition rate jumped from 12% to pre-pandemic levels of 17%. We see similar challenges for Indian IT service providers, which can impact their position to gain from this current demand wave,” he said.“We expect IT exports out of India to grow in healthy double digit in FY2022 and close to double digits in the subsequent years helped by accelerated digital shift and core transformation spends,” Kawaljeet Saluja and Sathishkumar S, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, said. While top tier players have the capability to manage talent demand, mid-tier companies may be vulnerable, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/top-tier-it-cos-likely-to-accelerate-revenue-growth-in-april-june/articleshow/83933182.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Kolkata||Don’t drop your mask yet, societies tell residents||Kolkata: Emboldened by the fact that they are vaccinated, many residents of housing complexes have started taking it easy with their masks in the common areas. Residents’ welfare associations across the city have received complaints and have started taking action, determined not to let this become a habit. South City Residency, one of the largest in the city, has started imposing a fine of Rs 100 on defaulters and has asked the security and other facility management staff to keep a strict vigil. There are some societies where such defaulters are being photographed and made to feel “special” before being requested to put on the masks. “Though people are largely conscious, there are defaulters and we cannot take any risk now that we have achieved a ‘Covid free’ status here. Whether you are vaccinated or not, you have to wear the mask at all times in the common areas. We have imposed a fine of Rs 100 on all defaulters and people have taken it in the right spirit. Security guards have been instructed to follow this rule,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of South City Residency. Two other housing complexes — Urbana and Greenfield City — have taken to “Gandhigiri” instead. “We are photographing those who are without masks and then politely asking them to wear them,” said S Ramani, the treasurer of the association at Urbana. “To drive home the point further, we are giving out free masks to defaulters after photographing them,” said Saurav Chandra, chairman of the Greenfield Foundation that has 4,066 flats and has held eight vaccination camps in a row, inoculating over 1,600 residents and staffers. Some complexes, like Silver Spring, said they have not named-and-shamed anyone yet, but have kept the option open. “We have empowered our security guards to approach anyone without a mask in the common areas and ask them to put one on. They are sending a list of habitual offenders to the board, which is then holding separate conversations with defaulters,” said Indranil Chowdhury, secretary of the association. The portfolio holders of the RWA at Upohar are also meeting those caught without masks personally and “engaging them in conversations”. “We haven’t imposed fines on anyone yet,” said vice-president of Upohar Utsav Committee Sudeep Ganguly. In other complexes, like Siddha Pines, each tower has a block representative who has started talking to the defaulters and is keeping note of whether they are habitual offenders. “We are regularly sending messages in the common WhatsApp group and have clearly told the security personnel to keep us informed about habitual offenders,” said Manav Mehra, president of the association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dont-drop-your-mask-yet-societies-tell-residents/articleshow/83933270.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Consent form must for black fungus op||Kolkata: In the backdrop of an increasing number of mucormycosis (black fungus) cases, the state health department has come up with a standard consent form that needs to be taken from the patient or their kin before surgery. According to the expert committee formed by the state, patients need to undergo debridement surgeries over the head and facial region. Even if the surgery is successful, patients could often be disfigured. Hence, the panel felt the need for informed consent. “The surgeries are often mutilating and the patient and family should be given the right kind of information before the procedure so they can make an informed decision,” said Monoj Mukherjee, ENT head, Bankura Sammilani Medical College. Sixty-six cases of murcormycosis have been confirmed in the state so far, along with 166 suspected cases. While 16 among the confirmed cases have died, 38 among the suspected have succumbed. “Early diagnosis is very important as the disease can progress fast and prove fatal. It has a high fatality rate. We have a sizeable number of patients,” said neurologist Bimal Kanti Roy of Bangur Institute of Neurosciences, which is part of Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research. The informed consent form says the patient must be explained the risks involved in the surgery, the expected outcome and likeliness of the procedure being successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/consent-form-must-for-black-fungus-op/articleshow/83933392.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Business||Govt plans nat’l stockpile of life-saving drugs||Mumbai: The government is in discussions with the pharma and medical devices industry to create a “national stockpile” of life-saving drugs and vital equipment to combat the third Covid wave. This could prevent the massive shortages of critical drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, key antibiotics, and devices like oxygenators and pulse oximeters, as witnessed during the brutal second wave with a huge daily case-load. At present, the government is undertaking only a weekly review of the status of drugs’ availability, and is tracking manufacturing of the black fungus drug, Amphotericin B. For medical devices, a taskforce has been formed under the department of pharmaceuticals, which will shortlist critical items and seek advice from stakeholders, industry experts told TOI. The stockpile will help companies to plan and manage inventory to strengthen supply chains and resolve glitches in manufacturing of raw materials (active pharmaceutical ingredients), and finished formulations (drugs). “Strategic stockpiling of critical Covid drugs, oxygen and other Covid requirements is critical, based on our learning of Covid 2.0. Centre and state governments are working on the same. We need to be prepared so that we are not caught off guard this time around. Companies are working on their production cycle and inventory management so that there is a faster turnaround of critical drugs in case of an emergency. Manufacturing and supply chain agility has been important and will continue to be important in the unpredictable environment on account of Covid,” Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance secretary general Sudarshan Jain told TOI. Besides the two antivirals, antibiotics like Azithromycin and Doxycycline, and steroids including dexamethasone, there is need to stockpile critical medical aids like nasal cannulas, oxygen regulator and humidifiers, ICU beds and multi-parameter patient monitors. “It’s good that some state governments are shoring up inventory of essential Covid-related medical devices in anticipation of a third wave. We have recommended to the Centre to consider creating a stockpile of 25-30% of annual national demand, and warehouse it in the four geographical zones. These should be particularly the ones which have limited domestic and international availability, and need longer lead times. Most countries like the US create these as part of disaster management,” stated Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator at AiMeD, an umbrella association of domestic manufacturers of med devices. Experts believe that a third wave may hit the country over the next few months, fuelled by the emergence of the Delta-plus variant. The second wave during March-May saw an unprecedented increase in the daily case-load from just around 10,000 in February to nearly 4 lakh in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-plans-natl-stockpile-of-life-saving-drugs/articleshow/83936675.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||Business||Faster growth in broadband users||Chennai: The pandemic has given the fixed-line broadband industry a boost as ‘everything from home’ and mobile data limitations makes people opt for reliability and speed offered by such internet connections.Data from telecom regulator Trai shows that the number of new wired broadband connections grew 2% on average every month since July 2020, compared to just 0.5% before the pandemic. As of March 2021, there were 22.8 million wired broadband connections in India and the growth rate in March was around 2.2%, according to the data. Analysts said in a hybrid work future, wired internet connections are going to be on a par with basic utilities. An average urban household has 5-6 smart devices running concurrently making fixed broadband essential, they said. Apart from metro cities, broadband providers have all also made inroads into tier-2 locations like Jaipur, Varanasi, Vijayawada, Mangalore and Coimbatore. Airtel Xstream Fiber’s customer base grew 27% during fiscal year 2021 to cross three-million mark, the company said. Airtel’s fibre connection is available in over 200 cities.“The capex for the fiscal year was Rs 1,100 crore, up 89% year-on-year,” an Airtel spokesperson said. Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani noted in the company’s AGM last week that the despite pace of deployment slowing due to the lockdowns, JioFiber acquired more than two million new premises in the previous year, and data consumption on the network has grown to more than 3.5 times compared to a year ago. A spokesperson for ACT Fibernet said the company has seen a “massive spike” in data usage and new connections across geographies in the last 15-18 months. The company said it has around 1.8 million broadband subscribers as of March 2021. Internet service provider Excitel said new connections grew around 65% in the last 12-15 months. In the past 12 months, there has been around 60% growth in our revenue as well. The company has invested around Rs 150 crore in the last one year with the bulk of money spent in creating last mile infra,” Vivek Raina, co-founder and CEO, Excitel Broadband, said.However, industry estimates peg the teledensity of wired broadband in India at only 1.5% compared to advanced tech nations like Japan (50%), China (14%) and the US (30%). A key constraint to achieve scale is the capital and labour intensive process of laying fibre optic cables, and the levels of bureaucracy involved in this task.Industry body Broadband India Forum president T V Ramachandran said processes and permissions to ramp up fibre optic infrastructure and cover more ground should be made simpler for the industry. “Increasing penetration of wired broadband is also important to make the 4G experience on mobiles better as it frees up internet traffic on mobile networks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/faster-growth-in-broadband-users/articleshow/83933589.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

In fact, the state has so far recorded only 26 days since the first two cases of Covid-19 were reported on March 19 last year when the daily tally was below 100. An analysis of the cases reveals that the daily tally was below 100 the last time on April 14 with 78 positive cases. With the addition of 96 new infections, Gujarat’s caseload went up to 8,23,340 on Monday while the death toll rose to 10,054, the state health department bulletin said. At the same time, 315 patients were discharged during the day, raising the count of recoveries to 8,09,821 so far, leaving the state with 3,465 active cases, it said. Gujarat’s case recovery rate has improved further to 98.36%, the department said in a release. Ahmedabad district reported the highest number of new cases at 21, followed by Vadodara with 16, Surat with 14, and Rajkot with 9. Ahmedabad city, Chhota Udepur and Tapi districts reported one Covid-19 fatality each. A total of 2,49,125 people were inoculated against Covid-19 on Monday, which raised the tally of administered vaccine doses in Gujarat to 2,51,28,252, the department said. City-based doctors said that the drop in cases is encouraging, and it’s an opportunity for the state and the city to ensure that the third wave is thwarted or delayed. “We saw crowding at almost all the public places on Sunday and social distancing and mask protocols went for a toss,” said Dr Pragnesh Vaccharajani, secretary of Ahmedabad Family Physicians’ Association. “It’s a great chance for us all to ensure that we don’t contribute to the cases further.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-covid-century-daily-cases-at-96/articleshow/83935869.cms||---

Ward coordinator Tulsi Sinha Roy, who is also a member of the BMC board of administrators, said samples were collected from 56 residents living near the micro containment zone. “The tests were done to check whether anyone of them are affected by Covid and are asymptomatic,” Roy said. Civic officials said if anyone is found to be Covid positive, he or she will be able to be self isolated, minimising the possibility of infecting others. Roy added that if any resident of the housing estate is yet to get vaccinated, the authorities will arrange for them to get inoculated at the earliest. A micro containment zone was set up on a lane at D Block on Saturday night after four persons from one of the stand-alone buildings were diagnosed with Covid. The police have set up a barricade and residents falling within the micro containment zone are keeping in touch with cops and civic authorities for their requirements. The civic body is also conducting sanitisation drives in the locality. “The civic authorities conducted a Covid test for us on Monday and have been taking all necessary measures. I am yet to get my result. I had been affected by Covid earlier this year,” said Avijit Chakraborty, a resident of the housing. “A Covid test was conducted by the ward committee and we have been taking all necessary measures, including sanitisation, inside the housing estate. A Covid help desk has also been set up for the residents,” said Laboni Housing Estate secretary Sumit Sarkar. At present, there are three micro containment zones in Salt Lake — one at Laboni Housing Estate and two in BF Block. There are eight other micro containment zones that have been set up in other localities within the BMC area, including in Kestopur, Raghunathpur, Jyanga Hatiara and Jhawtola.

---||Patna||IMD: Bihar receives 128% excess rainfall this month||PATNA: The comparatively sluggish advancement of monsoon current over north-west India is apparently proving to be a boon in disguise for rainfall in Bihar and adjoining areas in eastern parts of the country. While the south-west monsoon is still to enter Delhi, Punjab and Chandigarh, it entered Bihar through Purnia on June 12, a day before its scheduled onset day. Bihar has received 327.6mm rainfall from June 1 till 28, whereas the normal rainfall for the same period is 143.9mm, leading to an excess of 128% rainfall till date and is enhanced rainfall activity is likely to continue till July 2. India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated on Monday that moist easterly winds are likely to pick up in strength, causing enhanced rainfall activity along the Himalayan foothills of north Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand around July 1 and 2. Accordingly, isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely over Bihar during the two days. Sanjay Kumar, meteorologist at Patna meteorological centre, said, “As the monsoon has not been progressing in north-west India for over a week now, its current in eastern parts of the country has been comparatively stronger. The rainfall in Bihar has been supported by several other factors, including favourable position of monsoon trough line, frequent formation of cyclonic circulation and moisture-containing easterly winds blowing in the region,” Sanjay told TOI. He added that Patna has received perhaps the highest rainfall in the month of June this year after 2000. The meteorologist further said the intensity of rainfall in Bihar reduced on Monday owing to dry westerly winds in the lower level of atmosphere. “Subdued rainfall is expected in the state on Tuesday as well, but its intensity is likely to increase on Wednesday, especially in the northern parts of the state. Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall is expected on Thursday and Friday,” Sanjay said. The IMD has further predicted moderate thunderstorms accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning over east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh during the next five days. The IMD has also issued yellow code warning for thundershowers with lightning in Bihar for Tuesday and Wednesday and escalated it to orange-code warning for Thursday and Friday. The weathermen also predicted unfavourable conditions to develop for further advance of south-west monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west UP, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during the next six-seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/imd-bihar-receives-128-excess-rainfall-this-month/articleshow/83932564.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Goons fire at police team, assault cop in Ekbalpore||KOLKATA: A constable was allegedly assaulted and a police team reportedly fired upon after they tried to stop a clash between two groups of local criminals on Dr Sudhir Bose Road in Ekbalpore in the early hours of Sunday. While constable Sanjay Panda from Ekbalpore police is recovering, cops have so far nabbed five persons. A case has been initiated under attempt to murder, obstructing a public servant and rioting, along with other sections. Main accused Idly Vicky is absconding. A live cartridge and an empty cartridge of 7mm pistol were seized. Cops said the clash was a result of an ongoing gang war over control of the area after a few youths from one group switched their loyalties. Both groups, who have local political clout, had been at loggerheads for the past four months and have various cases registered against them in the Port area. Around 2.05am on Sunday, two groups involving around 20-25 people clashed with each other. Most carried hockey sticks and rods, and a few reportedly also carried other weapons. One group was led by Idly Vicky alias Zahid Hossain, who has an arms case against him, and the other was led by Imran and Tanveer Alam, who are working under a local influential person after the elections and are trying to reportedly enter Vicky’s territory. Sources said there had been attempts in the area to mediate between them, but all efforts had failed. “There was a severe altercation, followed by a brawl. When cops arrived, Vicky’s gang attacked them. Vicky opened fire at the cops while they were trying to pacify both sides. Panda was assaulted even though the bullet missed him,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. On the basis of a suo motu complaint by Panda, a case was registered against Vicky and 21 others.

As the Mahavihara is the main attraction for foreign as well as the domestic tourists, footfall in Bodh Gaya has been very low. “At present, all people visiting Gaya by any means of transportation are being tested for Covid at the respective stations,” DM Abhishek Singh told this newspaper on Monday. “The Mahabodhi Mahavihara will be reopened as per state home department orders,” he added. Meanwhile, some voluntary organisations and the people in Bodh Gaya are vigilant with regard to precautionary measures to prevent spread of the virus and spreading awareness regarding Covid vaccination. Bodh Gaya-based Nagrik Vikas Manch’s president Suresh Singh said: “Covid vaccination is going on smoothly in the city. Local people and monks living in monasteries are also aware and proactive towards vaccination.” Speaking on tourists’ footfall, Singh said: “In the absence of international flights, footfall of foreign tourists is nil, while domestic tourists are also not arriving as the Mahabodhi Mahavihara and other monasteries are closed. Nevertheless, stakeholders of tourism industry, including hoteliers, tourist guides and footpath vendors are ready to receive the tourists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mahabodhi-temple-to-reopen-after-govt-order/articleshow/83929420.cms||---

It gets cured if the surgery is done on time. As their financial condition is not good, they have urged the Prime Minister to arrange financial help so that their daughter could overcome the deformity. The girl’s mother Kshama and father Kapil Porwal said that the doctors at AIIMS had apprised them that the surgery of the girl is already late. It should be done as soon as possible. Now the date of operation has been postponed twice due to Covid-19 and their poor financial background. They said that they want the PM to listen to them and help them. Samridhi’s parents have shared details of her disease in an emotional post written to the PM on social media. They have told the PM that their daughter will turn three on June 29. They further stated that they are a resident of village Atta in Jalaun. They said, “Our daughter, who is suffering from developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) has been undergoing treatment under Dr Shah Alam of the orthopaedic department in AIIMS, Delhi for the last one and a half years. AIIMS doctors have given the date for surgery twice. But due to the Corona period, the date got cancelled both the times. Though she is developing physically, there is a difference in the length of one of her legs due to DDH. Because of which, she walks with one leg. Due to an imbalance, she could not stand or walk properly.” Ravindra Chaudhary, posted as manager, district early intervention centre at the office of Jalaun’s chief medical officer (CMO), said, “This disease is considered to be a congenital problem. This is sometimes called hip dysplasia or congenital hip dislocation. It gets cured if the surgery is done on time.” However, no one has come to him asking for help with the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/jalaun-couple-seek-help-from-pm-for-daughters-surgery/articleshow/83932445.cms||---

These volunteers help the accident victims by providing them with first aid, arranging an ambulance and shifting them immediately to the nearest hospital. Assistant police inspector Amol Valzade of Ghoti traffic aid post (TAP) said the the Highway Mrutunjay Devdoot campaign is the brainchild of ADG Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay. “Under this project, the volunteers readily pitch in to take all the necessary measures to provide help to the victims of road accidents on the highway,” he said. “Under the Ghoti TAP there are 70 Mrutunjay Devdoots spread over a stretch of 45-km. People running restaurants, garages, health workers and villagers who have their settlements along the highway have been taken as volunteers in providing help to accident victims,” he added. The Sinnar TAP has 30 volunteers, while Pimpalgaon and Malegaon have 75 volunteers and Malegaon has 32 volunteers. Every year close to 1.5 lakh people die in road accidents on the highways across the country. Most of them die only because they do not get medical treatment on time. The volunteers have been trained in giving first aid to the victims. They are also provided with phone numbers of nearest hospitals and ambulance service. The Mumbai-Agra highway which passes through Nashik district is an extremely busy highway and a large number of accidents take place here.

Members of ‘Kotha Telangana Charitra Brundam’ who were exploring pre-historic sites found the plant fossils in a jungle 4 km from Bhupatipur in Kannaigudem mandal. Sriramoju Haragopal of the group said: “The fossil area identified in Bhupatipur forest is the most extensive of all. The fossils here are 40 feet to 25 feet long. Fossils are usually 10 ft to 12 ft in circumference,” he said. He said this is the unique fossil site in Telangana and fossils of animals and trees were found in abundance in the Pranahitha and Godavari rivers basins. He said more exploration has to be done to find dinosaur fossils in the area. “Fossils of dinosaurs were found in Kota formation in Yamanapalli, Rangareddy and Khammam districts,” he recalled.

The suspended deputy dean Dr Rakesh Verma and his aide Lavkumar Gupta were brought to Bharuch through a transfer warrant as the duo was lodged in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai in a similar case. Police said that the duo and five others named Vishal Radariya, Ritam Sharma, Mukesh Mishra, Aditya and Sagar had conned Aadam Patel, whose son Mohsin was seeking admission in a post-graduate course through National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). In August last year, Patel received a call from Sharma asking if Mohsin was interested in admission at Sion Hospital for MD course. When the family showed interest, they were called to Mumbai and had a meeting with Verma. Verma promised admission to Mohsin and asked them to meet Gupta. The family was asked to pay Rs 60 lakh to secure the seat, but as they could not afford the deal was finalized for Rs 43 lakh. Within the next few days, they managed to pay Rs 43 lakh in different amounts. However, Mohsin never got admission and the money was also not returned. Patel lodged a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy in March. “The gang targets candidates who have secured lower ranks in NEET. They secure admission for such candidates when seats fall vacant after counselling,” said assistant superintendent of police Vikas Sunda. He added that one more victim from Banaskantha who had paid Rs 60 lakh has also come forward against the gang. Mumbai police had busted medical seat racket in December last year wherein Verma and his aides used to dupe medical graduates under the pretext of helping them to avail admission for post-graduation at Sion Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mumbai-hospitals-suspended-dean-aide-held-in-cheating-case/articleshow/83931022.cms||---

As many as 100 students from 50 schools have been selected for the initiative called ‘Cyber Congress’. They will be imparted training on how to fight cyber crime. The initiative has been proposed by the education department and women’s protection wing of police. Education department official Surya Chaitanya said girls, in particular, will be taught on how not to fall prey to crimes on internet. An equal number of boys and girls have been selected for the Cyber Congress. From the 100 students selected, 50 WhatsApp groups have been formed. Local police and She Teams personnel will also be part of the team to coordinate the programme. After the training, two students and one teacher selected from each school will educate the rest of the students in their respective schools on cyber crimes and how to fight them. The students will be given suggestions on how best to make use of the internet. “The idea is to involve parents in the programme and give them an idea on how the smart phone can be misused by students,” an official said. Thanks to online education in the wake of the pandemic, students get attracted to online games which give an opportunity for cyber criminals to prey on them. “How this happens and how they can fight this will also be taught to the students and parents,” he said. Some teachers have been selected for the training apart from students from 20 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/100-students-in-nagarkurnool-dist-to-get-training-in-cyber-crime/articleshow/83935864.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Delhi||To boost business aptitude in students, Delhi government hikes seed amount to Rs 2,000||NEW DELHI: Delhi government increased the seed money given to students under the Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum (EMC) to Rs 2,000 from Rs 1,000 earlier, announced deputy CM and education minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday. The government will also give up to Rs 50,000 for an enterprise created by a group of 25 students, which will be selected in the format of “Shark Tank”— a popular television series. Sisodia urged every head of schools and teacher to watch the show and implement a similar approach at their schools. “Our initial plan was to disburse Rs 1,000. However, after reviewing the prototype they created based on their ideas, we have revisited this project, and now plan to give Rs 2,000,” he said. Reviewing the progress of EMC, Sisodia launched a web application for all heads of schools, teachers, and EMC coordinators to access the teaching-learning material. This platform will use a decentralised approach, where teachers will be able to access all EMC resources. Success stories from the students will also be gathered through the platform. “The purpose of EMC is to work and build on entrepreneurial mindset of our students. Our school community, especially our teachers and heads of schools need to accept EMC as a subject in their daily teaching and learning. It is not just an initiative or a scheme, but an indispensable subject that will equip students with a mindset and skills needed to triumph in any challenge,” he added. Sisodia insisted that they must take the curriculum forward on a largescale and stressed the importance of students interacting with real-life entrepreneurs. “If our children receive 100/100 in business studies or in science but are not able to apply their knowledge and skills, then our education and teaching are redundant. Now, when we see employers hiring individuals, they do not only look at individuals who have knowledge, but want someone who can apply their learnings in a creative way,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/to-boost-biz-aptitude-in-students-govt-hikes-seed-amount-to-rs-2000/articleshow/83968337.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Study soon on water yield of forests||KOCHI: In a first, government has initiated steps to study the ‘hydrological services’ provided by the forests of Kerala. The three-year study, which will cover five types of forests in Kerala, will be conducted by Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM). The study is a part of Rebuild Kerala initiative. The study will look into water yield, water retention and consistent water supply by evergreen, moist-deciduous, dry-deciduous, semi-evergreen and shola grassland forests. Contribution of each type of forest will be studied by auditing the quantity of water forests yields during rain and how much is retained and how long can the forest supply it. “How the deviation in the ecosystem of each forest is affecting the contribution in hydrological services is part of the study. Impact of encroachment, degradation of forest, fire and plantations will also be studied. The main drawback is that there is no data on various aspects due to the lack of previous studies in this direction,” said sources. Given the lack of previous studies, scientists will have to use existing rain data available with KSEB, irrigation, IMD and forest department. “Extra measures need to be taken to gauge rain data in deep forest where no rain gauge mechanisms are available. Stemflow, surface and groundwater flow have to be studied. Data from three years is required for analysis as prediction on disasters is not possible with the data from a year. Once study is completed, authorities can utilize it for prediction of flood depending on the intensity of rain in each area,” said sources. Forest department officials stressed on the need for water conservation. “Depletion in groundwater level and recent disasters the state witnessed raised a concern and the study is a concrete measure in the direction of water conservation. It is a novel step. There is no precedent in the country regarding a study on water yield of forests,” said a forest department official. Meanwhile, environmentalists feel no concrete steps were taken for the protection of ecology despite recurring disasters due to human intervention and climate change. “Rivers originate in forests and the main problem Western Ghats are facing is fragmentation of reserve forest. Degradation and fragmentation in catchment areas pose threat to rivers. Forest streams are drying fast. All these problems are due to forests losing their riches. We need to bring back natural vegetation in reserve forests. We lost it due to industrial plantation policy, construction of reservoirs and drawing high-tension power lines. Kerala needs a river policy,” said director of River research Centre S Unnikrishnan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/study-soon-on-water-yield-of-forests/articleshow/83933595.cms||T C Sreemol

---||Kochi||Kerala: ‘Pallikoodam’ students donate 40 tabs||KOTTAYAM: A group of schoolmates who grow concerned about the digital divide in online education have launched an initiative to address the issue. The five students of Pallikoodam in the district raised over Rs 4 lakh so far and donated over 40 tablets to students of two government schools in Kanam and Kumarakom. It was Nihal Mathew, Niranjan Menon, Vinayak Dinesh, Kurien George Kalarickal and Kurien Kurien Kalarickal, all Grade 12 students of the school, who joined hands to raise funds for buying tablets for children with a poor financial background. They raised the funds through an online crowd funding campaign which was launched on June 12. “The pandemic has widened the gap in education for children especially with everything going digital. Unfortunately, many students of government schools do not have access to a smart phone or a tablet, and this puts them at a great disadvantage,” the students say in their request for donations. The campaign is being done in association with The Tiny Seed, a non-profit organization dedicated to changing the lives of children by making their schools better places of learning. Those who wish to make donations can do so by logging in to https://pages.razorpay.com/tabletsschool and donate any amount. The campaign will end on June 30. Last year when the Covid-19 pandemic forced the nation to go under lockdown for weeks, another group of Class XII students of the same school had come together to help the families of around 800 daily wagers, who were left jobless by the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pallikoodam-students-donate-40-tabs/articleshow/83933624.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Pandemic takes its toll onroutine immunisation||Lucknow: For the second consecutive year, the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a toll on the state health department’s routine immunisation (RI) of children required to protect them from vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). Under the RI programme, children – from birth till the age of five years – are given vaccines to prevent several diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, Hepatitis B, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus and typhoid, among others. While the RI programme for 2021-22 has not started even after two-and-a-half months of the annual scheduled date, as per RI data of the state health department accessed by TOI, about 39,436 immunisation sessions were held in various government sector health centres in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021), which was 33% less than the 58,334 sessions held in the preceding (2019-20) year. As a result, the number of children vaccinated for various VPDs in 2020-21 were 20-45% less than 2019-20. Experts say that lesser number of sessions automatically lowers the number of RIs, which means that hundreds of children from families which depend on government healthcare centres, missed their doses, making them susceptible to VPDs. Emphasising on the urgent need to start RI programme, experts pointed out that the World Health Organisation (WHO) had warned last year that any disruption of immunization, even for short periods, would leave a community, especially children, at risk, which would add to the already overburdened healthcare services due to Covid-19. The RI programme is carried out in eight urban community healthcare centres (CHCs) and 52 urban primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in the district. The immunisation target of every CHCs and PHCs depends on its capacity and local population and is largely driven by ANMs (auxiliary nurse and midwife). “This year, the RI programme was stalled due to deadly Covid-19 second wave in April and May. It has not taken off even in June because ANMs in CHCs/PHCs have been deployed for Covid-19 vaccinations,” a senior health official said. “Some people, who can afford it, go to private hospitals to get their children vaccinated but a large population is still dependent on the government sector. If RI is not resumed soon, problems will aggravate if an outbreak of VPDs takes place,” he added. District immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said, “The RI programme in the city will be resumed soon. Currently, our focus is Covid-19 vaccination for adults and all energy is diverted to that front.” He refused to comment on how authorities would cover the shortfall in RI witnessed during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pandemic-takes-its-toll-onroutine-immunisation/articleshow/83905939.cms||Yusra Husain

The man claimed that he had been confronted by a gang of ghosts, of which two threatened to kill him. “So, I ran to the police station. I request you to save my life,” stated the 35-year-old, who resides in a hamlet in Jambughoda taluka of Panchmahals district. Strange as his request was, the police accepted his application to pacify the man who seemed to be mentally disturbed. The application, addressed to the police sub-inspector, revealed that the gang of ghosts had approached the complainant when he was working in his farm. PSI Mayanksinh Thakor said that he was on duty in Pavagadh on Sunday when the man came to the police station. “He was very agitated. It was clear that he was behaving abnormally. We took down his application and showed it to him to help him calm down,” said Thakor. The police also contacted the man’s relatives. “His family members revealed that he was undergoing psychiatric treatment. However, he had not taken his medicine for the past 10 days,” Thakor said. On Monday, the police spoke to the man again. “He said that he ran to the police station as he believed that the ghosts would not be able to trouble him there. We have asked his family to ensure that he takes his medicines regularly so that he does not experience such psychotic episodes again,” the PSI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ghosts-harass-man-cops-file-plaint/articleshow/83931004.cms||---

The seasonal waterfall that flows down the cliff close to the temple became alive on Sunday following good rainfall in the area in the last few days. The news of the waterfall being active spread like a wildfire and hundreds of people along with family members thronged the spot to have splash under the water cascading down from over 100 feet. A video of large gathering at the waterfall in violation of Covid regulations went viral on social media drawing harsh criticism. Taking note of the gathering of hundreds which may become ‘superspreader’ amid the possible third wave of the Covid pandemic, Prernadai Virangana Mugdai Aadiwasi Seva Charitable Trust, the governing body of Mugdai Mata temple, banned entry of people to the waterfall from Monday. Trust president Ramrao Nannaware told TOI even though the waterfall is seasonal, it flows down for weeks after good monsoon rainfall attracting thousands of people and devotees every year. It was first time on Sunday when water had started cascading down this season and hence a large crowd gathered there. “After the video of large gathering at the waterfall went viral, we were warned by the police and tehsil office to take immediate measures to stop the gatherings.

The experts, who for months have been saying pregnant women should be given Covid vaccines, said other than exclusive drives for them, officials should arrange for on-site consultation by gynaecologists, especially for those not registered for ante-natal (pre-delivery) care. They added a registry of vaccinated pregnant women should be maintained for long-term follow-up and data collection. “Pregnant women should be given priority at Covid vaccination sites. They should be assigned a day or a time of day to ensure they don’t have to mix with the general crowd,” said Sanjay Gupte, a Pune-based gynaecologist who has been at the forefront of demands for inclusion of mothers-to-be in the country’s Covid vaccine drive. On June 25, the Centre revised an earlier policy to state that pregnant women should be vaccinated against Covid-19. “We should also have a separate registry—trimester-wise —for pregnant women who undergo vaccination, to facilitate follow-up and data collection for future use,” said Gupte, who is also chairman (ethical committee) of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the organisation. Patients suffering from pregnancy-induced hypertension called pre-eclampsia or immune-suppression treatment should be offered vaccines only after their obstetricians’ consultation, the experts said. “Besides this, women who are planning a pregnancy—natural or assisted—can take the vaccine and then attempt to become pregnant. Vaccines do not affect fertility. Both husband and wife can take the same or different vaccine. It doesn’t matter,” said gynaecologist-infertility expert Dr Sanjeev Khurd. Specialists said lead Covid vaccines in India, Covishield and Covaxin, do not contain any live virus. There is no biological mechanism in them to cause Covid in the mother or unborn foetus. Therefore, there is no transmission during pregnancy or through breast milk, they said. “The decision will especially be useful for pregnant women with comorbidities and those at a high risk of exposure due to their work. Pregnant women account for about 5% of the Indian population,” said gynaecologist Dr Pankaj Sarode.  After a National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) meeting on May 28, the health ministry said pregnant women should also be vaccinated. The ministry is set to release a notification on vaccination of pregnant women within a week, a member of the national Covid-19 task force said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-arrange-spl-vax-drives-on-site-advice-for-expectant-mothers/articleshow/83935994.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Unique Disability IDs (UDID) cards have been issued to 3.58 lakh persons and disability certificates have been issued online to 3.90 lakh persons so far. Therefore, 32,000 persons are yet to be issued UDID cards in the state.For a PwD to be registered on the state’s electoral roll, he/she has to furnish the disability certificate. Currently, names of around 5 lakh PwDs have been enrolled in the state’s electoral roll. “Around 11.22 lakh persons with disabilities (PwDs) are registered with the directorate of specially-abled persons, Rajasthan. Of these, objections have been raised with regard to many applications and several have been rejected for submitting incorrect documents. After issuance of disability certificates, UDID cards are issued by the centre to specially-abled persons,” said an official.“There is pendency (in issuing certificates). We will hold a video conference at the chief secretary’s level in the second week of July. We will ask the collectors, chief medical and health officers (CMHOs) and principals of medical colleges to clear the pendency at their level. Due to the Covid situation, it issuing of certificates) could not be done,” said Samit Sharma, secretary, social justice and empowerment department. Hemant Goyal, national vice-president, Divyang Adhikar Mahasangh said he raised several issues concerning the problems faced by PwDs during polls in a meeting with the officials of the election department recently. He also said, with the introduction of online submission of applications for disability certificates, many applicants are unable to apply as either they face various challenges in applying online or the e-Mitra operators are not skilled enough to help them apply online. “I suggested that the acronym ‘PwD’ should be mentioned before the names of every specially-abled person on the voters’ list. This will help the sarpanches, parshads and the candidates know that there are these many PwDs in a particular area. Rajasthan chief electoral officer (Praveen Gupta) agreed to my proposal and said this is a policy matter and will be decided by the election commission,” said Goyal.“I also suggested that pre-poll activities and webinars should be conducted to create awareness among PwDs for adding their names to the voters’ list and exercise their franchise; election manifestos and other items used for poll campaigning should be printed in braille; also PwDs should be included in the manifesto committees of the political parties,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-lakh-applications-pending-for-certifying-disabled-people/articleshow/83938021.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

---||Surat||Vaccine shortage continues to mar ‘jab for all’ drive||Rajkot/Surat/Vadodara: While the state government has issued targets for Covid-19 vaccinations to corporates and civic bodies, it seems ambitious drive has hit a rough patch. This has resulted in a severe demand-supply gap of vaccine vials across Gujarat, especially in the cities like Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara. Civic authorities in these three cities have admitted to the short supply of vaccines against the demand. Also, some complained of more supply of Covaxin and less supply of Covishield vaccines which has led to chaos at many vaccination centres in Rajkot and Surat. Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) on Monday did not get the vaccine stock on time, said health department sources. As a result many centres had to close down early as they ran over of vaccine shots. According to RMC officials, they only have 10,000 Covaxin doses in stock. “Seven lakh people were administered first dose of Covishield, out of that nearly 1.50 lakh are now due to for the take second dose. People are getting reminder to take the second dose, but they can’t be given the shot as RMC is out of Covishield,” said a government health officer. Against the target of 25,000 doses daily, only 8,000-12,000 people get inoculated due to non-availability of doses. RMC commissioner Amit Arora said, “There is an issue of stock currently but it’s temporary. We got assurance from the government that supply will be normalised in a day or two.” However, the sources claimed there has been mismanagement at a higher level as the officials did not take into account those due for the second dose. The Diamond City on Monday administered 22,000 doses of vaccine at 100 centres against 12,000 on Sunday. The vaccine supply was limited so the health department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) continued vaccination from 100 centres out of the 230 in the past week. “Walk-in for vaccination is continuing, but to avoid rush we are issuing a token. We need more doses of Covishield since the majority of people coming for the second dose now were given the first dose of it earlier,” said a health official. “I waited in line for over an hour but did not get the vaccine on Sunday. Today I stood in line for over two hours and was informed that the stock got over,” said Kirit Parmar (76), who was at the vaccination centre at T&TV High School. While vaccination has gone down significantly in the Vadodara, there has been no shortage of vaccines for the first dose. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and the city police have had to work overtime to ensure people take vaccines. With few takers, the number of vaccination centres had to be reduced. However, since the last couple of days, those looking for the second dose of Covishield have been sent back by some vaccination centres. Covaxin in being used widely in most vaccination centres. While Covishield is available, it can be found only at select centres. An official said that out of around 13,000 vaccine doses being given to VMC, 4,000 to 4,500 were of Covishield. "The vaccine is available. We request those looking for the second dose of Covishield to check on the portal first before going to the vaccination centre," said medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/vaccine-shortage-continues-to-mar-jab-for-all-drive/articleshow/83931128.cms||---

Meanwhile, director of GMC Dr M S Padmanabhan has said that they were ready to start the specialized IP treatment and 100 beds were kept ready. Once the medical equipment for the intensive care unit reach, it can start functioning, he said. Though the GMC was inaugurated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in February this year just before the assembly elections, it was not having facilities that are required for a medical college, said BJP district president E Krishnadas. After making the district hospital an exclusive Covid-19 treatment centre, the medical departments, except four specialized departments, were shifted to the GMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/palakkad-med-college-work-to-be-over-by-sept/articleshow/83933686.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Owaisi strategy to hammer out MBC-Muslim combo may cut into SP, BSP votebank||Lucknow: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday formally announced his party’s plans to contest 100 seats in UP assembly elections early next year. His announcement came hours after BSP chief Mayawati sent out a strong denial of having any plans to ally with Owaisi, who has been planning to make inroads into the politically crucial state of Uttar Pradesh. AIMIM contested 38 seats in 2017 UP assembly elections, but managed to bag only 0.2% votes. Analysts say Owaisi’s plan to contest from 100 seats is an attempt to cut into the Muslim votebank of Samajawadi Party, which gears up to take on BJP in 2022 assembly elections. The AIMIM chief tweeted on Sunday that his party was in alliance with the ‘Bhagidari Morcha’, a political conglomerate of smaller parties constituted by BJP ally-turned-rebel Suhaildev Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar. Owaisi has been in touch with Rajbhar, who has been flexing muscle to thwart BJP’s concerted bid to consolidate the Most Backward Castes, essentially Rajbhars, who account for 7% of the OBC block in the eastern UP region. SBSP alliance with Owaisi would shape up a new MBC-Muslim combination, which could potentially trouble both SP and BSP, experts said. Owaisi said, his party has already begun the process of identifying prospective candidates. Besides AIMIM and SBSP, Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha includes eight other parties, including Krishna Patel’s Apna Dal, Jan Aadhikar Party and Chandrashekar Ravan’s Azad Samaj Party. The inclusion of Krishna Patel in the Morcha gains political significance as it’s seen as an attempt to sabotage BJP’s bid to consolidate the Kurmi vote, which forms 24% of the total OBC block. Krishna has been at odds with her daughter and Apna Dal (S) chief Anupriya Patel, which is in alliance with BJP. Likewise, Rajbhar stitching an alliance with Chandrashekhar Ravan, who is also founder of Bhim Army – a group of Ambedkarite activists — is viewed as a deft political strategy to dent prospects of Mayawati in the west UP region, which has substantial population of Dalits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/owaisi-strategy-to-hammer-out-mbc-muslim-combo-may-cut-into-sp-bsp-votebank/articleshow/83906073.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Kochi||Forest department restores grassland in Idukki||IDUKKI: The Pazathottam area in Anamudi Shola National Park in Idukki shows how an eco-restoration project helps to grow natural grasslands inside a forest area. The project was implemented through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). According to forest department officials, three years ago over 50 hectares of forest land in the national park was gutted in fire. The department then, on a trial basis, started an eco-restoration project in the Pazhathottam area. Exotic species were cleared from the forest land and natural grass was planted. The grass grew to a better level and within months the area got converted into a natural grassland. The success of the project inspired the officials and decided to expand it to more areas. The project was started in 2019. Pampadum Shola National Park assistant wildlife warden Arun B Nair said, “When the natural grasslands developed in the hills we noticed the presence of wild animals, including bison and deer, there. After the restoration of grasslands a natural stream in the area was also revived. It could also ensure water security in summer season in Chilantiyar area downstream Pazhathottam region.” “The eco-restoration project is continuing and I hope it will be completed in 2023. When complete the project will bring about a significant change in the area,” said Nair. The officials said the eco-restoration project is being implemented with the full participation of residents. The department has formed an eco-development committee (EDC) named ‘Haritha Vasantham’ for the project. The department will pay wages to the families supporting the project. It is for the first time in the state that an eco-development committee has been formed for an eco-restoration project. The total length of Anamudi Shola National park is 32sq km, of which 14sq km is covered with exotic species. The spread of exotic species inside the forest is causing food and water scarcity for wild animals, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/forest-dept-restores-grassland/articleshow/83933725.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Demand for withdrawal of Indira Gandhi national open university’s Jyotish course||AURANGABAD: Days after the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) launched a master’s of arts course in astrology (MA Jyotish), the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti has sought the withdrawal of the course. The two-year master’s programme is being offered by IGNOU’s School of Humanities through an open distance-learning mode and is available in Hindi and Sanskrit languages. Contesting that the introduction of the course is a major step against scientific temperament, the samiti’s core committee member Prashant Potdar told TOI: “Astrology is claimed to be science, but it does not fulfil the criteria to be a science. By imparting education that does not have any scientific base, we are going to have an unscientific and deceptive generation.” He contested that it is claimed that the stars have impact on our lives. “We have been seeking explanation on how the stars, which are light years away from the Earth, impact our destinies and lives,” said Potdar. He said more than 25 senior scientists have agreed to come forward against the introduction of this course and soon they will be using their respective platforms to oppose the move. Shital Waghmare, another member of the samiti, contested that stars named as Rahu and Ketu are imaginary and there is no scientific evidence to support their existence. In a press communiqué issued by the samiti, it has been stated: “A similar decision was taken by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 2001. However, after widespread criticism and opposition to the unscientific move, it was withdrawn. It was opposed by scientists including astrophysicist Dr Jayant Narlikar. Samiti members questioned the logic behind the introduction of the degree course, while stating that IGNOU’s course aims to spread ignorance and unsubstantiated fears about astronomical events such as lunar and solar eclipses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/demand-for-withdrawal-of-ignous-jyotish-course/articleshow/83933682.cms||Mohammed Akhef

They watched curiously as a huge crocodile was being pulled out of the waters by the firemen. The 12-feet-long reptile was dead but the firemen were finding it tough to fish it out as it was very heavy. This is the second crocodile found dead in Vishwamitri River in the last three days. On Saturday, a 12-feet-long crocodile was also found dead in the stretch below Akota-Dandia Bazaar bridge. “Their post-mortem report revealed that both the crocodiles were old and died of natural causes,” said Nidhi Dave, range forest officer (RFO), Vadodara. Dave added that the reptile that was found dead on Monday was between 12 to 15 years of age and weighed about 300 kilograms. “It is possible that the reptiles may have died due to territorial fight too. We haven’t found any visible injury marks yet. An inquiry, though, has been initiated,” Dave told TOI. The river that passes through the heart of the city is home to about 275 crocodiles, many of which are found in the densely populated Sayajigunj and Fatehgunj stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/12-ft-crocodile-found-dead-in-vishwamitri-river/articleshow/83931218.cms||---

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted light rain for the next two days over Aurangabad and parts of the region. This is expected to ensure a good run of the monsoon after the recent lull. As per official data, Marathwada has reported an average of 21 mm showers between Sunday and Monday morning with Ambad from neighbouring Jalna district registering the highest 87 mm rainfall. Jalna district recorded the highest 37 mm rainfall followed by Parbhani (25mm), Aurangabad, Hingoli (both 21 mm), Beed (20 mm), Nanded (19 mm), Osmanabad ( 12 mm) and Latur (11 mm). “The region, comprising eight districts, has received 188 mm rainfall since June 1 which accounts for 149% of normal rainfall. Marathwada had reported slightly lower 142% rainfall during the corresponding period last year,” divisional authorities concerned said. While a majority of dams from the region were holding considerable storage before the start of monsoon, the surplus rainfall during the current rainy season, including the latest rainfall activity, has further boosted the storage in these reservoirs. Among major irrigation projects from Marathwada, Jayakwadi dam from Aurangabad district has received 148 mm rainfall in catchment areas since June 1 and was holding 33% live storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/widespread-showers-bring-cheer-to-mwada-farmers/articleshow/83933763.cms||---

Helping them has become a part of his life. From the injured, hungry to those walking barefoot and in rags—he has a bagful of gifts for all. The do-good videos of ASI Ashok Kumar, 45, in-charge of traffic zone-1 of Ludhiana commissionerate, are viral on social media and winning hearts. Kumar said, “I cannot build houses for the homeless, but I can provide them basic things they lack. In winters, I give them woolens and in summers, I keep at least 50 pairs of slippers to ensure nobody has to walk barefoot. I have never uploaded any of my videos on social media. Someone captured me helping others and shared those videos. When these reached my seniors, they shared them on the official Facebook page and Twitter handle of the Ludhiana commissionerate. Thereafter, I received several appreciation messages from people and they asked me to keep posting such videos so that others can also work for the cause.” In one video, the traffic cop is seen taking a homeless man along and giving him a makeover —from a bath, new clothes, slippers to a haircut. “I also keep lunch boxes with me. On finding someone who has not eaten, I give him food. A few days back, I found a man near Old City who lived on the pavement outside an eating joint. When I asked him if he wanted to go to an old-age home, he refused. He said he only wanted home-cooked food and new clothes. I got him a kurta-pajama stitched and brought a home-cooked meal for him,” Kumar added. He also keeps masks and first-aid box with him for the needy. In August 2010, when Kumar was a traffic munshi, he had found on the road a diamond necklace that had fallen from the car of a businessman. He had returned the necklace, worth Rs 5 lakh, to the family. For this, he was honored on the Independence Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/this-cop-goes-above-and-beyond-the-call-of-duty/articleshow/83931237.cms||Payal Dhawan

The 29-year-old girl had married a Muslim youth after switching the religion. She is in Delhi with her husband and ATS sleuths are trying to reach her, sources said. Mohammed Umar Gautam, the founder of Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC), which has its office in Delhi’s Batla House, used to help people willing to convert to Islam. Another cleric, Qazi Jahangir Alam, who worked with Gautam, is also under arrest. The girl in an interview to local media has said, “I searched online for help when I wanted to get converted. And these people helped me with the conversion. They took my Aadhaar card and some other documents to get it registered.” When asked if her family agreed to the conversion, the girl said, “They were not happy. But I told them about my decision.” The girl has said that she changed her religion for better career prospects in Gulf countries. “I work at IGI Airport and get just Rs 20,000. In Dubai, I am likely to get Rs 2 to 3lakh a month. So I converted to Islam,” the girl is heard purportedly saying in the video, with her face covered with a stole. She left for Delhi on Friday for a day, but didn’t return. Her phone has been switched off since then, and so is her husband's. The girl’s uncle told TOI, “My niece left for Delhi and didn’t return. Now she has contacted her father through a lawyer who has assured him that she will return by Monday night. If she doesn’t come back then we would lodge a police complaint as I believe that her husband had concealed the information about his religion and the name that he told us is also not right.” An official in ATS, who is looking after this case, told TOI, “An FIR was registered against Mohammed Umar Gautam and Jahangir Alam after finding their involvement in this conversion. We are searching for the girl as she is missing and even her father is not aware about her location. The claims made by the girl earlier didn’t seem to be correct. The role of her husband is also suspicious and we are investigating his role as well.” The clerics have been booked under sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race etc), 153-B (imputations assertions prejudicial to national integration), 295-A (deliberate or malicious act intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion), 511 (attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of IPC. While Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand said, “We are keeping an eye on this case and an FIR would be registered once the girl’s father gives a complaint in writing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/up-religious-conversion-case-ats-books-2-clerics-for-conversion-of-girl-29-who-changed-religion-for-gulf-job/articleshow/83931343.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Chandigarh||Power department privatisation back on as SC stays Punjab and Haryana high court order||CHANDIGARH: In a major relief for the UT administration, the Supreme Court has stayed the Punjab and Haryana high court’s May 28 order in which it had stayed its power privatisation process. The HC order had come on the application filed by Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, UT Powermen Union. The administration had then moved the Supreme Court. Recently, the administration had opened technical bids of all seven companies and submitted the case to technical bids evaluation committee. The UT was planning to open financial bids in the first week of June, but the union had moved the high court. A senior UT official said they were waiting for the certified copy of the Supreme Court order and only after getting it, they will move ahead. The engineering department had issued notice on November 9, 2020, and invited bids for distribution licence in Chandigarh. The bids closed on February 8. On March 8, the UT had issued an amendment to the bid document and extended the bidding date to March 18. The amendment also provided an opportunity to new bidders to submit their bids and allowed the existing bidders to modify theirs. During an inter-ministerial meeting held in Delhi on February 26, it was decided that the UTs, where the privatisation process was in the last phase, would continue with the procedure. As many as 20 intended bidders purchased the tenders, but only six companies —Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NESCL (NTPC), Adani Transmission Ltd, Tata Power and Torrent Power —had submitted their bids. Later, Kolkata firm---Eminent Electricity Power Company -- too participated in it. On December 1, 2020, the high court had stayed the privatisation till the next hearing and issued a notice to the Union government, the UT administration and the UT chief engineer on a petition filed by UT Powermen Union. The petitioner had contended that they were aggrieved by the decision to privatise the electricity wing by selling 100 per cent stake of the government in the absence of any provision under Section 131 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Bench was also told that the process of privatisation could not be initiated at all, especially when it was running in profits. The sale of 100 per cent stake was unjust and illegal as the wing was revenue surplus for the past three years. It was economically efficient, having transmission and distribution losses less than the target of 15 per cent fixed by the Ministry of Power. However, on January 12, the Supreme Court had stayed the order of the high court. The SC had issued its order on the UT’s petition against HC’s order of staying the directive of the administration, wherein it had floated a tender for privatisation of the electricity department. On January 14, the UT Administration resumed the sale of tender for the privatisation process. On February 9, the Supreme Court in its order had requested the Punjab and Haryana high court to dispose of the petition as expeditiously as possible preferably within a period of three months. The UT administration, in its tender, had proposed to give licence to a distribution company, to be finalised after the bidding process, for 25 years under the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-dept-privatisation-back-on-as-sc-stays-hc-order/articleshow/83933844.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad to become Super City by 2023: Desai||AURANGABAD: District guardian minister Subhash Desai on Monday said efforts were on to transform Aurangabad into a Super City by 2023 — coinciding with platinum jubilee celebrations of Marathwada Liberation Movement. “The civic administration and other government authorities have been asked to execute different development work in Aurangabad in a time-bound manner. Together with these work, different ongoing and upcoming industrial development in Aurangabad will transform the face of Aurangabad in the next two years,” he said. Desai, who held a review meeting with different authorities, said implementation of laying down a new water supply scheme for Aurangabad is one of the focus areas of the government. “The Rs 1,680 crore project needs to be ramped up. The civic administration and Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran have been told to speed up the construction work of overhead tanks as part of the project. Once completed, the scheme will ensure at least twice a week water supply for Aurangabad,” he said. While inaugurating the new building of Chamber of Marathawada Industries and Agriculture (CMIA), Desai, who is also state industries minister, said the industries from Maharashtra would be least affected due to Covid-related restrictions being planned in the wake of the presence of Delta plus variant. “The state government will continue to stand firm behind the industries during the current pandemic. In order to ensure effective battle against Covid-19, all industries must carry out vaccination of its workforce at the earliest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-to-become-super-city-by-2023-desai/articleshow/83933864.cms||---

The islanders protested at homes following Covid protocol and shared images on social media. The call by the Save Lakshadweep Forum (SLF) was to protest by sitting on coconut leaves and palm for at least an hour with placards demanding ‘garbage disposal mechanism’ and an end to fining for littering. The administration through an order dated June 4, had implemented Rs 200 fine for throwing, breaking or spreading coconuts, fruit leftovers and vegetable wastes in public places. Also, Rs 500 is the fine if the 25-metre radius peripheral area of houses are not litter free. Penalties from Rs 200 to Rs 5,000 were announced in the order issued as part of ‘management of cleanliness and hygiene in the wake of Covid 19’. “Their new law says that tender coconut shells, tree leaves, coconut husks, shells, etc. around dwellings have to be disposed of scientifically by us. Where are we supposed to dispose them of? We need a proper garbage treatment system for that. We observed ‘Olamadal Samaram’ by sitting on coconut tree leaves as a symbolic protest. These might be small things for others but it causes great problems for the commoners,” said SLF convener UCK Thangal. Meanwhile, the deputy collector of Androth island on Monday came out with an order directing the public not to conduct any social/religious/political gathering without the prior permission of the district collector. “The district collector and chairman of the district disaster management committee is the competent authority to grant permission,” the order stated. It added that any person found violating the order would face action under the Disaster Management Act and the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/islanders-stage-green-protest/articleshow/83933882.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab doctors’ strike hits OPD services, elective surgeries||CHANDIGARH: Medical services were disrupted in Punjab after government doctors abstained from duties across the state to pressure the government to rollback its decision of delinking non-practicing allowance (NPA) from basic pay. This is the second strike by government doctors within a week. Earlier, they struck work on June 25. Doctors have given the government till July 1 to do away with the condition, failing which they will intensify the agitation. Outpatient departments (OPDs) remained closed, while all elective surgeries were postponed in all government hospitals. Protest marches and dharnas were held at all district and subdivision hospitals, community health centres and government medical colleges. Emergency services and Covid-related services were unaffected. Doctors are protesting against the recommendations of the sixth pay commission accepted by the Punjab government in which apart from other allowances, the NPA being given to doctors has been reduced and delinked from basic pay. NPA will also not be considered for pension purposes. The call for strike was given by Punjab Civil Medical Services Association (PCMSA), associations of rural medical officers, dental, ayurvedic, homoeopathic, veterinary officers, and medical teachers association. The government wants to destroy the public healthcare system by defunding it, said a PCMSA funtionary. “It is a well thought out plan of first making the public health care system defunct and then handing it over to corporates. Our struggle is to save public healthcare system,” said Dr Gagandeep Shergill, senior vice-president of PCMSA. Association president Dr Gagandeep Singh said the government must accept the demands by doctors in public interest. The Punjab government had set up a committee of ministers to resolve grievances of state government employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-doctors-strike-hits-opd-services-elective-surgeries/articleshow/83936145.cms||---

President of Punjab Civil Medical Service (PCMS) for civil hospital Dr Kulwant Singh said, “The OPD didn’t operate at the hospital, but we attended to emergency services, including Covid care.” Though operations of pregnant women were performed, their routine check-ups were hit. State president of civil medical service for civil hospital Dr Gagandeep Singh said OPD services didn’t function in the government hospitals of the district. State president of Rural Medical Officers’ Association Dr Deepinder Singh of Khanna said, “Rural medical officers also observed strike. Instead of raising our non-practising allowance (NPA) from 25% to 33%, the government reduced it to 20% even as the healthcare workers have remained at the forefront of fight against Covid pandemic. We held a meeting with the health secretary on Monday morning. He has assured that the decision to reduce NPA will be taken back in a week. But the doctors are not ready for this long time-limit and have asked the officials to take the decision in two days.” Unavailability of doctors at OPDs left patients high and dry.  “I had come for a check-up from Jamalpur. On reaching here, I learned about the doctors’ strike and suspension of OPD services. Now, I am going back home. I have no option other than coming on Tuesday,” said Parveen Kumar, a resident of Jamalpur. Pregnant women, too, were hassled. “This period is critical for us, but there is no one to attend to us. Who will be responsible if something goes wrong with me and my child,” said Anju Bhatia of Civil Lines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/opds-hit-as-doctors-at-govt-hosps-go-on-strike-again/articleshow/83931360.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress infighting: Navjot Singh Sidhu to meet Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi today||CHANDIGARH: Amid the ongoing tussle between Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh and former Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, the latter will meet with Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi in Delhi on Tuesday. This comes a week after Sidhu’s announcement that he was not after any position, including that of deputy chief minister, and has full faith in the party high command. Rahul has already had sessions with groups of ministers, MLAs and MPs from Punjab last week. Amarinder too could be called to Delhi in the coming days to wrap up the entire feedback exercise, as the party high command would want to resolve the internal conflicts at the earliest. Rahul had stepped in to hold simultaneous meetings with ministers and MLAs, mostly detractors of the CM, even as the panel took feedback from around 180 party leaders. The panel asked MLAs questions about Sidhu too and is also believed to have discussed the options for Sidhu with Amarinder during the last round of talks. Sidhu’s meeting follows reports of the AICC-appointed panel led by Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge recommending that Sidhu be ‘suitably accommodated’. The committee was set up to tackle the internal turmoil in the state unit ahead of the next assembly elections due in early 2022. Amarinder was called by the Kharge panel for the second time on Wednesday, but returned to Chandigarh without meeting either Sonia or Rahul. Sidhu is likely to reiterate his stand that the Congress government led by Amarinder Singh had failed to deliver on key promises like justice for sacrilege and also give his feedback on the ‘ground realities’ in the state. Former MP JP Aggarwal, who is a member of the panel, told TOI that Sidhu is not scheduled to meet with the panel. Earlier, Sidhu had given his feedback to the committee on June 1 and had reportedly conveyed his stand on the issue of sacrilege and the various proposals shot down during his stint as cabinet minister. “Rahul has not met with the chief minister so far during the current crisis, even as the latter has had two rounds of meetings with the panel. Apart from discussing the role he (Sidhu) could agree upon, Rahul and Priyanka will also discuss the roadmap for the next elections,” said a party leader. Most senior Congress leaders in Punjab have been on tenterhooks for over two months amid talk of changes in the Cabinet and the organisational structure. They have adopted been in ‘wait and watch’ mode over on the Amarinder-Sidhu tussle, uncertain which side the party high command would support. Sidhu has announced last week that he is not keen on returning to the Cabinet as deputy chief minister but wanted ‘people’s agenda’ to be implemented in the state. It is believed that he is keen on taking over as the Punjab Congress president, a proposal rejected by the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-rift-in-punjab-sidhu-to-meet-rahul-and-priyanka-today/articleshow/83936180.cms||Vibhor Mohan

With most of the districts in the state starting to open up owing to relaxation in Covid restrictions, the number of people willing to travel from Kolhapur has also gone up. But lack of trains is posing problems for them. Shivnath Biyani, member of advisory committee for Pune Railway zone, said, “Railway passengers are demanding starting of Kolhapur-Mumbai Mahalaxmi Express, Kolhapur-Ahmedabad Express and Kolhapur-Satara daily passenger as early as possible. Kolhapur-Mumbai Koyana express is expected to start from July 1. Most of the districts in the state have opened up. Currently, only Kolhapur-Gondiya Maharashtra Express, Kolhapur-Tirupati Haripriya Express and Kolhapur-Dhanbad Dikshabhumi Express — all once a week trains — have commenced.” He added, “We have come to know that Kolhapur-Nagpur via Pandharpur, Kurduwadi will commence from July 2 and Kolhapur-Delhi Nizamuddin express will resume from July 6. We have also demanded to add Gandhi Nagar and Rukdi railway station in the halt list of the trains as it is being demanded by the passengers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-passengers-demand-more-trains/articleshow/83933903.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal govt relies on biz bodies, private hospitals for off-site vaccine camps||KOLKATA: The state government on Monday stepped in to facilitate tie-ups between business chambers, trade and industry bodies to link them up with private hospitals to set up off-site vaccination camps at places like industrial houses and factories. The move is aimed at ramping up vaccination figures as well as completely utilising the vaccine stock available with private hospitals. Over 2.1 crore people in Bengal have received at least one dose. Private hospitals felt the move would help them expand the drive. “There is a need to speed up the drive. While private hospitals have been conducting various workplace or off-site camps, we want them to reach out to districts as well. They can link up with various trade and industrial bodies for it,” said a health department official. On Monday, of the 1996 vaccination sites in Bengal, 208 were run by private hospitals. More than 50% were in Kolkata. “We are inoculating about 10,000 doses on an average, about 50% of it from off-site camps. We can hike it up to 25,000 doses a day if the state government help link us up with various chambers,” said Medica chairman Alok Roy. Some private hospitals in the city have started going to the districts but the number is still negligible. Some have put their camps on hold, including those in districts after the new SOP from the health department on off-site camps. Health officials, however, assured that streamlining the implementation will take only a couple of days. “We are organising vaccination camps in districts and we expressed willingness to continue our drive. However, we raised concern about ensuring a steady supply of vaccine vials and urged the government also to look after the supply,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua. Currently, 25% of the vaccine supply is going to private hospitals. “Government officials told us to stimulate demand, mobilise more recipients through various avenues, involving corporates, trade and industry bodies so that the stock is utilised to the optimum,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east) Narayna Health. The chambers and trade bodies, however, were skeptical about the cost factor. So far, there was some amount of supply from the state government’s own procurement to these trade bodies at a nominal price. But tying up with corporate hospitals will mean almost double of what they have been spending so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-relies-on-biz-bodies-private-hosps-for-off-site-vaccine-camps/articleshow/83933937.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Covid genome sequencing to be done at PGI soon||CHANDIGARH: PGI would outsource the work of next-generation whole genome sequencing of coronavirus to detect its variants on its premises, a move that will provide quicker results and help take preventive measures on time. “We will soon have the facility in the institute as we cannot rely on other laboratories which have pendency due to huge demand,” said PGI director Prof Jagat Ram. Once set up, it will be the only facility for the Tricity. Using the sequence, it is possible to analyse the entire genetic material of an organism. Using this tool, one can understand how the virus has been evolving and mutating. “The overall usage of this investigation is 1% in the country, which is unfortunate. As per the WHO, this tool has been able to investigate outbreak dynamics, including changes in the size of the epidemic over time, help in the design of diagnostic assays, drugs and vaccines, and in monitoring changes in their efficacy over time,” said a faculty member in PGI. Presently, PGI sends its samples to NCDC laboratory in New Delhi for tests. “It takes a month or so for the reports due to many samples from throughout the country. So, we decided to outsource the work. The procedure of procurement of the machine is expected to take time,” said a faculty member. PGI has demanded from the outsourcing agency that the procedure include library preparation, quality check sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of 60 samples for coronavirus whole genome sequence by next-generation sequencing. The sequencing should cover 99% of the whole genome of SARS Cov 2 and be able to detect all known viral variants. Sources said the government procedure for the procurement of such tools is not easy as there is priority for ‘Make in India’. “For the imported products, approvals and processing time is longer,” said an official in the institute’s administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/virus-whole-genome-sequencing-to-start-in-pgi/articleshow/83933922.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: New Town, Sector V jab sites supplement malls||KOLKATA: Off-site vaccination sites set up by private hospitals at city malls are planning to augment manpower and infrastructure to cater to more people following doubts over the drug being administered in the wake of the fake vaccination camp scam that rocked the city last week. Two more off-site camps were started by government bodies NKDA and NDITA at New Town and Salt Lake Sector V on Monday. In June, five city malls vaccinated more than 25,000 people, including a section of their staff. Though two malls have since discontinued the camps, the remaining three continue to offer vaccination to all adults eligible for the jab. On Monday, the three camps vaccinated around 750 people who took the first or the second dose. Officials of AMRI and IQ City Medical College, which operate the vaccination centres at the malls, said they were ready to cater to 25% more people with a hike in manpower. Beyond that number, the site space would have to be increased. On Monday though, fewer people turned up than usual, perhaps because they were unsure if the camps would be operational following a state health department order to stop off-site camps for the time being. Sangita Chakraborty, who took the first dose at South City mall on Monday, said she preferred the mall over visiting hospitals because there were less chances of contracting any infection there. “I felt comfortable and did not have to worry about crowding. Nor was there a hassle in having to queue up for hours,” she said. While the camps at South City and Acropolis operate from noon to 6pm, the one at Mani Square is operational from 10pm to 6pm. While South City mall has a drive-in as well as walk-in vaccination centre, the camps at Acropolis and Mani Square are walk-in facilities. On Monday, two other drive-in vaccination facilities were introduced in Salt Lake Sector V and New Town. “It is an on spot drive-in vaccination facility for all adults. People will not be required to step out of the car. A nurse will inoculate the occupants of the car while they are seated in it,” said NKDA and NDITA chairman Debashis Sen after urban development minister Chandrima Bhattacharya inaugurated them. While the facility in Sector V has been set up at the multistoried car parking plaza, the facility in New Town is being organized at Eco Park Gate 1 parking lot. The twin facilities will operate from 11am to 1pm between Monday and Friday. In all, around 100-120 got vaccinated there on Monday. Those who drove in welcomed the initiative. “The facility was smooth and hassle-free. This was much-needed at a time when there is so much confusion,” said Sumana Bhattacharya, who had come from Howrah to get vaccinated.“This initiative was needed as many IT employees will now be able to come and get vaccinated on the way to office,” said Sector V Stakeholders’ Association vice-president Kalyan Kar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-sector-v-jab-sites-supplement-malls/articleshow/83933967.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The group of traffic policemen fled the spot soon after the accident. “All of them were later booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and for extortion, while traffic inspector leading the drive has been arrested,” a police officer said. The accident took place when the van coming from Punjab -- carrying migrant labourers -- was stopped for checking in Moradabad’s Majhola area. The bus, which was coming from Himachal Pradesh with over 50 passengers on board, hit the van moments later and overturned. Three workers of the van were killed while over 20 passengers in both the vehicles were injured and taken to hospital. Balram, an injured labourer on board the van, said, “We were signalled to stop by the traffic policemen. As soon as our van slowed down, a speeding bus rammed into our vehicle from behind and turned turtle on the highway. The bus driver perhaps got panicked by the policemen and lost control over the vehicle. My three friends were killed in the accident.” Moradabad senior superintendent of police Pawan Kumar said, “Following preliminary inspection and after gathering information from the locals in the area, it has come to light that a few traffic policemen were randomly conducting vehicle inspections on the highway and intercepting vehicles.” “The accident occurred allegedly when a checking drive was going on. An FIR has been registered against five policemen, who were allegedly conducting vehicle inspections, under section 384 (punishment for extortion), 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. Traffic inspector Dharmendra Singh Rathore has been arrested.” The van was taking the labourers to Pilibhit while the bus was heading to Bareilly. The deceased were identified as Tej Pratap, Suresh, Ashish and Brij Kishore, all residents of Pilibhit. Superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said, “The injured have been admitted to Moradabad district hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/5-including-traffic-cop-killed-during-unauthorized-checking-drive-in-ups-moradabad-traffic-inspector-held/articleshow/83931439.cms||Maria Khan

The FIR has been lodged against quarters owner Karam Singh of Kud village and manager Hardeep Singh of Gobindgarh village under Section 188 (disobedience to the orders duly promulgated by the public servant) of the IPC. Focal Point police station SHO inspector Davinder Sharma said, “The CCTV cameras installed in the locality had captured the woman and her daughter with the kids. During investigation, the woman and her daughter were traced to Sirhind. The footage of CCTVs there shows the two sitting in an auto-rickshaw with both the boys. The accused man was not seen with them.” On June 26, the police had booked the couple and their 17-year-old daughter for allegedly kidnapping Ravi, 6, and Prince, 2. Cops said the family had come to live in the labour quarters five days before and the landlord had not got their police verification done. Ram Bahadur, father of Ravi, said, “The accused family had recently come to live in the labour quarters, where I live with my wife and two sons. When the couple’s daughter started holding coaching classes for the locality kids, I sent my son Ravi, too, there. On June 25 evening, when Ravi did not return home after the tuitions, I went to the couple’s house, but found it locked. I started searching for him and learned that our neighbour Pappu’s son Prince is also missing.”  Thereafter, they sounded the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-police-verification-of-accused-quarters-owner-manager-booked/articleshow/83931434.cms||---

Though he misses his earlier profession, which used to provide him with a comfortable life, he has also found new meaning and avenues which he had never envisioned in the last 23 years. Hivarekar, who owns a fleet of five tourist buses, told TOI, “Several businesses have opened up but transportation is something which is still suffering and will continue to suffer. My buses are mainly meant for tour purposes and I used to rent them out to different offices and establishments for their tours. Since more than a year now, most offices are closed and my business thus went for a toss.” “After waiting until November last year I decided to change gears and started a mess service which is slowly becoming popular. I have been a transporter for 23 years now and never thought I would enter the business of feeding people. This new line of work has given me a new perspective and I have a new thought process, something which I wouldn’t have done ever,” Hivarekar, who lives in Pashan, told TOI. He added that all his attempts to sell off his business has failed. “I was desperate at first, not knowing what to do. I planned to sell my buses but then there were no takers for them amid the situation.” Kiran Desai, the secretary of the Pune Bus Owners Association said the sector was suffering and on the verge of total collapse. “The ones owning school buses, office cabs and tourist buses are by far the worst sufferers. The help from the state government has been thin and our losses have been in crores.” Hivarekar said he always missed being a transporter. “I used to earn anything between Rs 3-4 lakh each month as profit, just two years ago. Now, each month I am making a maximum of Rs 15,000. I had to invest Rs 1 lakh towards opening this mess. I am yet to earn back my investment,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transporter-takes-to-running-mess-to-overcome-loss-of-business/articleshow/83934018.cms||Joy Sengupta

Khot along with BJP general secretary MLA Devyani Pharande, BJP city unit president Girish Palve demonstrated outside the NDCC Bank. In another agitation outside the collectorate, the All India Students Federation agitated for fee waiver. “Due to Covid, a large number of people have lost jobs or are facing hardships. The government should waive off the tuition fees for the students and ask the schools to follow the same,” Viraj Devang, the AISF state unit president, said.

---||Ludhiana||Third wave may hit Ludhiana district in September-end: CMCH study||LUDHIANA: A calculation by the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) indicates that there are chances of arrival of the third wave of Covid by the last week of September. However, the finding suggests that it may get delayed in Ludhiana if 70% of eligible persons get immunised and people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. CMCH’s preventive and social medicine department projected the figures on the basis of mathematical calculations from the available data in recent times. A doctor involved in the work, who didn’t want to reveal his identity, said, “The calculations suggest that Ludhiana district may witness the third surge by the last week of September or the first week of October. It may arrive even before the predicted time, depending on the behaviour of the people. If the health department is able to vaccinate 70% of eligible persons, then the wave may get delayed by four to six months. Apart from regular vaccination, we have suggested to the authorities to inoculate college students, especially those with co-morbidities, as institutes might be opened because of examinations. We have also advised the authorities to get teachers and non-teaching staff vaccinated.” CMCH officials said if the authorities strictly enforce wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing, the peak may get delayed. The baseline for Ludhiana district is 130, and once the daily cases cross this number, it indicates that “we are moving towards the wave”. “As the number of vaccinated persons, especially those who have received the first dose, has already crossed 1 million and those infected have developed antibodies, the third wave may not be as severe as the second one,” said the doctor, adding that vaccination reduces the severity of the disease. Dr Clarence Samuel, head of the department of preventive and social medicine department, said to delay the third wave, people must get jabbed and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, like wearing a mask, washing hands regularly, maintaining social distancing and practising cough etiquettes. HIGHEST NUMBER OF CASES Last year, the highest number of cases reported in a day in Ludhiana district was on September 16, when 562 were infected During the second wave, the highest number of persons (1,729) from the district had tested positive for the disease on May 9 HIGHEST ACTIVE CASES  The number of active cases during the first wave was the highest on August 22 last year at 3,867 and during the second wave on May 16 at 13,217.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/third-wave-may-hit-district-in-sept-end-cmch-study/articleshow/83931484.cms||Shariq Majeed

Davinder Bambiha, Vicky Gounder, Sukha Kahlon and the recently killed Jaipal Bhullar are all active on social media, thanks to several Facebook profiles and fan pages that are projecting them as heroes and messiahs wronged by the police. The TOI scanned several such profiles and fan pages and found many pictures of youngsters flaunting weapons. To connect with and mislead the youth, these ghost gangsters also use hashtags on Facebook like #RespectWomen, #AvoidDrugs, #HelpPoor, #SaveGirls and #StandAgainstWrong. Besides, they also wish other gangsters on their birthdays. On June 9, Jaipal Bhullar and gangster Jassi Kharar died in an encounter in West Bengal, but FB profiles in their names are still active. A profile named ‘Jai Pal Ferozepur’ uploaded a post on June 21, saying that the police have been harassing Bhullar’s family. It warned the police to stop harassing them else more gang wars would start in Punjab and they would be responsible for it. This FB post ends with ‘Best of Luck, Shera Khuban group and Jaipal Bhullar Ferozepur group’. Shera Khuban was also an infamous gangster who was encountered in 2012 in Bathinda. Another post on the same profile uploaded on June 14 seeks justice for the families of Jaipal Bhullar and Jassi Kharar, stating that the system had no solution to drug menace and smugglers, but they chased Bhullar and Kharar to Kolkata and killed them. A fan page in the name of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is lodged in Tihar Jail, has provided contacts on the page for people to get illegal weapons. Deputy commissioner of police (crime), Ludhiana, SPS Dhindsa said, “It has been observed that some people sitting abroad run such profiles and pages. They are friends or fans of these gangsters. Youngsters fall for illegal things for fame, easy money and glamour. The cyber cell and Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) team keep a check on such activities.” RN Dhoke, OCCU ADGP, said, “So far, the unit has done a great job and controlled organised crimes. The matter of openly providing contacts for illegal weapons is serious and I will get it checked.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/dead-gangsters-of-pb-alive-on-social-media-as-victims-heroes/articleshow/83931473.cms||Payal Dhawan

The heavy showers also led to waterlogging in some parts of the city and town areas. Nashik district as a whole has so far received about 78% of the average rains. “The city received good rainfall in the evening after 6.30 pm. The showers continued for two hours and it is a welcome thing for the citizens,” Rakesh Sharma, a local resident, said. Parts of Niphad also received good rainfall in the evening due to which the market areas and bus stand witnessed waterlogging, leading to slow movement of vehicular traffic. Due to the showers a section of Nashik-Aurangabad road was also submerged till the rain stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/heavy-rain-causes-waterlogging-in-nashik-city-and-niphad/articleshow/83934013.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata private hospitals defer camps till process gets streamlined||KOLKATA: Many off-site vaccination camps were put on hold by private hospitals on Monday after the new SOP for outreach camps was enforced. But the hospitals hope to come up with the proposed camps in a day or two once the process of implementing the new guideline is streamlined. Earlier, the private hospitals could start their off-site camps once the vaccination site was created on Co-Win by state health officials who shared the login ID and password with them. But now the health department has mandated that each camp will be inspected by a team from the health department before the drive kicks off. In addition, the approval letter from the department needs to be displayed at the camp along with the Co-Win authenticated code. “Fourteen off-site camps planned by the three units of AMRI and AMC Southern Avenue have been put on hold as we were told that off-site camps run by private hospitals can only be resumed only after a team from Swasthya Bhawan inspects those sites and issues a formal approval letter,” said an official at AMRI Hospital Group. The health department, however, allowed three ongoing off-site vaccination camps by the hospital group at Acropolis, South City and Eastern Diagnostics. “Three of our off-site vaccination centres have been put on hold for now. We hope that we can start operating those camps in a couple of days as we need to speed up the drive,” said Medica Group of Hospitals chairperson Alok Roy. Since the SOP came out late on Saturday night, the hospitals have been communicating with the organisers they have tied up with and informing them about these camps being deferred. “We had planned only one off-site camp for Monday. Due to the government guideline we have deferred this. Hope the process will get streamlined in a day or two,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (East) Narayana Health. “We were a little apprehensive about a two-day long outreach camp in Haldia, which started on Sunday. Luckily, the health department allowed us to continue it on Monday,” said Pradip Tondon, CEO Belle Vue Clinic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-defer-camps-till-process-gets-streamlined/articleshow/83934089.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A meeting of people’s representatives and top officials convened by sports minister V Abdurahiman here on Monday decided to take measures to renovate various stadiums in Kochi. TOI had on Sunday reported about the pathetic state of the playgrounds and stadiums in Kochi. The synthetic track at Maharaja’s College ground, which is in a neglected state, will be renovated. A high-level meeting will be conducted by the minister to discuss the steps to be adopted for renovating the synthetic track. State sports council president Mercy Kuttan informed that the council has earmarked Rs 7 crore for the renovation of the synthetic track. The formalities in this regard will be completed in consultation with various agencies and departments like higher education. The issues related to the construction of a hockey ground in Maharaja’s College ground will be sorted out. Maharaja’s College development council member CICC Jayachandran handed over the documents regarding an assurance given by the government in 2014 for constructing a hockey ground on par with international standards. The minister promised to look into the issue. The minister held discussions with Greater Cochin Development Authority chairman V Salim regarding the development of Ambedkar stadium. Repair works of all the stadiums, including the ones in Kochi, will be undertaken by Sports Kerala Ltd, a company being floated by the government. District collector S Suhas informed that the renovation of Parade Ground and Veli Ground at Fort Kochi will be undertaken by the district administration. A football academy for under-14 girls, which is the first of its kind in the state, will be started at Panampilly Nagar. It is under the aegis of the district sports council that the academy will be set up. “We can use the existing ground at Panampilly Nagar for the purpose. We will arrange hostel facilities for the girls,” district sports council president P V Sreenijin, MLA, said. For giving more focus on the development of sports in the district, a regional office of sports and youth affairs department will be set up in Ernakulam. Projects will be prepared for exploring the potential of Kochi as a venue for water sports. The minister visited grounds in the city, including Maharaja’s College ground. Hibi Eden MP, MLAs T J Vinod MLA, P T Thomas and K J Maxi, and mayor M Anilkumar accompanied him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-intervenes-to-renovate-stadiums-grounds-in-city/articleshow/83934072.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Vaccination count dips as many camps stay shut||KOLKATA: There was a slight dip in vaccination numbers in the state on Monday as many private hospitals had to put their off-site camps on hold. Till reports came in, the number of doses was hovering just below the 3-lakh mark, which was achieved on five consecutive days last week. “About 300 recipients each would have got inoculated at our 14 off-site camps that have been put on hold temporarily. But we hope we would be able to start the drive at these sites soon,” said an AMRI Hospital official. Till reports came in last, 2,93,491 doses had been administered in the state from 1996 vaccination sites, of which around 62,000 recipients got inoculated in Kolkata. “On any given day apart from Sunday, close to 200 private camps would be operational in Kolkata. On Monday, only 105 private camps functioned as many had to defer their outreach sites. But the issues on the new SOP will get ironed out in another two days,” said a state health department official. In addition to the 105 private centres, 246 government sites conducted the drive in the city. While the drive on hospital premises is restricted to between 300 to 1,000 doses per site, many hospitals have been adminsitering more doses at off-site camps or least 50% of its daily doses from these camps. “We can reach out to double or triple the number from our outdoor or off-site camps compared to the number of doses we administer in the hospital. Because some of us had to shut our camps for now, there will obviously be a drop in the daily number of doses. We hope the health department does not take time in issuing approval letters and other formalities so that we can start going to these camps at the earliest,” said an official of a private hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-count-dips-as-many-camps-stay-shut/articleshow/83934062.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

There had been many instances in the past where drones had swiftly returned back to Pakistan after dropping drugs, fake currency, arms and ammunition in Punjab’s border areas and just a few of them were gunned down by the vigilant officials of the Border Security Force (BSF). The police had in November last year also finalised the standard operating procedure (SOP) to handle the looming threat of Pakistan-backed drones. But even after that, a drone launched from Pakistan dropped 11 hand grenades on the night of December 19 last year in Gurdarspur district’s Salach village, nearly 1km from the Indo-Pak international border, and returned back. BSF as well as the Punjab police had claimed to have spotted the drone in the night sky and fired multiple shots at it. This happens since most of the drones or UAVs are not detected by radars and they are operated generally during the nights. SSP of one of the border districts of Punjab told TOI, “These drones have become a big challenge for the security agencies and till the suitable anti-drone technology is available, we have to deal with these lethal UAVs through strict vigil round the clock.” DGP: Pinpoint drone movement areas Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta held a meeting with senior officers of the police and BSF in Amritsar to discuss challenges posed by drone movements from across the border. The state police chief asked the officers to use the last two years’ data to pinpoint areas which are conducive to drone movements. The DGP also suggested installing infrared CCTV cameras on the road network in border villages and asked the police officers to list out the possible camera points in the vulnerable areas or roads. The meeting was attended by ADGP internal security RN Dhoke, ADGP STF B Chandrashekhar, IG border range S P S Parmar, commissioner of police Amritsar S S Gill, SSP Amritsar (rural) Gulneet Singh Khurana and SSP Tarn Taran Dhruman Nimbale, besides IG BSF Mahipal Yadav, DIGs of different BSF sectors. The DGP also asked commissioner of police Amritsar and SSPs of border districts to launch a crackdown on drug smugglers and identify hotspots infamous for drugs smuggling. He also emphasised on the arrest of proclaimed offenders and bail jumpers in NDPS cases .BSF needs to have anti-drone tech: Ex-DIG J S Saran, former deputy inspector general, BSF, said, “BSF does have anti-drone technology. And considering the threat factor, the force should acquire the same at the earliest.” Talking to TOI on Monday, Saran said cross-border militants, who enjoy the backing of ISI, were capable of acquiring and flying drones which could be used as a distraction also. “They could send a drone to divert the attention of BSF and help militants infiltrate into India from some other place,” he said. A senior BSF official who didn’t wish to be named said they were using the best of the technology available with them. Following Pathankot Air Force Station terrorist attack in 2016, BSF had reportedly raised demand for modern radars and other surveillance equipment with the government, but according to sources, only a fraction of their demands had been fulfilled. “In the past, we had demanded certain surveillance equipment to upgrade ourselves in wake of growing cross-border threats,” the sources added.

Notably, both the two firms are accused of irregularities in conducting Covid-19 tests. Goyal was called to Haridwar from Mumbai for the interrogation. Circle officer Rakesh Rawat, SIT head, told TOI, “We interrogated Anudesh Goyal and also questioned the owners of Max Corporate Services and Nalwa Laboratories on Monday.” Interestingly, the officials of both Max Corporate Services and Nalwa Laboratories have denied any involvement in the scam.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC refers Mazgaon school e-class row to state panel||MUMBAI: Bombay high court (HC) has referred to a state-appointed grievance redress committee a dispute between a school management and a parent whose two kids were denied access to online classes for non-payment of fees. The father of the two students of Diamond Jubilee High School, Mazgaon, had moved HC over the “irrational hike of fees” and to direct that it reconsider the hike due to the pandemic. On June 10, while allowing the students to attend classes and the father to undertake t o pay fees due if he fails in his petition, Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrakant Bhadang asked the state to inform if the committee constituted to look into fee disputes will also decide such cases. They said, “Several such petitions are coming to court and it is not possible to decide cases of individual students.” The state’s advocate on June 24 said there is a four-member committee constituted for Mumbai at Navi Mumbai to look into various grievances and disputes that arise between parents and school managements. Also, that the “present issue [denial of onlines classes]” can be looked into and resolved by the panel. Advocates R Sathyanarayanan and Nandini Menon, for the father and school respectively, said that their clients will go before the committee. But Menon said it must be open to the school to challenge maintainability of the issues before the committee. “Get it resolved. Are you interested in litigating? What difference which authority resolves the issue?” asked Justice Jamdar. The judges directed the committee to consider the petition and school’s reply to redress the grievances and to inform the parties of a date for their interaction. Posting the next hearing on August 5, they allowed the parties “to place the outcome ofthe interaction before the court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-refers-mazgaon-school-e-class-row-to-state-panel/articleshow/83936333.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Trichy||Shopping hubs spring back to life||Trichy: People who had been waiting for the reopening of textiles and jewellery outlets over the last few days didn’t make any delay in rushing to the shops on Monday bringing the shopping hubs of Trichy back to life.Major textile shops and jewellery outlets located in Big Bazaar Street, NSB Road, West Bouleward Road, Thillai Nagar, KK Nagar and the central bus stand in the city attracted decent crowds right from the morning on Monday. Resumption of public transport also facilitated people from all walks to visit shopping spots. Monday was also the last auspicious (Muhurtham) day of this season, said textile outlets. The next wedding season will start only in September, and there are no festivals in the coming weeks. This has led to moderate crowding in most of the textile shops, and people who are in immediate need of shopping made use of the opportunity. For many people like S Santhosh, 35, from Subramaniapuram who came to buy clothes for his new born, reopening of shops was a boon. V Rajesh, 50, from Woraiyur came to purchase a saree for his wife on her birthday, but he came alone anticipating a large crowd at the textile outlets. Rajesh who visited a couple of textiles said that he could see fewer children in the shops unlike usual days. It is good that people avoid bringing their children, he said. While the jewellery shops saw moderate crowds, many shop owners said they came to know about the government announcement on opening only late on Sunday. “Shops could have been allowed to open at least two weeks ago when Puducherry announced relaxations,” said N Chandrasekaran, president of Tiruchirapalli Jewellers Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/shopping-hubs-spring-back-to-life/articleshow/83934127.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Kochi||Kochi : Call to protect Malabari synagogue gets louder||KOCHI: Kochi is a city which is rich in heritage but poor in protecting it. Despite the fact that historians and heritage conservationists have been demanding measures to protect the Kadavumbhagam synagogue for almost a decade, the monument with a history of more than four-and-a-half centuries is in ruins. According to former Kochi mayor K J Sohan, there are many monuments and objects of heritage value in Kochi. “But when it comes to the protection of such monuments we lag behind. Kadavumbhagam synagogue, which was a place of worship for the Malabari Jews, is one of the most important heritage monuments in Kochi. It is a symbol of secular heritage and historic testimony of coexistence of various communities in harmony in Kochi. So, it is a very valuable monument and should be protected at any cost,” Sohan said. “It was the Malabari Jews who first came to Kerala. The Paradesi Jews who are also known as white Jews came to Kochi centuries after the arrival of Malabari Jews,” Sohan said. The structure of the synagogue is in a dilapidated condition. “If the authorities fail to take urgent measures to stabilize the structure, the synagogue building will collapse any time,” Sohan said. According to corporation health standing committee chairman T K Asharaf, the authorities’ callous attitude is the main hurdle in the way of heritage protection. “It was in 1999 that the measures to renovate and protect Ariyittuvazhcha Kovilakam in Mattancherry were started. After carrying out the renovation works, the state archaeology department declared the kovilakam a protected monument in 2018. But the kovilakam, which has a great history, has never been opened to the public since the department took over it,” Asharaf said. “The installation of the new heir of erstwhile Kingdom of Cochin was conducted with a ceremony called Ariyittuvazhcha held here,” Asharaf said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/call-to-protect-malabari-synagogue-gets-louder/articleshow/83934117.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The team seized packaging machines, printed wrappers and a small consignment of fake drugs. On Monday, another team comprising drug inspectors of three districts and local police raided a premises in Muzaffarnagar and arrested Balraj, the kingpin of the racket. Earlier in Baghpat, a machine operator, Surender Singh, was arrested from the spot even as the owner of the house where the packaging unit was set up, Gaffar Ahmad, fled. Raids are being conducted on his possible hideouts. Giving details, Vaibhav Babbar, drug inspector of Baghpat, said “During questioning of Surender, it has come to light that these drugs are manufactured in Muzaffarnagar and sold in the rural and sub rural medical stores of Meerut, Baghpat, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar and other districts.” Babbar revealed that the mastermind of the racket, Balraj. had procured the packaging machinery from the discarded units of drug manufacturing industries of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and rented the equipment to associates who would package the medicines supplied by him. “Gaffar is one such associate of Balraj who had started this 'business' on a trial basis during the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We recovered 300 tablets of a painkiller and a few antibiotics which have been sent for testing to an Agra lab.” An FIR has been filed against the two under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 274 (adulteration of drugs), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 276 (sale of drug as different preparation) and relevant sections of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. In Muzaffarnagar, where Balraj was arrested, Abhishek Yadav, SSP said, "Balraj has been arrested and we are still in the middle of investigations to ascertain the extent of his operations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/fake-drugs-racket-busted-meds-made-in-mngr-packed-in-baghpat/articleshow/83931562.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Before govt slams brakes, one camp gives 138 shots of hope||KOLKATA: One hundred and thirty-eight people were vaccinated in one of the last private vaccination camps held at a Baguiati club on Sunday before the government put on hold all such camps to frame more rules to run private off-site vaccination centres. This move came after a fake vaccination camp was unearthed in Kasba last week. On Monday, vaccination centres inside hospitals (both government and private) and KMC clinics were operational with the exception of some off-site centres inside the malls. Private hospitals cancelled all their off-site vaccination drives. For off-site vaccination centres, the government on Saturday had issued a list of guidelines that included the submission of joint application by the private health facility and the participating organisation to hold an inoculation camp, permission from local police stations, vaccination site to be created on CoWin and approval letter from the health department. “We submitted an application with the local police station and the local councillor. The local civic body and other agencies were informed too about the vaccination drive in the club,” said Deb Kumar Pal, secretary of Baguiati Sport Council. “We intend to conduct more such camps once proper guidelines are framed as we are being flooded with requests from locals.” One hundred and forty-three people had registered while 138 of them got vaccinated at the club. “This club has a very good reputation. Moreover, they have tied up with a reputed hospital. So, I had no doubt before coming here for vaccination,” said Sutapa Sen, a resident of Jessore Road, who got vaccinated at the camp. AMRI Hospitals conducted the vaccination drive. “We have already taken permission from the CMOH. All the government guidelines were followed during the vaccination drive,” said a representative of the hospital present at the vaccination centre in Baguiati on Sunday. Earlier, all private vaccination centres had to fill up a form, submit it to the health department that created a page on the Co-Win portal for the particular camp. Now an additional clearance letter is needed while more details of the camp and the vaccination centre are being sought in the application form. The health department now takes 48 hours from the time of application to issue the final clearance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/before-govt-slams-brakes-one-camp-gives-138-shots-of-hope/articleshow/83934135.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The TNSTC operated long distance and city bus services after the state government relaxed Covid-19 lockdown norms in 27 districts on Monday. Out of the 735 buses that were kept ready to operate on Monday, TNSTC Trichy division operated only 640 buses, which include 349 city buses. However, the buses plying on the long-distance routes stopped at the borders of 11 districts where lockdown norms were yet to be relaxed. Buses from Trichy were stopped at Pettavaithalai on the Karur district border. Similarly, Thottiyam was the last point for buses that were plying on the Salem route. Buses didn’t ply beyond Valavanthankottai on the Thanjavur route. Buses from Thuraiyur of Trichy to Salem and Namakkal were stopped at Mangampatti and Pavithram. Similarly buses from Ariyalur, Perambalur and Jeyamkondam to Salem and Thanjavur were stopped on the district borders. However, buses to Chennai, Pudukottai and southern districts were operated as usual. “There were only a few passengers when the buses started service at 6 am. But passengers kept coming in as the day progressed and buses were running with full capacity by 9am,” said a bus conductor on the Palakkarai route. “Many people used the bus to reach their offices. The patronage was better towards Malaikottai and Gandhi market as people turned out for shopping,” said a TNSTC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/80-govt-buses-back-on-road-to-see-good-patronage-in-trichy/articleshow/83934099.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

District collectors have been directed to ensure the launch of work on one lakh houses each day on July 1, 3 and 4. The newly appointed joint collectors (housing) have been asked to gear up field-level administration to complete the task on a mission mode. Housing minister Cherukuvada Sri Ranganatha Raju took stock of the plans with the officials on Monday. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy recently gave green signal for launching of 15.6 lakh houses under YSR Jagananna housing programme in the first phase. The state government has granted nearly 30 lakh house sites to the eligible poor across the state and granted pucca houses under Housing for All programme. The state government is granting Rs 1.8 lakh to each beneficiary for completion of single bed room housing unit. “We are providing steel and cement at reasonably low prices when compared to market prices besides giving sand free of cost. We are also providing them electrical equipment including tubelights, bulbs and fans free of cost,” said minister Sri Ranganatha Raju. He directed the officials to transport the required sand to the housing colonies to avoid additional transport cost on beneficiaries. He also asked the key line departments which are involved in development of basic infrastructure to start the works in order to instill confidence among the beneficiaries to start the works on the housing units. The housing department roped in the amenities secretaries (engineering assistants) in village and ward secretariats to geo-tag the grounding of houses as per the schedule. The secretaries and field level volunteers have been asked to organize the meetings with the beneficiaries a day before the grounding ceremony. “Launching of 15.6 lakh housing units in one fiscal is a record in the country. We are working overtime to achieve the target set by the chief minister YS Jagan,” said Ajay Jain, special chief secretary (housing).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/work-on-3l-houses-in-jagananna-colonies-to-begin-in-1st-wk-of-july/articleshow/83934140.cms||Samdani MN

Adhav said the PMC, instead of inviting private tenders for waste collection, should sign a long-term contract with SWaCH. He said the women involved in waste collection were on the field even during Covid-19 and should get insurance cover. He added said the PMC should provide space for garbage processing that is carried out by SWaCH. A proposal has been under consideration by the civic body to appoint a contractor for daily collection of garbage in the city. The standing committee has been extending the contract with SWaCH for a few months. Adhav said, “The PMC should explain why no longterm agreement is being signed with SWaCH which has effectively been collecting garbage from all over the city. The SWaCH members are also involved in segregating and processing the garbage. The PMC should consider all aspects and refrain from appointing a contractor.” The agitation was also supported by the city Congress unit. Leader of the house, Ganesh Bidkar, said steps would be taken to ensure that SWaCH continues its services. The issue will be discussed at the general body meeting. He also said the administration has been asked to study SWaCH work and table a detailed report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baba-adhav-leads-wastepickers-stir-demanding-long-term-contract/articleshow/83934162.cms||---

Though the government decided to allot the fund as compensation for 16 cents land taken over from the college in 2014, the sum has not been transferred to the college’s account even after seven years. A letter sent by additional secretary of higher education department to Maharaja’s College principal shows that there were moves to give compensation to the college. The additional secretary in his letter dated March 24, 2014 asks the principal to deposit Rs 8 crore, which is the compensation amount, in PWD’s account for renovating the hockey ground, constructing a ladies’ hostel and renovating men’s hostel. “While handing over the precious land to the Metro agency, there was an understanding that Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) should construct a hockey ground on par with international standards in Maharaja’s College ground as a compensation for handing over the land. But the amount has not been transferred to the college’s account so far. Now, KMRL is denying the fact that there was such an understanding,” said college development council member CICC Jayachandran. “The KMRL or the government should allot funds for the renovation of the college ground,” he said. At the same time, KMRL officials said there had not been any such agreement that the Metro agency would construct an international hockey ground for the college. “There had been talks in this regard. The government is learnt to have given a verbal assurance that it will take care of the development of the college stadium,” a KMRL official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/college-yet-to-get-compensation-for-land/articleshow/83934161.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||CMO blocked venue for Arvind Kejriwal’s presser, says AAP; Punjab Amarinder Singh refutes claim||CHANDIGARH: On the eve of AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal’s visit to Chandigarh to announce poll sops, a blame game erupted over the venue for his press conference on Tuesday. AAP functioanries accused the Congress government of denying permission to hold a press conference at Punjab Bhawan. However, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh rejected the charge. It began with AAP flashing a message to mediapersons in the afternoon, alleging that the chief minister’s office had denied permission for Kejriwal’s press meet at Punjab Bhawan. The event was planned for 1 pm on Tuesday. Party leaders said leader of opposition (LoP) in state assembly Harpal Singh Cheema’s office had approached the Punjab Bhawan for the event, but the reply was that the venue was already booked. AAP alleged that it was done at the behest of the CMO. When the issue was highlighted on social media, the authorities confirmed the booking. However, by that time, Chandigarh Press Club had been booked by the party, they claimed. AAP state president Bhagwant Mann said, “The government is scared as the Delhi CM (Kejriwal) will expose the lies of the Congress.” AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan questioned that when former Uttarakhand CM of Congress Harish Rawat can hold events at Punjab Bhawan, why was AAP’s request turned down? Party’s co-incharge of Punjab affairs Raghav Chadha also tweeted, “Capt Amarinder’s fear of Kejriwal has reached a point where his office has denied us permission to hold a press conference at the pre-decided venue. Nevertheless, Kejriwal will make a mega announcement in Chandigarh which will send 440-volt current to Capt & his party.” Capt Amarinder Singh rejected the charge with a tweet. “Totally not true. We let Arvind Kejriwal address a rally here just a few days back so why should we stop him now from having a press conference. If he wants I’d be happy to arrange his lunch too. AAP just wants to do drama even if it means lying,” he said. Later, the venue for the press meet was confirmed at Chandigarh Press Club. It will be the second visit of Kejriwal to Punjab in two weeks. Earlier, he had come for induction of former IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Partap in the party. Political observers feel AAP wants to preempt the Congress by announcing promises like free power. The AICC has also asked the Punjab government to implement key welfare schemes in the remaining period of the government to brighten its poll prospects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cmo-blocked-venue-for-kejriwals-presser-says-aap-capt-refutes-claim/articleshow/83936434.cms||---

They said the drive had made them homeless and forced them to run from pillar to post for a shelter. The slum dwellers demanded that their houses be repaired by the civic body and they be allowed to live there. Member of Parliament Supriya Sule met the slum dwellers and assured them of a solution soon. The agitators said the action was influenced by a private builder, they alleged. Workers of NCP and Vanchit Bahujanvikas Aghadi (VBA) present for the agitation raised slogans against the civic administration. Some also raised slogans against guardian minister Ajit Pawar in the presence Sule. “There should be no politics in this issue.

Ravi Yadav, senior accountant at the accountant general’s office, and his friend Jagat Singh, data entry operator in the same office, sustained knife wounds on their arms and knees as they desperately tried to fend off a violent attack from two persons reportedly with a criminal past. Vanchiyur police responded promptly to a distress call and came to their rescue. The police also took them to the hospital and stationed two officers in front of their rented house. They filed a complaint at the Pettah police station. The police are tracking down two suspects. One of the suspects was recently released on parole from jail. The incident took place around 8.40pm on Sunday. Ravi, his wife Madhavi, their six-month-old daughter, Jagat, his wife Pooja and their one-and-a-half-year-old son went for a walk after dinner. They were about to return to their homes when Pooja and Madhavi came running to their husbands, alerting them about the two youths, who were pestering and were trying to grab them. Sensing danger, Ravi and Jagat handed the babies over to the wives. The duo tried to dissuade the youths, but one of them punched Ravi in the face. Ravi tried to push him and the other youth fished out a knife from the scooter and swished at them. Ravi and Jagat sustained wounds while trying to evade the attack. “They were coming at us with a sharp knife and were aiming at my head. I tried as best as I could to defend myself because we were so concerned about the babies. We could block the attack using our bare hands. Our babies were terrified and started crying,” said Ravi. They somehow managed to get safely to their house, but the youths followed, shouting threats and abuses at them. On reaching their house, they locked themselves inside the gate. They stayed outside, hoping for the police to arrive. “The police came to our rescue soon. By the time we reached our house, there were other people on the street as well. This forced the youths to run away,” said Ravi. The police have constituted a special team to probe the incident. A suspect named Rajesh is being tracked down by the police. CCTV visuals are also being collected from the scene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/an-evening-walk-turns-into-nightmare-for-two-families/articleshow/83934317.cms||---

In a tweet in Punjabi, Kejriwal said, “With such high inflation, women are finding it difficult to run their households. In Delhi, we are offering 200 units of free electricity to every family. Women are very happy. In Punjab, women are troubled by inflation and the AAP government will give free power. Will meet in Chandigarh tomorrow.” AAP state president Bhagwant Mann said Kejriwal would announce schemes for Punjab on the lines of facilities being provided to people of Delhi.  “He could also promise to provide free electricity to the people of Punjab and to save them from the costly power tariff. Kejriwal will also present his formula for overcoming the power crisis in Punjab,” he added. AAP MLA Raghav Chadha also tweeted, “Delhi doesn’t produce its own electricity, still AAP Govt provides Free Bijli Punjab produces its own Electricity, yet Captain is looting its people Tomorrow, CM Arvind Kejriwal is going to announce a major gift for the women of Punjab.” Under the free electricity scheme in the national capital, domestic consumers can avail up to 200 units of free electricity. Mann added, “Every section of society is hit by inflation and women are the worst affected. Kejriwal would release his plan to provide more facilities to women and arrangements for their savings.” “Congress government of Punjab has failed to provide facilities to the people, due to which every section is feeling cheated. At present, paddy sowing is on in full swing but due to non-availability of electricity to the farmers; they are not sowing their paddy properly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delhi-cm-may-promise-free-power-in-pb/articleshow/83936498.cms||---

---||Thane||Three of every 10 Covid patients in Thane are opting for treatment outside city||THANE: As many as 30% of total active cases from Thane city or three of every ten Covid patients presently seem to be handled at facilities outside the city or the district, reveals government data. As per recent statistics, 278 of 973 active cases from Thane city till Sunday have been admitted to facilities outside the city or district limits. Meanwhile, around 14% of Kalyan-Dombivli active patients are seeking treatment outside the city while Navi Mumbai has a negligible volume of .3% cases being taken out. The number in Bhiwandi Nizampur with 22 cases also has nearly 27% patients admitted outside the city. The statistics have now given activists an opportunity to question the corporation and politicians if the health facilities in the city are not yet capable of handling the pandemic nearly 15 months later too. The administration maintained they are offering the best of treatment but claimed easy access to private facilities in neighbouring Mumbai or Navi Mumbai could be enticing residents to cross over. A resident of Thane recently preferred to get admitted to a facility outside Thane as he wasn’t sure of the quality of treatment at a private facility in the city. “My family wasn’t sure about the quality of treatment at the Thane private hospital and so got me admitted to one outside the city,” said the resident requesting anonymity. Activists meanwhile said it is a wake-up call for the administration and politicians to improve facilities in the city also. The situation reflects that the politicians from lake city have to set up more health infrastructure here instead of focusing more on road excavation and filling up. “Residents opting for other cities is understood last year or even last month as the demand for beds was more than what was available in the city. We should have had a good infrastructure for the taxpaying citizens. Not only have we not created new facilities for residents but the existing ones are also not maintained,” complained BJP city president and MLC Niranjan Davkhare. Deputy municipal commissioner Sandeep Malvi denied the possibility of Thane patients going out of the city for treatments and said the quality of facilities here was equally better. “We have patients coming in from neighbouring cities and have good quality civic and private hospitals so there is minimal chance of patients opting for other cities,” he said. A senior official from the health department added there could be a possibility of those residents travelling and testing positive and taking treatments locally. “The possibility of several corporates and certain government staff preferring treatment at designated hospitals could also be responsible for the numbers, which needs to be ascertained,” said the official. Mayor Naresh Mhaske also defended the stance of the corporation saying the numbers may be misleading and added that there has been a reverse trend as many from Mumbai and other areas are preferring admissions to Thane facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-3-of-every-10-covid-patients-in-thane-are-opting-for-treatment-outside-city/articleshow/83936548.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Joshi boarded an autorickshaw, which already had a person (Khule) inside, to reach the Swargate bus terminus. Joshi’s plan was to board a state transport bus to Palghar. Ghadge said,“On the pretext of dropping Khule to his house, Dharpale drove the autorickshaw in a lane at Padmavati and stopped at an isolated place around 11.05pm. Khule suddenly hit Joshi on his head with a stone, snatched the IT professional’s laptops, forced him to alight and sped away. The robbery came to light after Joshi alerted the police.” The officer said, “The duo were not wearing face masks. Based on their description and CCTV footage, a police team, led by senior inspector Swati Desai, arrested them and recovered the laptops and the three-wheeler,” When contacted, Joshi told TOI, “I tried to resist the two men, but in vain. One of the suspects suddenly hit me with a stone. I got two stitches on my head.” Joshi’s FIR relating to armed robbery under section 397 was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. A 35-year-old woman lodged an FIR with the Kondhwa police last week stating that an autorickshaw driver snatched her bag, comprising valuables worth Rs 27,500, over a dispute of paying fare. In another incident, the Wanowrie police last week arrested two men on the charge of posing as passengers and robbing two autorickshaw drivers of their cellphones by threatening them with a sickle in an underpass near the Kalepadal railway crossing on June 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/auto-driver-aide-held-on-charge-of-robbing-palghar-techie/articleshow/83934319.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Police arrest two for murdering cab driver||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A driver with an online cab aggregator firm was stabbed to death in his rented house at Chackai on Monday. He was found dead in a pool of blood in the kitchen during the early morning hours. The deceased is Sampath (40). Police were alerted by the staff of a private hospital after a man, apparently injured by slash wounds, got himself admitted there. The staff grew suspicious that the man may have been involved in a scuffle. Police picked on the tip and learnt that the injured man was involved in a murder. Police found out that the man had an accomplice and they intensified patrol. Police also learnt that the injured man was dropped off at the hospital in a car. An eyewitness noted down the car number owing to suspicion. The accomplice would later return to check on his friend at the hospital from where he was arrested. Sajad and Sanal Mohammad are the accused in the case. Police said that one of them harboured a grudge against Sampath since he thought that Sampath ratted him out in a ganja case. Sanal was arrested for peddling ganja in Attingal in 2020. Police recovered two knives from the crime scene. They understand that Sajad and Sanal came on the pretext of talking to Sampath and soon tried to kill him. He was first stabbed in the neck in the bedroom and was chased down to the kitchen. There, Sampath was stabbed on the neck, throat and face repeatedly. Sampath bled to death in the kitchen. Sampath had been living in the rented house for the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-arrest-two-for-murdering-cab-driver/articleshow/83934337.cms||---
---||Delhi||An incredible journey: From child labourer to engineer to Univ fellow||NEW DELHI: From working at an eatery in Mandsaur as a 13-year-old to becoming an engineer and now to being selected for the Young India Fellowship at Ashoka University, Shubham Rathore has come a long way, something he could perhaps never have imagined until rescued from child labour by Kailash Satyarthi’s Bachpan Bachao Andolan. He is the first to acknowledge this. “If they had not found me or rescued me, I wouldn’t be here today,” he told TOI. He had just entered his teen years when he moved from Pratapgarh in Rajasthan to Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur to find work. “I began working the night shift at a dhaba, being paid with a meal, not money,” said Rathore. “Then in May 2009, Bachpan Bachao Andolan rescued me.” He then received his family’s consent to study at Bal Ashram, a rehabilitation centre founded by Satyarthi and his wife, Sumedha Kailash. “My first memory of Satyarthi ji is about him asking me and five other new kids about our dreams. I had no idea, but he told us that life without a dream was meaningless and asked all of us to think about what we wanted to become in the future,” the young man said. “I was introduced to the world of books through the informal classes in Bal Ashram and enrolled in the local government school. I also became aware of my rights and began raising my voice against the exploitation of children.” Conducting awareness programmes on social evils in villages near Pratapgarh help the youngsters develop leadership skills. He then created a children’s group in school, called it ‘Bal Panchayat’ and initiated a dialogue with the local administration on the problems faced by the educational institution. Rathore went on to complete his electrical engineering from Laxmi Devi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Alwar. “In college, I was an active member of numerous youth groups and conducted awareness drives, in the process also getting his college administration to provide free tuition to the underprivileged children of the neighbouring village,” he said. After graduating, he became involved in child rights activism, especially child sexual abuse and trafficking. As part of Bharat Yatra, he got an opportunity to address the Laureates and Leaders for Children Summit in Jordan, where he urged business leaders, Nobel laureates and world politicians to ensure the implementation of child rights with a zero-tolerance approach. Now an associate engineer at Power Grid Corporation of India, Rathore applied for Ashoka University’s Young India Fellowship “to enhance my leadership skills and also to study further for a well-rounded multidisciplinary approach”. He told TOI, “My life can inspire other young people. I got my opportunity when I needed it the most. If I hadn’t been rescued, I’d have lingered on at that eatery. That is why I want to work for others. No child should work like I did in that dhaba.” Sumedha Kailash admitted to being very proud of Rathore. “I still remember his first day in Bal Ashram,” she said. “He was shy and did not talk to anyone. But slowly and steadily, he became comfortable with his new friends and family and grew into an active leader of change. Children of Bal Ashram are my children and as a mother, I have seen their transformation very closely, from traumatised youngsters liberated from child labour to confident change bringers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/an-incredible-journey-from-child-labourer-to-engineer-to-univ-fellow/articleshow/83936555.cms||---

The victim Mavji Gangadia (35), a resident of Jinjuda village in Chotila taluka of Surendranagar, was under treatment since May 31 following an assault by Dhama Khachar, Ravu Kathi and Lala Kathi over personal animosity. After the assault, Mavji, a farm labourer, was taken to the primary health centre in Chotila and then referred to Rajkot Civil Hospital. But as his condition did not improve, Mavji was shifted to a hospital in Ahmedabad where he succumbed to injuries. Police said that Mavji was survived by his wife and five children including three daughters. On Sunday, Mavji’s kin brought his body to the Nani Moldi police station from Ahmedabad and refused to cremate it till all three accused were arrested. Family members of the deceased alleged that it had been nearly a month since Mavji was brutally thrashed, but the police had not taken any action against the accused. As the people from Mavji’s community started gathering at the police station, the cops swung into action and arrested the three accused and assured the family they would get justice. Following the arrest of the accused trio, Mavji’s body was cremated. According to police sources, Mavji’s brother Ashok Gangadia had committed suicide three months ago. Later, Mavji came to know that his brother had ended his life as his wife was having an affair with one of the accused Dhama Khachar. When Dhama came to know that Mavji knew about his relationship and his aides attacked him on night of May 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/labourer-thrashed-a-month-ago-succumbs-three-arrested/articleshow/83931818.cms||---
---||Madurai||Courts can’t interfere in government’s policy decisions, says high court||Madurai: Courts cannot interfere in policy decisions of the state government, Madras high court has said while hearing a plea pertaining to distribution of free laptops to students. The court made the observation in a public interest litigation filed by Kaudeen, a resident of Pudukkottai district who sought a direction to the state to provide free laptops to Class XII students of the 2017-18 batch. In the counter-affidavit filed by the authorities, it was stated that nearly 2.08 lakh laptops have been purchased in addition to the previously procured 5.32 lakh for 2021 for distribution to eligible students. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice T S Sivagnanam observed that they hope that the state has the resources to provide laptops to even toddlers as the newer generations appear to be adept at using gadgets almost from birth. The judges observed that it is essentially a matter of policy and availability of resources that impel a decision of such kind. When the state has considered it appropriate to provide laptops to certain categories of people and not to others, the state must be seen to have considered all aspects.  In matters of policy, the courts scarcely interfere, though they may request the state to look into the possibility of extending the state largesse to a wider section of society. Hence, the judges disposed of the case without any affirmative order, but requesting the state to consider whether the distribution of laptops can be made to younger students than what has already been decided.

The court made the observations while dismissing a public interest litigation filed by a siddha doctor who is the managing trustee of Indian Medicine Welfare Trust based in Madurai.Petitioner Jeyavenkatesh stated that the state government had passed a GO dated February 10, 1970 for establishing siddha dispensaries and appointing doctors in temples with an annual income of Rs 1lakh. According to information obtained through RTI, pursuant to the GO, siddha doctors were appointed at six temples but no steps were taken to appoint doctors at other temples. He stated that the state government by taking into consideration the importance of siddha medicine had passed the GO and created such posts. Hence, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench seeking to establish such dispensaries in the remaining temples.When the case was taken up for hearing, the government counsel submitted that necessary steps were taken in this regard. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that taking into consideration the present situation, no such positive direction can be given for the government to establish such facilities. The larger issue would be as to whether it would be advisable to run a dispensary on a temple premises when the government has established primary health centres, fever clinics and other taluk-level hospitals. Hence the judges observed that the policy of opening dispensaries in temples itself requires a relook. The judges observed that the prayer sought for by the petitioner cannot be granted and hence dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/policy-to-set-up-siddha-units-in-temples-needs-relook-hc/articleshow/83934342.cms||Kaushik Kannan

According to the directorate of health services, six healthcare personnel lost their lives due to the pandemic, including three at private hospitals. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced that the state would pay the kin of health care workers Rs 50 lakh if they lost their lives due to Covid. GFP had filed an RTI with the DHS asking if any compensation has been released to the healthcare workers who died due to Covid-19. “DHS has given us a reply that no compensation has been disbursed to the kin of the healthcare workers. This makes it clear that the chief minister is simply making statements. The government is bankrupt,” said GFP vice-president Durgadas Kamat. He also said that Sawant is making false promises to people and healthcare workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/release-money-to-kin-of-dead-health-workers/articleshow/83936525.cms||---

The first day will have core papers — mathematics, science and social science — and the second day only languages. The exams, to be held from 10.30am to 1.30pm, will be in the multiple-choice format and students will write on the OMR sheet. This is the second year that the SSLC exams are being conducted under the shadow of Covid. The government, however, decided to cancel II PU exams this year owing to a brutal second wave of the pandemic. The minister said the health department will soon release a detailed standard operating procedure about safety measures for the conduct of the examinations. Some of the steps are: Prohibitory orders in force around 200 metres of exam centres; students can walk in as early as 8.30am to prevent crowding; and their temperature will be recorded and hands sanitized before they enter the hall. Over 8.7 lakh students will write the exam this time as against 8.4 lakh last year. Exam centres have been increased from 48,000 to 73,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/8-7l-will-write-crunched-sslc-exam-on-july-19-22/articleshow/83940414.cms||---

Now they are scared for their lives. “We are planning to shift to another house. We don’t feel safe here anymore. It is such a trauma and we don’t know how we could save our babies,” says Ravi. He ran with his family to their house with bleeding fingers and arms. Blood drops were spattered all over the front yard of the rented house and on the road. “My wife is yet to recover from the shock. She has been taking care of our baby. All we wanted was to have a quiet night walk. But it turned out to be something terrible,” says Ravi. The residents were also shocked by the incident. “The road where it happened usually gets deserted around evening. Since it was total lockdown, the road was empty. What happened with those families is shocking to us. We have been living here for a long time and to know it is not safe is not a good feeling,” says Indran. At the police station, the women were panic-stricken. They held the babies tightly and struggled to speak as the media threw questions at them. Eventually, after completing the formalities at the police station, they felt slightly relieved to get back to their home, somewhere they believe would be safer. The families are worried about the threats. “Before they left, they said something in Malayalam. We understand Malayalam. They were saying it was not over and they were coming for us. We don’t have any connections here. We go to the office and lead a normal life. We don’t know how to handle such people,” says Ravi. Their colleagues were also shocked after coming to know about the incident. Many of them reached the station to offer support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/we-want-to-shift-to-a-safer-place-victim/articleshow/83934376.cms||---
---||Goa||Urfan Mulla linked to fake B Ed certificate racket, says Goa Forward Party||PANAJI: A fake B Ed certificate racket is operational in at least six schools with BJP spokesperson Urfan Mulla emerging as the lynchpin of the operation, said Goa Forward Party on Monday. Citing official documents, including a note signed by former education director Vandana Rao, GFP alleged that Mulla even attempted to tamper with official records in order to cover his tracks. Mulla, said GFP office bearer John Nazareth, jumped from Congress to BJP to seek protection from a vigilance inquiry and criminal proceedings. “If GFP comes back to power, we will ensure that education is imparted through the properly educated teachers,” said Nazareth. “Action will be taken against fake teachers and those who encouraged fake certificates and facilitated, definite action will be taken against those persons.” The allegations against Mulla have surfaced after the BJP spokesperson spoke out against any likely alliance between the Congress and GFP and also accused Congress and GFP office bearers of corruption. In reply, GFP has released documentary evidence to show that on June 23, 2020, Rao wrote to the Anti-Corruption Bureau informing them that forged B. Ed certificates were being used to obtain teaching jobs at several schools in and around Margao. File notings also show that Mulla sought to inspect documents pertaining to one of the schools. “While inspecting the file it is observed that the applicant (Urfan Mulla) tried to tamper with the documents from the inspected file at pg 486/C,” said Rao in a the note. Nazareth alleged that Mulla is the headmaster of an aided school and the chairman of another school in Gogol where teachers with fake B.Ed certificates were being given jobs. Nazareth said that GFP will file an official complaint with the relevant authorities and if the government fails to take action, GFP would approach the courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mulla-linked-to-fake-b-ed-cert-racket-says-gfp/articleshow/83936558.cms||---

The meeting chaired by the party’s former union secretary and district Amma Peravai joint secretary M K Velavan unanimously stated that Sasikala should head the party and strengthen it.This meeting has made ripples in the party that has passed resolutions at the district level demanding cadres and functionaries to stay away from Sasikala or face expulsion. Kovilpatti MLA and AIADMK Tuticorin north district secretary Kadambur C Raju addressed a press meet at the Kovilpatti MLA office in this regard on Monday, terming the meeting and resolutions as invalid.Raju said except for Velavan no other participant at the meeting is connected with AIADMK. Stating that the others have already moved away from the party or removed for anti-party activities, he added that Velavan will be removed from the party.He added that they are not bothered about Sasikala planning to travel across the state and meet cadres, “but it should not be under the AIADMK banner.” According to him, the expelled leader’s tour and efforts to regain position in the AIADMK will hardly have an impact on the party just like the AMMK.The resolutions that were passed in Sunday’s meeting include condemning all the resolutions that were passed against Sasikala at the party meetings at the headquarters and district level. They said the resolutions were not a reflection of the district, union and grassroot level functionaries and were passed without getting their views.Stating that Sasikala only tried to unify the party and strengthen it in her interactions with cadres over the phone, they strongly condemned the dictatorial way in which the cadres were removed from the party. They also appealed to Sasikala to tour districts after the Covid-19 lockdown and interact with party functionaries and cadres to strengthen the party.They also said that selfish motives of Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam against the interest of the cadres resulted in the party losing the election. Other resolutions include condemning former ministers D Jayakumar, Natham Viswanathan, C V Shanmugam and K P Munusamy for their remarks against Sasikala and condemning district functionaries who are allegedly encouraging district, union and panchayat level elected representatives from the party to join the DMK.Meanwhile, the Vilathikulam Police registered a case against 80 people who took part in Sunday’s meeting under IPC sections 143, 269 and 270 and section 2 of The Epidemic Diseases Act for violation of lockdown restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmk-functionary-passes-resolution-urging-sasikala-to-head-party/articleshow/83934368.cms||---

The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Shiva V R, a resident of Trichy who sought a direction to the government to fix prices of all essential commodities including edible oil, pulses and vegetables and also to establish price monitoring cells in all districts. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that such a relief cannot be granted in a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution. The judges also took note of the fact that the state government has ensured supply of all essential articles through public distribution system. They said the issue regarding price fixation is a policy matter to be decided by the appropriate authorities in accordance with relevant statutes. Hence, they are not inclined to grant any direction as sought for by the petition. However, the court said the petitioner was at liberty to pursue his representation with the authorities as he had filed this petition within hardly 10 days of submitting it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-fix-prices-of-essentials-disposed-of/articleshow/83934365.cms||---

Hodarkar, a former BJP karyakarta, said BJP has become “dictatorial” and its workers are not given the freedom to work. “Congress has its own base in Curchorem. The time is less, but if everyone work together and if the workers and supporters are brought together, it is possible to win,” said Hodarkar, who was a close aide of Curchorem MLA and power minister Nilesh Cabral. Hodarkar, who is seen as the likely Congress candidate against Cabral, parted ways with the minister during the elections for the post of chairperson of CCMC. Minutes after Hodarkar was declared elected as chairperson of the 15-member council on April 1, nine Cabral-backed councillors moved a no-confidence motion against him. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said Hodarkar’s entry into Congress will boost the party’s chances and will attract more people to it. Meanwhile, the party announced that it would launch a Covid-19 outreach programme where party workers will visit families of those who lost loved ones. It also plans to hold protests against the steep hike in fuel prices. Making the announcement, Congress functionary Altinho Gomes said party workers will visit at least 10-15 homes of Covid-19 victims every day to condole the family members. AICC interim president Sonia Gandhi will also write a personal note to each of the victims in a bid to reach out ahead of the coming assembly elections. Congress has also decided to launch an agitation against fuel prices, including a cycle yatra at the district level. On July 10, it will hold a cycle rally from Margao, with a similar rally taking off from Panaji on July 16. A march and a signature campaign will also be organised, said Gomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ex-cabral-aide-joins-cong-calls-for-unity-to-take-on-bjp/articleshow/83936543.cms||---
---||India||Govt plans national stockpile of life-saving drugs||MUMBAI: The government is in discussions with the pharma and medical devices industry to create a "national stockpile" of life-saving drugs and vital equipment to combat the third Covid wave. This could prevent the massive shortages of critical drugs like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, key antibiotics, and devices like oxygenators and pulse oximeters, as witnessed during the brutal second wave with a huge daily case-load. At present, the government is undertaking only a weekly review of the status of drugs' availability, and is tracking manufacturing of the black fungus drug, Amphotericin B. For medical devices, a taskforce has been formed under the department of pharmaceuticals, which will shortlist critical items and seek advice from stakeholders, industry experts told TOI. The stockpile will help companies to plan and manage inventory to strengthen supply chains and resolve glitches in manufacturing of raw materials (active pharmaceutical ingredients), and finished formulations (drugs). "Strategic stockpiling of critical Covid drugs, oxygen and other Covid requirements is critical, based on our learning of Covid 2.0. Centre and state governments are working on the same. We need to be prepared so that we are not caught off guard this time around. Companies are working on their production cycle and inventory management so that there is a faster turnaround of critical drugs in case of an emergency. Manufacturing and supply chain agility has been important and will continue to be important in the unpredictable environment on account of Covid," Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance secretary general Sudarshan Jain told TOI. Besides the two antivirals, antibiotics like Azithromycin and Doxycycline, and steroids including dexamethasone, there is need to stockpile critical medical aids like nasal cannulas, oxygen regulator and humidifiers, ICU beds and multi-parameter patient monitors. "It's good that some state governments are shoring up inventory of essential Covid-related medical devices in anticipation of a third wave. We have recommended to the Centre to consider creating a stockpile of 25-30% of annual national demand, and warehouse it in the four geographical zones. These should be particularly the ones which have limited domestic and international availability, and need longer lead times. Most countries like the US create these as part of disaster management," stated Rajiv Nath, forum coordinator at AiMeD, an umbrella association of domestic manufacturers of med devices. Experts believe that a third wave may hit the country over the next few months, fuelled by the emergence of the Delta-plus variant. The second wave during March-May saw an unprecedented increase in the daily case-load from just around 10,000 in February to nearly 4 lakh in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-plans-national-stockpile-of-life-saving-drugs/articleshow/83940369.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

However, Shaji and his wife, Savitha, who run a two-wheeler workshop, confronted the goons and helped the families. They also alerted the police station and averted a major tragedy. “We were in the kitchen when we heard a child crying. We were scared that it was our brother’s baby. Suddenly we rushed outside and saw two families trying to fight off two persons, who were going at them with a knife. They were bleeding. It happened in front of an apartment, but everybody was scared to come out. They also switched off the light at the gate and it was all dark. We couldn’t watch those babies crying and we went to help,” says Savitha, who has been residing at Pettah for 16 years. Savitha says that when she and her husband intervened, the goons turned to them. “They asked what our business was. One of them said they are Hindi speaking people, why do you care? We tried our best to help the families run away. Then one of the goons threatened that they would come back and attack us. I called the Vanchiyur station and said two families were in danger. Thankfully they responded soon or else it would have turned into something worse,” says Savitha. Savitha says they are not scared. “We don’t wish such a terrible thing to happen to our children. We are not scared. We did what was needed,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/this-fearless-couple-came-to-families-aid/articleshow/83934425.cms||---

The government has appointed Darashaw and Co, and the All-India institute of local self-government for the purpose. Their role would be to coordinate with the Centre and secure funds under different schemes in different sectors. The consultants would be paid up to 2% as “success fee”. “Since 1980, the state government has not sent utilisation certificates to the Union government,” he said. Reacting to the development, GFP president Vijai Sardesai said that the state government’s decision to hire consultants to source funds from the Centre is “laughable and ridiculous”. Sawant, reacting sharply, said that those who are unaware of facts should first find out before they speak. He also said that the state government has availed of various Centre-sponsored schemes over the past two years, and that the government has started planning for the future. “We have to prepare detailed projects to get the scheme. I am capable of getting the Central schemes (funds), but we have appointed consultants to prepare detailed project reports,” he said.

---||Pune||Demand for e-vehicles soars as fuel prices in Pune continue to be on fire||PUNE: Registration of e-vehicles and hybrid four-wheelers running on both petrol and CNG is gathering pace primarily due to the constant rise in fuel prices in the city. On Monday, a litre of petrol and diesel in Pune cost Rs 104.20 and Rs 94.59, respectively. The registration of e-vehicles steadily increased in the first six months of this year, except during April and May when there were stringent Covid-induced restrictions and the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad Regional Transport Offices (RTO) were closed. “We were looking at an increase in registration of e-vehicles by almost 73% in March this year compared to January in the Pune RTO. June recorded a significant increase and the registrations are expected to surpass the January figures,” a Pune RTO official said. In the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO, the numbers are more impressive with the June figures (until June 28) already surpassing the January numbers. “We are looking at an increase of around 124% when we compare the figures with that of January and March. We should surpass the March numbers in both RTOs next month. The registration process has been made simpler and the dealers can do it online,” the official said. The Pune RTO witnessed a 47% increase in e-vehicle registrations in 2020 as against the numbers of 2019. The corresponding rise in the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO was almost 112%. “Earlier, the maximum number of e-vehicles getting registered were mainly goods transport vehicles, such as ecarts. Now the trend is changing. Registration of electricity-run two- wheelers is now higher than goods transport vehicles. The main reasons are the ever-increasing fuel prices and easy maintenance of an e- vehicle,” another RTO official in Pune said. The deputy regional transport office and in-charge of the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO, Atul Aade, said the maximum registrations were that of the electric two-wheelers — much higher than the numbers of cars, e-carts (goods) and regular ecarts. An RTO official said there were higher registrations related to operation of the hybrid vehicles “Till June 28 this year, 6,216 such vehicles were registered in Pune. The number was 12,460 last year. In 2019, as many as 21,035 vehicles were registered in the Pune RTO. The numbers declined in 2020 due to the pandemic. But this year, the registration of hybrid vehicles will surpass the 2020 figures,” another official said. “In the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO office, 5,774 such vehicles were registered in the first six months of this year. In 2020, as many as 11,654 such vehicles were registered and another 14,772 in 2019,” he said. Shadab Shaikh, who deals in pre-used cars, said people were mainly looking for hybrid vehicles. “A lot of customers are looking for vehicles that run on CNG or on CNG and petrol/diesel. We get around 6-7 customers looking for such vehicles each week,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-fuel-prices-push-demand-for-e-vehicles/articleshow/83934471.cms||Joy Sengupta

Goa, which is in its diamond jubilee year of Liberation from Portuguese rule, got an unexpected bonanza from the Union budget, with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing a grant of Rs 300 crore for the celebrations. Sawant had sought Rs 100 crore from the Centre for the year-long festivities. Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai said on Sunday that the Centre is yet to disburse the Rs 300 crore meant for Goa to celebrate its 60th Liberation day. In response to an RTI application, the department for information and publicity informed GFP that the Rs 300 crore has not been received till date. In the Union budget, Sitharaman had said, “2021 is the year of many important milestones for our history. I mention a few of these: It is the 75th year of Independence, 60 years of Goa’s accession to India. Goa is celebrating the diamond jubilee year of its Liberation from Portuguese rule. From the government of India’s side, I propose a grant of Rs 300 crore to the government of Goa for the celebrations”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sent-centre-plan-to-utilise-rs-300cr-l-day-fund-cm/articleshow/83936605.cms||---

Meanwhile, city corporation mayor Arya Rajendran directed corporation secretary to submit a probe report after complaints surfaced that the health official was framed. Four drivers who were present in the main office garage have reportedly told the officials that they had witnessed the entire incident and they did not see any sexual advances from the health official. A corporation staff said that Aji sought an explanation from the woman staff for turning up late for work and said that she couldn’t sign the register since she came one-and-a-half hours after the scheduled time of work. The drivers intervened and requested the health official to let her go home. Aji reportedly then left the office and went home. Later in the day, she filed a complaint of sexual harassment against the health official following which the official was arrested on Sunday night. TOI tried to contact the complainant however she didn’t respond. The complainant who was recently dismissed from work due to non-performance and various complaints had requested mayor Rajendran to take her back and she was deployed at secretariat health circle. Meanwhile, corporation has started steps to reconstitute the internal complaints committee to deal with incidents of sexual harassment at workplace. Three years after Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act came into effect, the city corporation had formed an anti-harassment committee in 2016. The formation of the committee had been triggered by an incident in which a woman official had raised complaints against a senior official in the engineering wing.  The corporation had constituted the committee with deputy mayor Rakhi Ravikumar as the chairperson. Welfare standing committee chairperson Geetha Gopal, project officer, T Geenakumari, an advocate, and a representative of NGO were the other members.

---||Pune||Have special vaccination drives & on-site gynaecologists for pregnant women, say Pune specialists||PUNE: Specialists have suggested a host of steps to ensure safe Covid-19 vaccination of pregnant women, just days after the Centre said they can be given the shots. The experts, who for months have been saying pregnant women should be given the Covid vaccines, said besides exclusive drives, officials should arrange for on-site consultations by gynaecologists, especially for those not registered for ante-natal (pre-delivery) care. They added that a registry of vaccinated pregnant women should be maintained for long-term follow-ups. “Pregnant women should be given priority at Covid vaccination sites. They should be assigned a day, or time of day, to ensure they don't have to mix with the general crowd,” said Sanjay Gupte, a Pune-based gynaecologist who has been at the forefront of demands for inclusion of mothers-to-be in the country’s vaccine drive. On June 25, the Centre revised a policy to state that pregnant women should be vaccinated against Covid-19. “We should also have a separate registry — trimesterwise — for pregnant women who undergo vaccination, to facilitate follow-ups and data collection for future use,” said Gupte, also the chairman (ethical committee) of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, which brings together global professional societies of obstetricians and gynecologists. Experts said those suffering from severe pregnancy induced hypertension called pre-eclampsia or immune suppression treatment should be offered jabs only after their obstetricians’ consultation and permission. “Besides this, women who are planning pregnancy — natural or through assisted methods — can take the vaccine and then attempt to become pregnant. The vaccines do not affect fertility. Both husband and wife can take the same or different vaccines. It doesn’t matter,” said gynaecologist and infertility expert Sanjeev Khurd. Specialists said the lead shots in India — Covishield and Covaxin — do not contain any live virus. There is no biological mechanism in them to cause Covid in the mother or unborn foetus. Therefore, there is no transmission during pregnancy or through breast milk, they said. “The decision will especially be useful for pregnant women with other comorbidities and those who are at high risk of exposure due to their work. Pregnant women account for about 5% of the Indian population,” said gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode. Before the June 25 revision, the health ministry had said “women who are pregnant or not sure of their pregnancy should not receive Covid-19 vaccine” since they were not part of the trials. But after a National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) meeting on May 28, the ministry said pregnant women should also be vaccinated since “exposure probability is very high” and that the “benefit far outweighs the risk”. The ministry is set to release guidelines on vaccination of pregnant women soon, a member of the national Covid task force said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/have-spl-vax-drives-on-site-gynaecs-for-pregnant-women/articleshow/83934460.cms||Umesh Isalkar

When asked if he is interested in contesting the next election, Kuncalienker said, “Yes, of course. The party is aware about it, and whatever election-related responsibility the party entrusts to me, I am ready to take it.” When asked if the party asked him to work for incumbent Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate, Kuncalienker said, “Till date, the party has not told me such thing and whenever the party tells me to do so, I will take my decision.” The former Panaji legislator said that BJP is a party of karyakartas, and that he is one such ‘responsible’ karyakarta. “Whatever responsibility the party has given me, I have completed it,” he said. Kuncalienker had first contested the assembly election from Panaji in 2015 after then chief minister Manohar Parrikar was elevated to the position of defence minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union cabinet. In the 2017 assembly elections, Kuncalienker defeated Monserrate to secure the prestigious seat. However, soon after the election as Parrikar returned to state politics as chief minister, Kuncalienker had to vacate his seat for Parrikar to contest. Once again in 2019, after the death of the former chief minister and Panaji MLA, Kuncalienker contested the bypoll as the BJP candidate and lost to then Congress candidate Monserrate, who then joined BJP with nine other MLAs in July 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ready-to-contest-from-panaji-says-kuncalienker/articleshow/83936639.cms||---

---||Pune||Traders in Pune fear business loss due to deadline; want change in timings||PUNE: Traders in the city have said that closure of shops at 4pm would lead to a 40% dip in business and have urged the authorities to allow them to function from 11am till 7pm. They have pleaded for a revision in timings as most customers come for shopping in the evening, and requested the civic administration and the state government to allow them to operate on weekends. Monday was the first day of enforcement of fresh restrictions, mandating essential and non-essential shops to function till 4pm and complete closure of non-essential shops on weekends. Most shopkeepers pulled down their shutters at 4pm. Viraj Shah, a cloth trader from Ravivar Peth, said, “We will lose about 40% to 50% business, with three-hour curtailment in timings. This is because customers hardly prefer to shop on working days in the morning, when they step out mostly to purchase grocery items, vegetables and kitchen-related stuff. For non-essential items, the suitable time for customers is evening or post-lunch. The government needs to allow non-essential shops to function till late evening.” Sandesh Solanki, who runs a jewellery shop, said, “We are allowed to open the shop at 7am but why will customers turn up at 7am or even at 9am to purchase jewellery. Shops should be allowed to open for some hours in the evening. This will also prevent unnecessary rush in the market.” Mahendra Pitaliya of Federation of Trade Associations of Pune said the business was already down and traders were facing losses due to restrictions. “Earlier, shops used to function almost for 12 hours till 9 pm. But now they are compelled to operate at odd hours that are neither suitable for business nor customers. We urge the authorities to introduce some changes in the timings of at least non-essential shops,” he said. Meanwhile, the traders have also said that the administration should hold vaccination drives for them. “We have urged the civic administration and the state government to hold special drives for traders, but the demand has not been met so far,” said an office bearer of the Federation of Trade Associations of Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/traders-fear-business-loss-due-to-deadline-want-change-in-timings/articleshow/83934516.cms||Sarang Dastane

Police suspect that her husband, who is on the run, might have committed the ghastly murder. Alipiri police had found the unidentified woman’s body inside a suitcase near the hospital five days back. The body was charred beyond recognition and it was difficult to make out if it was a male or female. The forensics team concluded that the body belonged to a woman aged around 30 years. Cops checked CCTV footage near and around the hospital area and managed to nab the second accused in the case, a taxi driver who allegedly helped the main accused in dumping the body near the hospital. Through his interrogation, police identified the victim as Bhuvaneswari, from Chittoor district, who was married to Srikanth Reddy of Kadapa district in 2019. The couple was blessed with a girl child about 18 months back. Bhuvaneswari was a software engineer and worked with a tech major in Hyderabad. The couple, who relocated to Tirupati after Srikanth lost his job about three months ago, used to have frequent fights. Cops said Srikanth may have killed his wife in a fit of rage, packed her body in a suitcase and dumped it at the isolated spot near the SVRR hospital on June 23. The same night, he again returned to the spot, poured petrol on the suitcase and set it on fire. Cops have launched special teams to nab Srikanth, who is on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/charred-body-found-in-tirupati-is-of-hyd-techie-say-ap-police/articleshow/83938602.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The project was suspended in May due to a sharp increase in Covid cases. “From July 1, ‘swayampurana mitrs’ will again start visiting village panchayats,” Sawant said, adding that the concept was implemented to help the people of the state. Speaking at a function, the chief minister said that Goa can become swayampurna (self-reliant), and that it’s necessary to motivate the people of the state. “We have to tell people about their strength and skills. We have to upgrade their skills,” he said Sawant said that 191 swayampurna mitrs in village panchayats and 14 swayampurna mitrs in municipalities have started their work to make Goa swayampurna. Sawant said that if the swayampurna mitr is active, they can do a lot of things for the people in their panchayat. He also said that grassroot-level politicians should keep politics aside and work for the people in their panchayats. He said that every swayampurna mitr should identify the problems in their jurisdiction and resolve them. Under Swayampurna Goa, panchayats and municipalities were supposed to get funds under the 15th Finance Commission and under the funds allocated for the 60th celebration of Goa’s Liberation. The state, through the scheme, wanted to ensure 100% coverage of water and electricity connections to the people. The government has roped in the agriculture department to increase the vegetable and agriculture production so that the state does not have to depend on other states. Sawant had announced the Swayampurna Goa programme last year in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/swayampurna-goa-to-restart-from-july-1-cm/articleshow/83936668.cms||---

Public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves argued after commission of the crime, the four accused, Shellar, Jadhav, Soni and Mothkuri, travelled abroad and they wanted to investigate where they went and who sponsored their trip. Soni and Mothkuri were remanded to police custody till July 1. The NIA on Monday did not seek encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma’s custody, after which the court sent him to judicial custody. His lawyer, Sudeep Pasbola, handed over a letter to the judge stating that as he was a police officer who has taken action against several gangsters and criminals, there was a threat to his life in Taloja as well as Arthur Road jails and requested that he be sent to the one at Thane. The court directed the superintendent of jails to take a call and inform the court and sent him to judicial custody. Sources said Sharma was later moved to Taloja jail where dismissed cops Sunil Mane and Sachin Waze are lodged. The court also sent Sharma’s two confidantes, Shellar and Jadhav, to judicial custody. The NIA sought custody of Soni and Mothkuri. The NIA is probing the financial angle in Hiran’s murder to know who were the beneficiaries in the crime. Prima facie, NIA stated Waze orchestrated the crime and wanted to solve the case and claim credit to regain his lost glory. Police sources said there is more to it though. NIA investigations have reportedly suggested that while Shellar, Jadhav, Soni and Mothkuri and even Waze and Mane personally took part in the crime, Sharma allegedly coordinated the crime, from killing Hiran to destruction of his body in a creek. Sharma was arrested after Shellar and Jadhav “spilled the beans”. Last month, the NIA had recovered the red car used in the crime from Goregaon. The focus of the NIA’s investigation now is on finding out the role of a senior police officer in the conspiracy and planning the planting of explosives in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25 and the subsequent murder of Hiran, the vehicle owner, on March 4. NIA said so far the investigation has shown on March 4, Waze and Mane impersonated as “inspector Tawde” and called Hiran to Ghodbunder Road in Thane. The duo picked him up and handed him over to Shellar, Jadhav, Mothkuri and Soni, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1-drove-other-killed-hiran-later-duo-aides-went-abroad-says-nia/articleshow/83934872.cms||Ahmed Ali

Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) additional municipal commissioner, Rubal Agarwal, also said, “Weddings are allowed on Saturdays and Sundays. If there has been some confusion, hotels can get in touch with the PMC to have the doubts clarified. We have, so far, had no specific guidelines from the state as to not allowing weddings on weekends.” Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI, “Weddings can be organised with a limit of 50 people and not more even during weekends. During the restrictions imposed earlier, weddings with limited people had been given a nod even on Saturdays and Sundays. We have decided to go by that.” Vikram Shetty, owner, Sadanand Resorts, told TOI, “We had several wedding bookings for evenings, but the sudden orders two days ago led to cancellation of such events. We had to cancel at least four evening wedding functions and feared that the marriage functions on the weekends could meet a similar fate.” Poona Hoteliers Association (PHA) president Sharan Shetty told TOI, “We had sought a clarity from PMC on whether weddings will be allowed on weekends or not. Many were of the view that such functions were not allowed on Saturdays and Sundays following the latest restrictions. We have been holding off clients enquiring for weekend weddings in the absence of such clarity.” Ajay Kanojia, general manager, Sayaji Hotel, told TOI, “We have been holding off clients for the weekend wedding functions as there has been no clarity. Wedding queries have started pouring in. We had one such query for coming Sunday, but didn’t confirm the booking on account of confusion.” Similar confusion also prevailed in the PCMC limits. Vinay Nair, general manager, DoubleTree by Hilton, in Chinchwad, told TOI, “We are still awaiting a clarity from the PCMC. Weekends are the preferred days for weddings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-bodies-say-weddings-allowed-on-weekends-with-covid-19-norms/articleshow/83934551.cms||Neha Madaan

On facts also, we do not find any grounds for setting aside the suspension order.” While upholding the validity of sections 39(1)(d)(ii) and 39 (1)(d)(iii) of the Act of 2009, the court said, “We do not find any ground to set aside the order of suspension passed by the appropriate authority.” But taking note of the facts and circumstances of the case, “we deem it proper to direct the state government to expedite the judicial enquiry initiated against her and the same be completed as far as possible within a period of six months”. The incident that led to the suspension was a dispute over the extension of the contract given to BVG company for collecting garbage from the city. In 2017, the earlier corporation had granted work to BVG India Ltd for door-to-door collection, segregation and transportation of municipal waste. After the earlier Jaipur municipal council was dissolved, on January 18 this year, the director local bodies informed both the corporations (Jaipur-Heritage and Jaipur-Greater) to enter into supplementary agreements with the company for garbage collection. Due to non-payment dues by the corporation, the company had stopped garbage collection. At the first general board meeting of the newly formed Jaipur-Greater, it was decided to take appropriate legal action against BVG within 30 days and invite fresh tenders for collecting garbage. In the meanwhile, BVG obtained an interim stay order from high court in its favour on May 6. The mayor called the JMC commissioner for discussing the issue on June 4 and allegedly some untoward incident took place in the meeting room. The commissioner filed a complaint and lodged an FIR and sought action against the councillors. The government conducted a preliminary inquiry and found the mayor and three councillors guilty and ordered a judicial probe. It suspended the petitioner from the post of mayor, a member of Ward No 87, on June 6 along with three other councillors. Later, the government appointed BJP councillor Sheel Dhabai as interim Mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-hc-dismissesgurjars-plea-onher-suspension/articleshow/83936788.cms||Joychen Joseph

---||Pune||Pune: Mundhwa shopkeeper falls for ‘nude video call’ trap||PUNE: A shopkeeper from Mundhwa was forced to make a Rs 18,000 money transfer in May after a cyber fraudster(s) trapped him in a “nude video call” trick and threatened to make the recorded call viral on social media. The Pune cyber police registered a case on Sunday following an initial verification of the complaint. It revealed a link fresh set of fraudster(s) operating from Rajasthan, a cyber police officer said. From January, the cyber police have received 275 such complaints. Two suspects, whose involvement have been established in 150 of these complaints, are currently lodged in a jail in Rajasthan for similar crimes there. In the latest case, the police are collecting information related to the IP address from where the victim received the video call. They are also establishing the money trail using the details of the UPI application. The police said, “The complainant stated that in January he had befriended a woman on a social networking site after receiving a friend’s request. They exchanged chats and phone numbers. In May, the shopkeeper received a video call from a woman friend posing in nude and asking him to go nude on the call. The man fell for the trick, allowing the fraudster(s) to use a video recording app to record this moment. Then they started blackmailing him.” Inspector Machindra Pandit of the cybercrime police station said, “To avert embarrassment on the social networking site, he transferred of Rs 18,000 to the suspect. We have registered a case of extortion and invoked provisions of the Information Technology Act.” “Generally, men (the suspects) make fake and misleading profiles posing as women on social media sites. Some men accept these requests and then the suspects start chatting with them on the site without disclosing their identity. The suspects use voice modulator software, which changes the voice of men to women or vice versa,” he said. According to police, the suspects share their cellphone numbers and keep on chatting on the internet-based mobile text messaging service. “The ‘women’ promise to post nude pictures for the men after professing their love. The suspects then play downloaded videos online for the victims and ask the latter to pose nude. Once a victim makes a video call posing nude, the suspects use the screen video recording software to record the call and start issuing threats.” Pandit said, “The suspects generally demand Rs 15,000-25,000, but in few cases, the amount has been around Rs 50,000. All the victims are in the age bracket of 22 to 55 years. Of the total 275 cases, about 150 were solved after we identified the two men.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mundhwa-shopkeeper-falls-for-nude-video-call-trap/articleshow/83934594.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh called by ED today; Nagpur lawyer submits documents||MUMBAI: Even as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) summoned former state home minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday, a Nagpur-based lawyer, Tarun Parmar, visited the ED office on Monday and submitted documents allegedly linking the former minister to money laundering. Earlier, Parmar claimed that he had complained to ED against Deshmukh and a senior cabinet minister, along with some government officials, for their involvement in money laundering and corrupt practices. Subsequently, the ED decided to record Parmar's statements and to allow him to submit relevant documents on June 28. The ED has found that Rs 4.7 crore collected from bar owners by dismissed cop Sachin Waze was transferred to Deshmukh’s Nagpur-based educational trust by his son Hrishikesh, routing it through a hawala operator and showing it as a donation. The ED arrested Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande (an additional collector rank government officer) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde in the money laundering case last week. The two have been remanded in ED custody, and officials are questioning them about Deshmukh’s illegal cash transactions. During the ED investigation, it emerged that Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh played an important role in parking the fund that was collected from the bar owners. Earlier, the ED had recorded the statement of Vikram Sharma, who was a dummy director in five companies controlled by Deshmukh. Sharma told the ED he knew about his role in just one company, Qubix Hospitality, and Hrishikesh Deshmukh had provided funds to set up the company. Sharma said in his statement to the ED that he would sign documents, including cheques, on instructions of Hrishikesh. The ED is probing financial transactions of 24 companies controlled by the Deshmukh family. Among these companies, 11 are under the family’s direct control, whereas the family controls the other 13 through its associates, including Vikram Sharma. The ED had recorded Deshmukh’s CA Prakash Ramani’s statement to gather details of the 24 companies. He told ED officials all 24 companies are under the family’s control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-called-by-ed-today-nagpur-lawyer-submits-docus-in-maharashtra/articleshow/83936850.cms||Vijay V Singh

The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Monday issued the necessary order shifting Aurangabad from Level I of restrictions to Level III as per the latest order from the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA). While the SDMA in its order has also pressed to speed up Covid vaccinations, the local civic body has almost run out of vaccine stock . Dr Neeta Padalkar, the health officer with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said vaccination will be limited at only one centre for the first dose of Covidshield and three centres for the second dose of Covaxin, on Tuesday. “After achieving record 18,148 vaccinations on June 26, followed by 15,396 vaccinations on Monday as part of the recent scaled up vaccination drive, we are left with only 550 doses of vaccine. We are awaiting official word on supply of fresh supply of vaccine to execute the vaccination drive in a rigour manner,” she said. As per the order issued by the DDMA, which is headed by district collector as its ex-officio head, there will be strict control over unnecessary public movement on weekdays post 5pm. “The new curbs are aimed at preventing the possible further Covid outbreak and therefore every citizen is requested to follow the restrictions and exhibit Covid appropriate behaviour. Any non-compliance can lead to public health hazard as we witnessed during the second wave,” Aurangabad resident deputy collector Anant Gavhane said. While shops that don’t offer emergency services can operate only from 7 am to 4 pm with blanket closure on weekends. Only 50 and 20 people are allowed in weddings and funerals, respectively. The industries, however, are free from any curbs though vaccination of staff is encouraged. The weekly markets are allowed only if all stakeholders undergo Covid testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/aurangabad-introduces-covid-curbs-from-today/articleshow/83928948.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||In a U-turn, Telangana govt says only online classes from July 1||HYDERABAD: Putting an end to speculation about commencement of physical classes, Telangana education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy on Monday announced that only online instruction will be held from Class 1 to postgraduate level from July 1. The decision comes in the wake of the high court questioning the logic of opening educational institutions in the backdrop of the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Schools also requested the government to have a rethink on the entire issue. The minister said that the decision to begin online classes was taken as the situation was not favourable for conducting physical classes in the pandemic situation. While private institutes can start online classes for all classes from July 1, the state government will conduct online/digital classes only for students from Class 3 to PG. For class 1 and 2 students, the government schools will start teaching in August. “To ensure that students don’t lose an academic year, we have decided to start online or digital classes as per the directions of the chief minister,” said Sabitha Reddy, adding that the state wants students to access digital classes through smartphones and television. “If any student does not have access to TV or smartphone, they should use the one available at the library or gram panchayat office to attend digital classes,” she added. In the third week of June, the Telangana government announced that physical classes for all students will begin from July 1. In fact, Telangana was the first state to announce commencement of physical classes. However, parents opposed the state’s decision and said that they were not ready to send their children to schools in the current circumstances, especially as the experts are predicting that the third wave will impact children the most. On Monday, after the announcement by the education minister, a government order was also issued for the opening of all educational institutions and coaching institutes in online mode. The minister added that if, for any reason students could not attend lessons relayed through TSAT or the Doordarshan channel, the same would be made available on the TSAT App and students can attend them at their convenience. She also asked students to access worksheets placed on the SCERT website. She said that about 75,000 WhatsApp groups have been created for students and teachers to clear doubts and share information. The minister also made it clear that only 50% of staff, both teaching and non-teaching, have to attend schools and colleges every day. She asked universities to prepare an action plan for the conduct of degree, engineering, postgraduate, diploma final semester examinations in the month of July. The Telangana school education department on Monday released a government order asking schools to not increase any kind of fees for the academic year 2021-22 and charge only tuition fees on a monthly basis. The order will be applicable to all schools affiliated to the state, CBSE, ICSE or other international boards. “Non-compliance of the above instructions will result in cancellation of school recognition, revoking of no objection certificate already granted for affiliation to other boards and initiation of appropriate action against the school management under relevant act/rules,” read the order released by Sandeep Kumar Sultania, secretary, education department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-u-turn-t-govt-says-only-online-classes-from-july-1/articleshow/83938655.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

---||Hyderabad||Inter 2nd year results out, students say method not fair||Hyderabad: Cooped up in homes for more than a year and unable to write exams in view of the raging coronavirus, hundreds of students were left in tears after the Intermediate second-year results were announced on Monday. Upset about the marks given to them after considering their first-year scores, some wrote directly to authorities pleading for reconsideration, while others swore to take the exams whenever they are held. Tanish Rajan tweeted to education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy saying: “Ma'am I’m an intermediate second-year student. Can you please not give our 12th marks based on the first-year marks because it isn't fair for many students, for me personally, as I was sick during my first-year exams.” Hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Telangana government cancelled Intermediate examinations and declared all students as passed. The same subject-wise marks obtained in the first year were awarded for second year subjects too, leaving students and their parents upset. If a candidate failed in a subject in the first year, he/she was awarded minimum marks in that subject. A total of 4,51,585 cleared the examination this year and as many as 1,76,719 candidates secured ‘A’ grade. Showing widespread resentment, scores of students said they would appear for exams at a later stage as they felt they can better their score. Social media was abuzz with students questioning the method adopted for awarding marks. “I had a fever during chemistry and physics exams in the intermediate first year and could not give my cent percent. I wanted to appear for improvement exams, but they were not conducted due to Covid-19. I feel that I could have got 25-30 marks more in total had I appeared for exams,” said G Pavani, who secured 53 in chemistry and 54 in Physics. Pavani said she was looking forward to appear for exams. “If exams are conducted right before EAMCET or NEET, I won’t appear for them. Otherwise, I want to write these exams,” she added. Students said instead of asking them to appear for all examinations, they should be given an option to appear for only those subjects in which they feel that they have a chance to improve their score. “My daughter is not happy with the marks she was awarded. She is planning to appear for exams at a later stage,” said B Ramesh, whose daughter Navya secured 410 marks in intermediate first-year. Few, however, said that they wish to move on. They said that since there is no weightage for intermediate marks in EAMCET, it is best to concentrate on preparing for the entrance exam instead of thinking about second-year exams. “From now on I want to concentrate on EAMCET and JEE. I don’t see a point in thinking about inter marks as there is no weightage for them in competitive exams,” said D Rohit Reddy, who secured 940 marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inter-2nd-year-results-out-students-say-method-not-fair/articleshow/83938713.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Pune||Dhayari man manhandles power utility wireman; held||Pune: The Sinhagad Road police on Sunday night arrested a Dhayari resident on the charge of manhandling an MSEDCL wireman and forcing him to restore the power supply to his house earlier in the morning. According to the police, suspect Ravindra Chavan is the office-bearer of a local outfit of a political party. “A special squad of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) reached Dhayari village to disconnect the power supply of defaulters, including Chavan, for not clearing their power dues despite serving them notices,” inspector Deepak Khedkar said. “The squad reached Chavan’s bungalow around 10.15am. They enquired an elderly woman present there if they had paid Rs88,530 dues pending since a year. The woman told the squad that she will communicate MSEDCL’s message to the family members once they return home. Unsatisfied with her response, the squad decided to disconnect the power supply,” the inspector said. As the squad proceeded with disconnecting the power supply, Chavan rushed out of the house and picked up an argument with wireman Mahesh More (30) and his colleagues. In the meantime, the squad disconnected the power supply. In a fit of anger, Chavan abused More and others and threatened them with dire consequences. He charged at the wireman, pushed him and forced him to restore power supply. “Chavan was nabbed on Sunday after More filed an FIR,” Khedkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dhayari-man-manhandles-power-utility-wireman-held/articleshow/83934646.cms||---

An official from the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) said the consumers had been given the option to pay their bills via online banking or at its centres, which had been kept open on weekends. The officials added they would disconnect supply to consumers, who were not paying the bills. A statement released by the MSEDCL said the overall pending dues in western Maharashtra amounted to Rs 1,290 crore in Sangli, Satara, Solapur, Kolhapur, and Pune districts. The number of such defaulters was around 31.37 lakh. According to the MSEDCL, the region’s pendency included defaulters from the residential, commercial and industrial consumers. The MSEDCL’s statement also added that it was under immense financial burden because of the huge pendency of bills and had urged consumers to clear them at the earliest. “In the past one year, the state has gone through cyclones, cloud bursts and also the ongoing Covid pandemic. The MSEDCL and its staff have been working tirelessly for the consumers during this whole time and paying the bills on time could really help,” an MSEDCL official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msedcl-speeds-up-recovery-of-pending-bills/articleshow/83934648.cms||---

This was part of the state forest department initiative to protect the egg laying sites of these river dwelling reptiles in the National Chambal Sanctuary (NCS). Since then, some 6,300 gharial hatchlings have made their way to the river safely, proving that the conservation effort of the critically endangered species has borne fruit. “In Rajasthan, efforts were made this year to protect the nesting sites. Surveys conducted covered 26 such sites of gharials with a total of 224 nests. Approximately 6,300 hatchlings were counted in 191 nests,” a senior forest official said. As the mortality rate is extremely high because of predators and seasonal floods, intense patrolling and other conservation efforts were made to assist in natural breeding. “It was, in fact, a challenge to protect the gharial and turtle nests (both species lay eggs in March-April) from stray dogs, jackals, feral pigs and crows. Wherever possible, the nesting sites were fenced, often using thorny bushes to prevent predators. In Palighat, angle iron and wire mesh fences were used to guard the gharial nesting sites,” added the official. For regular monitoring, the sites were marked using handheld GPS. For the first time, adjoining river depth of these sites was also recorded using handheld depth sounders. The staff conducted patrols and boat trips along the river banks to identify known and new nesting sites. Sreya Guha, principal secretary, environment and forest department, said, “Ecotourism has immense possibilities in Rajasthan, given the huge variety. The chief minister had announced that NCS would be developed in the 2021-22 Budget and tourism infrastructure upgraded. We are now working on a plan to showcase the sanctuary in a sustainable and responsible manner so that not only the sanctuary is protected, but wildlife enthusiasts can also experience the beauty and thrill of exploring a hitherto unexplored destination.” The NCS comprises 625km of the river in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and UP. In Rajasthan, the NCS was notified in 1979 – the stretches between Jawahar Sagar Dam to Kota Barrage and Keshoraipatan to Gadi Tidawali. The easiest access points to the river are at Kota, Palighat in Sawai Madhopur and Dholpur.  An official claimed that Chambal has huge potential to be the most preferred destination for wildlife tourists. “Rajasthan has more to offer than its tigers. The gharial is among the largest of crocodiles and can grow up to more than four metres in length. It has an unmistakable elongated snout and its unique characteristics can attract thousands of wildlife tourists.” In the 2021 Budget, chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced augmentation of tourism facilities in the NCS. As part of this announcement, infrastructure like floating jetty, camping facilities, nature trails, and boating are being planned. A centre for tourist guides is also in the works. The river section between Palighat and Rameshwarghat in Sawai Madhopur can become the natural hotspot for development given the good connectivity from Sawaimadhopur and the established tourist traffic to Ranthambore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gharials-find-a-safe-haven-to-breed-in-raj-sanctuary-6300-hatchlings-counted/articleshow/83936842.cms||Ajay Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builders, societies to pay Rs 1,400 crore as fire service fees since 2014||MUMBAI: Housing societies and buildings that came up after 2008 and their developers will now have to pay one-time fire service fees and annual fees, retrospectively since 2014, according to a recent circular issued by the Mumbai Fire Brigade. Officials said the total amount to be recovered is around Rs 1,400 crore. The circular, which was issued on June 7, says the fee recovery notices will be sent to the developer, owner, occupier or society within a month by the fire brigade’s regional command centres. The one-time fire service fees will be levied on the builder, and the annual charges on the housing society, owner or occupier. The BMC has also drafted a new standard operating procedure for imposing fire service fees on all buildings that come up after June 2021.In May, BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal had sanctioned the recovery of fire service fee, which is calculated at Rs 10 per sq m for all buildings. The annual charge is 1% per year of the fire service fee amount, said officials. According to the fire brigade circular, fire service fees and annual fees are recovered under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. “It is necessary to recover the fees as per the provisions of the Act from March 3, 2014 for all buildings constructed on or after December 6, 2008,” the circular stated. “The deputy chief fire officer (CFO) concerned, with help of assistant divisional fire officers and divisional fire officers, will find out data of permissions granted to buildings from March 3, 2014, to May 14, 2015, where the BMC is the planning authority; and from March 3, 2014, to June 6, 2021, of buildings where Mhada, MMRDA, SRA or MbPT is the planning authorities. Data of buildings that came up between May 15, 2015, and June 6, 2021, will be made available by the chief engineer (development plan) for levy of fire service fees and annual fees,” it added. These two fees were introduced to raise an internal fire protection fund for upgrade of services. “While 50% of the money collected under this head is to be given to the state government to strengthen fire services in other parts of the state, the remaining 50% is to be used by the BMC in Mumbai to create better fire safety and firefighting infrastructure like creating more fire stations. However, this money has not been recovered since 2014; it was stuck in red tape between the state government and the BMC,” claimed a senior civic official, adding that the BMC had exempted religious and a few charitable institutions, like old age homes, from payment of these fees. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra claimed the “deliberate delay” in collection of the fees by fire brigade officials had caused a loss of thousands of crores to the BMC and state government. “If you calculate the interest on the principal amount of Rs 1,400 crore for seven years, the amount is much more. A probe must be conducted either by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) or economic offences wing (EOW) against the officials concerned who did not charge the fees to favour builders in exchange for kickbacks. The responsibility for not recovering this money must be fixed,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bldrs-socs-to-pay-rs-1400cr-as-fire-service-fees-since-14/articleshow/83938699.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||BMC drafts new fire service fee SOP for buildings from July||MUMBAI: The BMC has drafted a new standard operating procedure (SOP) for imposing fire service fees on all buildings that will come up after June 2021. In May, BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal had sanctioned the recovery of fire service fee, which is calculated at Rs 10 per sq m for all buildings. The annual charge is 1% per year of the fire service fee amount, said officials. Times ViewThe BMC standing committee recently rejected the proposal to hike property tax citing the economic slowdown due to the pandemic. The fire brigade should have collected the fire service fee and annual fee regularly since 2014. Now collecting it retrospectively will put a huge burden on housing societies and residents. While it is important to recover the amount, the BMC must develop a mechanism to collect it in parts. The BMC must also conduct a probe and fix the responsibility on officers who caused the delay in levying these charges and caused a loss of over Rs 1,400 crore to the BMC.According to the Mumbai Fire Brigade circular dated June 7, fire service fees and annual fees are recovered under the Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. “It is necessary to recover the fees as per the provisions of the Act from March 3, 2014 for all buildings constructed on or after December 6, 2008,” the circular stated. “The deputy chief fire officer concerned, with help of assistant divisional fire officers and divisional fire officers, will find out data of permissions granted to buildings from March 3, 2014, to May 14, 2015, where the BMC is the planning authority; and from March 3, 2014, to June 6, 2021, of buildings where Mhada, MMRDA, SRA or MbPT is the planning authorities. Data of buildings that came up between May 15, 2015, and June 6, 2021, will be made available by the chief engineer (development plan) for levy of fire service fees and annual fees,” it added. These two fees were introduced to raise an internal fire protection fund for upgrade of services. “While 50% of the money collected under this head is to be given to the state government to strengthen fire services in other parts of the state, the remaining 50% is to be used by the BMC in Mumbai to create better fire safety and firefighting infrastructure like creating more fire stations. However, this money has not been recovered since 2014; it was stuck in red tape between the state government and the BMC,” claimed a senior civic official, adding that the BMC had exempted religious and a few charitable institutions, like old age homes, from payment of these fees. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra claimed the “deliberate delay” in collection of the fees by fire brigade officials had caused a loss of thousands of crores to the BMC and state government. “If you calculate the interest on the principal amount of Rs 1,400 crore for seven years, the amount is much more. A probe must be conducted either by the anti-corruption bureau or economic offences wing against the officials concerned who did not charge the fees to favour builders in exchange for kickbacks. The responsibility for not recovering this money must be fixed,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-drafts-new-fire-service-fee-sop-for-bldgs-from-july/articleshow/83934891.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The city transport body is not budging even after the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) called the move illegal and told it to withdraw the buses. An MSRTC official said they would approach the state transport department about the issue. “MSRTC buses go to many of these routes. Every transport body is struggling for revenue and the PMPML’s move will affect our business,” a senior official from the Pune MSRTC said. The PMPML started six routes connecting the rural areas to the city on June 20. A total of 26 buses have started plying on these routes at intervals of 30 minutes to an hour-and-a-half.The Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol also recently launched three more routes. “All approvals have been received and MSRTC should have reacted then,” a PMPML official said. Rajendra Jagtap, chairman and managing director of the PMPML, said, “We have been running buses to rural areas for quite a while now. Similarly, the Pune United Metropolitan Transport Authority, headed by the collector, of which MSRTC is a part, also approved that the PMPML buses could run in the PMRDA areas. Similarly, we have got the approval from the regional transport authority. Public transport should be unified and run with mutual cooperation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-msrtc-lock-horns-over-nine-rural-routes/articleshow/83934651.cms||Joy Sengupta

The division bench stated that it was only suggesting that the government, before filing an application in the high court seeking an exemption to this category of persons, gets the expert committee to deliberate on the issue and give its comments. If the state government files its application, the high court will consider it only on July 12, at the next hearing, the court stated. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the high court that it is seeking this exemption, which is being permitted at other places too where people who have taken both doses of the vaccine are permitted to enter the state after a prescribed time gap. Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Sunday stated that government would ask the high court to allow those who have taken both doses of the vaccine to enter without a Covid negative certificate. The high court also directed the state’s expert committee to decide on permitting entry to persons based solely on negative Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). “The expert committee to take appropriate decisions on this issue and forward its observations and recommendations to the State Task Force. The State Task Force to then take appropriate decisions on this issue based upon the observations and recommendations of the Expert Committee. All this exercise to be completed before the next date which shall be July 12, 2021, and necessary compliances filed before this Court,” the high court stated in its order. It asked the authorities to place before the expert committee the statistics which are to be found in the affidavits filed in these petitions where the emphasis is only on the adoption of RT-PCR or TrueNat, or CBNAAT tests as a precondition for entry into Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/consult-expert-panel-over-entry-to-fully-vaccinated-persons-hc-to-govt/articleshow/83937401.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Juhu police have registered a first information report against an unknown person for allegedly hacking the link and playing the objectionable video after the management of the Vile Parle college filed a complaint. The incident took place last week. “The cyber cell is working on tracing the person suspected to have hacked into the online lecture and uploaded the objectionable video 40 minutes into the lecture. Investigation is on to find out if the hacker managed to get access to the link or if he hacked into the class,” said senior inspector Shashikant Mane. The police team is trying to track the internet protocol (IP) address of the device from where the objectionable clip was uploaded. On June 13, Sakinaka police booked a 15-year-old boy from Jaisalmer in Rajasthan for entering coding classes hosted by an ed-tech platform and flashing before female instructors. The student committed the offence several times between February 15 and March 2. “The minor used a fake number and email address to commit the offence,” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hacker-gains-access-to-online-class-plays-porn-clip/articleshow/83934900.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||No service if tariff not revised: Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association||HYDERABAD: Days after the state government issued renewed tariff slabs to be charged for the treatment of Covid-19 patients by private hospitals, the Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (THANA) has threatened to stop Covid-19 services. The association has expressed displeasure over the order, claiming that salaries of employees had gone up four times during the pandemic. They said that other expenses have also increased manifold but the government-issued tariff slabs have not taken these factors under consideration. Due to the public outcry about increasing costs of Covid-19 treatment, THANA had come up with a cost evaluation without any profitability, according to its members. THANA president Dr K Krishna Rao termed the two orders issued by state government over the last one year as being unscientific, insensitive and impractical. “With this pricing, it appears that the government health department is not interested in private hospitals giving Covid-19 care. It is not at all possible for us to be part of the Covid-19 care system in the state and we will be forced either to withhold or to quit the Covid-19 care services...we account for 60- 70% the care required,” Dr K Krishna Rao said. The association explained that four times hike in salaries, staff insurances, boarding & lodging, payments to consultants and specialists, high electricity and biomedical waste disposal charges, a ten-times increase in cost of oxygen cylinders, and maintenance of equipment used for non-Covid-19 treatments have added to the costs. “Private hospitals in Telangana came forward and enrolled to treat Covid-19 patients during the pandemic on request of the state government. For this, large infrastructure was created as deemed necessary to treat patients coming with varied presentations of Covid,” said THANA general secretary Dr T Linga Rao. The THANA general secretary said that in order to boost infrastructure, huge financial investments and increases in staff strength were required. “Lack of oxygen and an increase in the costs of gas cylinders, flow meters, disposable masks and many other consumables costing ten times the original cost. Despite non-availability (of resources) at times hospitals have continued 24x7 services. Many factors played a role in increased prices during the last one year,” Dr Linga Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-service-if-tariff-not-revised-thana/articleshow/83935406.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Can defer flu vaccines for kids by a month: Doctors||HYDERABAD: Health experts are now advising parents to defer flu vaccines for their children for the next one to two months. This, even as hospitals are receiving a large number of phone-ins from parents seeking to understand the benefits of flu vaccines against Covid-19, especially in light of a possible third wave. Several hospitals are seeing anywhere between 10 and 15 children being brought in for the vaccine daily. “Parents are anxious right now and want to take all possible precautions for their children. There are many who are rushing due to the misconception that the flu vaccine will protect the child from Covid-19. Currently, there is no shortage of these vaccines but the rate at which parents are coming in, there might be one soon,” said an official from a corporate hospital. The official said that the hospital has been responding to calls from parents, explaining to them that getting the flu vaccine for their children is not an emergency and that they can defer the shots by a month. He added that getting new vaccines may again lead to beelines at hospitals. The reason some doctors are recommending the seasonal flu vaccine shots to children, is based on some studies which state that the vaccine may protect against the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) due to a phenomenon known as viral interference. However, there currently is no robust evidence to substantiate the claim. Should a child take the flu vaccine, diagnosis can become much easier as several symptoms and complications of flu are similar to that of Covid-19, say experts. “We are expecting the 2021-22 (batch of) flu virus vaccines to be released during the month of July and are asking parents to wait till the end of July or August to get their children the shots. Since the flu vaccines will only protect from flu, there should be no hurry in taking these anticipating protection from Covid-19,” explained Dr Sharmila K, senior consultant paediatrician at Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/can-defer-flu-vax-for-kids-by-a-mth-docs/articleshow/83935560.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Dr Reddy’s rolls out 2-DG drug for Covid treatment||HYDERABAD: Nearly two months after the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approved emergency use of wonder Covid-19 drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) for Covid-19, pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd finally commercially rolled it out on Monday. The drug, which was being developed for cancer and was repurposed for Covid-19, was developed by scientists at a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) lab — Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS) in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s. The drug comes in a powder form in a sachet and has to be taken orally by dissolving in water. It works by accumulating in virus infected cells and prevents growth of virus by stopping energy production, viral synthesis. Pointing out that it will supply 2-DG to major government as well as private hospitals across the country, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said that in the initial weeks it will be available only in hospitals in the metros and tier-1 cities, after which the coverage would be expanded pan-India. Though the pricing has been fixed at Rs 990 per sachet, it will be offered at subsidised rates to government institutions, it added. Dr Reddy’s said that 2-DG can be administered only upon prescription and under the supervision of a qualified physician to hospitalised moderate to severe Covid-19 patients as an adjunct therapy to the existing standard of care. Though the DCGI’s approval had come on May 1 this year, the commercial rollout took time as the company was ramping up capacities. Meanwhile, to improve affordability DRDO has also invited expression of interest (EoI) from other pharma companies for manufacturing this drug, even as Council of Scientific & Industrial Research institution Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) has licenced the process knowhow for 2-DG synthesis to companies like Lee Pharma, Suven Pharma, Anthem Biosciences and Nosch Labs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dr-reddys-rolls-out-2-dg-drug-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/83935651.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Police officials have instructed that no force should be used against the violators, but only strict legal action should be taken. Learning from the previous experiences, officials from the police, civic body, health department and district administration are found taking steps to ensure close coordination at mid-rung and lower-rung employees. Aurangabad city police would stress on wearing masks, maintaining social distancing norm. Commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta said instructions have been given to police personnel to ensure implementation of guidelines, without violating any of the norms themselves. This time around, the city is all set to have a higher number of fixed checkpoints and patrolling teams. “Police will also ensure motorists wear helmets or seatbelts,” said Gupta. He said that only in case of an emergency, citizens will be allowed to move during restricted hours. Districts of Jalna, Beed, Nanded, Parbhani are among others that have already imposed restrictions on inter-district movement. Osmanabad superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan said, “Apart from scaling up checking on inter-district movement, our focus will be more on the movement in state border areas.”  Nanded had recorded a large number of Covid cases and casualties in the two waves, so extra precautionary measures are being taken there. Senior police officials have decided to ensure effective strict imposition of norms even in rural areas. Nanded superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale said, “This time our officers from across hierarchy will be on the field. Police will not use force against anyone caught violating norms, but strict legal action will be taken including registration of offences.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/stricter-imposition-of-fresh-covid-norms/articleshow/83929108.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Goa||Goa’s popular party haunt Tito’s has been sold, claims co-owner||PANAJI: Nightlife doyen Ricardo D’Souza claimed in a social media post on Monday that he has sold Club Tito’s—one of the most popular party destinations in the country and an iconic hospitality brand of the state—and their “entire business in Goa” due to “harassment” from the state government “officials” for an undisclosed amount. D’Souza didn’t name the buyer, but said, “I personally have suffered the least as I have been compensated adequately and even my future generations won’t have to work”. Though he blamed the state government for the sale of his entire family businesses, he expressed gratitude to chief minister Pramod Sawant and some others. Claiming that the development left him with “sadness and anger”, and that it left many of his staff unemployed, he asked “the officials” to employ his staff “as I do not ever plan any more business in Goa”. Apart from not identifying the buyer, Ricardo also didn’t specify if the Tito’s brand would continue. “End of an Era!” he posted. Ricardo and his brother David were running Club Tito’s, Bollywood Discotheque, and Café Mambo—all part of the Tito’s brand—and were also the directors of Tito’s Resorts and Entertainment Ltd along with Lucille Dsouza. The two brothers owned at least 15 different companies as part of the Tito’s group with diversified interests such as home decor, creative publishing, hospitality, construction and even watersports. While some of the companies are active, others have been struck off by the registrar of companies. In his post, Ricardo said: “By ‘officials’ I mean all the harassing lot, like police, planning and development authority, coastal regulation zone, NGOs, panchayats and sarpanchas, block development officers and deputy collectors.” He, however, did not blame Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins for the harassment. Established by Tito Henry de Souza in 1971, Tito’s Goa was a popular spot for hippies and world travellers looking to escape the chaos of the world. As international tourists flocked to Goa in search of Tito’s, domestic tourists followed, firmly planting Tito’s Goa as the party destination. The sale of Tito’s sent shockwaves across the country, with many netizens expressing dismay that they would not be able to party at the clubs anymore. “Very sad, I still remember I used to be a regular there right from my college days, sometimes even with my books to study as I had to answer my exams the next day. What memorie! The place had some magic,” said Lokesh Kavlekar. Over the past two decades, Club Tito’s became the place to be for everyone looking to party, and over the years, it spawned many competitors. So passionate was the fan following that Tito’s lane became an address everyone knew. “End of an era. Won’t be the same without you,” said entertainer and entrepreneur Bhumika Singh in reply to D’Souza’s post. D’Souza thanked all who played a role in making Tito’s a global brand. While the two brothers maintained a stoic silence, speculation about Ricardo taking a plunge into politics has been doing the rounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/titos-has-been-sold-claims-its-co-owner/articleshow/83936987.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctor’s pre-arrest bail rejected in fake vax case, to surrender||MUMBAI: A sessions court judge in Dindoshi court on Monday rejected Dr Manish Tripathi’s pre-arrest bail application in connection with a fake Covid-19 vaccination case at Kandivli that was registered by Mumbai police. His advocate, Adil Khatri, though, immediately filed an application for his surrender. He said Dr Tripathi would surrender on Tuesday before the Borivali metropolitan magistrate. Judge L S Chavan said, “Once the anticipatory bail application is rejected, then there is no question to grant permission to surrender before the metropolitan magistrate.” The court directed the doctor to surrender before the police station. The doctor (26) runs an institute in Kandivli and was accused in the vaccine fraud case at Hiranandani Heritage.  Khatri said the doctor’s family alleged police harassment while being questioned and wanted him to surrender. The advocate, on behalf of the doctor’s family members, addressed a complaint to the police commissioner alleging “torture and illegal detention” at the Kandivli police station on June 23. Public prosecutor Usha Jadhav had opposed grant of any relief to the doctor. Kandivli police said preliminary probe suggested he had filled saline water in the injection vials and was involved in acts with the co-accused that adversely impacted lives. It said he had been “absconding”. Police have invoked the stringent penal section for ‘culpable homicide not amounting to murder’. The doctor, though, said he was made “a scapegoat” and said the police are trying to protect Shivam Hospital, its owners and their son who are involved. He is a director of KCEP group that offers training and placements in various industries, including healthcare. Police accused him of sourcing vials for camps and roping in students from his institute for administering shots at nine camps. One student, Karim Ali (19), was arrested for allegedly transporting the vials.  The doctor argued his name was dragged in the case merely on hearsay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-docs-pre-arrest-bail-rejected-in-fake-vax-case-to-surrender/articleshow/83934907.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Goa||‘You have no other work?’: High court lambasts Goa govt for hounding whistleblower||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday pulled up the government for hounding a whistleblower for exposing the dumping of raw sewage into water bodies by the sewerage corporation in Panaji. A division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar asked the government whether its departments have “no other work” than to pursue a case from 2012 to 2021 against a whistleblower. While hearing the case pertaining to quashing of the FIR against the public-spirited citizen, the bench asked whether it was the “attitude” of the government to “file criminal cases” against anybody who points out its faults. The issue highlighted by the whistleblower is in “public interest” and should be addressed, the court said. “If raw sewage is being discharged in water bodies, then your whole energies should be focused on treating that issue rather than going against one staff nurse from IPHB,” the court stated. The bench also stated that it was “shocked” that there was a vigilance inquiry against the man, and asked whether he was still in service. “You should have welcomed such a thing,” the high court said. “Raw sewage is being discharged and instead of hounding the messenger like this, you should take steps to see that this problem is sorted out. ” Advocate Ryan Menezes, representing the whistleblower, told the court that the allegation against him is that he is in possession of unauthorized photocopies obtained without the knowledge of the chief chemist, and not that he has taken away original documents from the office. The original documents are still in possession of the office, he said. Public prosecutor G Nagvenkar said that citizens could expose the government, but added that documents should come through the proper authority. He told the court that on October 18, 2012, the whistleblower made a presentation before then chief minister Manohar Parrikar (who was also the MLA from Panaji), and annexed the photocopies taken unauthorizedly with the representation. To this, the bench asked whether the government is considering the documents under the Official Secrets Act. Nagvenkar said a chargesheet has been filed and framing of charges have been fixed for August 2, to which the bench stated that it is enjoined to quash the FIR against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/you-have-no-other-work-hc-lambasts-govt-for-hounding-whistleblower/articleshow/83937046.cms||Lisa Monteiro

State Election Commission (SEC) announced election dates and the process is to begin from June 29. The state cited manpower crunch, the pandemic, lockdown restrictions and danger of a possible third wave. On June 25, the state was directed by disaster management authority to remain on severe ‘Level 3 restrictions’, said the state’s application filed by advocates Rahul Chitnis and Sachin Patil on Monday. The plea is to postpone by-elections to ZPs for Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur and 33 panchayat samitis, called by SEC, in pursuance of an SC judgment of March 4. SC had in March read down a provision of Maharashtra ZP and Panchayat Samitis Act of 1961 to mean that reservation in favour of OBCs in local bodies can be notified to the extent that it does not exceed aggregate 50% of seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together. SC had quashed few notifications issued in 2018 and 2020 by SEC. The state’s plea before SC was that on June 22, Centre informed it of a Delta variant of Covid in Maharashtra and containment steps were required. The SEC on March 5, 2021 declared bye-elections to the six ZPs and 27 Panchayat Samitis were in excess of the 50 percent reservation, held those seats vacated and separately announced an election scheduled for such vacated seats. It then scheduled elections for five districts as they were in ‘level 1’ and postponed it for Palghar which was in level 3 on June 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-moves-sc-to-put-off-zp-bypolls-by-6-months/articleshow/83937019.cms||Swati Deshpande

Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap said the redrawing of ward boundaries must be done based on delimitation criteria of State Election Commission (SEC). “Redrawing of wards has always been contentious. Delimitation of municipal wards is a process, which is done according to geographically determined criteria by government. It cannot be done arbitrarily,” Jagtap said. Jagtap added, “In 2016, when BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis-led government was in power, this process was sidelined and municipal wards were restructured under pressure of the BJP government. This was not only our allegation but we also gave a written complaint. “Half of the population in one locality was in one ward and the other half was in another. People in certain areas, people in communities were deliberately split. Mumbai Congress had formed a panel under Janardhan Chandurkar. This committee had prepared its report after a thorough study. The committee report said that the delimitation in 2016 was done in a flawed and wrong manner,” Jagtap further added. The SEC has said that the draft boundaries of electoral wards in Mumbai for the upcoming BMC polls will be published and suggestions and objections will be called before they are finalised. The SEC told the Congress in a written response that the final ward boundaries will be published after considering the suggestions and objections. SEC deputy commissioner Avinash Sanas said draft ward boundaries will be published in the gazette and suggestions and objections will be called for.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-delimitation-of-bmc-poll-wards-before-2017-skewed/articleshow/83937081.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Sagar, in a letter to additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on June 26, said he read about the BMC’s plan in TOI and is happy it intends to act on it speedily. “Of the 390 people who were vaccinated, 140 have received their certificates, which should be scrapped so that they can get fresh shots. There is a high possibility of individuals being administered either glucose or saline water... Therefore, after the residents undergo checks, they should be vaccinated after June 30,” said Sagar in his letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mla-to-bmc-hold-vax-drive-at-kandivli-bldg-after-june-30/articleshow/83934909.cms||Richa Pinto

In the first wave, which occurred till September last year, 9,971 Covid cases were reported. While in the second wave, from January 2021 till now, 20,389 cases have been recorded. The highest number of cases reported on a single day during the first wave was 404 cases and it was 564 in the second wave. The high number of cases in the city is attributed to a large number of tests conducted. In the first wave, 26,000 tests were carried out while in the second wave, 2.30 lakh tests have been done so far. The officials said around 85% of RT-PCR tests have been done, which is the highest in the state, as against 15% rapid antigen test, which needs to be validated by RT-PCR test if negative. Kadambari Balkawade, the civic administrator said, “We are following strict containment measures. Unlike the first wave, this time the index person is difficult to trace due to increased movement. So, we ensured maximum citizens are traced and tested.” The number of beds has also been increased in the city. The number of regular beds was increased from 831 to 1,189, oxygen beds were increased from 203 to 320 and ventilator beds were increased from 9 to 15. The city has seven Covid care centres, six dedicated Covid care hospitals and two dedicated Covid hospitals In recent week, the positivity rate of the city is increasing. Balkawade said the increase in testing is the reason.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cases-doubled-in-2nd-wave-in-city/articleshow/83929156.cms||---

However, within a few hours, following a meeting with the district superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade, the traders downed their shutters for two more days. Balkawade assured the traders that he will speak to district collector Daulat Desai and send a proposal to the government to consider the urban areas of the district as one administrative unit and the rural areas as another. The traders claim the urban areas have a positivity rate below 10%, and therefore qualify for Level 3 restrictions that allow the non-essential shops to operate on weekdays. Sanjay Shete, the president of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said: “Out of respect for the SP’s assurance, we have withdrawn our decision to open the shops. However, no matter what the government or district administration decides during these two days, we will reopen all shops from Thursday.” The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has fixed a fine of Rs 5,000 and sealing of shops if traders defy the order. KMC & KUADA as one unit In the evening, collector Daulat Desai said there is a proposal to consider the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) and areas under Kolhapur Urban Area Development Authority (KUADA) as one administrative unit. He has asked health officials to get the data on the positivity and oxygen bed occupancy rates for both areas. This information would be sent to the government. As per government norms, civic areas with a population above 10 lakh can be considered as a single administrative unit to fix the level of restrictions. The traders claim that KMC and KUADA have a combined population of more than 10 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-traders-shut-shops-after-disrict-sps-assurance/articleshow/83929181.cms||---

As prices continue to soar across the country, petrol remains just Rs 4 away from the century mark, while diesel stands at Rs 94 per litre in Goa. Consumers have been complaining about the surge in fuel prices, which is burning a hole in their pockets. In 2012, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had kept petrol prices below Rs 60/litre, and had reduced VAT on motor spirit to 0.5% from 20%, to provide relief to the common man. VAT and other Central and state taxes account for a 67% of the pump price of petrol, and 61% of the retail price for diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-petrol-4-short-of-rs-100-mark-sawant-says-cant-give-relief/articleshow/83937078.cms||---

Singh, who was in Ladakh to review the operational situation amidst the continuing military confrontation with China as well as virtually inaugurate 63 bridges built by the Border Roads Organization in six states and two UTs, said the safety and security of the nation will not be compromised at any cost and assured the armed forces of all possible support from the government. He said the country will never forget the sacrifices of the soldiers who laid down their lives at Galwan. During his visit, Singh also said terrorism has reduced in Ladakh after it became a UT in 2019. "After J&K and Ladakh were made UTs, many doubted the intentions of the PM as vested political interests. But he wants the political process to start in both regions. The Prime Minister recently spoke to political leaders of J&K and will speak to leaders in Ladakh soon," he added. The minister inaugurated the 63 bridges at a function in Kyungam, which included a 50-metre-long constructed on the Leh-Loma Road. This single-span steel superstructure bridge, which replaces an existing bailey bridge, will ensure unhindered movement of artillery guns, tanks and other specialised military equipment.

It also directed the committee constituted by the government on May 13 to inquire into the oxygen supply issues at Goa Medical College (GMC) to submit its report within four weeks to the government and thereafter submit it to the high court. “Now that the tide of Covid 19 cases has ebbed, there is “no scope for any complacency,” it said. It added that “this period must be utilized to make preparations to meet the projected consequences of a possible third wave”. Further, the court in its order stated, “The state administration, guided by its expert committee, will have to anticipate the oxygen requirement and other difficulties in the supply chain at this stage itself and, thereafter, take steps to ensure to the utmost extent possible that there is no repetition of what happened in May 2021.” The committee constituted to inquire into the oxygen supply issues at GMC had been directed by the state to submit its report in three days. However, the court found that the report had not been submitted till date. When asked, the government said that the report could not be submitted as some of the members were affected by Covid and that the report would be submitted within reasonable time. “Although the findings in such report may not bind any parties as such, the report will at least assist the state administration in effectively addressing the issues of oxygen supply at the Goa Medical College, so that the state administration is well geared up to address issues that may arise on account of the third wave of the pandemic,” the court stated in its order, and directed the state to prevail upon the committee to submit its report at the earliest. “The state administration, including the dean, Goa Medical College, and other authorities to render full cooperation to this committee in the matter of its inquiries and its report,” the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated in their order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lessons-must-be-learnt-from-2nd-wave-deaths-hc-to-govt/articleshow/83937105.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The managements of the five private schools are alleged to have deprived students of education over non-payment of fees for the academic year 2020-21. NMMC education officer, deputy municipal commissioner Yogesh Kaduskar said the four CBSE schools include New Horizon Public School in Airoli, Terna Orchid International School in Koparkhairane, Ryan International School in Sanpada and Amruta Vidyalay in Nerul, besides Saint Lawrence School (state board) in Vashi. “We had received about 433 complaints such as private schools not promoting students to higher class, students not being given their results and students being removed from online classes due to non-payment of fees. The schools are also alleged to have caused mental harassment to students,” said Kaduskar. He said the schools were served notices and NMMC officials visited the schools and online hearings were conducted too. The management of the private schools were directed not to deprive students of education over fee dues. Kaduskar said the schools ignored the notices. “The schools have violated Section 16 of the RTE Act, 2009, that states no child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled till the completion of elementary education. They also violated Section 17 that prohibits physical punishment and mental harassment to children,” he added. “Stringent action has been taken against these five private schools as their managements were behaving adamantly by not following our instructions despite repeated follow-ups by our officials,” NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar said. Dr Nicolas Correa, executive director of New Horizon Public School, said they had not received any notice about cancellation of NOC. “Parents have not paid fees for the last academic year, yet we have not stopped online classes in the current year. However, they are not even submitting an undertaking about paying last year’s fees through instalments. The school has to pay teachers’ salaries,” he said. Principal Saira Kennedy of Saint Lawrence School and principal Muriel Fernandes of Ryan International School did not respond to text messages from TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/fees-issue-nmmc-chief-cracks-whip-on-5-pvt-schools-in-mumbai/articleshow/83937163.cms||George Mendonca

Met officials forecast no relief in the next 48 hours and the maximum temperature is expected to cross 43 degrees. Monsoon is currently said to be on a “halt” with its progress into the remaining parts of India being extremely slow over the last two weeks. India Meteorological Department forecasts a return of rain in Delhi only by July 2. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said high humidity was a factor at present and temperature was gradually rising once again after the withdrawal of a western disturbance. “On Tuesday and Wednesday, we may see strong surface winds too, which will raise the mercury further. On Thursday, there is a chance of thundery development, but rain is expected on Friday only,” he said. Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, recorded a high of 40.2 degrees Celsius on Monday – three degrees above normal. Pitampura was the hottest location in the city with a maximum of 42.2 degrees Celsius, followed by Pusa at 42.1 degrees. Gurgaon also recorded a maximum of 42 degrees Celsius. Delhi’s relative humidity, meanwhile, oscillated between 38 and 79 % in the last 24 hours. Monsoon in Delhi has already been delayed with its ‘normal’ onset date being June 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-soars-past-42c-mark-in-city/articleshow/83934795.cms||---
---||Agra||Agra youth kidnapped for ransom of Rs 2 crore by friends, murdered and cremated as Covid positive patient||AGRA: Sachin Chauhan, 25, was allegedly kidnapped for ransom of Rs 2 crore in Agra by his friends, who eventually killed him and cremated his body at Balkeshwar Ghat by passing it off as a Covid patient's remains. Sachin, who was the only son of cold storage owner Suresh Chauhan, was kidnapped on June 21 and murdered on the same night. His family members had filed a missing complaint but he could not be traced. Agra’s Special Task Force got a tip-off on Sunday night and they detained five youths, including Sachin’s close friend Harsh Chauhan, who is son of his father’s business partner. They confessed to the murder. The arrested accused — Sachin Aswani, 32, Happy Khanna, 35, Manoj Bansal, 30, Rinku, 25 and Harsh Chauhan, 24 – are known to one another and are all residents of Agra. #Agra youth kidnapped for ransom of Rs 2 crore by friends, murdered and cremated as #COVID19 positive patient https://t.co/ofoO9HswBE— TOI Agra (@TOIAgra) 1624940911000According to police, Sachin and Harsh used to frequent a sports club owned by Aswani in Agra’s Dayalbagh area. Sachin became friends with Aswani and began to borrow money from him. When the borrowed amount reached Rs 40 lakh, Aswani asked Sachin to return the money, but he was not willing to pay back. Aswani and Harsh then made a plan to kidnap Sachin and demand ransom of Rs 2 crore from his father. On June 21, Aswani called Sachin to join them for a booze party at Khaspur village. He was allegedly killed by the suspects there. They smothered him to death by covering his face with packaging tape. He died due to asphyxia, said STF inspector Uday Pratap Singh. “In a bid to mislead the police, the accused bought PPE kits from a medical shop in Kamla Nagar and after covering themselves they cremated his body at Balkeshwar under a fake name. Next day, Aswani’s cousin Happy Khanna and his friend Rinku collected his ashes and immersed them in Yamuna,” said SSP Muniraj G. According to Singh, the accused made the mistake of giving one of their relative’s contact number at the ghat. After cremation, Happy’s friend Manoj Bansal took Sachin’s mobile phone to Kanpur to mislead the police. Police said that Manoj had to make the ransom call for Rs 2 crore but he could not gather courage to do so. “When he got a call from Sachin’s mother on his number, he told her that Sachin was sleeping and they were in Noida,” said police. The family got suspicious and contacted New Agra police station and filed a missing complaint on June 22, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-youth-kidnapped-for-ransom-of-rs-2-crore-by-friends-murdered-and-cremated-as-covid-ve-patient/articleshow/83929264.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||80% Mumbai ‘exposed’, 3rd wave may not be large: TIFR||MUMBAI: As 80% of Mumbai's population has possibly been exposed to Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, the third wave's peak is unlikely to be as large as the second wave's peak where 90 fatalities were registered on May 1. However, this positive projection by scientists of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Colaba, comes with a caveat: this is provided reinfections are not substantial. “Reinfections will hold the key in the third wave,” said the study's main author Dr Sandeep Juneja, dean of TIFR's school of technology and computer science. It is almost 17 months since the pandemic began in India and people infected in the first wave in 2020 could be vulnerable again due to dropping antibody levels. Keeping an eye on reinfections would help civic authorities catch the trend early. Juneja said it would help check the third wave if the 20% of Mumbaikars who haven't caught Covid-19 yet are vaccinated soon. The TIFR team of Juneja and Daksh Mittal worked out several scenarios for the third wave. “We also consider a somewhat pessimistic scenario where reinfections are significant (amongst the 80% recovered, 10% are amenable to infections, and if infected, will follow the same disease progression as the first time infected), or a new variant that is 50% more infectious and 50% more virulent than the Delta variant (we assume that Delta variant is 2.25 times more infectious than the earlier variant in Mumbai and marginally more virulent),” they said. The other factors that could affect the third wave would be poor effectiveness of the vaccine (due to a variant causing escape from vaccine immunity) or opening up the city at 60% level but low compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Despite these negative things, the resulting peak is seen to be no larger than that under the second wave,” said Juneja. The team believes the third wave would be barely noticeable by September if four factors align: reinfections are mild; there are no new dangerous variants, vaccination coverage is extensive in June, July and August; and the vaccine is 75-95% effective. Interestingly, the TIFR paper says Mumbai’s peak during the second wave was lower than, say, peaks in Delhi and Bengaluru because of higher levels of previous exposure to the virus. Mumbai saw a peak of around 11,000 cases a day in the second wave, while Delhi saw a peak of around 28,000 and Bangalore of around 25,000. “Mumbai, with a population of around 13 million, already had around 65% population exposed to the disease (as per our model). Delhi with 19 million had an estimated 55% population exposed around this time. Bangalore, with a population similar to Mumbai had an estimated 45% exposed around February 1. Thus, while the Mumbai administration was well organised in tackling the second wave, the presence of high sero-positivity may have helped Mumbai avoid the tragic consequences that may have resulted from a much higher peak,” the paper concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tifr-80-city-exposed-3rd-wave-may-not-be-large/articleshow/83938893.cms||---
---||Pune||Calls grow for more sites in Pune as hundreds rush for dose-II||PUNE: Public health experts and those in the 45-plus group have now urged district officials to open more vaccine sites to serve the region's fast-growing list of seconddose beneficiaries. On Monday, many sites in PMC and PCMC areas saw huge crowds of beneficiaries turning up for shots. In Sangvi, the Balaji Lawns vaccination site was quickly overwhelmed by a crowd that had turned up for the 200 allotted doses. But vaccinators at the site said they had only 100 doses. Many citizens were turned away. According to estimates, at least 5 lakh people who had received their vaccines in the first week of April are now eligible for their second dose. The number is expected to hit 14 lakh in July. Officials are bracing for chaos. “Two weeks ago, we were returning doses. But now we don’t have enough. Arguments between vaccination staff and citizens are becoming increasingly common,” an official with the PMC's vaccination unit said. Dayalal Jadhav, a beneficiary at the Sangvi site, said his sons had to argue with staff to get two tokens for him and his wife. “They should increase sites to ease crowding,” he said. There were heated exchanges at the neighbouring Shakuntalabai Shitole School vaccination site too. Ashok Asole, said he had booked a slot on Saturday only to be told to come on Monday. "And now, it seems the officials here have no idea how to vaccinate Monday's beneficiaries who did not receive their shots," he said. PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said the civic body will now deploy more staff to ensure smooth drives. Rubal Agarwal, the PMC's additional commissioner, said eligibility for the second dose is from 12 to 16 weeks. “So even if one becomes eligible on the 84th day, she/ he can wait two to three more weeks.” She added that the PMC will certainly increase the number of sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/calls-grow-for-more-sites-as-hundreds-rush-for-dose-ii/articleshow/83934812.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Over 5,000 MSEDCL connections snapped due to unpaid bills||MUMBAI: More than 5,000 consumers faced temporary power disconnections in the past three weeks due to non-payment of electricity bills for several months, a MSEDCL official said on Monday. “This is part of a fresh drive which we have begun in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) including parts of Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pen/Panvel,” the official said. Earlier this year, the MSEDCL had temporarily disconnected over a lakh connections, but had stopped the drive during the second wave of Corona. It was restarted from this month, the official added, saying that connections were being restored only after payment of dues. It may be recalled that after the hefty bills received for the summer months of 2020, several consumers had not paid bills. Across Maharashtra, the electricity bill arrears had then mounted to Rs 48,500 crore of which Rs 242 crore was pending in Mumbai metropolitan region, an official said. Nearly 2 lakh consumers in MMR -- which includes residential, commercial and industry users-- had not paid their monthly electricity bills during the past ten months amid Covid-19 pandemic, an official said, adding, “After the temporary disconnections, several consumers have come forward and handed over cash between Rs 30,000 to Rs 80,000 and also cheques of that amount after which the power connections were restored.” A few officials faced the risk of being attacked, but they now have police protection. “The arrears have piled up and it is difficult to run the day to day operations of MSEDCL -- repay loans with interest and also pay salaries to over a lakh staffers. We also need money to purchase power for distribution and for infrastructure and maintenance. So directives have been issued to all officials from MSEDCL to launch a drive in January to recover the arrears,” said MSEDCL spokesperson Anil Kamble||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-5k-msedcl-connections-snapped-due-to-unpaid-bills/articleshow/83934920.cms||Somit Sen
---||Goa||Goa: Nearly all residents of remote Surla given first vaccination dose||VALPOI: Surla, one of the most remote villages in Goa, situated in Sattari taluka has nearly all its residents vaccinated with the first dose of Covid-19. The hamlet which is set against the backdrop of the Western Ghats has a population of around 500. “The people of Surla have set an example by nearing completion of the first dose of Covid-19 vaccination of its population,” said health minister Vishwajit Rane. “This is a significant achievement as we strive towards our goal of 100% vaccination. I appeal to all the citizens to join our mission which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has envisioned,” said health minister Vishwajit Rane in a social media post. While the response of senior citizens to vaccination in most villages has not been very satisfactory so far, the people of Surla which is situated on the Goa-Karnataka border have proven that they are ahead of others. For this far-off village the nearest government hospital is the Valpoi community health centre (CHC). “Had there not been a Tika Utsav in the village, the response of people would not have been so good. Several people especially senior citizens would have skipped vaccination had they needed to travel far,” said an officer who was part of the drive. “A good thing was that after the villagers were informed about the vaccination date they came without doubting us,” the officer said. In April during the first Tika Utsav many villagers had taken the jab at the Surla village panchayat, the remaining 218 villagers were vaccinated during a recent visit by the CHC team. Valpoi CHC in-charge Dr Shyam Kankonkar said, “Non-availability of internet in the village was a hurdle as it was not possible to register villagers on the Co-Win platform for vaccination.” Panch member, Suryakant Gaonkar said, “Almost every villager has taken the dose and very few who are out of the village due to work, are remaining to be vaccinated,” Gaonkar said. During the day, at various vaccination sites across the state as many as 18, 893 doses were administered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nearly-all-residents-of-remote-surla-given-first-vaccination-dose/articleshow/83937180.cms||Afaq Khan

Hospital administrators said those who can afford paid shots should visit private sites to reduce the pressure on government centres. Many civic sites in the district have been seeing large crowds gather every day. Thousands from the 45-plus group are fast becoming eligible for the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic, said, “We still haven’t placed orders with the civic body for more doses. We’re continuing with the stock we have. Our hospital’s branches were vaccinating nearly 8,000 beneficiaries daily before June 21. That is down to an average of 200 to 300 per day.” Free Covid-19 vaccinations, for everyone over 18, started at government centres on June 21. HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “We have seen a 30% drop in walk-ins as well as online appointments. We have tied up with about 10 housing societies to hold vaccine drives, but the response has not been as expected. On Monday morning, we opened 100 slots on CoWIN for the Covaxin shot. Sixty-three of those slots were unbooked till 12pm.” But there are signs turnouts could improve. Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said, “Before June 21, we were doing nearly 4,000 daily vaccinations. On June 21, 22, 23 numbers dropped to 1,500 to 1,800 per day. But footfall has been increasing. Since Saturday, we’ve been having 4,000 daily jabs.” Kelkar said that the increase may have been because of the rush for second doses among the 45-plus group. “The number of youngsters who are turning up for the vaccines has also increased at our site.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/turnout-low-at-pvt-hosps-several-daily-slots-open-up/articleshow/83934831.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Surat||Gujarat: Clicking selfie an offence in Dang||SURAT: The next time you visit Saputara or any other tourist spot in the picturesque Dang district, be careful not to click selfies. If you are caught taking one, you will be committing a crime that will invite police action. Dang has become the first district in the state that has banned taking selfies at any place in the district, especially at places that are favourite among tourists. The public notification dated June 23 prohibiting selfies has been issued by additional district magistrate T K Damor. The notification prohibits locals as well from entering rivers or any water bodies during monsoon to wash clothes, bathing or other work to prevent accidents. It warns that a person caught violating the order will be booked under Indian Penal Code section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).  “With the start of monsoon, there has been a huge influx of tourists in Dang. While enjoying nature, many act irresponsibly by taking selfies which lead to accidents that could prove fatal. The notification has been issued to prevent such incidents,” said Damor. The administration noticed that taking selfies was not limited to places of tourist interest but places like road, cliffs, waterfalls and rivers. “Considering such risky behaviour, prohibitory orders have been issued for the entire district,” Damor added. After Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, Dang has been witnessing heavy rush of tourists. In the past, incidents of people dying or suffering injuries while taking selfies have been reported in the district. Some tourist destinations have become so risky that an NGO was roped in to hire lifeguards at these spots. Ankit Charitable Trust of Navsari has entered into an MoU with local administration to appoint lifeguards at Gira waterfall to prevent accidents. The NGO was started by Dr Ashok Shroff, an eye surgeon, in 2008 after his 21-year-old nephew Ankit died in the waterfall. In monsoon, when the rush of tourists is high, the trust keeps two lifeguards. “The order has been issued to prevent accidents and the police will implement it strictly. Meanwhile, we are taking various steps as the crowd is increasing during the weekend,” said R S Jadeja, Dang superintendent of police. “Issuing the notification is a good move that will empower law enforcement agencies to take action against those found behaving irresponsibly,” said Dr Shroff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/clicking-selfie-in-dang-can-land-you-in-legal-trouble/articleshow/83929316.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The walk-in coolers have been set up on the premises of the Nashik civil hospital where some of the vaccines could be stored below zero degree celsius and some 2 to 8 degree celsius before they are shipped out to the cold chain points in the five districts. P D Gandal, the deputy director of health said, “Usually, we send our divisional vaccine van to collect vaccine from the state office. On the way, we give the vaccine to the health department of Ahmednagar first. After the van reaches Nashik, the quota for Nashik district is distributed on the same day, while the remaining quota of the other three districts is distributed the very next day. Now since more vaccination centres are being set up, the divisional health department will be getting more supply of vaccines. WICs and WIF would help store the routine vaccines before they are sent to other cold-storage points in other districts. The two walk-in coolers have been stored in one room and one walk-in freezer has been fitted in another room with a generator backup facility. Routine vaccines can be stored for a particular time at a particular temperature and could be transported up to cold chain points at desired temperature while maintaining an appropriate cold chain.  State immunisation officer Dileep Patil, deputy director P B Gandal and other medical officers were present at the installation of the walk-in coolers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-walk-in-coolers-set-up-to-increase-vax-storage-capacity/articleshow/83929345.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Over 50% Mumbai kids have antibodies: Sero-survey||MUMBAI: The results of the BMC’s first pediatric sero-survey show 51.18% of the children surveyed have antibodies to the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2, allaying fears that the probable third wave would disproportionately affect children. The presence of antibodies in blood reveals a past infection and, more importantly, indicates the person has immunity against the same infection for some period. The pediatric survey was carried out by BMC-run Nair Hospital doctors, with 2,176 samples collected from the 24 civic wards in the city. The survey began on April 1, when the second Covid wave was peaking, and continued till June 15, said Nair Hospital’s head of microbiology Dr Jayanthi Shastri. At 53.4%, sero-positivity is highest in 10-14 age groupThe BMC’s first pediatric sero-survey shows over 50% of the children surveyed have antibodies. To get a picture from across socio-economic levels, 1,283 samples were taken from BMC-run Aapli Chikitsa Network and Nair Hospital that offer free tests, while 893 samples were taken from two private labs. “There was fear that children would be most vulnerable during the third wave as they would be the only section not vaccinated against Covid-19, prompting us to carry out a survey that would provide answers,” Nair Hospital’s head of microbiology Dr Jayanthi Shastri. BMC commissioner I S Chahal called the results, released on Monday, as “encouraging.” The survey results showed overall sero-positivity of 51.18% among children. More children from the economically weaker section (54.36%) had antibodies as compared to 47.03% from the relatively affluent sector. Sero-positivity was highest in the 10-14 age-group (53.43%) and lowest in the 1-to-4 age-group (51.04%). In the 10-14 age-group, more children who got their tests done in the public sector (58.3%) had antibodies than those in the private sector (46.8%). Incidentally, a recent sero-survey in Delhi too showed 59.3% children had previous exposure to the virus. When the pandemic began, it was believed children were immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But it was later established children get as infected by the virus as adults do, but they are largely asymptomatic. BMC commissioner Chahal told TOI that more children had antibodies now than a few months ago. The third sero- survey done in March, for instance, showed 39.4% in the under-18 group had antibodies. A BMC doctor observed that more children would have been exposed during the second wave. Welcoming the results, pediatrician Vijay Yewale, a member of the state pediatric task force, said the major fear vis-à-vis children was not the Covid-19 infection itself, but a little-known rare complication called multi-system inflammatory disorder that occurs a month after Covid. “The majority of children get asymptomatic Covid-19 infection, but a few of them could thereafter develop MIS that is serious,” he said. Another pediatriciain said the fear of the third wave had led the state to carry out much-needed upgrade of pediatric infrastructure in public hospitals. Chahal said despite the encouraging results, the BMC wouldn’t lower its guard as far as the third Covid wave is concerned. The field hospital in Malad will have 200 pediatric oxygen beds and 50 pediatric ICU beds. The four new field hospitals at Mahalaxmi, Worli, Kanjurmarg and Sion will have1,000 pediatric beds in all. “We are ensuring that there are cubicles made in a way for the patient and a parent can stay,” said Chahal. Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj said the sero-survey results are good, but it would still not be a good idea to open up schools before children are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/over-50-city-kids-have-antibodies-sero-survey/articleshow/83938985.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Pune||Pune: 129 housing societies get PMC nod to hold vaccine camps on premises||PUNE: As many as 129 housing societies in the city have been given permission by the PMC to hold vaccination drives on their premises, so far, civic officials have said. The PMC has allowed housing societies to tie up with private hospitals to organise these camps. The housing societies will need permission from the PMC. It’s a similar rule for housing societies within PCMC limits. “We have given permissions to 129 housing societies so far. Quite a few of them have already held vaccination camps on their premises by tying up with private hospitals. The idea is to get the maximum number of people vaccinated and avoid overcrowding,” said PMC’s Covid-19 vaccination chief, Vaishali Jadhav. Jadhav, however, said the PMC is currently not considering free drives at housing societies. “Housing societies can tie up with designated private hospitals called private Covid vaccination centres (PCVCs) to hold a drive,” Jadhav said. Ashwin Porwal, medical director of the Healing Hands Clinic, said, “We have had vaccination drives at around four housing societies so far. We are not charging extra for logistics. It is Rs 780 for a dose of Covishield, as fixed by the Centre.” Abrarali Dalal, CEO of Sahyadri hospitals said, “We recently started vaccine drives at housing societies. On Sunday, we had our first drive at a housing society in Rahatani in PCMC limits. The per dose price of Covishield is Rs 780. We’re not charging extra for transport and other expenses.” Jehangir Hospital’s CEO Vinod Sawantwadkar said, “We held camps at three big housing societies recently. We will be covering more. We're not charging extra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/129-housing-societies-get-pmc-nod-to-hold-vaccine-camps-on-premises/articleshow/83934856.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Nagpur||New Vid cases drop below 100 for first time post 2nd wave||Nagpur: The 11 districts in Vidarbha region together reported 99 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday. Though a major reason for this was the decline in number of daily tests to 13,805 due to Sunday lull, the test positivity rate — under 1% — continued to bring cheer to the region. Less than 100 cases were reported for the first time post the onset of second wave. Fewer than these many cases in a day were reported only in the month of June 2020. This indicates that Vidarbha region’s Covid-19 conditions have eased considerably, a big relief for the citizens. Seven out of 11 districts reported less than 10 new cases, including only 1 new case in Bhandara and Wardha. The three districts reporting new cases in double digits were Amravati (28), Nagpur (24) and Buldhana (13), which shows that the wave is receding in the region. As cases are going down, recovery count is also down, but still three times as much as the day’s new cases. 319 patients recovered on Monday. Now, 10,73,396 patients out of the 10,95,872 so far have recovered — a recovery rate of 98%, which is better than the state and national average. Number of under-treatment patients declined further to 2,304. Now, no district in Vidarbha has more than 500 patients under treatment. Gondia, Yavatmal, Bhandara and Wardha have barely 50 patients each under treatment. Six deaths were reported on Sunday, with two of them added into Bhandara’s count after reconciliation. Nagpur district reported no death for the second day, Wardha for sixth day, and Yavatmal for 12th day in a row. Overall, the death toll is under control, which is another indicator that the Covid-19 conditions have now improved. Bhandara: Only 1 new case out of 126 tests done in last 24 hours was reported in Bhandara. Two deaths from Lakhandur tehsil that had happened last week and gone unreported were added into the toll, which took it to 1,128. Now, Bhandara has 52 patients under treatment. Gondia: The district conducted 1,367 tests in last 24 hours and 4 of them tested positive. Seven patients recovered on Monday and no death was reported.

Washim: Eight new cases and 38 recoveries marked Monday in Washim district. A death was also reported due to Covid-19, which took the district death toll to 618. Now, 237 patients are under treatment in Washim. Amravati: Two covid deaths and a spike of 28 cases took the district’s toll to 1,552 and caseload to 95,911 respectively on Monday. With 70 getting discharged from the hospital today, the recoveries reached 93,902 for a rate of 97.91. This left 457 active cases under treatment. Yavatmal: No Covid death was reported on the 12th consecutive day in the district, as a result toll remained at 1,789. The administration has received 405 reports of which only two were found positive. Currently there are 51 active positive patients undergoing treatment in the hospitals.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao unveils PV Narasimha Rao statue; Vidya Peetham to be set up at KU||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has announced the state will set up a Vidya Peetham in the name of former PM PV Narasimha Rao at Kakatiya University in Warangal. He said the cabinet has approved the proposal. The government has already rechristened Necklace Road as PV Narasimha Rao Marg. KCR along with governor Tamilisai Soundararajan unveiled the 26-foot bronze statue of PV Narasimha Rao at PV Gnana Bhoomi on the banks of Hussainsagar on Monday as part of the closing ceremony of the year-long birth centenary celebrations of the former PM. The chief minister said PV was a known reformist, who bailed out the country from a financial crisis. “He also ran the minority government for five years while introducing and implementing many welfare schemes,” the CM said. The land reforms, introduced by him in the united AP, were followed by many states. He donated 800 acres of agriculture land owned by his family in Karimnagar and Warangal districts, which indicated his commitment towards society and upliftment of the poor. Recalling Rao’s contribution in education, KCR said Navodaya Schools and Gurukuls were started during his stint as education minister, which were now giving results. “The former PM had left indelible mark in every field both at the Centre and united AP,” KCR said. He thanked Hyderabad-Mahabubnagar and Rangareddy Graduates’ MLC constituency voters for electing PV’s daughter Vani Devi in the recent elections. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said the state government had organised programmes to pay tributes to the former PM in a befitting manner. She said PV was respected by people all over the country. Earlier, both the governor and CM paid tributes to PV Narasimha Rao and released eight books, four books written by the former PM —‘Influence of India’s Culture on the West and Other Speeches’, ‘The Granny and Other Stories’, ‘The Meaning of Secularism and Other Essays’ and ‘Thus Spake PV-Interviews with PV Narasimha Rao’. The CM complimented the PV Narasimha Rao Centenary Celebrations Committee for organising many programmes despite Covid-19 restrictions. PV Narasimha Rao Centenary Celebrations committee chairman K Keshava Rao urged the Centre to name the Central University in Hyderabad after the former PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-unveils-pv-statue-vidya-peetham-to-be-set-up-at-ku/articleshow/83937226.cms||---

While alumni from different batches have made several contributions in the past, this is probably the first initiative where alumni of a hostel have pooled in their resources to overhaul it. Renovation of the 200-room Hostel 5, also called the Penthouse now, is a joint initiative of the institute and the alumni association. Dhananjay Saheba, a board member of the IIT-B Alumni Association, said the idea came up when one of his classmates from the batch of 1977 visited the hostel and shared some pictures. “We decided to appeal to everyone who has graduated from the hostel over the years. We thought of the initiative in mid-December and, by February, we had met our target of Rs 5.5 crore,” he said. The plan is to build a common study area with WiFi coverage and other state-of-the-art facilities, besides additional toilets, he said. He said hostel life played a critical role in their education and development and it is where they forged some of their deepest and most meaningful friendships. “Current H-5 students have expressed keen interest in the enhancements as they will significantly improve the quality of hostel life,” said institute director, Subhasis Chaudhuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-bombay-alumni-pool-in-rs-5-5cr-to-upgrade-hostel-facilities/articleshow/83934931.cms||---

There were also many people who were out in public without masks. Nashik IMA president Hemant Sonanis warned people that such indiscipline can be disastrous as experts have predicted a third wave that will be worse than the second one. Many doctors said that if people continued with their negligent attitude, the situation would be similar to the peak of the second wave when there was shortage of medical oxygen and medicines. Bhausaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said that apart from the vaccination, maintaining Covid safety protocol is the only way to shield people from the third wave. From Tuesday, police officials will be putting in place measures to ensure that there is no overcrowding in the markets. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey on Monday issued an order to all the police stations asking the personnel to take strict action against people not following the Covid norms. As per the new orders, assembly of five or more people is prohibited from 5 am to 5 pm till July 27. There should be no unnecessary movement of people between 5 pm and 5 am either. Shops will be open only between 7 am to 4 pm daily till July 27 and strict action will be taken on shopkeepers of non-essential commodities if their shops are found open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-covid-norms-ignored-as-crowds-fill-city-markets/articleshow/83929380.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The facilities were started recently and are getting good response from people who would not want to disturb their daily routine and also be assured of getting the shot. The two facilities have been started at HCG Manavata Cancer Centre and Suyash Hospital in the city. More than 2,500 people have taken both shots at both these centres so far and around 10% of the beneficiaries opted to take the shots after 9 pm and before 7 am. “Our aim is to make the doses available for people at their convenience. We started the round-the-clock vaccination centre where citizens can walk in at any time and get vaccinated,” Dr Raj Nagarkar of Manavata Cancer Centre said. Nashikites who want to get themselves protected against Covid-19 at the earliest and who are willing to pay for the same are opting for the 24x7 centres. “People are coming in whenever they feel like getting vaccinated. They turn up even in the middle of the night,” said Nagarkar. Dr Hemant Ostwal of Suyash Hospital said when the citizens visit the facilities they understand how professionally the vaccines are being administered. “Vaccination is not merely an injection but lot of care has to be taken to ensure the cold chain is maintained till the last point,” he said. “I wanted the vaccine after I finish with my work. It is difficult for me to spend two hours for getting vaccinated during the day time. It is nice that we now have centres open even in the night. I took the jab at 10 pm,” Harish Kokate, an employee working with a multinational company, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-24x7-pvt-vax-centres-operational-in-nashik/articleshow/83929413.cms||Abhilash Botekar

He said that for the first couple of years after Rao introduced economic reforms in 1991, the country’s growth was anaemic and similarly, in the current scenario too, it will take some time before country reaps the benefits of the new reforms. Listing reforms in agriculture, labour, change in MSME definition, performance-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for exports, opening up of FDI for multiple sectors like insurance, privatisation of public sector banks and setting up of bad bank, among others, he said that these reforms are expected to boost growth and the country is expected to clock growth upwards of 7% from financial year 2023-24. Meanwhile, he also stated that the country’s plan to mop up Rs 1.75 lakh crore via disinvestment this fiscal is on track. “…this year there is actually a lot of emphasis on achieving these targets. Do remember that of Rs 1.75 lakh crore, a good part will be from LIC’s initial public offering. Second is from Bharat Petroleum privatisation…,” he said, adding that Air India’s privatisation is also very important from ‘signalling perspective’. Meanwhile, talking about the impact of the second wave of Covid-19 on the economy, he said it will not be as significant as the first wave mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, the pace of rise and decline in Covid-19 cases has been steeper in the second wave as a result of which it has impacted the economy for a much shorter duration as compared to the first wave. Secondly, in the first wave, there was a lot of uncertainty due to the lockdown, whereas in the second wave all the restrictions were at the state level and therefore it was easier to restart economic activities and recovery is expected to be much sharper.  The CEA said that reforms are expected to boost growth and the country is expected to clock growth upwards of 7% from financial year 2023-24||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvnr-would-have-backed-reforms-by-modi-govt-cea/articleshow/83937258.cms||Swati Rathor

BJP state secretary Rahul Kothari said 50% of the total 9.19 lakh Congress followers are fake and BJP would lodge a complaint with the cyber cell and the Election Commission. The Congress, however, shot back saying BJP is far behind Congress in social media activities. “Since long we have been busy investigating how the Congress party increased 6 lakh additional followers within 15 months. We have found that 50% Congress followers are fake. The way Congress leader Kamal Nath has managed followers from Dubai, Pakistan and Syria, has now been exposed," Kothari told TOI. He added: “Congress followers have no material for tweets, no profile photos or any fan following. We have released a list of 50% fake followers for verification.” “BJP believes in purity. BJP’s grassroots base of followers is actual. We work in politics with real and dedicated workers. The way Kamal Nath played a devious trick, we will definitely go to the Cyber Cell and complain the Election Commission to cancel the recognition of Congress,” said Kothari. “We have exposed the Congress’ fake social media strategy. Kamal Nath is using professionals for manipulations. Congress’ IT cell is doing all this. What Congress is doing? Only posting tweets,” said BJP state president VD Sharma. As per data released by Congress last week, it has 9,19,465 followers on Twitter and 61,862 followers on Instagram. The BJP has only 7,84,363 followers on Twitter and 9,715 followers on Instagram. Congress leaders further said that the Grrand Old Party has 86% real followers, while the BJP has only 62%. “The Congress gets an average of 589 likes per tweet, while BJP gets just 113 likes per tweet. Besides, Congress has an engagement score of 58 per cent against BJP’s 25 percent,” said a senior state functionary. Amid war of words on the social media, Congress has also challenged the followers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. “BJP is not aware of the difference between inactive and fake followers. The website they have used to trace out the details also shows fake followers of PM Modi and CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. BJP is spreading lies instead of accepting the truth,” said Congress state spokesperson, Narendra Saluja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bjp-cong-spar-over-who-has-upper-hand-on-social-media/articleshow/83932791.cms||---

All the government officials working in that village have been allotted responsibility,” Peth tehsildar Sandeep Bhosale said. As per the plan, one village per PHC will be covered on each of the six days of a week, for next five weeks till July 31. There are a total of 144 villages to be covered in the taluka. So far, the health department has vaccinated 14,000 people against the total expected population of 91,000, which means that only 15% of the target population has been covered. “There are a lot of misgivings about vaccinations and as a result, very few people take the jab. This is the reason that an action plan has been drawn up. Every day one village in each of seven PHCs has been selected for the campaign. Awareness camp will be carried out among people in that village for effective vaccination,” taluka health officer Dr Yogesh More said. The average vaccination of the taluka is around 400 per day and the target is to increase it to about 1,500 per day. “Our intention is to vaccinate every eligible beneficiary and hence, we have also deployed two vaccinators per team,” the officer said. Ganesh Misal, the incident commander of vaccination drive in Nashik district, exuded confidence in the success of the Peth plan of vaccination of maximum beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vax-campaign-in-peth-eyes-total-coverage-by-july-31/articleshow/83929436.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The patient had been admitted to AIG Hospital on June 14 with complaints of breathlessness, chest pain and weakness. He was stabilised and an angiogram revealed that the three main arteries were blocked. Given the patient’s long list of co-morbidities, a multi-disciplinary team was constituted. “The biggest challenge for such high-risk patients undergoing cardiac intervention is maintaining stable pressure and perfusion to brain, kidneys and other critical organs,” said Dr Anuj Kapadia, AIG Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/worlds-smallest-heart-pump-used/articleshow/83934942.cms||---

Party leader NV Subhash said that neither Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi paid tributes not conducted a party programme to mark the occasion. “Even the Telangana Congress unit had announced that it will conduct a national-level seminar in honour of PV but nothing has happened,” he said. Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy said AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has no respect for PV. Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson D Sravan said the BJP is adopting double standards. While it has sidelined its own stalwarts like LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi, it wants to pay respects to PV. “The Gandhi family has always shown respect to late PV,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-leadersignored-payingrespects-to-pv/articleshow/83937284.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Containment-zones come up on southern fringes to stop Covid spike||KOLKATA: Just like the northern fringes of the city where several containment zones have come up since last week, the southern tips of the city, covering the extended KMDA area, will now see the creation of multiple containment zones. Located on the periphery of Garia, micro-containment norms have been imposed on Model Town (Narendrapur), Rajpur-Dakshin Jagaddal and Dhalua Police Para under Rajpur-Sonapur Municipality over the past 24 hours. Also, Shibrampur and Chatterjeepara, on the borders of Behala and Joka, have been tagged as containment zones in the Maheshtala municipality area. All these places are located within 5km from the city. The two municipalities are alone contributing to 10 out of the 37 containment zones in South 24 Parganas, which had 11 such areas last week. “Our proximity to Kolkata makes us vulnerable. If we cannot control the cases, the city will suffer,” said Pallab Das, administrator of the Rajpur Sonarpur Municipality. The district administration and the Baruipur police division are especially worried about the Rajpur-Narendrapur belt. Home to the new upwardly mobile class as well as several middle-class families living there for decades, the belt reported 214 new cases last week. All the containment zones are in six of the 35 wards of the municipality: 1,2,3, 21, 25 and 26. “Increased restrictions will be imposed on any district reporting over 100 cases daily.. But there is no need to panic, given we are reducing the number by around 10%-15% every week,” Das said. He pointed out that on humanitarian grounds, no barricade will be set up outside affected people’s homes. “We are requesting the families not to venture out even if some member are unaffected. We will ensure food and grocery reach their home from the municipality,” he said. No shop was open at Model Town, the biggest containment zone in the area. Sonarpur North MLA Firdousi Begum said they were trying to step up vaccination in the affected areas. “After vaccinating 1,500 people per day in Sonarpur, we scaled up the drive to 5,000 as we noticed active cases were not coming down,” she told TOI. Police said shutting down all 15 markets in the 35 wards in the Rajpur-Sonarpur civic area, including the Garia station market, from Monday to Wednesday was likely to cut down on cases. “We have deployed our men on multiple rounds. We are coordinating with the municipality for monitoring,” said SP (Baruipur) Vaibhab Tiwari. Das said the markets were shut after discussion with traders. Saikat Pal, a resident, said still several residents did not wear masks properly. “Merely shutting down areas is no answer. More proactiveness is required on the streets,” said the Model Town resident. At Shibrampur, barely a kilometre from Sakuntala Park on the Behala end, residents said there was regular sanitization. “We have been asked to stay home. But with everything open barely 500metre from the containment zone and no cop being present, rules are often flouted,” said Apurba Halder, a bank employee from the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/c-zones-come-up-on-southern-fringes-to-stop-covid-spike/articleshow/83935043.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Lucknow||Eye on Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, BJP to revamp organisation, fill posts at grassroots||LUCKNOW: After mobilizing its cadre to win maximum seats in zila panchayat chairman polls due on July 3, the BJP is planning an organisational restructuring at the grassroots to refurbish its political machinery to take on a combative opposition ahead of 2022 assembly elections. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh told TOI that the party would soon make fresh organisational appointments at six regional and 1,918 divisional levels. Sources in the BJP said a number of positions at district level had turned vacant after the party decided to field its workers in zila panchayat and gram panchayat polls held in April. “Our aim is to fill the vacant posts and constitute the party structure at the grassroots,” he said, maintaining that as a cadre-based party, BJP aspires for a well-coordinated organisational structure comprising trained party workers. Singh said the party would also step up appointments of members of frontal wings across the state in the next 15 days. UP BJP has already effected a major reshuffle in the leadership of seven frontal wings – Yuva Morcha, OBC, ST, SC, farmers, women and minority wing – which augment party’s outreach among various social groups. BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and vice-president Radha Mohan Singh, during their recent meeting with UP BJP leaders, had insisted on ensuring a robust organization down to the booth level. The UP BJP has charted out a series of programmes to drum up support as part of preparations for assembly elections. Singh said the party would help the state government scale up vaccination drive against Covid-19 in rural areas. For this, the party plans to deploy at least two persons in every village. This comes in view of the party’s decision to escalate the awareness drive among people for vaccination. According to political analysts, the BJP is trying hard to counter the concerted efforts of the opposition to corner the government over alleged mismanagement of the second wave of coronavirus pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/eye-on-polls-bjp-to-revamp-organisation-fill-posts-at-grassroots/articleshow/83937286.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||India||80% of Mumbai exposed, third wave may not be too large: Tata Institute of Fundamental Research||MUMBAI: As 80% of Mumbai's population has possibly been exposed to Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, the third wave's peak is unlikely to be as large as the second wave's peak where 90 fatalities were registered on May 1. However, this positive projection by scientists of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) comes with a caveat: this is provided reinfections are not substantial. "Reinfections will hold the key in the third wave," said the study's main author Dr Sandeep Juneja, dean of TIFR's school of technology and computer science. It is almost 17 months since the pandemic began in India and people infected in the first wave in 2020 could be vulnerable again due to dropping antibody levels. Keeping an eye on reinfections would help civic authorities catch the trend early. Juneja said it would help check the third wave if the 20% of Mumbaikars who haven't caught Covid yet are vaccinated soon. Coronavirus: Live updates "We also consider a somewhat pessimistic scenario where reinfections are significant (amongst the 80% recovered, 10% are amenable to infections, and if infected, will follow the same disease progression as the first time infected), or a new variant that is 50% more infectious and 50% more virulent than the Delta variant," they said.   The other factors that could affect the third wave would be poor effectiveness of the vaccine (due to a variant causing escape from vaccine immunity) or opening up the city at 60% level but low compliance to Covid-appropriate behaviour. "Despite these negative things, the resulting peak is seen to be no larger than that under the second wave," said Juneja. The team said the third wave would be barely noticeable by September if four factors align: reinfections are mild; there are no new dangerous variants, vaccination coverage is extensive in June, July and August; and the vaccine is 75-95% effective. The TIFR paper noted Mumbai's peak during the second wave was lower than, say, peaks in Delhi and Bengaluru because of higher levels of previous exposure to the virus. Mumbai saw a peak of around 11,000 cases a day in the second wave, while Delhi saw a peak of around 28,000 and Bangalore of around 25,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/80-of-mumbai-exposed-third-wave-may-not-be-too-large-tata-institute-of-fundamental-research/articleshow/83940816.cms||---

All the patients from the vicinity were evacuated and rescued from the affected areas as a preventive measure. The casualty area was shut for a few hours. Some of the patients were moved to Safdarjung while some were adjusted at AIIMS itself. TimesViewAIIMS is among the most prestigious medical institutes of the country. Occurrence of several fires, even minor ones, is a cause for serious concern. The reasons must be investigated and any possible faults must be rectified immediately.“A call was received at 5.04 am about a fire in the operation theatre (OT) of Emergency Department and seven fire tenders were rushed to AIIMS. The situation was brought under control in an hour and there was neither any casualty nor any injury to any person,” said Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service (DFS). The fire broke out in a store room adjacent to the OT, he added. The casualty department was later reopened. This was the fourth fire incident at AIIMS since January last year. Senior officials from the fire department stated that the hospital always has an influx of patients. “The building is old and requires maintenance, but due to the patient load, it doesn’t happen and such fire incidents keep happening,” they said. Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “Investigation is underway to ascertain the exact cause of the blaze”. Another minor blaze was reported at Safdarjung Hospital on Monday morning. “A call was received at 7.58 am about a fire near the canteen area of the hospital. Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The fire broke out in an underground cable. It was brought under control very quickly and no injuries were reported,” added Garg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fourth-blaze-at-aiims-since-last-year-no-casualties/articleshow/83935038.cms||---

The challenge for Madhya Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MPMRCL) a joint venture of union government and MP, is to meet the target of launch date of first phase by 2023. The metro project underway is on the proposed purple line. New phase, with an investment of Rs 421 crore, calls for construction of 8 elevated metro rail stations including viaduct portion within the stations and transition spans on either side of the stations. Route length of purple line is 14.99 km. Construction of line from Karond Square passing through Bhopal Talkies, Railway Station, Bharat Talkies and Bogda Pul would require underground railway construction. Other line is Red Line for Bhopal metro. Any metro would require a depot to start functioning. Proposed depot at Arera Hills (Stud Farm) was estimated to be wide enough in area. However, recent proposals to the state government have requested for more land acquisition. The land is government owned and proposal is expected to be cleared soon. Turn out area for connecting to about dozen lines requires a large turning radius for metro to be serviced at a depot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-metro-phase-1-work-70-complete/articleshow/83932868.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Prepare strategy to detect, contain Delta Plus variant in Uttar Pradesh: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: With the highly transmissible Delta Plus variant getting detected in 11 states, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said it is imperative to have a plan for containment of cases, especially if this variant is detected in UP as well. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said the state was currently working on two aspects for detection and containment of the variant. “Even though the current positivity rate in the state is 0.1%, the CM has said that testing should not fall below 2.5 lakh a day. With the new variant having reached Madhya Pradesh, testing has been ramped up at all railway stations, bus stations and airports. Anyone showing any symptom is being tested immediately,” he said. “All Covid-19 positive samples of people coming from other states are being sent for genome sequencing. We have been sending 10% of all positive cases for genome sequencing. Now, samples of all those testing positive at points of entry into UP are being sent for testing. Districts along the MP border, like Jhansi, are also sending all positive samples for genome sequencing,” he added. Currently, Covid-19 positive samples are being sent for genome testing to four labs – BHU in Varanasi, KGMU and CDRI in Lucknow and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi. During a meeting with Team-9 on Monday, the CM said feedback on handling of Delta Plus variant should be taken from states which have reported these cases so that UP could implement an effective strategy for its containment. “The government-appointed expert committee has been asked to prepare a strategy for Delta Plus which will then be implemented across the state,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-prepare-strategy-to-detect-contain-delta-plus-variant-in-up/articleshow/83937330.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pardesh former CM Digvijaya Singh lodges FIR against Twitter handle||BHOPAL: Former chief minister and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh on Monday lodged an FIR with the state police Cyber Cell against twitter account @LeaksClubHouse for allegedly distorting his statement and presenting/ circulating it in an unconstitutional manner. Recently, Singh was in the midst of a controversy after @LeaksClubHouse allegedly released an audio of a club house conference, in which, the senior leader is heard claiming that if Congress returns to power, it will take a “relook” at abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. The conference was hosted by a Pakistani journalist. The audio was then released by BJP IT Cell chief Amit Malviya and went viral. On Monday, Singh reached the Cyber Cell police station and got the complaint lodged, in which, he said: “I am presently a Rajya Sabha MP and a former chief minister for ten years. On 15.05.2021, a club house media platform invited me for an audio conference also attended by many others.” The senior Congress leader alleged in his complaint that on June 12, a Twitter handle was started called ClubHouse Leaks (@Leaks-ClubHouse). The first tweet there was posted at 3am, in which, it was said that the admin will soon tweet a post after editing the same. At 4:03am the second tweet was posted saying that I told a man from Pakistan that if Congress comes to power, Article 370 will be restored. “Some persons have distorted my statement to malign me. I have requested the government that investigation should be conducted promptly under the IT Act, just like in Uttar Pardesh, where action has been taken against those who retweeted this post. I have urged that while action must be taken against those who edited the audio and those who distorted the statements, FIR should also be registered against those who retweeted that post,” Singh said after lodging his complaint. The former chief minister said that he is also serving notice to ClubHouse app that interviewed him because there is an affidavit that they cannot leak the discussion. “That too an edited version has been leaked,” he said. Singh said he is also sending a notice to Twitter. “I will also request Ravi Shankar Prasad that the readiness you showed in the investigation in UP should be shown here, too,” Singh said. He asked: “BJP government is both at the Centre and state. If I am a Talibani or have any connection with terrorists, a minister even said that I get money, then why are they not being able to register an FIR against me? They have no evidence. So should I not file a defamation suit against them?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/diggy-lodges-fir-against-twitter-handle/articleshow/83932827.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Gadchiroli welcomes ZP school students with band, baaja||Nagpur: The small entourage carrying balloons, bouquets, box of chocolates and swinging to loud drum beats could easily be mistaken for a marriage procession in the narrow bylanes of this remote Gadchiroli village. But this procession in Koyanguda village, in Naxalite-affected Bhamragarh taluka, stopped outside six-year-old Harish Vasudeo Habka’s house to celebrate his ‘first day of school’. Zilla parishad school (Koyanguda) principal Vinit Padmawar decided to visit all six of his new admissions in this unique ‘band, baaja & baraat’ style because physical reopening of schools is not allowed due to the Covid pandemic. “Well, if they can’t come to school, the school will go to them,” said Padmawar.Habka stared in disbelief at the adults who seemed to shower all their attention on him. As the drum beat tempo picked up, so did the applause and Habka found himself receiving the multiple gift items from the special welcome party.Padmawar said, “Kids love gifts. That’s a basic human trait which is more intense in kids, hence I decided to present multiple things to my students. Apart from all the goodies given as gifts, we also presented a set of academic books to the students.”Bhamragarh taluka has a unique topography and is a security sensitive area due to the presence of Naxalites. During monsoon, entire taluka gets cut off from civilization for days, if not weeks, as the only bridge connecting it to the outer world gets submerged under the rising waters of Parlakota river. Some of the deadliest encounters between the Naxalites and security forces have taken place here and children here are no strangers to hearing stories or even seeing the outlaws passing through their hamlets.Padmawar said, “That’s why education plays a crucial role, because children have to be kept engaged in a constructive atmosphere that no other ideology influences them. Closing down of physical classroom had hit us hard because in these remote areas online education is not possible. At some places you don’t even get mobile network, forget about Internet. Plus their socio-economic condition is not conducive for pursuing academic interests.”Even last year when urban students lapped up online classes, kids in these remote villages stared at a bleak future. That’s when many enterprising ZP schoolteachers in the taluka took it upon themselves to start home visits. The teachers would ride their bikes once a week into villages and teach students. At times, they hiked on unmotorable roads to ensure no student is left out.“If these kids drop out of school, then there is a possibility of them getting drawn towards activities and ideologies detrimental to their future. Hence, keeping every child connected with education on a daily basis is our priority,” said Padmawar.Bhamragarh ZP education team’s transformation was spearheaded by its former block education officer Ashwini Sonawane in 2016. Though working in her home district Pune, she sought transfer to Bhamragarh taluka and brought in multiple changes to the ZP school education ecosystem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gadchiroli-welcomes-zp-school-students-with-band-baaja/articleshow/83935593.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Meanwhile, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that despite the decline in cases it was not advisable to take the Covid-19 prevention protocol for granted as the virus is fast changing its form. He also said that the majority of the Covid-19 cases during the second wave were caused by the delta variant of the coronavirus. To note, the transmissibility and death rate with the delta variant was much higher than the previous prevalent alpha strain. The Data showed that 25 casualties in the past 24 hours took the death toll to 22,559. Prasad said that vaccination was the best defence against pandemic virus and people should shun their fears and get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/57-dists-have-less-than-50-active-cases/articleshow/83937367.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Infections seen among HIV patients prey on Covid survivors||MUMBAI: Superinfections, which typically affect those with highly suppressed immune systems such as people living with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant patients, are increasingly seen in patients who have recovered from Covid-19. Notably, many are contracting these rare co-infections despite not being ‘bombed’ with steroids or treated for diabetes, underlining the possibility of Covid-19 itself causing massive immune weakening. In a recent case, a 66-year-old patient was admitted to Lilavati Hospital with complaints of breathlessness and fever a week after he had recovered and got discharged. He came with completely white lungs as if his Covid was back. But after running investigations, it turned out to be a case of cytomegalovirus pneumonia (CMV) infection. “We normally see CMV in patients who have undergone solid organ or stem cell transplants. We were surprised to see it in Covid cases,” said infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar. Around six such cases of CMV, rarely seen in individuals with healthy immune systems, have been recorded among post-Covid patients in Mumbai. At least one has succumbed to it. Similarly, pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), a serious fungal infection that causes inflammation and fluid build-up in lungs, has been seen in more than 6-7 post-Covid cases. Till now, PCP was usually seen in HIV/AIDS patients whose CD4 count had dropped below 200. The fungal infection called mucormycosis that emerged as one of the major opportunistic infections is thus not the only one affecting patients, say doctors, who add that they are fighting a battery of other co-infections among Covid recovered patients, including Covid-19 Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA), herpes reactivation, bacterial infection multidrug resistant pseudomonas and candida auris, an emerging fungus that’s considered a global threat. Infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava said these co-infections must be documented like mucormycosis if their extent has to be gauged. “There is at least a 20% rise in co-infection incidences,” he added. According to Dr Nagvekar, doctors have to stay alert and open to the possibility that these rare co-infections could hit even those without a history of HIV or undergoing a transplant. “If a post Covid patient returns with fever, breathlessness and a worsening of CT scan and X-ray, these opportunistic infections must be suspected,” said Nagvekar, who is also a member of the state task force. “It’s not just steroids or diabetes alone but there is something about Covid that leads to this level of immune suppression,” he added. Physician and intensivist Dr Khushrav Bhajan has treated two cases of CMV and several of herpes reactivation and fungal infections of the skin. “Steroids have been used for 25 years now but we have never seen so many secondary infections with bacterial, viral and other pathogens. The role of Sars-Cov-2 alone in causing severe immunosuppression must be considered here,” he said, adding that cases could be going undetected as well. Intensivist at Hiranandani Hospital Dr Arpita Dwivedy said while 70%-80% who have returned with an opportunistic infection have been treated with steroids in her observation, the role of the infection definitely needs study. “Like HIV, which is an RNA virus, whether Sars-Cov2 also suppresses the immune system, must be studied in depth. Patients with autoimmune disease have been on steroids for years but never have we seen so many opportunistic infections in people with otherwise healthy immune systems,” she said, adding that usage of rare antibiotics in most hospitals has gone through the roof due to the surge in these co-infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-infections-seen-among-hiv-patients-prey-on-covid-survivors/articleshow/83935059.cms||Sumitra Debroy

As per information, 190 new cases were reported in the state, while 26 persons recovered from it. With this the state is left with just 3,046 active cases of which 1,868 are under home isolation. This means that less than 1,200 patients are in hospitals for treatment of Covid-19. A look at the data indicated that as many as 57 districts in the state have less than 50 active cases, while one district Mahoba has become coronavirus infection free. Also, only six districts have more than 100 active cases, including Lucknow (261), Prayagraj (164), Kushinagar (147), Varanasi (147), Muzaffarnagar (124) and Meerut (123). The new cases took the state’s overall tally to 17,05,779 of which 16,80,174 have recovered. This speaks for a recovery rate of more than 98.5%. Meanwhile, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said that despite the decline in cases it was not advisable to take the Covid-19 prevention protocol for granted as the virus is fast changing its form. He also said that the majority of the Covid-19 cases during the second wave were caused by the delta variant of the coronavirus. To note, the transmissibility and death rate with the delta variant was much higher than the previous prevalent alpha strain. The Data showed that 25 casualties in the past 24 hours took the death toll to 22,559. Prasad said that vaccination was the best defence against pandemic virus and people should shun their fears and get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/57-dists-have-less-than-50-active-cases/articleshow/83941355.cms||---

Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Monday conducted a meeting with district collectors and municipal commissioners from across the state about preparing the district oxygen management plan. “Each district collector is expected to prepare an oxygen management plan considering the maximum number of patients in the second wave as the base and then ensure oxygen availability three times the requirement at that peak,” Kunte said. The district oxygen management plan would include oxygen production in the district as well as storage facilities. The authorities have been told to store the oxygen in district and sub-district hospitals, or with manufacturers. Kunte said district authorities should submit the plan about where the oxygen would be stored and also draw up a plan with all agencies for transport of the stored oxygen. All facilities should be in place by July, he added. After the meeting, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said he would ready the district oxygen plan and submit it as early as possible. The authorities would assess the days on which the cases had peaked during the second wave in Pune and ready the oxygen supply to meet the peak requirement. “We already are in full preparation by assigning pressure swing absorption plants, liquid oxygen plants and oxygen storage cylinders in various parts of the district. I will seek details from both municipal commissioners and soon submit a plan to the chief secretary,” he said. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, who is a member of the District Disaster Management Authority, said active cases during the peak in a possible third wave could be thrice the number of cases during the second wave peak. The total number of active cases during the peak of the second wave in Nashik district was 48,400. At that peak, Nashik district needed 135 metric tonne (MT) oxygen daily. The state government has therefore asked the Nashik authorities to put in place availability of oxygen of not less than 400 MT per day. Jadhav said the district administration has been asked to ensure 70% of the total oxygen was stored in liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks with refilling systems that will act as a buffer stock. The Nashik municipal corporation has therefore decided to install a 50 kilolitre (KL) LMO tank at Zakir Hussain hospital. This will be in addition to the existing 20 KL facilities at Zakir Hussain and Bytco hospitals. Nashik civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said they were planning to raise seven LMO tanks, each with a capacity of 10 KL, at 50-bed hospitals in the rural areas. Nashik additional collector Dattaprasad Nade, who is the incident commander for oxygen planning, said they were planning to store more than half the oxygen in the LMO tanks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/stock-3-times-more-o2-than-requirement-at-2nd-wave-peak-dists-told/articleshow/83929510.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Kamal Nath writes to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on power tariff hike proposal||BHOPAL: Former chief minister and LOP Kamal Nath on Monday shot a letter to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan asking him to withdraw the proposed hike in electricity tariff in the state. “I request you to give relief to every section of society in this time of extreme inflation and revoke the increase in tariff of electricity,” Kamal Nath wrote. He also urged the chief minister to take a decision and waive electricity bills for the three months of corona curfew in the state. “Because of the corona epidemic, common man in the state is going through hardships with financial crisis, lesser income and spiraling inflation. Policies of the Centre and state have increased diesel prices making daily essentials costlier. Added to this, the price hike of petrol and cooking gas has badly affected the budget of every household,” he wrote. Nath argued that people of the state are looking towards the government with hope of fiscal relief. But the government is planning an increase in electricity tariff, he said. “During these times of high inflation, an 8% increase has been proposed in tariff for both domestic and agricultural consumers,” Kamal Nath wrote. He added that the increase in tariff will affect all sections including the poor, middle-class, business class, small traders and farmers. He reminded Chouhan that in December 2020 also, tariff of electricity was increased. Kamal Nath said that during the Congress regime, more than 97 lakh families were given 100 units of power for just Rs 100. He said that 20 lakh farmers also benefitted in his government when their bills got 50% rebate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nath-writes-to-cm-on-power-tariff-hike-proposal/articleshow/83932901.cms||---

---||Delhi||He, she & them: A toilet for third gender in Delhi||NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Council opened the first toilet complex in the city for the third gender opposite Shastri Bhawan on Monday and plans to build more such complexes. The facility developed near the Press Club of India parking under the Swachh Bharat Mission was inaugurated by members of the transgender community in the presence of NDMC chairman Dharmendra. The project was part of this year’s budget and was constructed on a pilot basis. “There is an online feedback machine and register for opinions regarding any additions or upgradation of the facility. Since the feedback machine is integrated with the Control and Command Centre, it will be automatically forwarded to NDMC,” said B M Mishra, the civic body secretary. Based on the feedback, we will take up work at other sites and integrate the requested changes.” This complex also has toilet facilities for regular users and specially abled persons and will be open from 6 am to 10 pm. “It has been developed on a public-private partnership basis and the concessionaire will be responsible for the maintenance,” said an NDMC official. In February, Delhi government instructed all its departments, offices, district authorities, municipal corporations and Delhi Police to have separate and exclusive washrooms for transgender people. The order also emphasised that trans-people should continue to be allowed to use gender-based toilets as per their self-identified gender. These government agencies were given a maximum time of two years to build these exclusive toilets. Prior to this, in 2014, the Supreme Court had accorded 'third gender' status to transgender people and also directed creation of separate toilets for them in public places, including hospitals. The NDMC move has been welcomed by the transgender community, but its members are concerned by the slow pace of implementation of the Supreme Court’s directive. Abhina Aher, a transgender activist and founder member of Transgender Welfare Equity and Empowerment Trust, said, “We welcome the move by the NDMC because we know how difficult it is for people like us to access public urinals. When we use the women's toilet, people make rude comments and attendants aren’t happy to let us in.” Rupika Dhillon, chairman, Society for People’s Awareness Care and Empowerment, said that the facility would help create a safe space for transgenders. “I am glad that at least some department/civic body has taken the lead and implemented the direction on exclusive toilets for the community. More should be built because it is their fundamental right,” said Dhillon. Anjan Joshi, Dhillon’s fellow activist, said, “One toilet in a city as big as Delhi is only a token but it is still a ray of hope.” Attributing the slow progress in the matter to the transgender community not being a vote bank, Sowmaya Gupta, a transgender activist, said, “Lutyens’ Delhi is not the entire Delhi. The NDMC area is a posh one, much of it with government offices. I think we should look beyond Lutyens’ Delhi and create facilities in other parts of the city where they are sorely required.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/he-she-them-a-toilet-for-third-gender/articleshow/83935082.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Bhopal||Engineering colleges in Madhya Pradesh face the heat due to curbs; 7 shut, seats too down 50%||BHOPAL: Engineering courses in the state that have been finding it difficult to survive has witnessed another blow during back-to-back lockdown due to the Covid pandemic. Sample this: The strength of seats in engineering courses has come down from 1 lakh to 55,519 before lockdown and it is likely to reduce by another 10,000 seats this year as seven colleges have closed down and another seven have already applied for closure. Core branches like computer science and mechanical engineering are still the favourite among a large number of students. With fresh admissions dropping to almost a trickle, many engineering colleges have closed down across the state. Earlier, around 200 engineering colleges used to participate in the admission counselling. In 2019, their number had dwindled to 150 and it will see more this year. According to an official data, 203 colleges took part in the online admission counselling in 2015-16, but in 2017-18, the figure dropped to 176. In 2018-19, there around 162 colleges which took part in the counselling. With the shutting down of colleges, the number of engineering seats have also come down. In 2016-17, there were 87,212 seats available and 45,999 (52.74%) students took admission. In 2017-18, the total seats available for admission were 71,026 and admission took place on 32,943 seats. In 2018, admission was done on 32,531 seats against the available 61,026 seats. In 2019, admission was available for 55,519 seats. With the engineering dream turning sour for students, the managements of engineering colleges are trying to utilize the infrastructure and campus for other subjects. An official said that the lockdown has put lot of pressure on college owners. “Engineering courses were already suffering. After pandemic hit, the colleges were left with no option as admission came down last year. Government should come forward to help the colleges. Else, more campuses will see the closure in the coming years,” said a college official without quoting his name. He said closure of campuses is not limited to MP only. It is true that colleges from various parts of the country have applied to shut down their respective campuses. Incidentally, for the past couple of years, no private player has applied to open an engineering college in the state. Sources said concentration of colleges in one or two cities has also led to poor admissions, forcing college owners to shut down their campuses. There are around 74 engineering colleges in Bhopal alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/engg-colleges-on-shaky-ground-due-to-curbs-7-shut-seats-too-down-50/articleshow/83932952.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Nagpur||BSNL salaries delayed again, Covid blamed for cash flow crisis||Nagpur: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has once again failed to pay salaries on time. The wages for May to be paid in June remain pending, even as the month ends in a couple of days. Official sources say there are chances that June salary would also be delayed, as the state-owned telecom company has seen low cash collections. This is being attributed to Covid by officials TOI spoke to. However, sources said BNSL’s inability to so far launch 4G services to come at par with private players is a major factor for the poor finances. The government has asked BSNL to procure 4G equipment from domestic vendors and avoid Chinese suppliers. It is learnt that BSNL has taken up the case with PMO, seeking a relaxation in the norms, as private players’ equipment too has Chinese components and are purchased from foreign vendors. There has been no response so far despite many reminders. BSNL is also awaiting a letter of comfort from government to facilitate bank loans for funding 4G services. If Covid has affected cash collections, BNSL employees too have faced tough times during the pandemic due to it. Even as medical advance was eventually started, a number of employees who suffered from Covid had to spend from their own pockets as reimbursements were held up, said sources. The first time BSNL had not paid salaries was in March 2019. This time, the delay in salaries has been despite BSNL reducing its manpower substantially, with 78,000 odd persons opting for voluntary retirement scheme over 2019-20. Even in Nagpur office, the strength has been halved after the retirement scheme one-and-a-half years ago. However, salaries have not regularized even after that. Employees say a delay of more than a fortnight had become the new normal. Salaries for April to be paid at the month end were paid after May 20. This current delay has been the longest, said employees here. There are indications that payment may be delayed beyond June-end, after which the current month’s salary would remain pending. BNSL director (finance) Yojana Das could not be contacted for a comment. A SMS went answered and her landline number not connect. A senior official said, requesting anonymity, there has been a major dip in collections, which has hampered the cash flow. The situation is expected to improve next month onward as recovery agents will start moving out to get the arrears, since restrictions have been eased after the second wave of the pandemic receded. “Medical advance was only started in May, before that employees who suffered from Covid had to spend on their own. The cashless facility was also not available as the empanelled hospitals refused the benefit due to delays in clearing bills from BNSL’s side,” said Naresh Kumbhare, district secretary of BSNL Employees Association. The employees had staged demonstrations last week to protest against delayed payment of salaries, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bsnl-salaries-delayed-again-covid-blamed-for-cash-flow-crisis/articleshow/83930553.cms||Shishir Arya

As per the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office, total 15,117 people took the first or second shot of the two-dose vaccine course till 5pm, while the figure on the CoWin portal till 9pm was 15,190. It was the lowest vaccinations in 18 days if CMO numbers are taken into account and 14 days if portal figures are considered. This drop has come after a record 1.4 lakh vaccinations in six days last week with Friday recording the highest 28,131. Last week, the number of booths ranged between 240-252 on different days, but on Monday drive was held at 128 booths. Vaccines were adequate for the 18-44 age category who have to book slots on the CoWin portal, but there was shortage for 45 years and above group, who have walk-in inoculation facilities. The KGMU got only 10 doses for 45 years and above beneficiaries and RMLIMS got just 50. Similar was the scene at other centres, including Balrampur Hospital, Rani Laxmi Bai Hospital, Jhalkari Bai Hospital, BRD Hospital, Lokbandhu Hospital, Avanti Bai Hospital and TB hospital. Vandana Shukla (51) went to BRD Hospital, Balrampur Hospital and Chinhat Community health but couldn’t get the vaccine anywhere. Akash Shukla booked a slot for his parents at Indiranagar CHS. “After waiting for two hours, the staff told us the vaccine is available for the 18-44 age group only,” he said. Archana Shukla (55) took the second dose at a private centre when she could not get it at the government booth. CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said “We are working to resolve the issue of supply. We have been assured about fresh supplies by July 1 by state authorities.” Camps at gurdwaras get a good response: The special vaccine camps at Naka and Sadar gurdwaras received an overwhelming response. A record 850 people – 525 in the 18-44 age group and 325 in 45 years and above -- were given the jab at Naka gurdwara, highest in a single day so far. Lucknow Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee president Rajendra Singh Bagga thanked the administration for setting up two booths and providing vaccines to meet the huge demand. The turnout at Sadar Gurudwara was over 700, but only 300 vaccines were allocated – 200 for 18-44 years and 100 for 45 years and above. “The rest had to go back disappointed. We have appealed to district and health authorities to allocate at least 500 vaccines in view of the huge demand,” said Harpal Singh Jaggi, president, Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shortage-fewer-booths-hit-vax-drive/articleshow/83937390.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The administration has denied the possibility but nonetheless assured a probe. TOI spoke to the family who preferred to remain anonymous and also refused to register a complaint as the husband of the woman works for a local government body. “I escorted my wife to the centre Friday afternoon. After her turn, she asked me if the dose was to be taken multiple times and said she was given the jab thrice. She said there were few staffers in the room and the vaccinator was talking to them and probably didn’t realise that she had accidentally administered the jab thrice to the same person,” the husband told TOI. When the woman felt unwell afterwards, her family dismissed it as a normal reaction. However, they panicked when three red marks and a slight swelling developed on her arm. Next morning, they informed the centre and a team visited them but found no adverse impact on the woman’s health. Dr A Mundada, in-charge of the Ghodbunder Road facility where the incident is alleged to have happened, confirmed spotting marks on her arm and attributed it to a reaction. “Our teams visited and checked her parameters which were normal. She didn’t display any adverse signs either. We offered to get her admitted but the family refused. We are in touch with her daily,” said Dr Mundada. Sandeep Malvi, deputy commissioner, denied the possibility of a triple vaccination but said they will probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/thane-woman-says-she-got-3-shots-inquiry-promised/articleshow/83935079.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Delhi||South Delhi eateries most eager to provide dining under the stars||NEW DELHI: At a time when Delhi eagerly awaits pleasant weather, many eateries and restaurants are trying to create dining areas outdoors and on rooftops. Around a hundred applications have been received for open air dining licences, the most from Dwarka and other areas in south zone and Aerocity in Najafgarh zone, both of which fall under South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). A senior SDMC official said 29 applications had been rejected and the owners had been asked to reapply after meeting the norms. With rising concerns about ventilation during the pandemic, open air dining is expected to get more popular once businesses settle down after the latest lockdown. Data from SDMC shows that out of 94 licence applications, 39 were from south zone, which has upscale areas like Greater Kailash, Green Park and Hauz Khas, while 31 were from Najafgarh zone with places like Dwarka and Aerocity. Central zone got 15 applications and nine came from west zone from places like Rajouri Garden and Punjabi Bagh. “While 56 licences have been granted so far, 28 have been rejected. Ten applications are being processed,” the official said. The overall rejection rate is 30%, the highest being in west zone where eight out of nine applications were disapproved. Multiple applications were received from Aerocity, Kapashera, Dwarka, Hauz Khas and Aurobindo Marg. Last year, after south corporation cleared the open air dining policy, thereby allowing serving food and liquor on rooftops and in open spaces, north corporation also adopted the same policy. The interest shown by restaurants in north Delhi is much weaker. A senior north corporation official said only one restaurant in Rajendra Nagar had been granted a licence. An East Delhi Municipal Corporation official said they had not yet started granting such licences. The policy states that licences would be granted to restaurants with a health trade licence and where the open space, such as a rooftop, is private property. Further, there should be no encroachments on public land, footpaths or roadsides. No cooking would be allowed in the open area and a liquor licence would be mandatory to serve alcoholic beverages. Structural safety certificate from a certified engineer and NOC from Delhi Fire Service is also mandatory. The fee for open air dining licence varies from Rs 100-200 per sqm. Before the pandemic, south Delhi had 2,000 big and small eateries. Earlier, TOI had reported that the renewal rate was still low and only around 30% units had renewed their health trade licence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/south-delhi-eateries-most-eager-to-provide-dining-under-the-stars/articleshow/83935127.cms||Paras Singh

This, despite a meeting among all Tollywood stakeholders last Thursday, when it was decided that shooting of serials would not be disrupted. Now that the technicians’ forum has decided not to cooperate till the MoU is signed, stakeholders are upset with work stopping for new serials, ‘Mon Phagun’, ‘Sree Krishna Bhakto Meera’ and ‘Dhulokona’. “The fate of two serials produced by Surinder Films now hangs in balance. ‘Mouer Bari’ and ‘Mon Mane Na’ were supposed to be telecast as part of the relaunch of Colors Bangla. Those shootings can’t begin. If there is a possibility of a deadline miss, the channel might ask us to shift the shooting outside Bengal. That will effectively mean loss of revenue for Bengal,” actor Bharat Kaul, operational head, Surinder Films. Raj Chakraborty, chairman of the I&CA, Sports and Youth Standing Committee of the state assembly, who was present at Thursday’s meeting, along with minister Aroop Biswas and actor-director Parambrata Chatterjee, called the technicians’ forums’ sudden turnaround a “violation” of the decisions and that it was “earning a bad name for the industry”. “The chief minister wanted this problem to be solved. So, we were sent to the meeting. This is insulting for us. It was decided that all work would go on even as the formulation and singing of the agreement progressed,” he said. FCTWEI president Swarup Biswas said, “Everyone in our industry should work together for Tollywood’s betterment. I will not make any further comment.” According to an FCTWEI official, technicians had committed to shooting only two new serials, ‘Rishton Ka Manjha’ and ‘Sundori’. “An email was sent to WATP on May 14, where we had said we would work on new projects only after the MoU was signed. We have been waiting for the past two years and 11 months for this signature. This was conveyed at the meeting. There is no question of violation,” he said. But others at the meeting insisted a decision had been taken to continue shooting of all projects. The FCTWEI member, however, maintained, “We had not made any promise. Rather, we had said this proposal would be discussed at the FCTWEI executive committee meeting. In our meeting, we decided to stick to the original plan. There is no violation on our part.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shooting-of-new-serials-pauses-over-mou-row/articleshow/83935481.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

Due to his behaviour she has kept their son at Arjun’s maternal grandparents’ home in Neelbad. On June 25, she had gone to Arjun’s grandparents’ home in Neelbad to meet her son, Arjun had accompanied him. Around 8 pm she received a call on her mobile phone and when she was speaking to someone, Arjun started hurling abuses at her saying that she talks over phone too much.

---||Coimbatore||Businesses emerge from shadow of lockdown, get ready for revival||Coimbatore: More than 45 days after the lockdown was imposed to contain the second Covid-19 wave, Coimbatore took the first step towards normalcy on Monday when most of the shops, service centres, salons and parks reopened. The state government has granted permission to reopen all kinds of shops, including stationary, footwear, electrical, electronic, hardware, salons, workshops and all kinds of industries. Shops are allowed to function from 9am to 7pm. Permission has been granted to operate export and auxiliary units with 100% workforce and other industries with 33%. Shops welcomed customers after checking temperature and making sure they used hand sanitizer.Dinesh, a gift shop owner, said business was dull on the first day. “It would take a few months for business to pick up. Students are our main customers. With schools and colleges shut, sales fell by half,” he told TOI.Paul, who sells vessels, said the business would flourish during the marriage seasons as people would buy in bulk. “Even though many marriages took place during the lockdown period, we could not sell any item. It would take at least six months for normal business to return.”“Some of my customers are from rural areas. They could not visit the shop due to lack of public transportation. Many of them still don’t know that shops are open and they keep calling us,” Paul added.A stationary shop owner, who was doing good business, credited it to pent-up demand. “I don’t know when I will get the usual business. As school and college students are migrating to online classes, the business is dull and we are struggling to survive,” he added.V Anand, a Keeranatham-based hairdresser, said he attended close to 10 customers on the first day. “As salons opened after two months, walk-ins were a bit high. We have made arrangements to accommodate only three people at a time and are sanitizing all equipment, and using single-use towels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/businesses-emerge-from-shadow-of-lockdown-get-ready-for-revival/articleshow/83935094.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Chandigarh||In public interest, HC steps in to improve Chandigarh and the Tricity life & its pace||CHANDIGARH: Pointing out that a need arises for stepping in as it is in the public interest of residents of Chandigarh and the Tricity itself so that it grows to its full potential, the Punjab and Haryana high court has taken up suo motu cognizance of a slew of civic and other matters plaguing the city for a while. A division bench of Justice G S Sandhawali and Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj has sought solution to long-pending issues like public transport in the form of mono rail or Metro, malba dumping in green belts and discharge of sewage into N-choe, while issuing notices to the central government and the UT administration. Pankaj Jain, the senior standing counsel for the UT, accepted the notice on behalf of the administration. The court has appointed Amit Jhanji, newly designated senior advocate, as pro bono counsel to assist it. “…Amicus curiae make periodic visits to various sites being referred.. and give his report as to the inaction of the administration and place the same before the court, so that more issues can also be redressed which have escaped the notice of this court. Accordingly, the matter be placed before the requisite division bench by taking appropriate orders from the Chief Justice,” according to the order. In a reprimand of the administration, the order said, “The UT suffers from futuristic long-term development plans on account of the administration being headed by a bureaucracy posted on deputation for short periods of 2 to 3 years. The elected representatives are only the mayor, who holds office for one year on rotation, and a sole MP. The town suffers from planned infrastructural projects coming up though it has to host a large number of visitors who come to the city daily on account of it being the capital…..” The court has also questioned whether the city required a public transport system in the form of mono rail or Metro that would seamlessly connect inflow from adjoining towns of Kalka-Parwanoo in the north, Yamunanagar on the north eastern side, Ambala on the southern side, Patiala on the south western side, Sirhind, Fatehgarh Sahib and Kharar on the western side and Nawanshahr, Ropar on the north-western side, to help reduce traffic from highways that comes into the city from all four sides. On the present infrastructure in Chandigarh, the high court has asked, “ Whether the infrastructure provided by the state has grown in proportion to the growth of the town from sectors 30 to 50 or whether the administration is not able to deal with the problems on account of adequate resources in the form of manpower and as to what was the cadre strength of appointments for the administration 40 years earlier and whether augmentation has been done thereafter… and whether sufficient regular persons are available to take the town forward to regain the status of City Beautiful.” The high court has sought reply of the administration as to why Rajindra Park not be developed as a forest area by planting renowned species of trees, creating walkways and pathways on the patterns of the Forest Institute at Dehradun to augment the green cover. The court has asked what steps the administration was taking to avoid the area from being converted into a dumping zone by residents of Khuda Ali Sher. “Why should the lake road/Uttar Marg, which is blocked at the entrance at the tum of Punjab Engineering College and Khuda Ali Sher, be not opened to facilitate the ready movement for persons commuting to the secretariat and the high court who have to come in a roundabout manner between Sector 11 and 2 to approach the institutes?” The court has also asked what is the statistical data of living trees and dead trees and what steps were taken to ensure that they were felled on time to prevent danger to pedestrians and residents. No underpass at high-density points “Despite various recommendations for the last more than two decades, the city has no traffic underpass at high-density traffic points like the transport chowk and the government press light points. Now another pedestrian underpass is proposed at PGI without any thought for future planning for vehicular underpasses for seamless traffic movement.” People commuting 60km, but no public transport system “In spite of the fact that people are commuting on daily basis as far as 60 km for example from Patiala, Nawanshahr, Kalka, Ambala and Sirhind, no effort is being made for long-term planning of public transport system in sync with Punjab and Haryana, whose capital it is, which would effectively and seamlessly connect these states by some high speed rail track/subway/” No one is accountable Every time proposals come through, but are jammed up in technical studies on footfall viabilities of projects and no one is accountable for seeing or pushing through the need of the hour of the town, leading to future decay ‘Short-term thinking pedestrian underpass cost city Rs 9cr’ The high court has said, “The solitary underpass built in in 1960s between sectors 11 and 15 has not been replicated in any other portion of the city by the administration and has led to chaos on account of the highest car ratio in the country… whereas short-term thinking of having a pedestrian underpass, which has cost the city a huge amount of Rs 9 crore and is grossly underutilized to the extent of having not more than 200 pedestrians using it, has been put in place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-public-interest-hc-steps-in-to-improve-city-life-its-pace/articleshow/83932983.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Avadh Dixit, a data analyst in a US-based company, died at the young age of 30 because he could not get a hospital bed in time. The pain of his untimely death made his friends do something for the healthcare sector. Seven of his friends pooled in money and decided to donate three beds and a wheelchair to the community health centre of Gudamba, the government hospital nearest to Avadh’s house. “Avadh’s condition was deteriorating and he did not get a hospital bed. By the time he was admitted to hospital in Indiranagar, he was critical and passed away on April 24,” said his friend Anshul Mehrotra, a photographer. Dixit had been ill for 10 days. His friends sent medicines to him but couldn’t save him. “Avadh was my closest friend; we were like brothers, sharing each and every memory since childhood. This gesture from us might reduce the pain of not being able to see our friend in his last days,” added Mehrotra. “Our donation is not huge but like us, everyone could take mini-steps to strengthen our health system. Before the third wave, people should try their best to support our health infrastructure,” said Aditya Anand, another friend. Other friends who have joined in the cause are Vineet Kumar, Dr Ayush Tandon, Nitin Dixit, Avanish Gautam and Gaurav Jaiswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/youth-dies-of-covid-friends-give-equipment-to-hosp-in-his-memory/articleshow/83937417.cms||Mohita Tewari

The SSB arrested three occupants of car. The drones and cameras were packed in eight cartons. Dayanand Kushwaha, the SSB sub-inspector of 20 battalion posted at Guabari border outpost (BOP) on Nepal border, said he along with other SSB personnel was engaged in vehicle checking on Gurhenwa-Dhaka road under Kundawa Chainpur police station area and intercepted the car bearing Bihar registration number. “Those arrested were identified as Vicky Kumar of Bairgania in Sitamarhi district, Rahul Kumar and Krishnandan Kumar of Kundawa Chainpur under the same police station area in East Champaran. They were handed over to Kundawa Chainpur police station for further action,” Kushwaha said. Kundawa Chainpur police station SHO Mithilesh Kumar said a case of smuggling has been registered against the three who had been remanded to judicial custody. He said the personnel of central intelligence agencies posted at Raxual interrogated them, but refused to reveal the details. “The consignment was being transported from Nepal and was supposed to be delivered in India,” Mithilesh said without revealing much. In another incident, the SSB personnel of 47 battalion seized high-quality charas worth Rs2.50 crore at Raxaul on Saturday and arrested one Shamir Sheikh, who was to deliver the narcotics to another smuggler from Uttar Pradesh. Smuggling of contraband items from Nepal to India through 726km-long porous border touching Bihar has been quite rampant, even during floods and the Covid-induced lockdown. A senior SSB official said it is not practically possible to check smuggling on the Bihar-Nepal border as it is open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/8-china-made-drones-seized-on-nepal-border-3-arrested/articleshow/83932998.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey
---||Goa||No need for death audit, no case of under-reporting of Covid deaths: Bombay high court at Goa||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Monday refused to go into the issue of appointment of any judicial commission to inquire into the deaths at the Goa Medical College (GMC) in May this year or the issue of payment of compensation to the victims. It also turned down the need for a death audit stating that there was no serious case of under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths. Dealing with a petition seeking judicial commission to look into deaths at GMC, the court stated, “There are no particulars as to whether any of the victims have authorised any of the petitioners to raise such a claim. In the state of such pleadings, we refrain from going into the issue of either appointment of a judicial commission, or the issue of payment of compensation.” It also took into consideration the advocate general’s submission that the Supreme Court is already seized with the issue of payment of ex-gratia compensation to the Covid victims. Countering the plea seeking death audit, advocate general Devidas Pangam assured the court that at least in Goa, there have been no cases of under-reporting and submitted that there was an issue of private hospitals not accurately reporting Covid deaths. He pointed out that in some cases, even show-cause notices have been issued to the violators and such notices will be disposed of in accordance with the law at the earliest. “This is yet another reason as to why we do not feel that it is appropriate for us to go into this issue, at this stage and that too, at the behest of the present petitioners.” The court however directed for a performance audit in respect of the ventilators and other medical equipment in Goa. “The state authorities are also required to take immediate steps to see that the ventilators and other medical equipment are in working condition so that there are no logistical issues in the future,” the high court stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-need-for-death-audit-no-case-of-under-reporting-of-covid-deaths-hc/articleshow/83937456.cms||---

At least 40 dedicated hospitals across the state have treated 3,239 cases of mucormycosis while recording 133 deaths. Black fungus cases were seen in Covid-recovered patients with co-morbidities and those who were administered steroids and oxygen therapy from the last week of May onwards. Doctors said patients who were not given anticoagulants had this problem. Health secretary Sidharth Mahajan said, “As we started witnessing the emergence of such cases, we took the help of experts like Dr Satish Jain, a well-known ENT surgeon. He advised that we should have dedicated hospitals treating such cases. So, we arranged for at least 40 hospitals across the state and to avoid mortality, we needed surgeons.” “With the timely intervention like surgery, we could bring down the death rate,” he added. Doctors at the SMS hospital and others stated that there is continuous dip in these cases. “For the past one week, we have seen continuous dip in the cases. In most of the cases, we had completed surgeries to check infections to go up further,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Senior doctors opined that the cases have gone down, but those who had dealt with mucormycosis, have to go for regular follow ups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-3-2k-mucor-cases-133-deaths-docs-tame-ailment-with-new-strategy/articleshow/83935146.cms||Ashish Mehta

Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Monday conducted a meeting with district collectors and municipal commissioners from across the state about preparing the district oxygen management plan. “Each district collector is expected to prepare an oxygen management plan considering the maximum number of patients in the second wave as the base and then ensure oxygen availability three times the requirement at that peak,” Kunte said. The district oxygen management plan would include oxygen production in the district as well as storage facilities. The authorities have been told to store the oxygen in district and sub-district hospitals, or with manufacturers. Kunte said district authorities should submit the plan about where the oxygen would be stored and also draw up a plan with all agencies for transport of the stored oxygen. All facilities should be in place by July, he added. After the meeting, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said he would ready the district oxygen plan and submit it as early as possible authorities in Pune would assess the days on which the cases had peaked during the second wave in Pune and ready the oxygen supply to meet the peak requirement. “We already are in full preparation by assigning pressure swing absorption plants, liquid oxygen plants and oxygen storage cylinders in various parts of the district,” he said. “I will seek details from both the municipal commissioners and soon submit a plan to the chief secretary,” he added. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav, who is a member of the District Disaster Management Authority, said active cases during the peak in a possible third wave could be thrice the number of cases during the second wave peak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stock-3-times-more-o2-than-need-at-2nd-wave-peak-dists-told/articleshow/83935137.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: At 53.4%, sero-positivity is highest in 10-14 age group||Mumbai: The BMC’s first pediatric sero-survey shows over 50% of the children surveyed have antibodies. To get a picture from across socio-economic levels, 1,283 samples were taken from BMC-run Aapli Chikitsa Network and Nair Hospital that offer free tests, while 893 samples were taken from two private labs. “There was fear that children would be most vulnerable during the third wave as they would be the only section not vaccinated against Covid-19, prompting us to carry out a survey that would provide answers,” Nair Hospital’s head of microbiology Dr Jayanthi Shastri.  BMC commissioner I S Chahal called the results, released on Monday, as “encouraging.”  The survey results showed overall sero-positivity of 51.18% among children. More children from the economically weaker section (54.36%) had antibodies as compared to 47.03% from the relatively affluent sector.  Sero-positivity was highest in the 10-14 age-group (53.43%) and lowest in the 1-to-4 age-group (51.04%). In the 10-14 age-group, more children who got their tests done in the public sector (58.3%) had antibodies than those in the private sector (46.8%). Incidentally, a recent sero-survey in Delhi too showed 59.3% children had previous exposure to the virus. When the pandemic began, it was believed children were immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. But it was later established children get as infected by the virus as adults do, but they are largely asymptomatic.  BMC commissioner Chahal told TOI that more children had antibodies now than a few months ago. The third sero- survey done in March, for instance, showed 39.4% in the under-18 group had antibodies. A BMC doctor observed that more children would have been exposed during the second wave.  Welcoming the results, pediatrician Vijay Yewale, a member of the state pediatric task force, said the major fear vis-à-vis children was not the Covid-19 infection itself, but a little-known rare complication called multi-system inflammatory disorder that occurs a month after Covid. “The majority of children get asymptomatic Covid-19 infection, but a few of them could thereafter develop MIS that is serious,” he said.  Another pediatriciain said the fear of the third wave had led the state to carry out much-needed upgrade of pediatric infrastructure in public hospitals.  Chahal said despite the encouraging results, the BMC wouldn’t lower its guard as far as the third Covid wave is concerned. The field hospital in Malad will have 200 pediatric oxygen beds and 50 pediatric ICU beds. The four new field hospitals at Mahalaxmi, Worli, Kanjurmarg and Sion will have 1,000 pediatric beds in all. “We are ensuring that there are cubicles made in a way for the patient and a parent can stay,” said Chahal.  Juhu corporator Renu Hansraj said the sero-survey results are good, but it would still not be a good idea to open up schools before children are fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-53-4-sero-positivity-is-highest-in-10-14-age-group/articleshow/83935232.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Habibganj station revamp work in fast lane, more trains to halt||BHOPAL: Newly built interior of Habibganj station has become centre of attraction for travellers in the state capital. Few people have suggested that the greenery should be also increased outside the station. The renovated Habibganj station is likely to witness average 35,000 to 40,000 passengers everyday. Around 85 pairs of trains will be given a stoppage. Before Covid, 54 pairs of trains operated here everyday and movement of about 25,000 people was being recorded. At present, 22 pairs of trains are operating from here. To implement the project, the railways awarded the prized contract to Bansal Group, which formed a new company in association with Prakash Asphalting and Toll Highways named Bansal Pathways Habibganj Private Ltd to work on the project. Project in-charge, Abu Asif, said, “We have completed our station work. The response of citizens is outstanding.” Habibganj is being developed as the first railway station in the country to provide world-class facilities to passengers through the public private-partnership (PPP) model under the station redevelopment programme of Indian Railways. The revamp work was launched in July 2016 at an estimated cost of Rs 450 crore. It took off in January 2017 with a deadline to complete it in three years. The project is divided into two parts: Rs 100 crore were earmarked for facelift of the station while the remaining Rs 350 crore was for commercial facilities. The deadline for construction of commercial facilities is 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/habibganj-stn-revamp-work-in-fast-lane-more-trains-to-halt/articleshow/83932996.cms||Ramendra Singh

BJP state president Satish Poonia’s statement that their legal team will evaluate the court order before making any statement was maintained by all leaders who came on record for the same. The party had made the suspension of Gurjar a state issue by holding demonstrations but protest was on a backfoot after a video of Gurjar’s controversial husband Rajaram Gurjar emerged in which he was seen negotiating for bribe with the BVG company official along with a senior RSS functionary. Also, the party didn’t receive any support from the common man. “The party’s stand that the ruling party acted in haste and violated the law by suspending the mayor without completing the inquiry fell in the court as the petition for the same was dismissed by it,” said a party source. Most city leaders including MLAs, who had opposed the nomination of Gurjar as the party candidate, feel that the matter should be considered over. “Defending the indefensible is not possible. The issue has dented the image of our party. In Jaipur, the party should not compromise with merit. We have raised our concern due to the past controversies of the Gurjar’s husband but was not heard by the party,” said the leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/lukewarm-response-by-bjp/articleshow/83935183.cms||---

The study conducted by Max healthcare shows that the mortality rate among the hospitalised patients in the second wave was about 40% higher than the first wave. During the second wave (January to mid-June 2021), the mortality ratio calculated for the 5,454 hospitalised patients works out at 10.5%, which was about 40% higher than 7.2% mortality rate among the 14,398 patients hospitalised during the pandemic’s first wave (April-December 2020). The study, published as a preprint in medical journal MedRxiv that is yet to be peer-reviewed, is based on Covid data collected from 10 hospitals run by Max Healthcare across north India, including six in Delhi-NCR. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director of Max Healthcare who led the study, told TOI that the sharpest increase in mortality was seen in younger patients — less than 45 years olds. “There was a three-fold increase in deaths due to Covid-19 among the younger patients (<45 years) who required hospitalisation: from 1.3% in the first wave to 4.1% in the second wave,” Dr Budhiraja said. He added: “The increasing trend in mortality was seen across the other age groups also. In the 45-59 year age group, mortality rose from 5 % in the first wave to 7.6% in the second wave. In the 60-74 year and above 75-year age groups, the increase was from 12% to 13.8%, and from 18.9% to 26.9%, respectively.” One of the possible factors for increased mortality in the second wave could be delay in finding a bed in hospitals. “The healthcare infrastructure was completely overwhelmed in the second wave. Many people couldn’t find a bed in time. This could have contributed to complications and even deaths,” Dr Budhiraja said. Oxygen requirement also went up during the second wave. In the first wave of the pandemic, about 63% of hospitalised Covid-19 patients required oxygen support. But, data shows, 74% meaning nearly three out of four hospitalised patients required oxygen support during the second wave. The predominance of the Delta strain of the Covid-19 virus, which is known to be highly transmissible and even lethal, during the second wave could also be the cause of increased mortality, doctors said. The strain, first identified in India, has now spread to many countries, including the US and the UK. Secondary infections, caused by bacteria and fungi, also increased significantly during the second wave and it caused deaths among many of the hospitalised patients. Public health experts say it is important to identify the gaps in Covid management policies and correct them. A study done by Indian Council of Medical Research has, meanwhile, found a substantial third wave could occur, while also illustrating that it is unlikely for any such resurgence to be as large as the second wave. “Preparedness planning for any potential future wave will benefit by drawing upon the projected numbers based on the present modelling exercise,” the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/loss-of-lives-was-40-higher-in-2nd-wave-those-below-45-yrs-worst-hit/articleshow/83935243.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Similarly, the patent application for the latter project was filed on October 1, 2020 and patent was granted on May 18, 2021.Patent officer and professor T Parimelazhagan said this is the first time that compounds with anti-diabetic properties are found in wild jamun fruit tree, scientifically known as Syzygium mundagam, in the Western Ghats.A professor in the department of botany, Parimelazhagan started to explore the scientific biological properties of the tree. The research in this field was carried out by research scholar Rahul Chandran, who is currently working as a research coordinator in Laser Research centre at the University of Johannesburg.Parimelazhagan said, “We have identified four compounds that are rich in anti-diabetic properties from the paste of the tree’s bark. We have standardized the process as well.”The statement said it could be a natural medication with less side effects for treating diabetic patients, cost effective and would benefit a lot of people. Farmers can also gain benefit by cultivating the plant based on the demand and therefore in turn can improve their socio- economic status.Another research was done by K Ramachandran, associate professor, department of physics, along with his research scholars R Saravanakumar and PV Anathapadmanabhan.The statement said their research involved reduction of metal oxides and recovery of metals from the heterogeneous waste of complex oxide mixture containing elements like aluminium, magnesium and iron. It is typical composition of the chromium bearing solid waste dumped in Ranipet district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bharathiar-universitys-two-projects-bag-patents/articleshow/83935174.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh zila panchayat polls full of corruption, BSP won’t contest: Mayawati||LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Monday clarified that her party is not contesting the zila panchayat chairperson elections due to “rampant corruption and misuse of government machinery in the elections”. She also warned people against taking her party lightly, saying that she had been in Lucknow since the end of the first Covid wave and had been working constantly to strengthen BSP and the movement. A day after she reiterated her party’s decision to contest UP elections alone, she announced that her party’s slogan for the 2022 Assembly polls, which she has asked her party cadre to focus on, will be “UP ko bachana hai, bachana hai. Sarvjan ko bachana hai, bachana hai. BSP ko satta mein lana hai, lana hai, va zaroor lana hai. (We have to save UP. We have to save the people. We have to bring BSP to power)”. Announcing the decision on not contesting zila panchayat chairperson elections, Mayawati said: “There is massive corruption and misuse of government machinery for these elections. BJP is now using the same mechanisms that Samajwadi Party had used earlier, because of which we had to part ways with the SP government in 1995. Unfortunately, BJP is using the same means now, which is weakening democracy.” A senior party member said the decision to explain this move was taken as BJP and SP were dominating headlines and it appeared that BSP was nowhere in the picture. “Behenji therefore outlined corruption in the elections for not contesting the elections and simultaneously cleared the air around BSP’s position. Just because we are not in the media everyday does not mean that we have given up the fight,” he said. Mayawati said she had told party workers to not waste their time and money on these elections but to strengthen the party instead. The former UP chief minister added that if panchayat polls had been fair and BSP had contested them, it would have won a significant number of seats. “When BSP was in power, it did not indulge in any misuse of power or corruption in any election. I have told party workers to focus on the assembly elections so that BSP can form government. When that happens, then most chairpersons will join BSP because they cannot function without the government,” she said. She also cautioned her party workers against conspiracies by other parties against BSP, saying that they were spreading misinformation to demoralise BSP workers. “Do not think we are any less than other parties. Since the end of the first wave, I have been in Lucknow tending to party matters. I don’t come in the media as often as other leaders do but we have been working quietly to strengthen our party,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zp-polls-full-of-corruption-bsp-wont-contest-maya/articleshow/83937469.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Officiating mayor Sheel Dhabai is likely to continue for some more time. Legal experts said fresh elections will have to be conducted among councillors to elect a new mayor. HC lawyer Vimal Chaudhary said, “Dhabai will be able to continue as an officiating mayor for a period of six months in accordance with the Rajasthan Municipality Act. After this period, elections will have to be held by the state government. However, a judicial inquiry has to be conducted within six months as per the orders of the high court.”Now, discussions are underway on whether BJP will agree to make Dhabai their mayoral candidate if elections are conducted despite her closeness to the Congress. A source in the BJP said, “She is inclined towards the ruling party as they appointed her, but making her the mayoral candidate may not happen. Dhabai is working in collaboration of the government to keep her chair secure but she doesn’t have the support of all the BJP councillors.” Names of other mayoral candidates have started floating in the corporation. Every MLA is trying to push for his or her own candidate to occupy the top post in the corporation. However, at the party level, no discussions regarding the names of the new candidate has been made.It is also not necessary that a Gurjar mayor will get selected if elections are held again. Due to seat reservation, the new mayor will be selected from the OBC, but the final picture will be clear in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dhabai-to-remain-acting-mayor-for-6-months-say-experts/articleshow/83935153.cms||---

Ayanki was summoned by customs who issued a notice under the Customs Act and he appeared before the agency office in Kochi along with his advocate on Monday morning. His arrest was recorded around 7.30 pm after a detailed statement collection. Mohammed Shafeeque, who was arrested with 2.3kg of gold (worth around Rs 1.11 crore) on Jun 21 at Karipur airport, is learnt to have given a statement to Customs, detailing Arjun’s involvement. Shafeeque was presented before the additional chief judicial magistrate (economic offences) in Kochi via video conferencing on Monday and was remanded in custody of customs for seven days. Sources said that Customs found WhatsApp audio clips between the accused and others on his phone. “It is learnt from the records that, detailed statement of the accused under Section 108 of Customs Act was recorded after seizure. The statement reveals the complicity of other culprits who engaged the accused for smuggling gold after offering Rs 40,000 and an air ticket. He specifically named one Saleem, Jaleel, Muhammed and Arjun. Further, the accused was instructed by Arjun how to behave when he arrived at the airport and to hand over smuggled gold to him after exiting the airport,” stated the order issued by the court granting custody. The order stated that as per the submission of customs prosecutor, the accused was one of the links of a smuggling gang operating from Dubai. “In the course of investigation, the mobile phone of the accused was seized and call data records were collected. Those records would reveal the close acquaintance of the accused with other culprits who deal with smuggled gold from the dispensing-end and receiving-end. Having regard to the nature of offence and complicity of other main culprits who perpetrated the smuggling, it is just and essential to keep the accused in custody and interrogate him with reference to CDR and complicity of accomplice,” the court order said. Shafeeque’s counsel submitted that the quantity of gold allegedly seized from the accused marginally exceeded Rs 1 crore. It was submitted that he had no criminal antecedents and an innocent carrier. The involvement of Arjun became sensational due to his alleged links with CPM members. DYFI Kannur district committee, on Saturday, dismissed its Chembilod area secretary C Sajesh after it emerged that he had reportedly given his car to Arjun on which he is suspected to have gone to the airport, expecting to meet the carrier. Soon, after Shafeeque was intercepted by customs, another gang which had assembled with the aim to rob the gold he brought met with an accident at Ramanattukara, in which five were killed. The accident reportedly happened when the gang was chasing a car due to a misunderstanding that the passenger they were waiting for went to Kannur in that car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gold-smuggling-customs-unit-arrests-arjun-ayanki/articleshow/83933054.cms||---

On the first day, all the shrines saw good footfall with devotees maintaining social distancing. Located in the centre of the city, around 4,000 people visited the Moti Doongri temple on Monday. Temple mahant Kailash Sharma said they had made circles on the ground to ensure social distancing and prasad and garland offerings were strictly banned. No prasad or flowers are allowed in any of the temples in the city as per the guidelines of the government. Around 1,500 people visited the Khole Ke Hanuman ji temple. To enter the shrine, devotees have to first wash their hands, followed by temperature screening and then sanitization. Temple authorities said the premise is so big maintaining social distancing is not a problem at all. In Govind Devji temple, around 1,500 devotees visited on the first day after it reopened. Mahant Manasji Goswami said, “We opened at our usual hour in the morning but due to curfew, we cannot keep it open in the evening. Moreover, on Ekadashi, Poonam and Amawas, lot of devotees visit the temple and taking it into account, we have deiced to keep the temple shut on these days. Religion is good but protection of the people is also important.” Galta Peeth, however, remained closed on Monday. Temple authorities said they were waiting for the inspection by the district administration. Swami Raghvendra said they will open the temple soon. “Unlike last time, we will open the temple in a few days. As per the instructions received from the administration, they will inspect the premises. After that we will open the temple.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/devotees-throng-temples-as-they-reopen-after-3-months/articleshow/83935186.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: One more route to see tigers in Sariska Tiger Reserve||JAIPUR: The forest administration at Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) has proposed to open an additional route for tourists to have better sighting of big cats. The decision was taken following demand of stakeholders as tourists visiting STR during this period in the past had negligible tiger sighting, unlike Ranthambore. As per the proposal, the route between Bara-Liwari, Shyodaanpura, Kabutar Khana and Pratap Bandh will be opened after receiving the approval. Along with this, the route between Kaali-Ghati and Pandupol and all zones of Balaquila will be remain open for safari. Field director of Sariska Tiger Reserve R N Meena said, “The proposal to open the additional route for tourists has been forwarded to chief wildlife warden for approval. The route map has been chalked in a manner that it would not disturb the habitat or wildlife during monsoon.” The stakeholders are elated with the move as there is a possibility of better sighting for tourists as two tigers are inhabitants of the area. “Earlier, wildlife tourists coming to Sariska for safari during this season was feeling duped as there was zero sighting. On the contrary, 6 to 10 zone are opened for tourists in Ranthambore, where sighting of big cats is good. We have requested the administration to atleast open one route where there is possibility for sightings,” said a nature guide who wished not to be named. Sariska will be closed this monsoon from July 1 to September 30. “The park will remain closed for three months. However, pilgrims visiting Pandupol temple will be allowed to enter inside the park on Tuesdays and Saturdays” added the official. In 2006, the NTCA had ordered ceasing jungle safaris in tiger reserves during monsoon for a minimum of three months, citing that it was the season for forests to rejuvenate and tigers to breed. However, according to sources, for the past few years reserves have been open for tourists as forest administration believes that tourism helps to monitor tigers and check illegal grazing, poaching and deforestation. Also people had faced a huge financial setback during pandemic as the park was already closed for two-and-a-half months. An official source said, “During the pandemic, livelihood of many locals was affected as parks were closed. If the forest department does not assist to gain momentum to bring tourists, people will take them as their enemy and not contribute in conservation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/one-more-route-to-see-tigers-in-sariska/articleshow/83935170.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Truckers in Rajasthan observe black day against rising diesel price||JAIPUR: State transporters observed Monday (June 28) as Black Day and wore black armbands as a mark of protest against rising diesel price. The association also handed over a written appeal to CM Ashok Gehlot and transport minister followed by a small agitation in Transport Nagar. The operators claimed that they will be forced to go on strike in the coming days if the issue of high fuel price was not resolved. In the letter addressed to the CM, the transporters said that they are facing losses of Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 on every vehicle and with the increasing diesel prices, they are finding it difficult to sustain their business. For the same, they have appealed that the government look into reducing the price. Anil Arora, president, Jaipur Transport Operators’ Association said, “Under normal circumstances, we would not have minded the diesel price as business was coming our way, but due to the pandemic, we have also been hit badly and while today we are only wearing black band on our arms, in the coming days we might have to go on strike. During the pandemic, we have worked 24/7 to ensure that supplies reach across the country, but high diesel price is breaking our back.” Keeping the Covid protocol in mind, the transport operators staged a peaceful protest with limited number of people in Jaipur. The fuel pump owners are already facing losses due to high VAT imposed on petrol and diesel in Rajasthan as compared to the neighbouring states. While there is 36% VAT on diesel, the same tax is 26% on petrol. Regarding this the transporters have been writing to the Centre as well as the state government repeatedly and claimed that although they do not want to protest, their appeals have been futile due to which they have to take this course of action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/transporters-observe-black-day-against-fuel-price/articleshow/83935228.cms||---

The FB post said that he can’t accept being tagged a traitor overnight and he will be forced to respond publicly, if those who spread lies against him don’t correct themselves. After TV channels flashed his comments as a challenge to the party, Thillankeri made a post on FB claiming that his statements were twisted by the media. “Statements from responsible persons that I befriended the accused in the murder of Comrade Kannipoyil Babu caused great agony to me. I responded to a comment saying that I will dismiss such allegations through a press-meet. This was twisted and flashed by the media saying that I challenged and threatened the party… I humbly request all media to not drag the party into my activities,” Thillankeri posted on his FB page. He made a FB post that he can’t cosy up to leaders of youth organizations who try to tag him as a party betrayer. “Anyone would react in this way when certain responsible persons in youth organizations insinuate through Facebook posts, that quotation was executed along with the murderers of comrade Babuvettan. Those close to me won’t believe it, but people would think it authentic when the person saying it is the DYFI district secretary…If they don’t make corrections even after pointing out such lies then I too have to respond publicly,” Akash had said. Meanwhile, CPM district secretary MV Jayarajan said that if anyone in the party is found to have connections with quotation gangs then action would be taken against them. He said that a family or an establishment can’t be blamed when an individual commits wrong. Responding to questions on the online group PJ Army changing their name to Red Army, MV Jayarajan added that it shows the righteousness of the party’s stand that no one should indulge in promoting personality cult. Meanwhile, CPI leader Binoy Vishwam told mediapersons that the controversy over the gold smuggling is a lesson to Left parties and reminded that quotation-people can infiltrate unless extra caution is maintained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thillankeri-dares-cpm-then-retracts/articleshow/83933100.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Shekhawat’s supporters staged a protest here on Monday against Joshi by putting up posters projecting Singh as an elephant while one of the three dogs on the left screaming ‘Should I send the ACB address?’. Joshi had recently tweeted the same statement in response to Shekhawat’s dig on him while the former was in Delhi. The other two dogs screaming ‘Shekhawat should give resignation’ and ‘voice sample’ again directed at Joshi who is repeatedly seeking Shekhawat’s resignation and voice sample over a controversial audio. The audio file leaked last year allegedly had Shekhawat talking to former deputy CM Sachin Pilot’s aide Bhanwar Lal Sharma to topple the government. However, Shekhawat has been denying the charges. Shekhawat on June 25 tweeted a photo of Joshi with Congress national in-charge with an address of Delhi Police Headquarters tasking him to visit as he is in Delhi. Joshi swiped back at him by asking him if he doesn’t know the address of Rajasthan ACB, he would send him.

The two waves also saw only 9% of hospitalized children suffering from a severe form of illness involving pneumonia and breathing issues, he said.“We want to create awareness among as many parents as possible on how they should handle Covid-19 in their children. We are creating brochures and posters,” Dr Rajendran said. “They should check saturation and if it falls below 90, child is sluggish and always sleeping, and starts having a bluish discolouration besides fever- they have to be rushed to the hospital as these are the danger signs,” he added.Tamil Nadu chapter of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics has formed a Covid task force. “We plan to coordinate with the state government to create a Covid-19 cell in each district to help parents and children with teleconsultation and necessary help like finding them beds, oxygen and doctors,” he said.“We are also working on creating a training module for medical and paramedicals on handling pediatric patients,” he added.

Issuing a government order, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi said that FPOs have the provision of getting working capital under the Centre’s directions. He said FPOs face financial crunch because of the shortage of share capital and less number of members. This results in problems pertaining to purchase of raw material and other requisite equipment. Chaturvedi said that at present, commercial, cooperative, schedule and regional banks are providing loans to FPOs at the rate of 9-11% to carry out commercial activities. The ACS said that now the state government has decided to facilitate FPOs with loans up to Rs 5 lakh at an interest rate of 4%. According to the government order, FPOs would be required to have a strength of at least 150 members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/state-govt-to-aid-fpos-to-get-loans-upto-rs-5l-from-banks/articleshow/83937499.cms||---
---||Mumbai||People will force Devendra Fadnavis to take ‘sanyas’: Congress||MUMBAI: A day after leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis threatened to quit politics over OBC reservation, state Congress president Nana Patole said there was no need for him to take the extreme step, as people of Maharashtra will force him to take ‘sanyas’. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut too urged the former CM not to take the extreme step as Maharashtra was in need of brilliant leaders like him. At a juncture when Maharashtra is lacking studious leaders like Fadnavis, he should not talk of taking sanyas, it will be an injustice on a progressive state like Maharashtra. “Fadnavis is a fighter, he should cooperate with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, all our efforts are being made to resolve the row over reservation for OBCs,’’ Raut said. Fadnavis had told a protest rally in Nagpur if voted back to power, he will ensure that OBCs get reservation in local bodies within four months or he will quit active politics. There was a sharp reaction on his threat from Congress and NCP. Patole said, Fadnavis, who was CM from 2014-19, was misleading people of Maharashtra over reservation for OBCs. “None other than Narendra Modi and Fadnavis took OBCs for a ride for obvious political reasons. Had NDA government submitted empirical data on OBC population before Supreme Court, the present situation could have been avoided. BJP ensured data was not submitted to the apex court,’’ Patole said. For BJP’s mistake, an estimated 55,000 OBCs could not secure representation municipal corporations, councils, zilla parishads, gram panchayats and panchayat samitis. “We will soon approach SC for justice to OBC community. Pending our appeal, we urge SEC to postpone elections to five ZPs,’’ Patole said. At the cabinet meeting, it was decided that chief secretary Sitaram Kunte will write to state election commissioner U P S Madan to postpone elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/people-will-force-fadnavis-to-take-sanyas-in-mumbai-cong/articleshow/83937506.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Large number of devotees came to offer prayers in both the dargah and the temple. The Anjuman committee has requested the state government to grant permission to offer chaddar and flowers in the dargah. Anjuman secretary Sayeed Wahid Hussein said permission to resume offerings will help a lot of people to get employment. Soon after opening, administration and police officials inspected the shrines to verify if Covid guidelines were being followed. The administration has asked devotees to strictly follow Covid guidelines before entering the temple and the dargah. With the reopening of the shrines, markets in Pushkar also opened with traders hoping to start over again. Resort owners said there tourists have started enquiring about rooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/strict-covid-rules-in-ajmer-shrines/articleshow/83935236.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The chief minister told reporters that the Covid situation is “coming under control” in the state, and that the positivity rate is decreasing and the recovery rate is increasing. “Our current positivity rate is 6%, and over the next four days, it will drop below 5%,” he said. Sawant also said that going by the speed of vaccination, the state government would meet its target of administering the first dose of the vaccine to the eligible population by the end of July. On Sunday, TOI reported that Sawant said the government would request the high court to allow fully-vaccinated people to enter the state without having to produce a Covid-negative certificate. On Monday, he said that this arrangement would not be for tourists, but for persons entering the state for business or other purposes. He also said that if a person is fully vaccinated, they would not be required to undergo a rapid antigen or RT-PCR test before entering. When asked about the fact that there is no testing facility at railway stations, he said the government has asked private labs to start testing. From Saturday, the government has started conducting rapid antigen tests at border checkposts. Sawant had said that anyone entering the state, whether migrant labourer or tourist, would be tested for Covid-19 at the borders to keep a check on the Delta+ variant. If the person tests positive at the border checkpost, they would be isolated or admitted to hospital, and if the report is negative, they will be allowed to enter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-positivity-rate-will-drop-below-5-in-4-days-says-cm/articleshow/83937528.cms||---

While giant idols made up of paper mesh and plaster of Paris are being widely used, half a dozen idol makers from the village are still making the idols in the traditional way. Usually, they start making idols by this time every year. With the fear of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infection looming, the idol makers are in wait and watch mode. More than 120 giant idols made in the village would be used for festivals in districts such as Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Virudhunagar, Madurai and Dindigul. P Vijayakumar, a 3rd generation idol maker, said that they are yet to collect the raw materials required for the idols. They use dry elephant dung, clay and soil from streams. Elephant dung is used to bring down the weight of the idols as the ones made up of only clay will weigh more. “The state government has not given its nod for conducting temple festivals so far. There is also talks about a possible third Covid-19 wave. We have not started making idols so far as we do not know what is coming. Unlike paper mesh idols, the clay idols cannot be stored for long. So, we do not want to take any chances,” he said. If they did not start at least a week or two from now, they may not take up work at all for this year, he said. A few families in the village invested a lot in paper mesh idols last year but could not sell them due to the pandemic. They too are concerned as they might not be able to sell them this year as well. Meanwhile, around 90 families in the village, who are into making small idols measuring up to two feet, are busy making idols. However, they too are not sure about the sales this year. “We are making Vinayaka idols and Christmas dolls. We are planning to make only 80% of what we make in a normal year. We expect less sales for Vinayaka Chaturthi as well as Christmas,” S Malarkodi, a doll maker, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vilacheri-artisans-yet-to-start-work-on-vinayaka-idols-over-fear-of-third-wave/articleshow/83935292.cms||V Devanathan

The link roads are expected to make life easy for thousands of commuters, who struggle to navigate their way out of busy JNTU to Hi-Tec City Road and also improve connectivity from Miyapur, Sardar Patel Nagar, Vasanth Nagar and KPHB phase 6 to Hi-Tec City Road and Hafeezpet Road. Inaugurating the link roads, municipal administration and urban development (MAUD) minister KT Rama Rao said so far 16 link roads have been opened in the city and six more would be developed soon. “Roads play a vital role in the city’s development. These roads will decrease traffic congestion in the city,” he said, adding that 133 link roads were being developed in a phased manner. The link road from Nizampet Crossroads to Hitex junction has come up at a cost of Rs 7.41 crore. The road starts from Nizampet X road traverses via Vasanth Nagar, Mahindra Ashvita, a housing society, and NAC compound to Kondapur Golf Court.

There is no scanner to know the products which are being accepted at the parcel counter. As of now only passenger entry points have baggage scanners in Secunderabad. Until the blast took place at Darbhanga railway station on June 17, none in the railways knew that an explosive parcel was accepted and later transported to Darbhanga. At the Secunderabad station, there is no facility to know what is being accepted at the parcel office. When contacted, South Central Railway (SCR) officials admitted that there is no scanner at the parcel office, but clarified that there are four CCTVs at the office and all are in working condition. “It is incorrect that we got the proposal two years ago. It was received recently and it is under consideration. The reassessment will be done and then the CCTVs will be added. The proposal was sent for less than 100 CCTVs,’’ concerned SCR officials said. On June 15, two persons came to Secunderabad Railway station in a taxi and went to parcel office and booked a consignment as garments. The persons who booked the parcels allegedly used fake IDs. Inside the garments, a bottle filled with liquid explosives was arranged and this went unnoticed by the parcel office officials and it reached Bihar and when it was unloaded at Darbhanga railway station, it exploded. Two brothers from Mehdipatnam under Asif Nagar police station limits were already taken into custody by the counter intelligence sleuths of Telangana police based on the CCTV footage and questioning is being done. It is learnt that a NIA team from Delhi is also in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/darbhanga-blast-exposes-loopholes/articleshow/83935311.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Dehradun||Techie, 25, ‘murdered’ by live-in partner, body burnt in Mussoorie forest||DEHRADUN: A 25-year-old woman from West Bengal working in a Dehradun-based IT firm was allegedly murdered by her live-in partner who burnt her body in a forest near Mussoorie. The victim’s remains were recovered from a spot on the Mussoorie-Kimadi Road on Sunday by a police team and a dog squad after a six-hour search. The accused, Ankit Chaudhary, who hails from UP’s Saharanpur and runs a construction business in Dehradun, has been arrested and booked for murder. Chaudhary, 31, claimed that the woman fell from the third floor of their rented accommodation in Rajpur Road on April 28 and died following which he panicked and performed her “last rites” in a forest. Meanwhile, Nivedita’s family said they are hopeful they will get justice. “No one has the heart to tell the mother that her only daughter is no more,” said Antara.The matter came to light earlier this week when a family from Burdwan approached Dehradun police and alleged that their daughter, Nivedita Mukherjee, had been murdered by her live-in partner. Mukherjee had met Chaudhary last year in October through a common friend and had told her family that she was moving in with him on April 25. Three days later, she stopped answering her phone. Nivedita's family managed to trace her partner on social media and contacted him. Chaudhary told them that the victim had left home after a fight but would be back soon. After that, he used the victim’s social media account to impersonate her and send messages to her cousin, Antara. “I last heard from Nivedita in April when she told us that she was moving in with her boyfriend. When we spoke to Ankit, he told us that he was also trying to find my sister while sending us messages from her social media account posing as her. It was only after Nivedita kept dodging our calls that we got suspicious. When we confronted Ankit, he told us that she had fallen from the balcony and died,” Antara told TOI. After the family’s complaint, police filed an FIR and interrogated Chaudhary. He broke down and took police to the spot where he had burnt the victim’s body. He had driven 15 km with the body in his car and used petrol to light it. “We have booked him for murder because there are several issues that remain unanswered. The accused said the woman fell from the balcony at midnight. Why didn’t he call an ambulance? The balcony has a four-foot grill. It seems unlikely that someone would topple from there,” said an officer involved in the investigation, adding that they were still trying to ascertain the motive behind the crime. Forensic experts have confirmed that the remains belong to a female and are examining them. “We found bones, including skull, a hand and a leg. They had been dispersed throughout the area,” said Rajesh Shah, station officer, Rajpur. Meanwhile, Nivedita’s family said they are hopeful they will get justice. “No one has the heart to tell the mother that her only daughter is no more,” said Antara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/techie-25-murdered-by-live-in-partner-body-burnt-in-mussoorie-forest/articleshow/83930023.cms||Sukanta Mukherjee
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Where’s the shield against third wave, ask citizens||AHMEDABAD: At the Behrampura urban health centre (UHC) on Monday, citizens in the long queue outside were told at noon that they had no more vaccines to administer. The vaccination drive began at 9am and covered just 120 beneficiaries. “It was déjà vu on Saturday, as people like me were sent back for the same reason. I have no other option but to come back tomorrow,” said Pali Chunara, a local resident. “After all, it’s the only cover we have against a third wave of Covid-19 cases. I know that there’s no guarantee that I will be inoculated tomorrow.” This was the third consecutive day that several Covid vaccination centres across Ahmedabad recorded depleted stocks and irate citizens who could not get their jab. With the state government’s directives for workers at commercial establishments to be vaccinated before the end of the month, a large number of those queuing up were from the working population. The majority of vaccination centres have adopted a token system where citizens have to come early, between 8am and 9am and get their tokens for vaccination. For many, it means two trips to the centre. Moreover, with one person given just one token and only one person allowed per token, it’s not an option for families to send one member to carry out the formality, many citizens said. At Ranip and Tagore Hall, the authorities put up signs informing citizens that the shots were not available. At several AMC-run centres, the authorities told citizens that there was a limited stock of Covishield available, and they would be able to resume vaccination once adequate stock was received. “We have only 100 doses of Covishield today. If people want a token, they have to come early. After 1pm, we will close the centre,” said a health department official at the UHC in Ambawadi.  “We tell people to come at noon as new vials may arrive but there are no guarantees for that as well”. At several centres, medical and support staff bore the brunt of citizens’ ire. They tried to placate them, explaining that the number of beneficiaries have increased but vial supply is yet to increase proportionately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wheres-the-shield-against-third-wave-ask-citizens/articleshow/83935444.cms||---

The 46th Battalion of BSF under the directions of Rajasthan Frontier IG Pankaj Goomar organised a free vaccination camp for villagers of Kishangarh near the border. The BSF also organised camps at other places where food and essential items were distributed among Covid-affected border population. On this occasion DIG Jaisalmer (north) Arun Kumar Singh inspired people to participate in vaccination drive and expressed gratitude to district collector Ashish Modi, CMHO Dr Kamlesh Choudhary and district administration for the help extended to BSF.A large number of villagers were vaccinated.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai records new high of 1.8 lakh vaccinations in a day||MUMBAI: A record number of 1,80,821 people took the vaccine in the city on Monday, topping its previous single-day high of 1.54 lakh vaccinations that was registered on Saturday. However, several Mumbaikars also complained of being turned away from vaccination centres for not having an online appointment or registration on CoWin. Kalyan-Dombivli will not hold drives on Tuesday due to unavailability of doses.  Fifty percent vaccinations are supposed to be through walk-ins and 50% through online appointments, yet residents from different parts of the city said they couldn’t get vaccinated through on-spot registrations. A woman in her 30s said she was denied vaccination and asked to come back later with a registration when she reached her closest vaccination centre in Prabhadevi on Monday. Similarly,a 45-year-old housekeeper was turned away from Jagjivan Ram Hospital in Mumbai Central as she didn’t have a registration. Similar instances came to light from Mahim, Ghatkopar and the western suburbs.  Civic officials blamed it on limited doses allocated to centres that further get distributed between multiple categories. The main problem started with only 200-300 doses being allocated to each centre, they said. “If we get 200 doses, for instance, 50% has to be earmarked for the 18-44 age-group and another 50% for people above 45 years. Within these groups, 50% have to be given to online appointment holders and the remaining to those walking in. Doses are further broken down to those coming for their first and second shots,” said the assistant municipal commissioner of a ward. He added the doses earmarked for walk-ins ultimately drop to 25-30 in most centres.  Another ward official said walk-in slots get exhausted within the first hour of vaccination on most days. “So people who come to these centres even post 11 pm have to be sent away,” he said. “The problem here is availability of doses. If we have steady supply coming every day, we can vaccinate more,” he added.  Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said they would check why people were turned away. “Walk-ins meant people can come without an appointment and take the vaccine. But people should preferably register themselves on CoWin before coming to the centres,” she said. But registration on CoWin has remained one of the biggest roadblocks for people from lower socio-economic pockets or those without education or access to smartphones with internet. With 1.80 lakh vaccinations, the city has completed administering 52.74 lakh doses since January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-records-new-high-of-1-8l-vaccinations-in-a-day/articleshow/83935301.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: No discussion on seat-sharing so far with AIMIM, says Om Prakash Rajbhar||LUCKNOW: Former BJP ally, Suhaildev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar on Monday dismissed All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi's claim for contesting 100 seats in the next year UP assembly elections. Owaisi had claimed that his party would contest these seats while being part of the `Bhagidari Morcha' formed by Rajbhar. The SBSP chief's pointed rebuke to Owaisi's claim came a day after AIMIM boss categorically said that his party "would contest" 100 UP assembly seats and the process for selection of candidates has begun. Owaisi statement came hours after BSP chief Mayawati sent out a strong rebuttal vis-a-vis speculations about her party planning a tie-up with the Hyderabad based political outfit to take on her political rivals. “No talks of seat-sharing with the AIMIM ever happened,” Rajbhar said, maintaining that members of `Bhagidari Morcha' would hold discussion over it in the days to come after assessing their preparedness to take on the BJP in the UP assembly polls. Rajbhar said that the AIMIM leadership had only expressed its willingness to contest on 100 seats but no seat-sharing formula ever got firmed up. Rajbhar’s stance, political analysts said, was a reflection of a palpable attrition between members of the 'Bhagidari Morcha' aspiring for a bigger pie in the seat-sharing arrangement. The SBSP chief said that the morcha formed under his leadership would contest all 403 assembly seats in next year's state polls. "But for that, the partners need to spruce up their organisational ranks for the high stake political contest," he said. The AIMIM, which contested 38 seats in 2017 assembly elections, could not win a single seat and managed to corner only 0.2% vote share. The SBSP, on the other hand, had allied with the BJP to contest on only eight seats. The Rajbhar dominated political outfit won four seats while bagging a vote share of 0.7%, which was significantly higher in comparison to AIMIM. Rajbhar has been reaching out to various political opponents of the BJP, including AIMIM and Krishna Patel-led Apna Dal, to shape up a political front which could potentially block the saffron party's prospects of returning to office after 2022 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-discussion-on-seat-sharing-so-far-with-aimim-says-rajbhar/articleshow/83937522.cms||Pankaj Shah

With many IAS officers of the state put on central deputation, the strength of the cadre is hard-pressed and insufficient in numbers to deal with pandemic like and emergency situations.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court stays Char Dham yatra, asks for rituals to be livestreamed||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court on Monday stayed the state cabinet decision to allow local residents to visit Char Dham shrines, concluding that amid the threat of a third wave and the new Delta-plus variant of the coronavirus, opening the yatra would be akin to “inviting a calamity”. The court directed the state to livestream all rituals and prayers offered in the sanctum sanctorum of the four revered shrines for devotees across the country. The state has been given a week to comply with the order. State government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said that they are likely to challenge the stay in the apex court. “We had done every preparation and limited the number of pilgrims to 750 per day. A senior official was posted at each of the shrines. We might approach the Supreme Court,” he said. Earlier, the state cabinet had allowed residents in Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts to visit the shrines in their respective districts when the yatra starts on July 1. While Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines are in Uttarkashi district, the Kedarnath shrine is in Rudraprayag district and Badrinath shrine is in Chamoli district. On Monday, the court said that it was ordering a four-week stay on the yatra as the cabinet’s decision was not only “arbitrary and unreasonable” but also violated Article 14 (equality), Article 21 (right to life) and several other provisions of the constitution. The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma cited repeated flouting of standard operating procedures (SOPs), the emergence of Delta-plus variant as well as the predicted adverse impact of the third wave of the pandemic on children. The bench said that the administration had failed to implement SOPs during the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, Ganga Dussehra and opening of Kainchi Dham shrine in Nainital. “The cabinet should have realised that SOPs are flouted by people and the civil administration does not have the wherewithal for implementing them in the strict sense,” the court said, adding, “In case the Delta-plus variant is allowed to play havoc with the lives of our children, the nation is bound to lose a part of its next generation. Such an apocalypse would adversely affect the growth and progress of the entire country. Hence, the Char Dham yatra will invariably cause irreparable losses to the people and to the country.” The bench said that it was aware of the “high religiosity” of people and directed the administration to ensure that ceremonies in the sanctum sanctorum of the Char Dham temples are livestreamed throughout the country. The court rejected the argument of advocate general SN Babulkar that live-streaming might be “prohibited by the shastras”. The bench said that since our ancestors were not even aware of development of a technology which would allow live-streaming, the possibility of shastras "prohibiting livestreaming of a religious ceremony is absolutely impossible”. After the court was informed by chief secretary Om Prakash that some priests may be against livestreaming of rituals, the court said that it is solely the state’s decision which cannot be left to the Char Dham Devasthanam Board or the priests since “it is the constitutional duty of the state to protect the lives of people during a pandemic”. The stay from court came even though the cabinet’s decision was not under challenge in any Covid-related plea. The court said that “echnicalities of law cannot come in the way of protection of people”. It added that PILs pending before the court already deal with the Covid situation in the state and while hearing these petitions there has been a continuous supervision over the “acts and omissions” of the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-stays-char-dham-yatra-asks-for-rituals-to-be-livestreamed/articleshow/83930095.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ahmedabad||Bonded doctors’ wait for HC aid gets longer||Ahmedabad: Facing registration of FIRs for not joining Covid-19 duty during the surge in cases, bonded doctors will have to wait a little longer for protection from the Gujarat high court as it did not entertain their request on Monday for a stay on the order. Justice N V Anjaria sent the petition filed by 251 specialist doctors to the registry to decide on whether it should be heard by a single-judge bench or a division bench. This is because a division bench had in the past issued notice in a case related to the government insisting on bonded doctors to join Covid-19 duty. As the court sent the case back to the registry to place it before appropriate bench and it is not in seized with the matter, the judge was of the opinion that it would not be a question of staying the authorities from registering FIRs against the petitioners. On June 20, the state health commissioner ordered all chief district health officers and medical officers in the municipal corporations to file FIRs in one day against 799 doctors. These medicos had who failed to join Covid duty after the state government issued orders for 1,415 bonded doctors to report on Covid duty. The state government said that since they had executed bonds to serve in rural areas for certain period and since they were beneficiaries of subsidized education in government medical colleges, to serve the society and the state is their moral and legal duty. However, on June 21, the state government itself decided to withhold filing of FIRs till June 28. As it was the final day, senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, who appeared for the bonded doctors, requested the high court to stay the state government from extending its decision on filing of FIRs under section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act. These doctors have been seeking quashing of the government’s decision to call them on Covid duty, to register FIR for their failure and also the government’s decision of not accepting the amount in lieu of the bond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bonded-doctors-wait-for-hc-aid-gets-longer/articleshow/83935437.cms||---

Association president S P Jeyapragasam said that businesses, trade and industries involving agricultural produce and food items are immensely affected due to the increase in fuel prices. “The general public is forced to spend more money on food and daily essential commodities,” he said. Jeyapragasam said that 80% of the agricultural produce and items needed for the state is brought from North India mainly on roads by lorries. The diesel price hike has impacted freight cost and burdened buyers to spend more on essential food items despite the economic slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Transporting a quintal (100kg) of Bengal Gram (kadalai paruppu) from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi to Tamil Nadu that cost Rs 300 about six months ago climbed to Rs 380 a couple of months ago. “Truckers maintained the cost for about a month and have now raised it to Rs 450, which is 50% more than the cost six months ago,” he said. According to the traders’ body, diesel price hike has given transporters an excuse to increase the transportation cost and it is passed down to consumers at all stages till the grocery store. “Due to the pandemic, all the business and industrial activities are stagnant in our country. We request both the central and state governments to look into the fuel price hike immediately and take necessary action to bring down the fuel price,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/grain-merchants-urge-modi-stalin-to-reduce-fuel-prices/articleshow/83935316.cms||---

---||Jaipur||HC notice over relief to non-accredited scribes||Jodhpur: The high court on Monday issued notices to the state government over a petition pertaining to compensation to non-accredited journalists on the lines of accredited scribes. The petition wants the government to consider them for a compensation of Rs 50 lakh in case of death from corona infection. Petitioner Chandra Shekhar Vyas, in his petition, prayed to the court that all the mediapersons and journalists be deemed as frontline warriors for Covid-19 and an entitlement for the equal compensation to them, irrespective of whether they were accredited or non-accredited. His counsel Rajvendra Saraswat argued in the court that all the journalists discharged their duties during the pandemic as frontline warriors spreading awareness among the people and covering news related to various aspects of coronavirus infection and lockdown without even caring for the threat of being infected. “Consequent to this service to their profession, many journalists and mediapersons as well as their family members got infected and lost their lives,” he said. He said that the Centre has considered both accredited and non-accredited journalists at par in its decision to grant a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to those who lost their lives to Covid. “On the similar line, the state government has announced an ex-gratia financial aid of Rs 50 lakh, but only for accredited journalists,” he said. Vyas in his petition, while terming this decision of state government as an injustice to non-accredited journalists who actively covered the Covid phenomena through the lockdown without caring about the risks involved, had demanded that like Centre, the state government must not distinguish between the two categories and immediately announce an ex-gratia financial aid of Rs 50 lakh for the deceased in a gesture of justice to their families. Allowing the petition, the division bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Vineet Kumar Mathur issued notices to the chief secretary, secretary (finance) and secretary (DIPR).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-notice-over-relief-to-non-accredited-scribes/articleshow/83935372.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||University of Hyderabad joins hands with two institutes to promote millets||HYDERABAD: In an effort to bring millets as staple to dining tables, the University of Hyderabad (UoH) has joined hands with two institutions to improve the nutritional value of minor millets. The UoH has tied up with Institute of Life Sciences (ILS), Bhubaneswar, and National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR), Delhi, to not only improvise the nutritional value of millets and cereals, but also to identify genes that could boost the cultivation of nutritional crops. “Currently, the entire country is only depended on three species — rice, wheat and maize. These crops contribute to more than 70% of the world’s food and cannot be afforded by all. Our effort is to bring millets to the mainstream so that it can be accessible to all,” said M Muthamilarasan of department of plant sciences, School of Life Sciences, UoH, adding that unlike the staple cereals, the indigenous species were nutrient-rich, climate-resilient and disease resistant, which favors their cultivation in India. As part of this collaboration, the researchers have proposed two primary approaches. First, broadening the food base to integrate several other species that could cater to the food and nutritional needs of the ever-growing population. Second, deploy the available biotechnological tools to identify the genomic regions underlying micronutrient biosynthesis and accumulation in the grains of cereals and millets. As 2023 would be observed as the International Year of Millets, the collaborative effort of UoH, ILS, and NIPGR would try to deliver nutrient-rich millets to ensure multiple securities, thereby getting a step closer to achieve UN’s sustainable development goals-2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uoh-joins-hands-with-two-institutes-to-promote-millets/articleshow/83935363.cms||---

Thackeray also said that even though the state has created a record of vaccinating 7 lakh people in a day, it can vaccinate 15 lakh people a day. “The second wave has declined and stagnated, it has not completely receded. We don’t know when the third wave will hit us, but seeing increasing crowds there is danger that the second wave will surge again,” Thackeray said at the virtual inauguration of a 2,170-bed dedicated Covid centre in Malad and Kalanagar flyover constructed by MMRDA. He said jumbo centres will look like circus tents from outside, but inside they are super-specialty hospitals with best set-ups. “Even though these are temporary hospitals, they are completely equipped for providing specialised care. Beds have been set aside for children too. Health of citizens is a priority for the government and there will be no compromise on that,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/second-wave-may-resurge-can-give-jab-to-15l/day-maharashtra-cm/articleshow/83935346.cms||---

We said on several occasions that ISIS recruitment is strong in Kerala and its sleeper cells are working in the state,” Surendran told reporters. “Kerala government submitted an affidavit in the court, denying the existence of ‘love jihad’ in the state,” he said, while congratulating Behera for speaking the truth at the fag-end of his career. Surendran alleged that there was something unusual behind the rush of a large number of applications from Afghanistan and Iraq for admission to various courses at Kerala University. The concerns, he said, were raised as the applications have come from countries where ISIS has a presence. “Pinarayi government has taken back to service a police personnel who was accused of leaking email details to terrorists. When the terror links of a deputy SP in Kollam came to the fore, the state government transferred him to Kottayam though ideally he should have been removed from the service,” alleged Surendran. He alleged that quotation gangs remain at large because of their links with CPM. “Akash Thillankeri was a staff at AKG Centre from 2014 to 2017. He was behind the murder of Shuhaib and Thillankeri Vinesh,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/clear-air-on-is-presence-in-kerala-bjp-tells-cm/articleshow/83933146.cms||---

BJP leader and former MLA Praveen Darekar, who was bank’s chairman, is among those named in the FIR filed in 2015. The Esplanade Court recently rejected a ‘C summary’ report filed by the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police in 2019. A ‘C Summary’ report is filed by the police to state that a person had been booked by mistake in a case or that an erroneous complaint was made. The court has now directed the investigating officer to further probe the case and submit a report. Darekar did not respond to calls made and text messages sent by TOI. A senior EOW officer on Monday confirmed having received the court order. “We will follow the [court’s] instructions,” the officer said. There were allegations of irregularities in case of tenements taken on rent for bank branches and in purchase of land, distribution of loan to credit societies, purchase of computers and software assembling among others. Advocate Vivekanand Gupta, a BJP secretary from Mumbai unit, had in 2015 filed an FIR of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy against the president and directors of the bank at MRA Marg police station. The EOW filed a C Summary report in the Esplanade court, contending that all allegations were civil in nature and there was no cognisable offence established against the accused. After receiving the summary report, the court issued notice to the complainant. “He orally submitted that he has no objection to grant C summary,” the court order read. Later, one Pankaj Kotecha appeared and filed an application against the C Summary. The court order stated, “...It is a public fund.

Among mofussil routes, buses which operated to Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Dindigul and Virudhunagar saw good patronage while those on routes including Tuticorin, Trichy and Tirunelveli saw fewer passengers. Only a few opted to travel to long destinations like Chennai during the day. While only those who were wearing masks were allowed to board buses, many passengers were disappointed that the bus crew did not check their temperature. “When services resumed last time, temperature was checked and hand sanitizer provided but this time it was missing. Some buses could also be seen with almost 100% seats occupied,” said G Ezhilarasi, a passenger from Thiruvathavur. The late night announcement by the state government allowing textile and jewellery stores brought cheers to the store owners. However, only a few people could be seen in these stores. Ashraf Tayub, secretary of Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association, said, “It took half the day to clean out the stores. Not many turned up on day one since it is month-end. Moreover, the muhurtham season has also ended.” Mobile phone service centres saw brisk business and Meenakshi Bazaar on North Veli Street was busy all day. Meanwhile, residents have urged the district administration to allow functioning of farmers’ markets. At present, traders are selling vegetables on roadsides outside the market.

He was speaking to reporters after holding a review meeting on airport development along with commercial taxes minister P Moorthy at the district collectorate on Monday. The meeting was also attended by collector Aneesh Sekhar, corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan and airport director S Senthil Valavan. The minister said the state government will take up the construction of the underpass as a national highway is passing through the proposed runway expansion site. The fund required for the project will be spent by the government. “We recently took the pending development works at Madurai airport to the chief minister. He has given his assent. The land acquisition work was pending for the last seven to eight years. It did not gain momentum even after the 2016 elections,” he said.Thiagarajan said that runway expansion will help Madurai airport handle bigger aircraft. As the developmental work progresses, they will take measures to get international status for the airport, which is a long-pending demand.The minister said there are talks that Indian airlines will not be able to compete with foreign carriers which will get the opportunity to operate from airports like Madurai once they are given international status. However, he said he was not sure whether that was the reason why international status is evading Madurai airport. It had handled repatriation flights from various countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. This suggests that the airport has potential to develop into a bigger centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-airport-land-acquisition-to-be-over-in-2-weeks-ptr/articleshow/83935367.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Three more involved in illegal conversion racket arrested||LUCKNOW: The Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) of the Uttar Pradesh police on Monday arrested three more persons in connection with the alleged illegal conversions of at least 1,000 poor people to Islam. The ATS is also looking into the funding of Rs 50 lakh from Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. The arrested men were identified as Irfan Sheikh, who hails from Maharashtra, Rahul Bhola of Delhi and Mannu Yadav of Gurgaon in Haryana. Earlier on June 21, ATS had arrested two persons, Umar Gautam and Mufti Kazi Jahangeer Qasmi, in connection with alleged illegal conversions. ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar told TOI, “Irfan works as an interpreter in Indian Sign Language Research and Training Centre (ISLRTC), in Delhi. It is a government training centre which comes under Union ministry of social justice.” “Irfan used to brainwash such children and got them converted to Islam at Islamic Dawah Centre (IDC), in Jamia Nagar of Delhi. IDC was run by Mufti Kazi Jahangeer Qasmi, who is now in ATS custody. Rahul and Mannu are also visually and hearing-impaired who roped in other specially abled children to convert to Islam through Irfan,” said Kumar. He said the ATS was conducting searches in Aligarh, Varanasi, Azamgarh, Noida, Agra, Ghaziabad and Kanpur while police chiefs of 27 other districts have also been asked to carry out investigations in their respective districts. Inspector general of police, ATS, GK Goswamy, who is heading the probe, said violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) was detected during transactions made in the bank account of Fatima Charitable Trust. “No income tax returns were filed by the Trust. From January 2010 to June 14, 2020, IDC received Rs 1.74 crore through cash and cheques from foreign countries, most of which were found to be hawala transactions,” said Goswamy. He added that Rs 50 lakh received by the trust from Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh is under scanner. “Run by Umar Gautam and Jahangeer Qasmi, IDC is the official examination centre of Doha-based Islamic Online University, owned by Bilal Philip, who was arrested in 2014 in the Philippines for inciting hatred,” the IG said. Goswamy added that Umar Gautam worked with an NGO, Markazul Ma’arif, in Assam from 2002 to 2010. “In 2020, cases related to FEMA and terror activities were lodged against this NGO in Dispur and Hojai districts of Assam. Umar Gautam has received payments from the accounts of this NGO,” he said. The IG said an FIR was also lodged in Khakhreru police station of Fatehpur against a person, Vijay Sonkar, on charges of religious conversion. “Vijay worked as a driver and converted into Islam. He allegedly forced minors to convert. Vijay has been arrested by Fatehpur police and ATS would be questioning him,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3-more-involved-in-illegal-conversion-racket-arrested/articleshow/83937552.cms||---

The number of fatalities too dropped to 101—the lowest in a week—while 1.6 lakh tests were carried out as against the average of 2.3 lakh. Maharashtra’s total cases rose to 60.4 lakh and total fatalities to 1,21,573. As many as 186 unreported deaths were added to the cumulative toll on Monday. Cases in Mumbai too dropped to 611 as against 739 on Sunday. However, deaths in the same period rose from 13 to 18. While the number of critical cases co-ntinued to drop to 804 as against 2,000 until 45 days back, doctors said the number of panic calls about fever and cough had increased a bit perhaps due to the detection of the new variant. On Monday, the Malad field hospital was handed over to BMC, while work on the other jumbo centres is still on. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC will continue to focus on building capacity in preparation for the third wave. “The paediatric sero survey released on Monday showed half the children in Mumbai are already exposed to the virus. It is good that children will not be greatly impacted in the third wave and the city may not need to increase the number of beds, but as we saw during the second wave, people from neighbouring areas seek treatment here,” he said, adding that only 30% of the patients admitted with mucormycosis in BMC hospitals are from Mumbai; the rest are from outside the city. Maharashtra’s recovery rate stood at 96% on Monday as 10,812 people were discharged, taking the total discharges to 58 lakh. The number of active cases dropped to 1.17 lakh, including 15,414 in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-witnesses-33-drop-in-cases-with-fewer-tests-over-the-weekend/articleshow/83935395.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Magisterial inquiry term extended||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Government has extended the time allowed for completion of the magisterial inquiry into the killing of Maoists in Wayanad in November last year. Based on the request of Wayanad district collector, the government decided to extend the period by six months till Aug 10, though the enquiry was supposed to be completed by Feb 10. The incident, in which Velmurugan, a member of Kabini Dalam of Maoists was killed, had created an uproar with a section of the civil society alleging that he was killed in a fake encounter. Wayanad collector had requested the government that since a special team had to be formed for enquiry and all officials were engaged in Covid-19 related duties and assembly elections, the enquiry could not be completed within the stipulated time. In the previous instance too, the government had thrice extended the period of magisterial inquiry for the encounter that happened on Oct 28 and 29, 2019 in which four Maoists – Manivasagam, Karthik, Suresh and Srimathi – were gunned down. While on 28 one Maoist was killed, the remaining three were killed on the second day when there was an exchange of fire between the Thunderbolt team and the Maoists. Two cases were registered in this regard. The police had seized seven guns, including one AK-47, two shotguns, two 303 rifles and two country-made guns from the Maoists after the Manjikkandy encounter, the biggest of the four encounters in state since 2016. According to the police, the cadres – trained in using sophisticated and automatic weapons – were operating as four Dalams since 2013 along the state border of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Under Western Ghats Special Zone Committee, four dalams are operating in state, namely Nadukani, Bhavani, Siruvani and Kabini. As many as eight Maoists have been killed in encounters with the police in Kerala since 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/magisterial-inquiry-term-extended/articleshow/83933185.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat in web of spider discoveries||AHMEDABAD: A team of researchers from Gujarat has discovered a species never documented before in India — jumping spiders. The team from Gujarat Ecological Education and Research (GEER) Foundation has found several male jumping spiders in Kalyan, near Mumbai. The researchers named the species Icius tukarami to honour Tukaram Omble, an assistant sub-inspector of Mumbai Police, who took 23 bullets while capturing the Pakistani terrorist, Ajmal Kasab, during the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Omble was awarded the Ashoka Chakra posthumously. Dhruv Prajapati of GEER, who studies spiders, said the name was chosen as a tribute to the fearlessness shown by Omble.  Prajapati said that a paper describing the team’s findings on the jumping spiders has been published in a journal of international repute, Arthropoda Selecta. The team includes Somnath Kumbhar, John Caleb, Rajesh Sanap, and Ravi D Kamboj. The jumping spiders were spotted last year. Prajapati said that Icius tukarami species was found in the urbanized habitat of Kalyan, Thane, and can be easily identified by a pair of white longitudinal stripes on the body. Also, the shape of its tibial apophysis, the reproductive organ, is unique. The second spider species that the GEER researchers found is Phintella cholkei. It is distributed across the Aarey Milk Colony in Mumbai. Phintella cholkei is named in remembrance of Kamlesh Cholkhe, a friend of one of the team members. Cholkhe passed away last year. The name was suggested by Kumbhar, a sample collector of these two species. This species has unique body pattern and genital organs. “Last year, Kumbhar collected both the species from Thane and gave them to me for detailed research,” Prajapati said. “I carried out the whole research work, covering the novelty of the species. Later, Caleb and Sanap also found the species we eventually named Phintella cholkei. They observed it in the Aarey Milk Colony.” Prajapati added: “Then we collaborated on a single paper. This entire research was done at GEER Foundation with the support of its director at the time, Ravi D Kamboj.” Prajapati has been regularly conducting studies to identify spiders. “The first distinctive aspect about spiders is their eyes,” he said. “This time, we used an electron microscope to study spiders’ legs, body shapes, patterns on heads, reproductive organs, and hair on bodies.” Prajapati said these features are compared with a standardized database. The comparisons helped the researchers determine that they had found unique species. He said there are about 49,532 types of spiders around the world, spread across 129 families. The two species can be found along roads and near residential buildings in patches of green. Development certainly affects the species’ habitat. The two species seem to mainly feed on whiteflies, plant-hoppers, wasps, and book-lice. The specimens observed in the Aarey Milk Colony were found under tree leaves, 2-7 feet above the ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-in-web-of-spider-discoveries/articleshow/83935478.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The samples were collected on Saturday, a day after the report of genome sequencing of the woman had revealed that she was infected with Delta+ variant on June 1. The health department had found 41 influenza-like illness cases, but no one has tested positive. Though officials heaved a sigh of relief, they are still making a lot of effort to ensure that no Delta+ variant case goes undetected. “We have collected 220 more samples from the area today (Monday) and sent them for Covid test. We have created a micro containment area. Our teams are conducting door-to-door survey. All 41 influenza-like illness cases we had found on Saturday have tested negative,” said Dr OP Chahar, chief medical health officer, Bikaner. Health authorities are trying to find answers to a lot of questions related to Delta+ variant, which is highly transmissible. They are putting efforts to know if Delta+ was circulating in the area during the second wave or the 65-year-old was the only case of the new variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/delta-scare-77-samples-from-bikaner-test-negative/articleshow/83935482.cms||---

In this memorable journey, I had the pleasant experience of meeting my old friends and relatives in Rura and Jhinhjak…,” wrote the President in the visitors book at Lucknow’s Charbagh station. LUCKNOW: Ram Nath Kovind scripted history as the Presidential Express chugged into Charbagh station a few minutes before noon on Monday. Kovind became the first serving President to travel to Lucknow by train As the President deboarded, he was warmly received by Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath along with a host of officials. The President directly went to the Raj Bhawan where he will spend the next two days. This is the last leg of the President’s five-day visit to his home state . The ultra-luxurious royal train, Maharaja Express, was converted into the Presidential Express at Delhi’s Safdarjung railway station. Elated with the journey, the President lauded the railways. “I extend my best wishes to Indian railways who are providing easy and convenient transportation from the inaccessible mountain ranges of the Himalayas to the beaches of Kanyakumari, and from the lush green lands of northeast India to the western deserts of Gujarat,” he wrote in the visitors book. “It is my firm belief that Indian railways will maintain a leading position in rail services across the world as it’s the preferred transport service for billions of Indians every day. My heartfelt thanks and best wishes to the entire team involved in the service of Indian railways,” the note further read. The last time a President travelled by train was in 2006 when Dr APJ Abdul Kalam boarded a special train from Delhi to Dehradun to attend the passing out parade at the Indian Military Academy. It was the country’s first president Rajendra Prasad who undertook train journeys often. Following the President Kovid’s train travel, railway minister Piyush Goyal tweeted, “His excellency president Ram Nath Kovind’s message is encouraging the entire railway family. I’m glad that your train travel experience was pleasant. I assure you that we will remain engaged in the service of crores of Indians, and will always keep your trust.” Sanjay Kumar and Anil Kumar Dixit, the two loco-pilots of the Presidential train, described the journey as “once-in-a-lifetime experience” and a “moment of pride” for them. “It was the most unforgettable moment of our life,” said Akshay Deep Chauhan, the guard of the Presidential Express.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/presidential-exp-chugs-into-city-kovind-scripts-history/articleshow/83937581.cms||Arvind Chauhan

---||Kochi||Olympian alleges lapses in rape case probe||Thrissur: Olympian Mayookha Johny on Monday alleged that the police were not taking effective action in her complaint that her friend was raped, and that the former chairperson of the state women’s commission M C Josephine and a minister in the previous cabinet had intervened to protect the accused. Addressing a news conference along with the survivor, Mayookha alleged that the accused was having immense financial, religious and political clout and had been blackmailing and threatening her and the complainant. Mayookha said the assault had taken place in 2016. The accused, Chunkath Johnson, hailing from Chalakudy Muringoor, had trespassed into the woman’s house and raped her. The accused had also allegedly taken her nude pictures. However, the survivor, who was unmarried then, did not disclose the incident to anyone fearing social stigma and the dire consequences. Mayookha alleged that the accused had taken it as an opportunity and tried to abuse the survivor again. When he found that she was not yielding, he started sending her indecent messages, Mayookha alleged. “The accused had become more enraged when he came to know that the survivor had shared the incident with me. He tried to threaten me also then,” Mayookha alleged. Mayoookha said the survivor had got married in 2018 but the accused tried to blackmail and threaten her again by dropping some notices in her house towards the end of 2020. Her husband and in-laws came to know about the incident then. The survivor and her husband then filed a complaint with the police in Kollam district where they were residing. The case was then transferred to the police station at Aloor in Thrissur district as the crime had taken place in the area under it. Initially, the police had taken prompt actions like taking the statement of the survivor before the magistrate and subjecting her to medical examination. However, later the accused started threatening her even in front of the police. Even though Thrissur rural SP G Poonguzhali was informed about the survivor’s predicament, she also adopted a favourable attitude towards the accused, Mayookha alleged. Mayookha claimed that she had definite evidence to show that Josephine had intervened to protect the accused. However, Josephine was not available for comments immediately. New police team to probeWhen contacted, Poonguzhali said the police were making earnest efforts to investigate the case. A new team under crime branch DSP Pious George has been constituted to probe the complaint. The team will also comprise woman police officers. The special branch DSP will be asked to look into the complaints raised by the survivor against the earlier investigating team, the SP said. She disclosed that the mobile phone of the accused has been seized and sent for forensic analysis. Since the alleged assault had taken place about five years ago, it was difficult to get direct evidence and the police had to rely on circumstantial evidence. “The survivor also could not submit the threatening and blackmailing messages the accused had allegedly sent her. We are trying to gather strong evidence before arresting the accused,” Poonguzhali said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/olympian-alleges-lapses-in-rape-case-probe/articleshow/83933180.cms||---

Rajkot has a target of administering 25,000 doses per day but due to the scarcity, barely 8,000 to 12,000 are getting the shot. Municipal commissioner Amit Arora said, “There is an issue with stock currently, but it’s temporary. We got an assurance from the government that supply will return to normal in a day or two.” Top sources however said mismanagement of stock for second dose beneficiaries has led to the shortage. Jab chances dim as only 100 of 230 centres operational in Surat Surat: Diamond City administered 22,000 doses of vaccine from 100 centres on Monday against 12,000 on Sunday. Due to limited supply, the health department of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is continuing vaccination from 100 centres against 230 in the past week. Health officials acknowledged that each centre is giving just 200 doses and tokens are being issued to avoid a rush. “We need more doses of Covishield as the majority of vaccine seekers are coming for their second dose,” said a health official. Meanwhile, citizens were hassled. “I waited in line for over an hour but did not get the vaccine on Sunday. On Monday too, after queuing up for two hours, I was told the stock is over,” lamented Kirit Parmar, 76, at T&TV High School. “I got a message to get the second dose but when went to the vaccination centre the stock was finished,” said Shobha Soni, 46, a resident of Gopipura.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Maharana aide Bhamashah’s Chittorgarh haveli lies in neglect||JAIPUR: Bhamashah (1547-1600 CE), a renowned general, minister and a close aide of Maharana Pratap, who gave 20,000 gold coins and other valuables worth Rs 2.5 lakh in 1581 CE to fund Pratap’s military, has become synonymous with generosity. Over the years, it became a trend to identify generous donors as ‘Bhamashahs.’ The reference of this donation is mentioned in the book Veer Vinod (1886 CE) by Shyamal Das. He is adorned as a state icon with some major flagship schemes like Bhamashah Yojana (financial benefits), Bhamashah Pashu Bima Yojana and Bhamashah Awards (for donors). However, his name is missing from his mansion or haveli which passes off as any other building in the compound of Chittorgarh fort. On his 474th birth anniversary, members from his lineage have demanded complete restoration of his mansion, signages and plaque after him. “Bhamshah’s multiple facets of his life, including the sharp understanding of business, economy and military have not been fully explored,” said Chandra Shekhar Sharma, a historian, while delivering lecture at Haldighati to commemorate the birth anniversary of the legend on Monday. The mansion is located in an isolated place with no signages. Chittorgarh tourism officer Sharad Vyas said his mansion added with his tales of generosity can be a great tourist attraction. “Efforts are on to highlight his mansion along with Topekhana as key spots in the Chittorgarh Fort,” said Vyas. Also, the department is working to include a portion of him in the light and sound show. ASI in-charge of Chittorgarh Fort, RL Jiterwal, said they have done restoration of the building. “The signages and boards will soon be placed at the site,” said Jiterwal. Historians have a dispute over how Bhamashah had accumulated his wealth. Sources said Bhamashah had a personal treasure account of the Mewar family which he had returned while another theory says Bhamashah along with Amar Singh (Son of Pratap) had looted Mughal treasure at Malwa (1581 CE) which was handed over to Maharana at Chuliya village at Idar (Gujarat).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/maharana-aide-bhamashahs-chittor-haveli-lies-in-neglect/articleshow/83935581.cms||---

In response to a story published by TOI on Monday, KIIFB stated that the organization does not stand to benefit from the price rise in petrol and diesel as cess on both have been fixed at Re 1 per litre in the state, and not as a percentage of the prices of petrol and diesel. So, when the prices go up, people would rationalize the use of petrol and diesel, effectively reducing the use and thereby KIIFB also losing its revenue. It further stated that KIIFB would be adversely affected with regard to the revenue from motor vehicle tax also, which is the second source of income for the organisation. When the prices of fuels go up, people would defer purchase of vehicles, which in turn would adversely affect motor vehicle taxes. The statement further said that the title of the article that “Fuel price hike: Public’s loss, KIIFB’s gain” is misleading that KIIFB benefits at the expense of consumers who are reeling under an unprecedented rise in fuel prices. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kiifb-loses-revenue-when-fuel-price-is-hiked/articleshow/83933216.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi municipal polls 2022: BJP’s own survey gives it 50 seats, claims AAP||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday claimed that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had conducted an internal survey that gave the latter 40-50 out of the 272 seats in the next municipal elections in 2022. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, however, called AAP’s claims imaginary and baseless. “BJP has not conducted any such survey,” he claimed. In the 2017 municipal elections, BJP had won 181 seats and came to power in all three municipal corporations in Delhi. According to AAP’s Durgesh Pathak, the people of Delhi had made up their mind to throw BJP out of power. “In the last 15 years, BJP has ruined the corporations and turned the capital into a city of garbage,” he alleged in a statement. AAP has been alleging that under BJP, corruption has grown in the corporations. According to Pathak, “In the last 15 years, no house has been built in Delhi from where BJP’s councillors have not taken commissions. They have destroyed the city by creating such a collection system.” He added that though the traders had been devastated due to Covid-19, the corporations had imposed 12 to 13 additional taxes. The corporations don’t even have funds to pay salaries, said Pathak. “The municipal employees are protesting everywhere demanding their pending salaries.” The AAP functionary claimed that “people of Delhi have decided that this time, the corporations should be given to Kejriwal and AAP. We must go to every house and unite entire Delhi on one platform and make Delhi an excellent city, a world-class city. This is only possible if both Delhi government and the corporations are under AAP”. BJP functionary Kapoor said AAP had conducted imaginary poll surveys and declared results. Calling the world-class city promise a gimmick, he alleged, “In the 2015 and 2019 assembly polls, Arvind Kejriwal had promised to make Delhi like London and Paris. But in the last seven years, the AAP government has not given Delhi even a single flyover or road project. They promised to make Yamuna like Thames, but have made it like a drain.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjps-own-survey-gives-it-50-civic-seats-claims-aap/articleshow/83935591.cms||---

On Sunday, seven districts did not administer a single dose. Despite state government’s demand for 25 lakh doses, as requested by health minister in a letter to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday highlighting shortage of doses affecting vaccination, it received only 2 lakh doses on Monday. “Tomorrow (Tuesday) no vaccines will be administered in several districts,” said a senior health department official.

---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: Home loan disbursals down 23% in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Disbursals of housing finance reduced by 23% in the pandemic year 2020-21 against the same period last year. Housing finance disbursals stood at Rs 12,731 crore in 2020-21 against Rs 15,647 crore in 2019-20, according to the latest report of the state-level bankers’ committee (SLBC). Bankers attribute the decline primarily to falling incomes due to which the uptake of new home loans has gone down. With the pandemic-induced lockdown, not only did demand for new properties take a hit but also launches of new schemes. “Due to the lockdown and restrictions, disbursals fell for housing finance. The demand for new homes also reduced because many people faced a fall in income and with the financial uncertainty of the pandemic, people deferred purchases,” said a top SLBC official. Even the number of housing finance loan accounts fell. The SLBC report shows that against 2.38 lakh home loan borrowers in 2019-20 in Gujarat, merely 1.91 lakh sought loans, a 20% reduction. On the lower demand for new homes, Balbirsingh Khalsa, the Ahmedabad branch director of Knight Frank India Limited, said, “New launches were very few in the pandemic year and therefore sales of new homes went down. This is bound to affect disbursal of housing loans. Many people lost their jobs or faced salary cuts, and some are not getting payments on time. Even businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises were adversely hit. Therefore, people’s confidence was shaken, and they did not want to add on another liability in the form of a home loan. This thus affected demand.” Actual disbursals of housing finance in 2020-21, was barely 73.6% of the target under the service area credit plan, states the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-home-loan-disbursals-down-23/articleshow/83935537.cms||Niyati Parikh

The decision was taken in the house meeting held on Monday. Mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu said libraries were closed for now. “Under the resolution, the maintenance of libraries will be done by the MC but the arrangements for its operation will be made by RWAs, for which Rs 10,000 per month will be paid to them,” he said. The libraries are in Silvi Park, Phase X; Rose Garden, Phase 3B1; Phase IV; sectors 70, 69, 65 and 56. At present, these libraries have very less books, no furniture and drinking water facility. These libraries have been a bone of political contention in the past. In January last year, the MC had sacked employees and paid them salaries of only three months against those pending of six months. In June 2020, after the MC’s attempt to purchase 1,100 books worth Rs 12 lakh for six various libraries while bypassing a committee was stalled, the libraries were on the verge of shut down. Senior citizens had vouched to manage and operate these libraries but the proposal had been rejected then. The libraries also faced a series of controversies and credit war between Congress and SAD-BJP councillors. Former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra alleged cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had inaugurated four libraries in Mohali which had already been opened by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rwas-to-operate-libraries-in-parks/articleshow/83933221.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The veterinary team involved in the post-mortem of the leopard said that the big cat succumbed to “traumatic shock”. However, the team didn’t divulge detailed information concerning the death. Meanwhile, a video of forest officials tackling the leopard with canes in their defence has gone viral on social media platforms. “The lesson that we have learnt from this operation is that our teams would be provided with full safety gear, starting from nets to gloves and helmets for conducting such operations. Many of our staffers were left injured,” said JS Suhag, chief wildlife warden of the forest department. Meanwhile, a ‘problem’ leopard in Biron Khal village of Pauri district has been caged by the forest department.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad architects brought Zen garden, Kaizen hall to life||AHMEDABAD: The Zen garden and Kaizen hall at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) have been designed by two city-based architects - Anushri Patel (25) and Neha Rajora (34). The two say that they have made a concerted attempt to preserve elements of traditional Japanese gardens at the Zen garden in Ahmedabad, which was inaugurated online by PM Narendra Modi last Sunday. Neha Rajora and Anushri Patel visited Japan and spent a fortnight there in April 2019 acquainting themselves with the design, and more importantly, the ethos and philosophy, which encapsulate traditional Japanese gardens, before they could replicate quintessential Japanese elements at the Zen garden and Kaizen hall, at AMA. “The 15-day training period in Japan helped us appreciate the sense of mystery, the use of points and elements as well as other basic principles of Japanese gardens. We have made a concerted attempt to keep these alive at the Zen garden,” said Anushri Patel, who was studying at the architectural Association, London, when she visited Japan for the training. “Traditional Japanese gardens are perceived to be more of holy and serene places and have a deeper meaning attached to them. We have attempted to create a similar atmosphere of tranquility in the 5,000 square feet area by incorporating most of the elements of Japanese gardens,” said Rajora, who has studied architecture from University of Illinois, USA and specializes in landscape architecture. The architects said that the unique thing about the project are the Awaji tiles — a gift from Hyogo, a province of Japan. “We used the tiles in the entire garden to showcase the friendship between the two nations by using them in the pathways, the dry Zen garden area and even created the symbols of Gujarat and Hyogo,” the two architects said. However, it was not just replicating basic elements of Japanese gardens in the one at Ahmedabad. There was in fact a lot of adaptation to do. “Ahmedabad’s climatic condition is quite different from Japan’s. We used flora and fauna that are strikingly similar to the ones in Japan,” Rajora said. The Kaizen hall has been set up with the vision of facilitating learning of different Japanese ethics and values. “We designed it in a way that it would represent the traditional Japanese tea house interiors with circular windows, to give a stunning view of the garden,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-architect-brought-zen-garden-to-life/articleshow/83935636.cms||---

The number of real estate agents registered with the Gujarat Real Estate Regulatory Authority (GujRERA) rose by 24% to 356 in 2020-21 from 286 in 2019-20. Of the total agents registered in fiscal 2021, 336 were individuals and 20 were companies. Ahmedabad grabbed the lion’s share with 279 real estate agents—individuals and companies—getting registered with the regulatory authority, according to data available with GujRERA. Around 70 more agents registered so far in the ongoing financial year, taking the total number of registered real estate agents to 1,571 across the state. “Demand for real estate agents has increased. There is zero investment and risk involved in starting one’s own real estate consultancy business. Hence, the market has seen the entry of a new generation with young and highly-qualified people, even having management degrees, choosing this business,” said Pravin Bavadiya, founder president of Ahmedabad Realtors Association (ARA), a body of real-estate brokers and agents.  Since there is no entry barrier, those who want to run their independent broking business rather than working for a salary are also foraying into the real estate broking business. This trend continued even during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to market players, several real estate franchise owners have launched ventures after gaining experience for a few years with national and international real estate consultants who operate on franchise model. A decade ago, the real estate consultancy space was largely unorganized. However, real estate consultancy has now seen professionalism and an agent-friendly environment getting created. This has attracted more players to the real estate brokerage business and an increased number of consultants are registering themselves with RERA, said industry players. It may be mentioned here that the number of real estate projects—residential, commercial, mixed development and plotted schemes— registered with GujRERA declined by 23% to1,346 in 2020-21 from 1,745 projects in 2019-20 due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/registration-of-estate-agents-up-24-in-pandemic-times/articleshow/83935660.cms||Kalpesh Damor

One councillor Rajesh Moradiya, who was ill, was not arrested. Later in the evening, they were produced before a judicial magistrate and released on bail. AAP leaders alleged that their councillors were deliberately arrested so that they could not participate in the general board meeting. While three councillors were detained in the morning, several others were taken into custody before they could enter the Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) headquarters. A few councillors who had managed to slip inside the building and had hid themselves were also arrested before they could enter the meeting hall. Two other councillors were detained from inside the meeting hall. “Police had registered FIR against our councillors on June 26 morning, but they did not do anything for 48 hours. Just before the general board meeting, they started arresting our councillors because we were going to raise the issue of irregularities committed during NPSS polls,” said Mahendra Navadiya, president of AAP Surat. AAP leaders said that it was for the first time that SMC’s general board meeting was held in absence of opposition. The councillors and their two candidates were booked for creating ruckus and damaging the furniture following the NPSS polls on June 25 at SMC headquarters. They had allegedly used abusive language and brawled with security guards. Visuals of the ruckus were widely shared on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/26-aap-councillors-held-ahead-of-smc-meeting/articleshow/83930750.cms||---

This is a major shift from the ongoing trend of engineering students dominating the batch in absolute numbers. A total of 197 students from diverse educational backgrounds, working environments/industries, and different parts of the country took admissions in the new MBA batch. This represents an increased intake as well as the enrolment of 44 more students compared to the 153 students of the 2020-22 batch. This third-generation IIM will induct these 197 students as its seventh batch of its flagship Post Graduate Programme in Management, which would lead to the award of an MBA degree, on June 29, Tuesday. The institute, which took its baby steps in 2015 from a transit campus in Andhra University with a sanctioned strength of 60 seats, had got 40 more seats in 2018, taking its intake capacity to 100. Since then, the IIM-V continued to add tens of seats every year to now reach the 200-range. The 2021-23 MBA batch students hail from 21 states of the country. Prof M Chandrasekhar, director, IIM-Visakhapatnam, said that diversity and inclusivity mark the new MBA cohort as was in the case of earlier batches. The institute celebrates diversity. The diversity in terms of educational credentials and work experience of the students would enhance the overall learning experience, as there are more opportunities on offer to interact and share experiences in a symbiotic way. The increased intake has helped more students gain admissions into the new batch. This promotes even better, practice of shared values, self-confidence and mutual support for well-rounded development,” said Prof Chandrasekhar. “The quantum of fresh out-of-college students in the batch is about 73%. While 16 students have a work experience of more than three years, eight students have the credentials of working more than two years. Among the 52 experienced professionals, nearly 50% students come from the IT background,” said Prof Chandrasekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/non-engg-students-dominate-iim-v-mba-batch/articleshow/83933269.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Dozens of businessmen led by Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JSMA) shouted slogans against the department and also burnt effigy of A Venu Prasad, chairman of the PSPCL. Jaswinder Thukral, president of JSMA, said, “As PSPCL did not budge from its anti-industry stand and has not waived off the penalties imposed on us and UUE cases filed against us for using more power load than sanctioned. The deadline given by us to the department passed last week and the chairman did nothing about these cases we have started our weekly protest under which we will visit every sub-division of PSPCL on every Monday and protest against department along with burning the effigy of chairman. It is now evident that all the senior officials of the department including chairman are least bothered about the plight of businessmen and themselves want that industry of Punjab should shut down.” Thukral also added, “Today was the first protest in this series at Janta Nagar sub-division of PSPCL and we got overwhelming response from the businessmen, as members of different business associations came out in large number to protest against the atrocities of the PSPCL.” According to Inderjit Singh, another known industrialist, “Our war against PSPCL has just began and it will continue till August 23.

The 78-second video was shared by SP president Akhilesh Yadav on his twitter handle. The video provides glimpses of how the former UP chief minister and his wife, former MP, reached out to the people in need, distributing food packets and medicines and extending help to migrant workers during last year’s lockdown. The video also highlights development schemes launched by the SP government, including Lucknow Metro and contains photos of Akhilesh meeting people on Agra Expressway and distributing laptops among students. सुख दुःख में साथ निभाया है सुख दुःख में साथ निभाएँगे https://t.co/LxyBYnrfZP— Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) 1624797925000Seen as the SP’s election campaign ‘teaser’, a noticeable section of the video is apparently aimed at attacking the ruling BJP over handling of the pandemic. With the catchy background score and a carefully worded song, the video focuses on problems and miseries faced by the people during the pandemic and takes on “avsarwadi” (opportunists) who had failed to deliver with visuals of a silhouette clad in saffron attire. The video has shots of people mourning the death of their loved ones, bodies floating in rivers and funeral processions, mass cremations and pyres, people in PPE kits carrying patients on stretchers and children in school uniforms confined to their homes.

Ironically, some of the felled trees from Mankuva were recovered from range officer Joji John property. “A 4.14m teak tree was recovered from a resort owned by John’s wife at Kumily near Thekkady. Additionally, over two tonne firewood was recovered from another building owned by John’s mother,” said a source in the forest department. However, the forest department has not taken any action against John. Meanwhile, Georgy P Mathachen, chief conservator of forests (CCF), high-range circle, told TOI that he has directed Munnar assistant forest conservator (ACF) to look into the allegations against John. “The forest vigilance squad found the felled tree and they are continuing the probe. Presently, there is no department-level action against the range officer,” said Mathachen. A top forest department official told TOI that the ACF-level probe against John is just a sham. “The ACF is just another official in the same region and he can’t conduct an impartial inquiry against the range officer. To reveal his role in the crime, a probe by forest vigilance or police vigilance squad must be conducted,” said the official. “It’s a curious case since trees were felled in the area under the range officer’s supervision and later it was recovered from his property,” he added. Environmentalist M N Jayachandran told TOI that the government should temporarily remove the official from service and conduct a probe. “An impartial probe against the official while he remains in service won’t be possible. The tree was recovered from the range officer’s property and it clearly shows his culpability in the large-scale tree felling. Environmentalists have already demanded a CBI inquiry into the tree felling issue in the state,” said Jayachandran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/felled-tree-found-on-range-officers-property/articleshow/83933373.cms||Sandeep Thomas

The YSR EMC coming up on a sprawling 350 acres of land at Kopparthy village in Kadapa district is getting ready with the APIIC executing the basic infrastructure provision works on the site. The project is estimated to cost Rs 784 crore of which the central government has already cleared the proposal to pay Rs 350 crore. The Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology already cleared the project in March this year and communicated the same to the state government. The state government too had initiated the works like formation of internal roads, provision of street lights, drinking water supply and the entrance gate. These works are nearing completion as the APIIC monitoring the works on day-to-day basis despite Covid-19 pandemic. APIIC has also constructed three major buildings at the site to provide temporary accommodation to investing companies. The companies can straight away install their machinery in any of these three buildings and start manufacture of electronic gadgets once the project is inaugurated. The APIIC had also readied layouts for investors in nearly 300 acres, where construction activity can be started straight away. The state government is anticipating investment of over Rs 10,000 crore in the cluster of which, sources say that proposals for Rs 2,000 crore have already been received and being considered. The electronics manufacturing major, Dixon Technologies India Limited, had already agreed to invest Rs 300 crore in the cluster. The APIIC had also given 70 acres of land in the cluster to the Dixon to start its operations. The state government wants to promote manufacture of consumer durables in the cluster, in which the Dixon is a major player. The focus in the Kopparthy cluster would be on promoting manufacture of home appliances, mobile phones, set top boxes, LED TVs, security systems and other consumer durables. Sources say that the chief minister is firm on opening this cluster, as it is located in his home district, before he completes the first half of his second year in power. The chief minister had also directed the officials to ensure that basic facilities are provided to every unit in the cluster on which the APIIC is working. When the officials told him about the water problem for the cluster, the chief minister is said to have directed them to draw it from the Somasila Project, which is in the adjacent Nellore district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/electronic-cluster-to-be-inaugurated-in-july/articleshow/83933307.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Hyderabad||Telangana’s dalit empowerment plan will exclude creamy layer||HYDERABAD: The Chief Minister dalit Empowerment Programme announced by the Telangana government on Sunday is expected to remove the long-term problems caused by banks under the Rythu Bandhu scheme. Sources in the state government told TOI that farmers were deprived of the benefit under Rythu Bandhu scheme with some banks diverting the money released under the scheme to recover loans given to farmers, and said that such a situation will not be faced by the SC beneficiaries under the new scheme. The proposed scheme will be linked with new schemes to come into existence aimed at financial growth of the beneficiary. The scheme ensures that the beneficiary gets the Rs 10 lakh indirectly as the beneficiary of another financial empowerment or self-support scheme. In addition to the schemes such as those that provide financial support for buying a four-wheeler to be run as cabs, there will be more supply schemes formulated. The beneficiary family can select a scheme where Rs 10 lakh worth financial assistance is given. “The chief minister has instructed us to formulate more such schemes, the scheme will be implemented this fiscal with Rs 1,200 crore,” SC welfare minister Koppula Eswar told TOI. Another feature of the scheme will be identification of beneficiaries seeking certain conditions. ‘The SC families having a government job or those who have already received other benefits will not be given priority. We will try to benefit the poorest of the lot,” the minister said. There will be an administrative set-up to implement the scheme at the district and assembly segment levels in addition to the officials working for SC welfare development and SC welfare corporation. Meanwhile, newly-appointed PCC chief A Revanth Reddy alleged that TRS did not do anything for dalits in the state. “In the name of dalit empowerment, benefiting only 100 families for each assembly segment is not justified. We will fight against the injustices meted out to dalits in the state,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-dalit-empowerment-plan-will-exclude-creamy-layer/articleshow/83935700.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Rajkot||Dhoraji, Upleta units suffer from want of plastic waste||Rajkot: Along with the spread of virus, lockdown had also kept another menace under tight control — spread of plastic garbage. Plastic garbage waste generation got reduced by 50 to 70 percent. While this figure was dervied at looking at plastic waste coming to Dhoraji and Upleta town of Rajkot, the hubs of plastic waste processing in the country, it has also upset the entire economy based on recycling plastic waste. Waste including polythene bags, cement bags hurtled in to these two towns in truckloads from around 25 states. Here, 550 units processed 1,000 tonnes of garbage every day, which for the past five months have been starving for want of raw materials. At present, town gets around 300 to 500 tonnes of waste forcing many units to cut down on manhours. Dalsukh Vagadiya, president of Dhoraji Plastic Association said, “The entire processing cycle has been disturbed. We don’t get enough raw material resulting in many units taking two week offs and also working single shift, instead of thre earlier three shifts. Also demand for processed material has also dried up in the market because of the lockdown-like situations in the many states.” Plastic waste processing and recycling units have come up in Dhoraji and Upleta over the past four decades which recycle waste including those collected by ragpickers in the form of polythene bags and low and high-density plastic scrap. Recycled plastic is a key raw material for making products like granules, plastic ropes used in packing bags of agricultural products and those used by loaders like trucks to tie the goods, baling twins, water pipes used in farms and others.According to the units, prices of raw material have also increased to Rs 16 per kg from Rs 10 owing to the shortage. Recycled plastic restricts use of virgin plastic and Dhoraji and Upleta exports its material to Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka and certain African countries.Nandlal Unghad, president of Upleta Plastic Association said, “We are waiting for the economy to revive because currently we have to pay very high prices for the raw material while in the market traders are demanding heavy discounts in processed plastic. We can’t bear loss from both sides.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dhoraji-upleta-units-suffer-from-want-of-plastic-waste/articleshow/83930841.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Mumbai||BMC, Israeli co ink pact for Maharashtra’s first desalination plant||MUMBAI: The plan to set up a water de-salination plant for the city just moved a step further. The BMC has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a water technology company in Israel to prepare a detailed project report. Such a plant makes sea water usable for non-drinking purposes after its salinity is tempered. So, sea water, when processed by the plant, will make it usable for industrial use, gardening and such purposes. The BMC will set up the state’s first desalination plant at Manori in Malad (west) to help increase Mumbai’s water supply. The project is estimated to cost Rs 1,600 crore and is slated to be operational by 2025. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who was present at the event said that the 200 million litres desalination project is a “revolutionary step” and that it was his “dream for several years”. “There are some countries in the world that have already started using seawater on a large scale by desalinating it. Every technology has a price, but human life is more valuable than that and we all have a responsibility to make drinking water available 24 hours in Mumbai,”said Thackeray. According to the MoU signed with MS IDE Water Technologies Ltd, whose appointment was cleared by BMC’s standing committee last month, the detailed project report will be ready by May next year. BMC officials said that once work to prepare the report is taken up, various studies for the project — like measurement of tides, waves and currents, analysis of the quality of sea water besides ecology and bio-diversity studies, preparaingcoastal regulation zone map and related clearances — will be pursued. BMC had plans to set up a plant after a severe water crisis in 2009, but it was shelved. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray suggested that more such smaller plants be set up along the state’s coastline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-israeli-co-ink-pact-for-states-first-desalination-plant/articleshow/83937808.cms||Bhavika Jain

Brute force was used to stop SP candidates and their proposers from filing nomination papers for district panchayat chairman polls,” Akhilesh said, adding that officials responsible for checking malpractices looked the other way. “The state election commissioner and the Governor House are also silent on the issue,” he said. Citing instances, Akhilesh said the SP candidate was put under house arrest in Balrampur, while in Lalitpur, the candidate was not allowed to file nomination. “In Gorakhpur, BJP supportrs stopped the SP candidate at the gates of collectorate. In Jhansi, the SP candidate was stopped from filing nomination. Similar situation prevailed in Varanasi,” he added.

In a letter to the medical superintendents of these 25 hospitals, Sharma said these plants would help to meet oxygen requirement during the third wave and make these hospitals generate oxygen independently. He said the district administration was ready to provide all kind of support to the hospital whenever the need arises. “Taking in the view of experience in the second wave, we have to prepare better to deal with the virus so these hospitals have to establish the oxygen plant immediately before the advent of the third wave,” he said. The DC said with the installation of PSA oxygen generation plants, the load on district administration and vendors supplying liquid medical oxygen would minimise and smaller hospitals can be supplied the life-saving gas according to their requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hospitals-asked-to-have-oxygen-plants-to-combat-3rd-wave/articleshow/83946469.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh high court pulls up finance department for payments delay||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday pulled up the finance department officials for inordinate delay in payment of bills to contractors who executed various works in Panchayatraj and Rural Development department. The high court observed that because of the inefficiency of the officials, not only the contractors but many others including retired employees have been suffering. Justice Devanand cited the death of a schoolteacher who did not receive salary for nine months and asked who will take responsibility for his death. “When the state government is spending Rs 60,000 crore every year for various welfare schemes, one cannot assume that the financial position of the state is in bad shape and it cannot be an excuse for non-payment of the bills,” said Justice Battu Devanand who had directed principal secretaries of finance and panchayatraj to appear before the court. On Monday, finance secretary S S Rawat and secretary for panchayat raj Gopala Krishna Dwivedi appeared before the high court. They deposed before the court that the pending bills of the petitioners have been cleared and payments have been made to them. Justice Devanand said that delaying payment for about three years was nothing but denying the right to dignity of the contractors who invested money by raising loans. Justice Devanand also found fault with the Comprehensive Finance Management System (CFMS) which has been cited as the reason for delay in many incidences. He observed that when a new system is introduced, the process has to be minimised, but it should not cause additional problems. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram said that he has called for a complete statement of works in panchayat raj department and is trying to evolve a resolution plan to clear dues pertaining to the works having no disputes. As one of the petitioners asked for payment of interest for causing delay in payment, Justice Devanand asked the government to file a counter affidavit on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-pulls-up-finance-dept-for-payments-delay/articleshow/83933366.cms||Srikanth Aluri

It decided not to shut down the units till the expiry of its environmental approval on December 31, 2022. The state government also assured the leaders that it will set up 300-megawatt capacity solar power plant in case KTPS fails to obtain environmental approval for continuity of operation of these two units after December 31, 2022. UDH minister and MLA from Kota-North, Shanti Dhariwal on Monday released a video statement and informed everyone of the development after his talks with energy minister B D Kalla and principal secretary Dinesh Kumar. “All the units, from1 to 7 of KTPS would continue their operation till December 31, 2022, it has been decided in today’s (Monday) meeting after discussion with the two (energy minister B D Kalla and principal secretary Dinesh Kumar),” Dhariwal said. Local Congress leader Pankaj Mehta and Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Karmachari Sangh’s Kota unit president Ram Singh Shekhawat expressed gratitude to CM Ashok Gehlot, Kalla and Dhariwal for the decision. The decision has given great relief to the families of around 1,000 contractual labourers and locals, he said.

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave this direction while hearing a PIL filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Telangana unit, general secretary Jaya Vindhyala seeking a judicial probe, action against the errant policemen, and Rs 5 crore compensation to be recovered from the police officers who allegedly tortured Mariamma to death. Advocate general BS Prasad informed the court that the judicial probe by the Alair magistrate has commenced. The state is also reaching out to the kin of the deceased with ex gratia and a government job. The bench directed the AG to file all those details in the form of an affidavit. The state, which initially ordered a probe by an RDO, an executive magistrate, was directed to get the probe done by a judicial magistrate by a bench of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar last week. The state government too took a serious view of the incident and also several atrocities committed against Dalits in the state and asked the DGP to visit the kin of Mariamma and assure them of justice. The state has also directed the police brass to punish the errant policemen who resort to atrocities against Dalits. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had announced a new scheme, the Dalit empowerment scheme, all over the state, that deposits Rs 10 lakh in the accounts of Dalit beneficiaries. This is in addition to the internal probe that is currently on to find out the errant policemen who resorted to the atrocious act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/custodial-death-hc-seeks-judicial-probe-report-by-aug-2/articleshow/83935720.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Loan disbursals down 30% due to lower uptake||AHMEDABAD: With fewer students opting for education abroad in the pandemic year due to the lockdown, uncertainty over Covid and restrictions, overall uptake of education loans took a massive hit.  According to the latest report of the state-level bankers’ committee (SLBC), education loan disbursals in 2020-21 declined by 30% from Rs 1,170 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 824 crore in 2020-21. The 169th SLBC meeting was held in Ahmedabad last week, during which the report was released. M M Bansal, convener of SLBC-Gujarat, said, “Most part of the first quarter of 2020-21 was spent under lockdown and the situation was the same across most countries. Universities had not given enough clarity on admissions and therefore, uptake was very low. At least 70% of education loan disbursals are extended to students headed abroad. With fewer students going, overall uptake fell significantly.”  In the priority sector annual credit plan for 2020-21, the targeted disbursal of education loans was Rs 1,982 crore. This means, barely 41.5% of the target was disbursed. Even in terms of number of accounts, only 26,308 accounts were given education loans, which works out to 45.7% of the targeted 57,491 accounts in the priority sector annual credit plan. Education has gone online at most universities worldwide due to the pandemic. Most foreign education aspirants were therefore compelled to get education online while in India. This, according to foreign education consultants, is one of the key reasons for the decline in uptake. “Last year, a number of students opted for deferred admissions because foreign universities gave the option of either delaying their admission by a couple of semesters or going for online classes. The number of students going abroad for education has gone down due to this,” said Hitesh Devaliya, director, Endeavour Careers. “Changing Covid-19 protocols of foreign countries are adding more requirements such as a 14-day quarantine, mandatory vaccination and even health insurance for students. All these factors are adding to the costs of studying abroad and are a deterrent to students. This may in turn have affected education loan uptake,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/loan-disbursals-down-30-due-to-lower-uptake/articleshow/83935747.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur district to help citizens change caste-based names||KOLHAPUR: The citizens of Kolhapur district who want to change their names or surnames that reveal their caste and cause discrimination now have a chance to do so. The decision to help citizens change their caste-based names or surnames has been taken by Kolhapur district collector Daulat Desai. Earlier, the state social welfare department had decided to do away with caste-based names for places and localities and instead allow the residents to choose the place names themselves. The process to change the names of such localities is on. Desai has gone one step ahead. “This is purely voluntary. Those citizens who wish to change their names and surnames, which reveal their caste, can apply to make changes. Kolhapur is the first district in the state to start such a drive,” Desai said. The administration will hold village-level camps. All the village staff will facilitate changing of names, surnames in all revenue records such as 7/12 certificates, house records, tax records and other certificates issued by the gram panchayat. “Soon, we will release the standard operating procedure to be followed by gram sevak, talathi and police patil to help citizens change their names and surnames,” the collector said. Legendary king and social reformer Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj used to change the names and surnames of wrestlers to hide their low social status. “He used to give names such as ‘Pandit’ or ‘Sardar’ to the wrestlers to avoid discrimination by others,” said Daulat Desai. During social reformation in the early 20th century, many changed their surnames to the name of their village or other names of their choice. Many, however, have deliberately kept their surnames. For instance, ‘Kumbhar’ and ‘Sutar’. These are the surnames of the castes of the same names. Not just caste, the profession is also revealed. In this case, Kumbhar meaning the person making potteries and Sutar meaning person working as carpenter. “Such surnames that reveal the caste and profession have remained at a little higher position in the society. They have hardly faced the worst form of discrimination such as untouchability. We have observed that people with caste-neutral surnames are accepted in society as the friends and co-workers. While those with surnames revealing caste are often outrightly rejected,” said Deepak Ghate, Kolhapur district social welfare officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-district-to-help-citizens-change-caste-based-names/articleshow/83933363.cms||---

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: One of 2 new jumping spider species named after cop who got Kasab alive||NAVI MUMBAI: Two new species of jumping spiders have been discovered recently, of which the one found from the Thane-Kalyan region has been named ‘Icius Tukarami’ in honour of Mumbai cop Tukaram Ombale who suffered fatal injuries while trying to catch Mumbai 26/11 attack terrorist Ajmal Kasab alive. The other species, ‘Phintella Cholkei’, was found from Aarey Colony and has been named after an avid spider researcher and naturalist Kamlesh Cholkhe who passed away last year. “ASI Omble was posthumously awarded the Ashok Chakra for his bravery and selflessness that led to the capture of Kasab near Girgaum Chowpatty. This species, Icius Tukarami, is recorded in urbanised habitat in Kalyan, Thane, and can be easily identified by a pair of white longitudinal stripes on its body and unique shape of tibial apophysis,” said the Ahmedabad-based spider researcher Dhruv Prajapati. The two spider discoveries have also been published in Russian scientific journal, Arthropoda Selecta. The name ‘Phintella Cholkei’ was suggested by Somnath Kumbhar who collected the samples of these two species. This species has unique body pattern and genital organs that cannot be seen in other spiders. This scientific paper is published by Prajapati, Somnath Kumbhar, Jhon Caleb, Rajesh Sanap and Ravi D Kamboj. “I wasn’t really thinking of how Ombale would have pounced on Kasab while naming the new spider species.

The businessmen joining the call given by the biggest transport body in India All India Motor Transport Congress, also observed a black day. They also submitted a memorandum of their demands through district administration. Charan Singh Lohara, chairman of Ludhiana Goods Transport Association (LGTA), said, “The consistent hike in diesel prices and the deteriorating conditions of the road transport sector is affecting about 20 crore citizens of India who are dependent on this sector for earning their livelihood. More than 85% of the transporters are small operators having one to five vehicles (both cargo and passenger segment) and about 65% of them are self employed, owner-drivers across all segments of commercial vehicle transportation space. Due to huge recession they are losing their livelihood and are struggling for survival. Moreover, as there is a spike in NPAs, the pressure from financial institutions for recovery and seizure of transport vehicles is making the matters worse.” Didar Singh president of LGTA, “Though a lot needs to be done by the central government for bringing back the transport sector on the path of growth, but the most important steps that need to be taken urgently include reduction in excise duty of centre government and reduction of VAT by states on diesel and petrol. Uniformity in rates of diesel and petrol should be maintained across the country and quarterly revision of fuel prices should be done. EMI Moratorium should be announced immediately and it should remain in force for six months in the prevailing scenario. Time limits prescribed for validity of e-way bill should be restored to earlier level of 1 day for every 100 kilometre.” According to J P Aggarwal, general secretary of LGTA, “We hope that the prudence will prevail among senior officials and leaders in the interest of this vital sector of economy and the lifeline of the nation to address the all important issues of the transport sector before the situation escalates beyond control.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/transporters-warn-of-going-on-indefinite-chakka-jam/articleshow/83933415.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While for aided courses, the total fee concession amounts to Rs 1,000-1,500, for unaided courses, it could range from Rs 3,000 to Rs 6,000. For PG courses, the concession could be higher. Among fees that are to be waived are charges for gymkhana, computers, sports fund, medical aid, festival, and hostels in aided and unaided colleges. Besides, higher & technical education minister Uday Samant said on Tuesday that students who have lost a parent or parents to Covid will get a full fee waiver till the completion of their UG and PG education. He has ordered that library and laboratory fees should be cut to 50% as colleges and universities may have spent on purchasing e-content and maintenance. He said some of the charges had not been incurred for most of the courses during the pandemic. However, there will be no concession in tuition and development fees. A government official said the decision on full fee waiver was taken in consultation with vice-chancellors of state universities. The minister convened a meeting on Monday to discuss the issue with VCs, who agreed to the conditions. “There are two components in college and university fees—fixed cost and running costs. Fixed costs include salary and maintenance which colleges must spend on, but for many other components, there was zero consumption during the pandemic. The idea was to pass on that benefit to students,” the official said. The state had already announced a concession of Rs 16,250 to students in government engineering colleges. Fees for private professional courses are decided by the Fee Regulating Authority. Yuva Sena, Shiv Sena’s students’ wing, had demanded fee concessions as several students have faced financial constraints due to the pandemic and the lockdown. Principals of city colleges said they will follow the guidelines once a circular is issued by the university or government. “Though for aided courses there will not be a major difference, for some unaided courses, colleges which have not retrenched staff or imposed a pay-cut for staff, the concession may have an impact. Some colleges have invested in software for laboratory and library work,” said a principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-univ-students-get-fee-concessions-of-up-to-rs-6k/articleshow/83974968.cms||Yogita Rao

Officers and teachers earn more than what he gets after tax deduction, Kovind said during a reception at Jhinjhak railway station while his special train was on way to Kanpur on Friday evening. Jhinkhak station is close to his native village Paraunkh in Kanpur Dehat. “If a train doesn't stop at a particular railway station, we forcibly stop it out of anger and, at times, even set it on fire. Who loses? Similarly, buses, scooters and motorcycles are set on fire in the name of agitation. Now, tell me, the train belongs to whom, people say it is a government's property. But, it's the taxpayer's money. I am telling this because everyone knows...there is nothing wrong...the President is the country's highest-paid employee, but he too pays tax. I pay Rs 2.75 lakh as tax each month. Everyone says I get Rs 5 lakh a month, but it is taxed too,” Kovind said, as the crowd cheered and clapped. “Now tell me, how much is left? Whatever I save, our officials earn more than that. The teachers here, they earn the most,” the President said further. He clarified:"I am mentioning all this to illustrate to you all that with the help of these taxes, development is being done." The President started his five-day trip to UP on June 27. After spending two days in Kanpur and his native village Paraunkh in Kanpur Dehat, he reached Lucknow on Monday by the Presidential Express Train on a two-day visit. He will lay the foundation of a grand Ambedkar Memorial in Lucknow on Tuesday before flying back to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prez-highest-paid-employee-but-is-taxed-too-says-kovind/articleshow/83937830.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The clarification came after there was confusion among many schools of whether the government decision was mandatory or not, said sources in GSHSEB. The state government has announced a mass promotion for all school students, including regular students of class X and class XII. To tackle the issue of a major rush expected this year for admissions in class XI, the state education department has earlier this month decided to increase the classroom capacity. GSHSEB said it had made some changes in the classroom strength for this year and the next. For class IX and Class XI, the board said it will allow 75 students to be admitted per class. Out of 7.92 lakh regular students who participated in the Class 10 board exam, 60.64% or about 4.80 lakh students cleared it last year. This year, however, 8.57 lakh regular students are eligible for admission to class XI. According to some initial estimates by the GSHSEB, about 2,000 new classrooms were to be added to accommodate the large number of students who will be taking admissions in class XI. This will require an addition of 3,500 teachers for class XI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gshseb-not-mandatory-to-increase-class-strength-to-75/articleshow/83935789.cms||---

Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition on the issue, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya said that the state government should be open for ideas and adopt best practices to contain the spread of Covid-19. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Suresh Kumar Potturi said that many international studies are suggesting that it was essential to vaccinate teachers before reopening schools. He said that as the state government was having all men and machinery to vaccinate people on mass scale it would take only a day to vaccinate all teachers and other staff members of the schools. Advocate general S Sriram told the court that the state government is open to take suggestions from everyone and trying to implement best practices in the state. He said the issue of vaccinating teachers will also be considered by the government as the process involves many other aspects. Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami further suggested to the state government to consider sealing off districts with high incidences of Covid-19 cases. Further hearing of the matter has been posted to July 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/devise-a-vax-policy-for-teachers-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/83933410.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court admits convict’s appeal in Nikita Tomar case, stays fine||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday admitted an appeal filed by the convict in the Nikita Tomar murder case of Faridabad, for hearing. The high court also stayed the fine imposed by the trial court in Faridabad on convict Tosif. A division bench headed by Justice Ritu Bahri admitted the appeal challenging trial court orders through which Tosif was held guilty and awarded life imprisonment for killing Nikita on October 26, 2020. Nikita, 21, a student of BCom was shot in broad daylight in Faridabad. The incident was captured on CCTV cameras. She was shot dead after she resisted an abduction attempt by the accused. On March 24, Tosif and accomplice Rehan were held guilty of murder by a fast-track court in Faridabad district. On March 26, both were sentenced to life imprisonment. A fine of Rs 20,000 each was also imposed on them by the trial court. In his appeal, Tosif, 22, submitted that he was falsely implicated by police in this case without any evidence as there was no complaint lodged at any stage regarding the harassment of the deceased by the appellant till the date of alleged occurrence. The high court has also been told that there is no call detail to prove that the appellant ever called the deceased after August 4, 2018. “The court has convicted Azruddin, co-accused by disbelieving the evidence of the prosecution and on the other hand wrongly convicted the appellant on the basis of the same evidence. Tosif has been falsely implicated by police without any evidence. The order dated March 24 and 26, through which he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisoned, should be quashed,” the HC was informed. The appellant has also submitted in his appeal that Nikita’s brother Navin Tomar is not the eyewitness to the alleged occurrence and stand taken by Navin that he took the deceased to the hospital along with one Tarun was false. It has been sumitted that information received from the hospital where the deceased was admitted showed that one Akash Bhatia took her to the health facility. Both Tosif and Rehan were held guilty under sections 302 (murder), 366 (kidnapping a woman to compel her into marriage), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. The third accused, Azaruddin, who was arrested for allegedly supplying weapons to Tosif, was acquitted for lack of evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-admits-convicts-appeal-in-nikita-tomar-case-stays-fine/articleshow/83935786.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||After water wars, Telangana & Andhra Pradesh caught in power tussle||HYDERABAD: Even before the dust on the water war is yet to settle down, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh seem to be heading towards power conflict now. The Telangana energy department on Monday issued orders to generate hydel power generation at Srisailam project despite AP government opposing it strongly. AP even wrote letter to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to restrain Telangana from hydel power generation. But, Telangana ordered its energy government to generate at full capacity. Interestingly, the orders were issued despite the KRMB asking Telangana to stop power generation. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has recently directed the power utilities to generate 100 per cent of its hydel power capacity to meet the energy requirements of the state. Following the CM’s directive, the energy department issued orders. In the orders, the energy department said owing to typical terrain of Telangana, it has no option except to lift water from either Krishna or Godavari rivers to fulfil the aspirations of the farmers of the state. “While there is huge power requirement, the TS Genco is not generating hydel power at full capacity. The present capacity of 2,500 MW a day is much lower than the requirement. The Genco chairman and managing director has been directed to take steps for enhancement of hydel power generation,” energy secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania said. TS Genco officials said the Telangana government is generating 300 MW in Jurala project, another 300 MW at Srisailam and about 100 MW to 200 MW from Nagarjuna Sagar project. “Of the total power demand of 5,000 MW for lift irrigation projects, 1,200 MW is exclusively for Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project,” a senior Genco official said. Official sources said while hydel power generation in 2019-20 was 4,509 MW, it was around 3,666 MW in 2020-21 due to the major fire accident in Srisailam hydel project where some units were destroyed. As a result of the accident, 700 MW was lost, the Genco official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-water-wars-telangana-ap-caught-in-power-tussle/articleshow/83935763.cms||Koride Mahesh

Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, the officer on special duty to state health department, Siddarth Tripathy, said, “We all have witnessed how devastating the second wave was and a big reason behind the spread was negligence by the citizens in maintaining the safety norms. So I urge all the citizens to continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour as we want to contain the spread during third wave.” The appeal comes after the Niti Aayog conducted a meeting with the health secretaries via video conferencing where the Union cabinet secretary directed the states to take measures to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour as experts have predicted that negligence will play a major role in the spread of virus during a third wave. Tripathy quoted the data provided during the meeting which stated that India had reported a total of 97,860 Covid cases in its highest single-day spike during the first wave in September last year and 4,12,624 cases were reported in May this year. “During the meeting experts have said that people behaviour will play an important role in the spread during third wave and there are chances that the highest spike could cross even 5 lakh,” he said. TOI also spoke to experts and they too said that Covid-appropriate behaviour is very essential in controlling the spread. However, they also added that the findings of sero-prevalence surveillance and vaccination has given positive signs as the population is headed towards herd immunity. Talking to TOI, public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences Dr Dewesh Kumar said, “The Covid-appropriate behaviour will surely play an important role in checking the spread of the virus and no one can deny the fact that we wouldn’t face a third wave because it is in the nature of virus to mutate. However, we cannot comment on the severity of the upcoming wave as people are developing herd immunity and the findings of the serosurveillance conducted across various districts have reflected that a major chunk of population has developed antibodies. If we continue to scale up our vaccination drive we will be able to immunise more and more population. Having said that those who haven’t been infected need to be careful as they can become super-spreaders after getting infected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/follow-norms-to-avert-severity-of-third-wave-health-dept/articleshow/83934205.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||BJP boycotts inaugural tribal council meet chaired by CM||Ranchi: Newly appointed members of the Tribes Advisory Council (TAC) from the BJP quota boycotted the maiden meeting of the council, chaired by chief minister Hemant Soren, here on Monday. Though the meeting convened virtually was more of a formality, it had political undertones as both ruling and opposition parties exchanged barbs. Chairing the meeting, Soren said the council’s rules were not framed even after 20 years of Jharkhand’s existence. “We not only framed the rules for the first time but also nominated the members so that the council, lying defunct since last one-and-half years, can start functioning in the interest of the tribal population of the state,” he said. He also asked the members to focus on giving education and employment opportunities to the tribal community and said Jharkhand can emerge as a leading state only when its 27% tribal population is given roles to prove themselves. The meeting was also addressed by the vice-chairman of the council, Champai Soren, who asked the members to keep their suggestions ready for the next meeting. “Even after 20 years of formation of Jharkhand as a separate state, aspirations of the tribal community remain unfulfilled and the council has a major role to play,” he said. Outside of the TAC meeting, both BJP and ruling JMM levelled allegations against each other. The former chief minister and BJP’s legislative party leader, Babulal Marandi, convened a press conference and claimed that the TAC was unconstitutional and incomplete. He accused the government of violating provisions of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution in constituting the TAC. Marandi and his party raised objections to the TAC Rules-2021 notified on June 5 as, under the new rules, the powers to nominate members of the council has now been vested with the chief minister, who is the ex-officio chairman of the council, instead of the governor. JMM’s central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the government had to make a decision because of the governor’s “non-cooperative” attitude. “We had sent a file for the nomination of members to the Raj Bhavan twice and when the file was returned, we had to frame the rules, authorizing the CM to make the nominations,” he said, explaining that in a similar move, the Raman Singh-led BJP government in Chhattisgarh had constituted the TAC after notifying new rules in 2012. “When that matter was challenged in court in the form of a PIL, the petition was rejected not only by the Raipur high court but also by the apex court of the country,” he said. Meanwhile, Marandi claimed said no woman and particularly from the Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) is not having any representation in the council. Responding to Marandi’s charge, Bhattacharya said JMM MLA Sita Soren is already a member and the CM may consider nominating a PVTG member against the only vacant position. According to the new rules, the TAC would be an 18-member body chaired by the CM, belonging to the tribal community, in which 15 members will be selected from among the MLAs from the Scheduled areas and three people, ideally experts of tribal affairs or from the intellectuals but belonging to the tribal community, would be nominated by the CM. The notification also clarifies that the quorum shall comprise a maximum of seven members to adopt any resolution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-boycotts-inaugural-tribal-council-meet-chaired-by-cm/articleshow/83933625.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Covid patients with travel history to be treated at government centres||RANCHI: With more than 50 cases of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 being detected across 12 states in the country, the state department for health, family welfare and medical education has decided to treat all Covid-19 patients with a history of travel to these states at Covid care centres. Talking to TOI, the officer on special duty to the state health department, Siddharth Tripathi, said: “People testing positive after travelling to any of the 12 states where Delta plus variant has been confirmed will be shifted directly to a Covid care centre for treatment. Any such patient will not be allowed home isolation and they will be under hospital care.” As per the Union health ministry, Maharashtra has reported the highest number of cases of Delta Plus variant (22) followed by Tamil Nadu (9), Madhya Pradesh (7), Kerala (3), Punjab and Gujarat (2 each), and one case each in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Karnataka. Apart from mandatory hospital admission, the state health department has also decided to ramp up surveillance for the detection of the new variant and has directed district authorities as well as railways and airports to intensify screening and testing of passengers coming from the affected states. A meeting in this regard was conducted on Friday wherein senior officials of the health department, district administration and railway officials worked out the modalities to ramp up screening at Hatia as well as Ranchi railway stations. Meanwhile, vigil has been increased at the Birsa Munda International airport, too, and people arriving from these 12 states have to undertake a Covid test and if they test positive they have to get shifted to a Covid-19 hospital. “We have directed all deputy commissioners and civil surgeons to consider all fresh cases as that of the Delta Plus variant,” said a senior health department official. With the Delta Plus variant being termed as a variant of concern (VOC) by the Union health ministry, the state health department has also set a target of sending 300 samples every fortnight for genome sequencing at the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) in Bhubaneswar. “We have directed all eight sentinel sites that conduct Covid-19 tests to send 15 samples each for genome sequencing every fortnight which will be 240 samples per month. Apart from that we will also send an additional 60 randomly selected samples for genome sequencing so that if there are patients infected with the mutated virus, we can track them at the earliest. In addition to this, samples of anyone who tests positive and has a travel history from states with the Delta Plus variant will also be sent for genome sequencing within 24 hours,” Tripathi said. On being asked when is Jharkhand going to start genome sequencing in the state as the process of sending samples to ILS is time-consuming, Tripathi said that the ICMR has approved their proposal for setting up a genome sequencing lab here and work in this regard will start soon. Critical care expert and Rims Trauma Centre head Dr Pradip Bhattacharya said: “Early detection and isolation followed by immediate treatment is the only way for preventing the spread of the Delta Plus variant. By early detection, I mean the screening of all those who are travelling from infected areas. Apart from that, strict contact tracing must be done in each detected case as the infectiousness of this variant is very high.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-patients-with-travel-history-to-be-treated-at-govt-centres/articleshow/83934339.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||Ranchi administration’s order prohibiting schools from hiking fees suspended||RANCHI: The Ranchi district administration has kept its order prohibiting schools from increasing fee and levying other charges in abeyance. The decision was taken after representatives of five schools from Sahodaya group of Ranchi met the deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan and pleaded that it would be difficult for them to run their schools if the order was implemented. Notably, the district administration had on Thursday issued an order stating that there would be no fee hike in schools in 2021-22 session. It further stated that schools should not take annual charges, transport fee and other levies till they remain closed. Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan said, “The matter has been referred to the department for its view. The order has been kept in abeyance till direction comes from the higher authorities.” The principal of Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Samarjit Jana, said, “During the meeting, the DC wanted assurance from the schools that they would not expel students or deprive them of online classes in case of non-payment of fees. We are already considering the cases of students facing economic hardship.” Jana said that schools, too, are under constraints due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that many schools have closed down while others are paying teachers half their salary. He added, “Last year, we managed without levying additional charges except tuition fees but it would not be possible to run the schools like that this year.” Among the principals in attendance were Manohar Lal of Gurunanak higher secondary school, M K Sinha of DAV Hehal, M K Sinha of DAV Kapildeo and Neeraj Sinha of Firayaal Public School. Jharkhand Parents Association (JPA) president Ajay Rai said, “The administration should have taken the decision after a detailed consideration. This step to keep the order under suspension would create confusion among parents. We are likely to hold a meeting on the issue soon.” Meanwhile ,JPA said that its members on Monday submitted a memorandum to the district authorities of Bokaro, Dhanbad, Jamshepdur, Giridih, Deoghar and Pakur demanding formation of district-level fee fixation committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-admins-order-prohibiting-schools-from-hiking-fees-suspended/articleshow/83934267.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Despite ban on gatherings, ministers, MLA flout norms||Ranchi: Different political leaders, mainly from the ruling parties, are violating the Covid appropriate behaviour blatantly and put many lives at risk by organising political gatherings despite a ban on such events. On Monday, Jamtara MLA and state Congress co-working president Irfan Ansari held a massive gathering at Kumapara village in Jamtara to conduct a membership drive. He claimed that hundreds of people of the village and nearby hamlets having affiliation with BJP joined Congress in his presence. During the event, dozens of villagers across different age groups assembled with total disregard to the Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing of masks and social distancing among others but the MLA was not reportedly trying to enforce the prescribed rules. Although he could not be contacted, he boasted about his achievement of making many join the party through his social media handle and posted pictures of the chock-a-block gatherings. In Lohardaga district, Congress president and finance minister Rameshwar Oraon attended a programme organised by the district administration to distribute benefits of welfare measures for Tana Bhagats and others. At least 200 people were seated in a hall in violation of social distancing norms. On Sunday, a similar violation of social distancing and wearing of masks was seen when JMM legislator and sports minister Hafizul Hassan visited Dahua village in his constituency, Madhupur, to provide compensation amounts to the kin of victims of an elephant attack. Opposition BJP has questioned the state government and the police for double standards in enforcing the Covid norms. BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “Such violations by members of the ruling party have been happening time and again but the entire administration turns a blind eye to them. However, it has slapped an FIR under the Epidemic Act against our party president (Deepak Prakash) for staging protests in the interest of farmers last week. The general public is also slapped with fines for any violation. This proves the political vendetta of the government and the actions of the ruling party MLAs/ministers speak volumes about how they feel about the laws.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/despite-ban-on-gatherings-ministers-mla-flout-norms/articleshow/83933502.cms||ASRP Mukesh

According to the discount plan, a total of 14 categories of goods have been listed across 25 commercial establishments in the city. The discount ranges from 1% to 25% for people who have taken their first dose while it almost doubles for people who have completed both doses of the vaccine. The financial component of the plan is fully borne by FJCCI and its members. An official release from the district administration said the discounts are applicable on home décor products, cosmetics, gifts, furniture, parlour and salon services, items of clothing, dress material, books and stationery items and electronic goods. Bicycles, dry cleaners as well as building construction materials have also been included in the list. A person will get a 1% discount on the purchase of construction material on getting the first shot and the discount will double if the person has taken the second dose. Similarly, the discount would range between 25% and 45% for electrical goods depending on whether the purchaser has taken only one dose or both doses. Talking to TOI, Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan said: “The discounts have been offered to encourage people to take the vaccine. This will also help the markets to revive by boosting footfall. I am very thankful to FJCCI for its support in this endeavour.” Ranjan further said: “I would appeal to everyone to come forward and get vaccinated at the earliest as it is an important step in the fight against the virus.” The residents of Ranchi welcomed the initiative of the administration. Kumar Abhishek, a Pundag resident, said: “I have taken both shots of the vaccine and had plans of buying furniture and now I will get a 40% discount on the purchase.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/enjoy-discounts-on-goods-after-taking-jabs-in-city/articleshow/83933425.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Singh played the key role in providing the emergency-use drug at a higher price to a patient under treatment for Covid-19 at a nursing home in city. Sinha is the staff member of a hospital from where he siphoned off the medicine to sell it in the black market. Additional director general of police Anil Palta, who is heading the probe, said, “This is the first chargesheet. The investigation is still going on and the SIT is focussing mainly on people who made profit out of the transaction.” Notably, SP (Ranchi rural) Naushad Alam, whose name also figured in the investigation, has been made a government witness. The SIT is of the view that Alam tried to help out a person who was desperate to save his infected family member admitted to a hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/remdesivir-black-marketing-case-sit-files-chargesheet/articleshow/83933594.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, the officer on special duty to state health department, Siddarth Tripathy, said, “We all have witnessed how devastating the second wave was and a big reason behind the spread was negligence by the citizens in maintaining the safety norms. So I urge all the citizens to continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour as we want to contain the spread during third wave.” The appeal comes after the Niti Aayog conducted a meeting with the health secretaries via video conferencing where the Union cabinet secretary directed the states to take measures to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour as experts have predicted that negligence will play a major role in the spread of virus during a third wave. Tripathy quoted the data provided during the meeting which stated that India had reported a total of 97,860 Covid cases in its highest single-day spike during the first wave in September last year and 4,12,624 cases were reported in May this year. “During the meeting experts have said that people behaviour will play an important role in the spread during third wave and there are chances that the highest spike could cross even 5 lakh,” he said. TOI also spoke to experts and they too said that Covid-appropriate behaviour is very essential in controlling the spread. However, they also added that the findings of sero-prevalence surveillance and vaccination has given positive signs as the population is headed towards herd immunity. Talking to TOI, public health expert and professor of community medicine at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences Dr Dewesh Kumar said, “The Covid-appropriate behaviour will surely play an important role in checking the spread of the virus and no one can deny the fact that we wouldn’t face a third wave because it is in the nature of virus to mutate. However, we cannot comment on the severity of the upcoming wave as people are developing herd immunity and the findings of the serosurveillance conducted across various districts have reflected that a major chunk of population has developed antibodies. If we continue to scale up our vaccination drive we will be able to immunise more and more population. Having said that those who haven’t been infected need to be careful as they can become super-spreaders after getting infected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/follow-norms-to-avert-severity-of-third-wave-health-dept/articleshow/83947229.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||India||India OKs vax for pregnant women, charts road ahead||PUNE: Medical experts have now suggested a host of measures to ensure safe Covid-19 vaccination of pregnant women, just days after the Centre said they can be given the shots. Experts, who for months have been saying pregnant women should be given Covid vaccines, said besides exclusive drives, officials should arrange for on-site consultations by gynaecologists, especially for those not registered for ante-natal (pre-delivery) care. They added that a registry of vaccinated pregnant women should be maintained for long-term follow-ups. “Pregnant women should be given priority at Covid vaccination sites. They should be assigned a day, or time of day, to ensure they don’t have to mix with the crowd,” said Sanjay Gupte, a Pune-based gynaecologist who has been at the forefront of the demand for inclusion of mothers-to-be in the country’s Covid vaccine drive. On June 25, the Centre revised an earlier policy to state that pregnant women should be vaccinated against Covid-19. “We should also have a separate registry — trimesterwise — for pregnant women who undergo vaccination, to facilitate follow-ups and data collection for future use,” said Gupte, who is also chairman (ethical committee) of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics — the organisation that brings together global professional societies of obstetricians and gynaecologists. Patients suffering from severe pregnancy induced hypertension called pre-eclampsia or immune suppression treatment should be offered vaccines only after their obstetricians’ consultation and permission, the experts said. “Besides this, women who are planning pregnancy — natural or through assisted methods — can take the vaccine and then attempt to get pregnant. Also, the vaccines do not affect fertility. Both husband and wife can take the same or different vaccines. It doesn’t matter,” said gynaecologist and infertility expert Sanjeev Khurd. Specialists said the lead Covid vaccines in India — Covishield and Covaxin — do not contain any live virus. There is no biological mechanism in them to cause Covid in the mother or unborn foetus. Therefore, there is no transmission during pregnancy or through breast milk, they said. “The decision will be useful for pregnant women with other comorbidities and those who are at high risk of exposure due to their work. Pregnant women account for about 5% of the population,” said gynaecologist Pankaj Sarode. Before the June 25 revision, the health ministry had said “women who are pregnant or not sure of their pregnancy should not receive Covid-19 vaccine. But later the ministry said pregnant women should also be vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/health-ministry-issues-guidelines-for-administering-covid-19-vaccines-to-pregnant-women/articleshow/83940842.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The division bench of the high court comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar also asked the government to ensure that “all the minutes of the expert committee meetings, reflecting the deliberations, observations and decisions, are made available in the public domain at the earliest”. Advocate general Devidas Pangam submitted that there can be no difficulty in placing the expert committee’s deliberations, observations, and recommendations in the public domain and submitted that, henceforth, the minutes of the expert committee meeting, which will reflect the deliberations, observations, and recommendations, will be posted on the state website. “This statement is both, accepted and appreciated. According to us, such transparency will go a long way to promote inclusivity and a transparent decision-making process on crucial issues which so vitally affect the members of the public,” the high court stated. Counsel Parag Rao representing one of the public interest petitioners pointed out to the court that the minutes of the state task force headed by the chief minister are already available on the fovernment website, but added that the minutes of the deliberations of the expert committee headed by dan GMC Dr S Bandekar are not posted on the website and, consequently, the same are not available in the public domain.

---||India||50% of Mumbai kids have antibodies||MUMBAI: The results of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's first paediatric sero-survey show over 50% of the children surveyed have antibodies to the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2, allaying fears that the probable third wave would disproportionately affect kids. BMC commissioner I S Chahal called the results, released on Monday, as "encouraging". The presence of antibodies in blood reveals a past infection and, more importantly, indicates the person has immunity against the same infection for some period of time. The paediatric survey was carried out by BMC-run Nair Hospital doctors, with 2,176 samples collected from the 24 civic wards in Mumbai. To get a picture from across socio-economic levels, 1,283 samples were taken from BMC-run Aapli Chikitsa Network and Nair Hospital that offer free tests, while 893 samples were taken from two private labs. The survey began on April 1, when the second Covid wave was peaking, and continued till June 15, said Nair Hospital's head of microbiology Dr Jayanthi Shastri. "There was fear that kids would be most vulnerable during the third wave as they would be the only section not vaccinated against Covid, prompting us to carry out a survey that would provide answers," she said. The survey results showed an overall sero-positivity of nearly 51.2% among kids. More kids from the economically weaker section (54.4%) had antibodies as compared to just over 47% from the relatively affluent sector. Sero-positivity was highest in the 10-14 age-group (53.4%) and lowest in the 1-to-4 age-group (51%). In the 10-14 age-group, more children who got their tests done in the public sector (58.3%) had antibodies than those in the private sector (46.8%). Incidentally, a recent sero-survey in Delhi too showed 59.3% children had previous exposure to the virus. When the pandemic began in 2019, it was believed that kids were immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, it was later established that kids get as infected by the virus as adults do, but they are largely asymptomatic. BMC commissioner Chahal told that more children had antibodies now than a few months ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/50-of-mumbai-kids-have-antibodies/articleshow/83940921.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Chennai||It’s an irony that more people want to take jab but we don’t have stock: Tamil Nadu minister||CHENNAI: Several vaccination centres in Chennai and other parts of the state were closed on Monday as there was no vaccine stock, health minister Ma Subramanian said. Though the state received two lakh additional doses in the evening, officials said many vaccine centres may not operate on Tuesday too. Of the1.44 crore doses of vaccines received, the state had used1.41 crore doses, the minister said after inauguration of a special vaccine camp at the Madras high court organised by Bar Council of TN and Puducherry. “It is an irony that people in Tamil Nadu, including members from the tribal population, are ready to take the vaccine but we can’t administer the jab as we don’t have the stock,” he said. At 8am on Monday, the state had a stock of 2.07 lakh doses. By afternoon, many centres turned away people as stocks were exhausted. The immunisation wing at the directorate of public health dispersed the doses it received in the evening across the state. By 8pm, the state vaccinated1.51 lakh people. Between January and February, the state was vaccinating 10,650 people every day. This rose to around 83,000 in March. In the next two months, between 94,000 and 99,000 people took the vaccine every day. The average number of vaccinations rose to 1.9 lakh a day in June. “Last week, we did up to 4.3 lakh vaccinations in a day. We have the capacity to do more, but we don’t have the stock,” Subramanian said. The state is expected to receive 72 lakh doses in July. “We are now doing focused vaccination of tribal people, sportspersons, people with disabilities and at tourists spots,” he said. More vaccinations than doses received in June: The state was allotted nearly 48 lakh doses in June but government vaccine centres offered 52.17 lakh doses. “The number of vaccinations were higher than the doses received because we used some doses left over from May. But more importantly, nurses drew 12 doses from a vial instead of just 10,” said joint director immunisation Dr K Vinay Kumar. Each vial of the vaccine contains five or ten doses but manufacturers always pack an additional 1ml. “Our nurses have learned to make use of that too. With this, our wastage also came down,” he said. Some districts have low coverage: Across the state, 6.06 crore people above the age of 18 years are eligible for vaccination and the target is 12.12 crore doses. Of the 45 health units, the Nilgiris has completed 23% of its dosage target and Chennai 22%, followed by Virudhunagar (17%) and Coimbatore (16%). But at least15 health units have fewer than 9% coverage of dosage targets. Overall, until Sunday, the state had completed 12% of the dosage target. On an average, 4% of the eligible population are fully vaccinated across the state. Even here there is a wide difference in coverage between districts. While 11% of Chennai’s population is fully vaccinated, 30 health units have less than 3% of its population that is fully vaccinated. Stalin urges Centre to cut vax allotted to private sector due to low usageTamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin has written to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan urging him to reduce vaccine allocation for July to the private sector from 25% to10% due to low usage by them. In a three-page letter, Stalin said 25% allocation was high compared to the vaccinations done by the sector. In Tamil Nadu, 1.43 crore doses have been administered, of which private hospitals account for only 6.5 lakh doses (4.5%). In June, of the 43.5 lakh doses administered in the state, private institutions have used only 4.5 lakh doses (10%), he said. “The disparity between demand and supply in government and private institutions has resulted in private hospitals having around 7-8 lakh doses in stock, which is equal to do a month’s need for them, while government institutions are left with just two lakh doses, which is less than their current singleday usage,” he said. “This can be rectified by rational performancebased distribution of available doses,” he added. Stalin suggested that the Union government increase vaccine procurement price to ensure that manufacturers are not distressed over the reduction in quota to the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/its-an-irony-that-more-people-want-to-take-jab-but-we-dont-have-stock-tamil-nadu-minister/articleshow/83940960.cms||---

India began its vaccination drive on January 16, more than a month after the US did on December 14, 2020. Over 48 lakh doses were given on Monday till 7pm. Reacting to the data shared by the health ministry, PM Narendra Modi took to Twitter to say, “India’s vaccination drive keeps gaining momentum. Congrats to all those who are driving this effort. Our commitment remains vaccines for all, free for all.” Citing vaccination data for India and other countries till 7pm on Monday, the Centre said India had administered 32.8 crore doses followed by the US at 32.3 crore, Brazil at 9.7 crore, the UK at 7.7 crore and Germany at 7.1 crore. While the coverage in terms of percentage of population is low for India, given its population size, with only 4% fully vaccinated, the numbers are better in absolute terms. India has 5.5 crore people fully vaccinated behind US’s 15.3 crore. At third place is the UK with 3.2 crore. In terms of vaccines administered per 100 people, India is at 23.1, with the US at 96.7. However, on daily doses being administered per 100 people, India is at 0.45 to the UK’s 0.52 and the US’s 0.23 as on June 27. China and Germany top the table at 1.55 and 0.93 respectively, according to the website ourworldindata. Health minister Harsh Vardhan said that of the 32.36 crore doses given till Monday 8am, one crore healthcare workers took the first dose and 72 lakh got their second shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-overtakes-us-in-total-jabs-given-now-world-no-2/articleshow/83940965.cms||---

On Monday, the administration decided to send samples of all these 10 patients to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for a “parallel study”. Last week, Neeri had sent the eight samples to Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, to look for possible mutations. All the 10 family members have been admitted in Umred Covid Care Centre (CCC). While no new guideline has been notified for their mandatory institutional quarantine, the admissions haven’t been shown on record by civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar. The civil surgeon didn’t respond to TOI calls in this regard. Neeri was yet to receive the two new samples while IGGMCH officials said they don’t have details of all samples. Last year in November-December, the NIV was unable to process all samples sent by IGGMCH suspecting UK strain. Dr Sharmila Raut, incharge of IGGMCH VRDL, referred queries to Dr Paturkar. District collector Ravindra Thakare confirmed to TOI that two more persons from the same group of Umred have tested positive. “Results of eight samples given earlier to Neeri are awaited. We would be sending all 10 samples to NIV, Pune, in the next couple of days,” he said. “Whoever processes the samples faster will be the first to deliver results. It will be a parallel study,” said Thakre. Thakre said first two persons had tested positive on June 18. “Subsequently, in high-risk contact tracing, six more persons were found positive. Two more were found positive between last Friday and Monday. All of them shall have to stay in institutional quarantine for 14 days. Based on their latest RTPCR results and genome sequencing result, we would take a call on their discharge,” he said. Asked why they were compulsorily asked to stay in CCC, the collector said, “We got worried due to looming threat of Delta Plus variant and an entire family suddenly turning positive.” District health officials said the family is mild symptomatic and doing well. They said the 10 patients from the two families related to each other stay in adjacent homes. Around 42 high-risk close contacts from their area tested negative. The 10 patients include a Mumbai-returned woman who was the first to test positive after which her parents, cousins, uncle and aunt also got infected, they said. Some of them have been vaccinated. CSIR-Neeri is part of Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) on SARS-Cov2 genome sequencing. As per the government of India project, the Neeri lab had already found double mutant B.1.617 (including B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 ) as ‘dominant variant’ in the samples investigated for the Nagpur region. The study led by Neeri’s Dr Krishna Khairnar on samples from RPTS swab collection centre from November 2020 to May 2021 was done in collaboration with CSIR-CCMB Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-more-ve-in-umred-chain-niv-too-to-conduct-genomic-study/articleshow/83934595.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||No Covishield jabs at govt centres in dist for next 2 days||Nagpur: The Covid vaccination drive in the division picked up on Monday but only to wind up early at several centres which ran out of doses again for the third time in the last four days. Shortage of doses and no timely replenishment by the state government will bring the drive to a grind halt at all goverenment centres on Tuesday. Officials said drive may not resume in rural parts even on Wednesday. Civic officials are hoping they might receive fresh stock of Covishield doses by Tuesday night so that the drive can resume the next morning. The divison’s had recorded 1.05lakh vaccinations on June 23 following resumption of inoculation for 18 to 44 age group. This led to the division and district consuming all of its available stock in a single day. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the city has capacity to administer 25,000 to 30,000 doses per day. “Whatever stock we receive gets consumed almost the same day. Hence, we are falling short of doses frequently,” he said. The NMC centres and nine private hospitals achievd 22,365 vaccinations on Monday. These include nearly 2,000 in private centres. As the doses won’t be available, the NMC announced that none of its centres would be open for any age group beneficiaries for Covishield doses. However, only 45+ age group would get Covaxin doses at a couple of government centres through NMC. The civic body would also offer only Covaxin second dose to 18 to 44 age group at some centres. Depending on their stock, citizens planning inoculation will have the option of private centres where the charges are Rs780, Rs1,145 and Rs1410 for Covishield, Sputnik V and Covaxin, respectively. Zilla Parishand CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said the district had received 24,000 doses. “Around 14,000 were utilized in the rural parts on Monday. We are waiting for the fresh stock now,” he said. On Monday, the division’s tally reached 92,962 vaccinations while Nagpur district recorded 34,336 jabs. Doctors from private hospitals expressed their displeasure at the government’s failure to ensure smooth supply of vaccines. Earlier, the citizens had been greatly benefitted when more number of private hospitals were available. Though a large number of government vaccination centres are available across the district, some citizens have avoided them citing ease and hygiene issues. HALT AGAIN * None of the age groups would get Covishield doses at any govt or NMC centres on Tuesday * Only 45+ age group would get Covaxin at GMCH, Khobragade Sabhagruh at Siddharth Nagar, Ambedkar Hospital at Indora, and Mahal Diagnostic Centre * 18 to 44 age group to get only second dose of Covaxin at GMCH and Mahal centre * Paid vaccination at 9 private hospitals available as per their stock size||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-covishield-jabs-at-govt-centres-in-dist-for-next-2-days/articleshow/83934706.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Making the announcement while inaugurating a plant manufacturing injection for black fungus at Jabalpur, virtually from Bhopal, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said our priority will be to make affordable but high quality medicines for critical diseases as per international standards. Chouhan said It is a matter of joy, satisfaction and pride for the state to start production of Amphoreva-B by Reva Cure Life Sciences Company in Jabalpur in such a short time for the treatment of black fungus. Chief minister Chouhan said that the state government is contemplating to formulate a policy to help poor and middle class families in serious diseases that can be financially disastrous like cancer and lung kidney-liver transplant. He said that the production of this injection to combat black fungus is an important step towards making the state self-reliant. Adding the word Reva to the name of Reva Cure Sciences Company symbolizes the company’s proximity to its roots. This unit is the only pharma company in Madhya Pradesh to manufacture anti-cancer injections. Production of advanced nanotechnology based injections and the company being certified by WHO and European GMP is a matter of pride for the state. He congratulated the founders of Reva Cure for this achievement. Chouhan said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the mantra to build Aatmanirbhar Bharat. A roadmap has been developed for the development of Aatmanirbhar Madhya Pradesh in this direction. This roadmap includes strengthening of health infrastructure.

Over 18,000 vehicles per day entered the state in the past two weeks and a majority people entering the state were not adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour. In last two weeks, police have challenged over 3,600 people for not wearing masks and collected over Rs 20 lakh in fine from them. From the state, 1,113 samples were sent to the National Centre for Disease Control Delhi for testing the variant of concern among the Covid positive cases in the state and according to the reports received 76 samples have tested positive for Delta strain, but no sample has been tested positive for Delta plus strain. Besides, 109 samples have shown presence of UK strains while eight samples have tested positive for Kappa strain. According to the police officials, a total of 2,57,179 vehicles have entered Himachal Pradesh in the last two weeks, since the Covid curfew has been lifted on June 14. Of these, 1,31,216 vehicles entered between June 13 to June 20 and 1,25,963 vehicles entered between June 20 to June 27. In the same period, four challans were issued and Rs 15,000 realised as fine for violation of marriage permits issued during the Covid-19 pandemic. Fine of Rs 17,000 was also realized for MV Act violation. Rs 3,500 were realised as fine for driving without masks. However, the total fine realised for mask violations during the period was Rs 20.05 lakh with 3,620 challans. According to the health officials, people are required to follow strict Covid appropriate behaviour to prevent and mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic.

---||Nagpur||Hospitals opted for first paid jab not available for 2nd||Nagpur: Many beneficiaries aged 45 and above who had taken their first Covishield doses at their preferred hospitals by paying a modest Rs250 in April first week are now finding themselves in a fix. Now, as their second dose is due after 12 weeks, the situation has changed more than merely the pricing of the dose of their choice. The hospitals where they got their first doses are not available now. Till April end, 28 big hospitals were vaccinating but a change in policy brought paid inoculation at these centres to a halt from May first week. The city now has seven new entrants offering jabs at Rs780, Rs1,410 and Rs1,145 for each dose of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V, respectively. Surprisingly, even as established hospitals are struggling to get fresh stock, some relatively new clinics and hospitals are getting Covaxin (many’s preferred vaccine nowadays), or Sputnik V and Covishield doses. A couple of beneficiaries told TOI that they were quite surprised to know that their preferred hospital won't be able to give them the second dose anytime soon. As on date, 6.36 vaccinations have taken place in the 45+ age group. Of these, approximately 2.16 lakh beneficiaries had taken their first Covidshield dose in April first week, making them eligible for second shot now. Alexis Hospital director (administration) Dr Tushar Gawad said, “In line with the earlier policy, state government should have supplied vaccines to the private hospitals for vaccination of the general public. This would have ensured equitable distribution of vaccines and people would have been in a position to get the vaccines at the hospitals of their choice.” Gawad added, “However, with the change in procurement policy, only 25% of the vaccine vials are now available for direct purchase from manufacturers by private hospitals. The lion’s share of this 25% quota is being cornered by big hospital chains, as a result of which standalone private hospitals are struggling to get their supply,” he said. Vidarbha Hospitals Association convenor Dr Anup Marar said that earlier, private hospitals procured vaccines from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and charged a fixed Rs250 per dose. “Thus, most of the 45+ beneficiaries had taken their first dose in their preferred nearest hospitals. Now, when their second dose is due, vaccine is not available in the same hospitals,” he said. Dr Marar also pointed out the endless wait for stock procurement. “The new GR stipulated a portal to private hospitals for procuring vaccines through the National Health Authority website. It is 3 weeks and the payment pathway is yet to open,” he said. “The manufacturers say that they are following government directions and releasing vaccines to earmarked hospitals,” he added. Dr Marar also highlighted the alleged bias in vaccine supply. “It is an irony that experienced hospitals are struggling to get vials, while some select clinics and hospitals are surprisingly able to obtain Covaxin, Sputnik V or Covishield vaccines,” he said. Marar added, “It was expected that guidelines as per the new GR will lead to transparency and proportionate distribution equitably across geographical locations for the ease of beneficiaries. Unfortunately, it is yet to materialize.” FACTS & FIGURES 6.36 lakh | Total vaccinations in 45+ age group 2.16 lakh* | First Covishield dose for 45+ in April first week at private and government centres, second dose due now 28+ | Pvt hospitals gave first dose to 45+ age group in April 24,690 | Total second dose from all age group between June 19-25 (*Approximate number)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hospitals-opted-for-first-paid-jab-not-available-for-2nd/articleshow/83934776.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||Kalpana Saroj Aviation gets one acre land in Mihan, plans Rs4,000 crore project||Nagpur: Kalpana Saroj Aviation (KSA) has been allotted an acre of land in Mihan-SEZ, though the future plans announced envisage a Rs4,000 crore investment. The company is promoted by woman entrepreneur and Padmashri awardee Kalpana Saroj, also known for her journey from living in a slum in Mumbai to becoming a millionaire. She is known as the original slumdog millionaire. Deepak Kapoor, vice-chairman-cum-managing director (VC-MD) of Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC), tweeted on Monday, “Big news for Mihan. Today we allotted land to another big company - Kalpana Saroj Aviation a group company of Kamani Tubes. Their focus on aircraft engine repairs and training, Mihan blooms.” MADC is the state government company developing the Mihan-SEZ and rest of the area. A KSA consultant overseeing the project spoke of many ambitious plans for Nagpur in the subsequent phases, involving investment of Rs 4,000 crore in all. “We will be starting with an engine bay where aircraft engines can be repaired and maintained. This will entail investment of Rs10 crore and create around 50 to 60 jobs, including indirect jobs. The project is expected to be operational by the year’s end,” said Captain Praveen Nikhade, who identified himself as a consultant for the company. However, a MIHAN official, citing the application put up by the company, said there will be investment to the tune of Rs7.5 crore and 25 jobs. Nikhade, who is from Chandrapur, said the ultimate plan is to come up with a major aviation complex in Nagpur. The group is already in advanced talks with an American company and would be soon forging a joint venture with it. This will enable the maintenance of CJ-130 Hercules transport aircraft flown by the Indian Air Force (IAF). The Hercules, which has been purchased from the US, currently has to be sent there for maintenance. Once the facility comes up in Nagpur, the maintenance can be done domestically, said Nikhade. The same maintenance repair and overhaul depot (MRO) will also cater to civilian aircraft. It is expected to be operational by next year, he said. There are plans to revive the flying club and also run a course granting a BSc degree in civil aviation through the Nagpur university. Finally, there are plans to run a non-scheduled airline service by deploying 10-seater planes at Nagpur. The service available on charter basis will help connect smaller centres throughout the country, he claimed. Kalpana Saroj, who started from a humble background came into the limelight after she took over Kamani Group, a company that was going into liquidation and restructured it back to profit. She also has her roots in Vidarbha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/kalpana-saroj-aviation-gets-one-acre-land-in-mihan-plans-rs4000-crore-project/articleshow/83934777.cms||Shishir Arya

Instead it will again be carried out on July 1. It will not be carried out on June 29 as it is Tuesday and universal vaccination is done on Tuesdays and Fridays. On Monday also which was the fifth day of mega vaccination drive, vaccination was carried out only in 26 districts of Madhya Prades. In the remaining districts, few covaxin doses that were available with the government were provided. It is not only on June 30, but on July 3 also drive for administering only second dose of covaxin will be carried out. Sources said that there are around 3 lakh people who have received the first dose of covaxin around a month ago and they are now eligible for getting the second dose of vaccine. As of now, no or meagre covishield doses are available with the government. On Tuesday, around 3.5 lakh doses are available and by Wednesday it is expected that there will be more than 9.5 lakh doses of the vaccine, said sources. Technically, the vaccination drive will only be carried out for one day in this week, ie, on July 1, as it would not be carried out on June 30, on June 28 also it was carried out only in half of the districts of the state and on June 29, it is Tuesday, similarly on July 2 it is Friday and vaccination for covid-19 is not done then. When contacted, commissioner health Akash Tripathi said, “Vaccination drive will now be carried out on July 1, instead of July 30, so that more and more people are covered. On July 3, we will be carrying out a drive for administering second dose of covaxin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/vaccine-shortage-to-halt-madhya-pradeshs-mega-drive-for-two-days/articleshow/83941019.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||India||With nod for vaccine in pregnancy, crores of families will breathe easy||Last Friday, India finally allowed Covid vaccines for pregnant women. After firmly refusing to vaccinate them for months, the government swung to the opposite view that they “can and should” be vaccinated. “Vaccination is useful for them and should be given,” ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava said. This makes India only the 18th country to “recommend” vaccines for all pregnant women. There are 28 other countries that “permit” Covid vaccines in pregnancy, but without overt encouragement. Another 46 countries either permit with restrictions, or deny with exceptions, data from COMIT (Covid-19 Maternal Immunization Tracker), developed by the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics and the Johns Hopkins Center for Immunization Research, shows. Covid big risk in pregnancyThe new policy will comfort crores of women who will conceive between now and the end of the pandemic. Every year, about 2.5 crore children are born in India. So, a few crore pregnant women and their families have already grappled with anxiety, disease and death through two large Covid waves since March 2020. Studies done in this period have shown that Covid is riskier for pregnant women than for most other people. The World Health Organization (WHO) says pregnant women over the age of 35 who are obese, or have diabetes or hypertension “are at particular risk of serious outcomes from Covid-19.” The UK’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) says, “Women with Covid-19 in late pregnancy are two to three times more likely to give birth prematurely, which can affect their baby’s long-term health.” Data analysed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last year also showed that, “Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women were more frequently admitted to an ICU, received invasive ventilation and ECMO.” Altogether, there was a “70% increased risk for death associated with pregnancy.” Delay due to lack of dataThere was never any doubt about the need to vaccinate pregnant women but the hesitancy arose from a lack of safety data. Pregnant women were not included in vaccine trials last year, so there were unanswered questions about the possibility of “miscarriage, low birth weight, preterm births, stillbirths and congenital anomalies,” a statement from the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) says. For India, the decision would have been harder as only one of its three vaccines – Covishield – is WHO-approved, and just two other countries – Canada and Mexico – ‘recommend’ it, while Austria, Iceland and Croatia ‘permit’ it in pregnancy. So, data for its safety and efficacy in pregnancy is sparse relative to data for mRNA vaccines used in the US and elsewhere. As the UK’s RCOG says, “There are no reported concerns with the Astra-Zeneca vaccine (Covishield) in pregnancy, but there is less experience in pregnancy with this vaccine than with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.” But it reassuringly adds: “Studies of the vaccines in animals to look at the effects on pregnancy have shown no evidence that the vaccine causes harm to the pregnancy or to fertility.” Covishield in other countriesAltogether 35 countries offer Covishield to pregnant women, most of them with restrictions. Pregnancy is known to increase the risk of blood clots, and so do ‘viral vector’ vaccines like Covishield. This is one of the reasons some countries avoid giving it to pregnant women. However, RCOG says the two types of clots are not related. “Someone is not necessarily at higher risk of this serious side effect just because they have a higher risk of other blood clots.” That should allay any doubts expectant mothers have about taking Covishield. What about Sputnik, Covaxin?Sputnik V is also a viral vector vaccine and is available to pregnant women in four countries, of which only Mexico recommends it. Argentina and Honduras allow it with conditions, and Pakistan’s position is not clear. Covaxin is available to pregnant women only in India. It is made with the killed virus, and because vaccines of this type are known to be safe in pregnancy, one of the points made at the May 28 meeting of India’s vaccine advisory group NTAGI was: “Since killed vaccines have an established safety profile in pregnant women, Covaxin/ killed vaccines may be the first choice in pregnant women.” However, on Friday, a government announcement made no such distinction between Covishield and Covaxin for pregnant women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-nod-for-vaccine-in-pregnancy-crores-of-families-will-breathe-easy/articleshow/83941021.cms||Abhilash Gaur
