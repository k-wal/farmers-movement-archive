---||World||Thousands of Indian students have secured visa appointments for July, August: US Embassy||NEW DELHI: Thousands of Indian students have secured visa appointments for July and August since Monday, the US Embassy here said on Tuesday. A senior American diplomat had said on Sunday that the US mission in India is "actively working" to accommodate as many student visa applicants as possible in July and August, and facilitating their legitimate travel remained a top priority for it. "Since June 14, thousands of students have secured visa appointments for July and August. Thousands of appointments remain available and we will open thousands more in coming weeks," the American Embassy said in a tweet. "We appreciate your patience as we diligently work to resolve the technical issues you have encountered," it said. Don Heflin, the Minister Counselor for Consular Affairs at the US embassy, had also said earlier that the US-bound students will not require any proof of Covid-19 vaccination to enter the country. They will need a negative report of their Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to their departure. There has been growing anxiety among a sizeable number of Indian students aspiring to fly to the US for higher studies in view of certain restrictions in getting visa appointments due to the coronavirus pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/thousands-of-indian-students-have-secured-visa-appointments-for-july-august-us-embassy/articleshow/83554911.cms||---

Police sources said that the drone was found abandoned in Garota area on the outskirts of Jammu by locals and cops rushed to the spot and seized the object immediately. A senior police official said that after investigation it came to the fore that the drone belonged to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). “The device would be handed over to the authorities concerned,” he added. Over the past two years, the Border Security Force (BSF) and the police have recovered large quantities of arms and ammunition, including sticky bombs, dropped into the Indian side by Pakistani drones. On May 16 a suspected Pakistani drone was seen hovering along the international border (IB) in Kanachak sector during night time, prompting security forces to launch a massive search operation in a vast area between Panch Talli and Laliyal to check if it had dropped anything inside the Indian territory. On May 14, BSF recovered an AK-47 rifle, a pistol and some ammunition dropped by a Pakistani drone in the border belt of Samba district. Several similar incidents in which arms and ammunition were dropped by Pakistan drones have been reported earlier from areas falling along the IB in Samba, Kathua and Jammu districts. BSF had also recovered bombs dropped by a drone along the IB in Samba sector on February 14, putting security agencies on high alert. The drone-dropped consignment had six pistols and 14 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) with inbuilt magnets, which could be used as sticky bombs. On September 22, 2020, an arms consignment including 2 packets containing two AK assault rifles, three magazines with 90 rounds and a pistol with two magazines and 14 rounds dropped by a drone operated by Pakistan-based terrorists was seized in Akhnoor sector of Jammu district. The consignment was seized in a joint operation by the police and the special forces of the Army at an aerial distance of 13 km from the border. Earlier on July 3, 2019, a drone was seen hovering over the Kishtwar district jail, which later crashed and was taken into custody by the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drone-found-abandoned-in-jammu-outskirts/articleshow/83555077.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||5 polio vaccinators killed in Afghanistan, police blame Taliban||ISLAMABAD: Unidentified gunmen on Tuesday shot dead at least five polio vaccinators and injured several others in separate attacks in Afghanistan’s eastern province of Nangarhar, bordering Pakistan’s volatile tribal districts. The targeted attacks took place in the city of Jalalabad, the provincial capital, and the nearby districts of Khogyani and Surkhrud. Authorities said the early morning violence occurred on the second day of a four-day national campaign to administer polio drops to children under five years of age. Jan Mohammad, the head of the provincial immunisation department, said the administration decided to suspend the vaccination campaign in the province following the deadly attacks. Provincial police spokesperson Farid Khan blamed Taliban for the killings. "This is the work of the Taliban, targeting health workers to deprive people of polio vaccines," Khan said. Taliban, which is opposed to the vaccination drive in the country, denied it had carried out the attacks. Islamic State had previously claimed responsibility for attacks on health workers in the country. In March this year, IS owned up to killing three women who were part of a polio vaccination team in Jalalabad. The terror outfit's regional affiliate, known as IS Khorasan, has bases in Nangarhar and adjoining Afghan provinces. Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries in the world where poliovirus remains endemic. Nigeria was declared free of the wild virus last year. About three million children were deprived of polio vaccination in the past three years in Afghanistan, according to the country’s health ministry. So far this year, there have been about two dozen polio cases in the country, the ministry said. In 2020, Afghanistan reported 54 cases of polio. Though not unusual in Afghanistan, Pakistani armed groups also regularly stage attacks on polio teams and police contingents escorting them, with the majority of clerics in the country claiming that anti-polio drive is part of a western conspiracy to sterilise children and gather intelligence. These attacks increased after it was revealed that a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign was used as a ploy by the CIA in the hunt for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was killed by US commandos in 2011 in Pakistan. Last week, two policemen escorting polio vaccinators were shot dead in Pakistan’s northwest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/5-polio-vaccinators-killed-in-afghanistan-police-blame-taliban/articleshow/83555109.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||MHA unit busts phone fraud racket, arrests 8||NEW DELHI: A pan-India ‘fraud to phone’ racket has been busted by a home ministry unit in joint operations with the Madhya Pradesh police and other state forces, leading to the arrest of eight people — across Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh — who cheated people through cyber fraud and used the money to buy expensive China-made phones from e-commerce sites. The phones were then sold in the black market at a 5-10% discount but at a huge profit for the crooks. The ‘fraud to phone’ (F2P) gang involved hundreds of operatives who were running different legs of the transactions involving OTP fraud, credit card fraud, e-commerce fraud, fake IDs, fake mobile numbers, fake addresses, black marketing, tax evasion, money laundering and dealing with stolen goods. The 8 arrested had defrauded their victims of around Rs 20 crore. As part of the probe that started with the reporting of a Rs 6.5 lakh cyber fraud on June 11 to Cybersafe, an app created by FCORD and operational since August 2019, by a 78-year-old Udaipur resident, eight 8 ‘fraud to phone’ (F2P) gang masterminds (4 in Jharkhand, two each in MP and Jharkhand) have been arrested and nearly 300 new mobile phones bought from stolen funds seized. Further, 900 cell phones, 1000 bank accounts and hundreds of UPI and e-commerce IDs of this gang were identified and are under investigation, while nearly 100 bank accounts and debit/credit cards were frozen. The operation against the F2P gang has expanded to 18 States and 350 persons now and is ongoing. The accused are being questioned about the reasons for preference of China-made phones, especially those made by Xiaomi. Sources told TOI that the key arrested accused in the case, 28-year-old Hukum Singh Bisen from Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh, is an M Tech in Digital Communication and works for a private telecom company that executes contracts for Railways. An IAS aspirant, he created 16 Whatsapp groups with 156 members, each of which had accounts with ecommerce websites like Flipkart and Amazon. “These were used to siphon defrauded funds to buy mobile phones,” said an investigator. Tracking via CyberSafe app revealed that Rs 6.5 lakh funds siphoned from the complainant in Udaipur by an F2P gang member calling from Jharkhand, was directly credited to 3 SBI cards, which were used to buy 33 expensive China-made Xiaomi POCO M3 mobile phones from Flipkart. Within minutes the addresses where these were delivered in Balaghat (MP) were identified and SP Balaghat informed. MP police detained the mastermind Hukum Singh and all 33 new phones and 70 other phones were seized from him. The F2P gang bought these phones for about Rs 10,000 each and sold them in the black market for 5-10% discount. Jharkhand police have arrested the F2P caller. CyberSafe links more than 3,000 law enforcement authorities (LEAs), including police stations, in 19 States/UTs with 18 fintech entities online and in real-time. As soon as a victim informs the police, the information is entered on CyberSafe and in real time, fund flows are identified and communicated. Till now 65,000 phone frauds have been reported on this app and 55,000 phone numbers and several thousand bank accounts of fraudsters identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mha-unit-busts-phone-fraud-racket-arrests-8/articleshow/83555243.cms||Bharti Jain
---||World||New York lifts more Covid-19 rules as it hits vaccination mark||Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that 70% of adults in New York have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a threshold he said the state would celebrate by easing many of its remaining social distancing rules and shooting off fireworks.  "What does 70% mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it," Cuomo told an invitation-only crowd at the World Trade Center in Manhattan.  Effective immediately, he said, the state is lifting rules that had limited the size of gatherings and required some types of businesses to follow cleaning protocols or take people's temperatures or screen them for recent Covid-19 symptoms.  Businesses will no longer have to follow social distancing rules, or limit how many people they can allow inside based on keeping people 6 feet (2 meters) apart.  Some rules will remain: New Yorkers, for now, will continue to have to wear masks in schools, subways, large venues, homeless shelters, hospitals, nursing homes, jails and prisons.  Cuomo, a Democrat, said there would be fireworks displays around the state Tuesday. He said in previous days that the fireworks would commemorate the 70% threshold, but said Tuesday the fireworks are to honor essential workers.  It's unclear how many more people have to get vaccinated to reach herd immunity, which is when enough people have immunity that the virus has trouble spreading.  It's unclear what that threshold is for the coronavirus, though many experts say it's 70% or higher. Just half of all 20 million residents in New York are fully vaccinated, according to federal data as of Monday. About 58% of residents of all ages have at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  Over the past seven days, New York has been averaging around 450 new coronavirus cases a day, the lowest level since the pandemic began.  Vaccination rates are particularly low in parts of the state that were hit hard by the winter Covid-19 surge, including parts of New York City and rural counties in western and central New York.  About 30% of the population is vaccinated in Allegany County, compared with 37% in nearby Wyoming County.  In New York City, 38% and 40.6% of residents are fully vaccinated in the Bronx and Brooklyn, respectively. That contrasts with 58% of Manhattan residents and 51% in Queens.  Also Tuesday, health officials announced that nearly 900 people received expired Covid-19 vaccine doses at a vaccination site in Times Square earlier this month. The 899 people who received doses of the Pfizer vaccine at the former NFL Experience building in Times Square between June 5 and June 10 should schedule another Pfizer shot as soon as possible, the New York City Health Department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-york-lifts-more-covid-19-rules-as-it-hits-vaccination-mark/articleshow/83556034.cms||---

With this, Twitter becomes the only American platform to have lost the protective shield – granted under Section 79 of the IT Act, even though others such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram remain protected, official sources said. “The company had been given extra time to comply with the guidelines, but it has failed to fall in line with the new IT Rules despite our repeated indulgence, including an extension. With this, Twitter has lost its safe harbour protection, and now stands exposed to action under the IPC for any third-party unlawful content,” a government source told TOI. Read AlsoTwitter appoints interim chief compliance officer, says will make efforts to comply with new IT normsSocial media giant Twitter on Tuesday said that it has appointed interim chief compliance officer in India. In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson informed that an interim chief compliance officer has been retained it will share all details of the appointment with the IT ministry soon.Companies had to originally appoint the officers by May 25, but many were delayed as they blamed the Coronavirus-induced lockdown and closures, and other technical challenges for their failure to comply with the rules. Twitter had made certain appointments initially, but these were summarily rejected by the government as they were external legal consultants or people not directly employed on the rolls of the company’s US parent. When contacted, a spokesperson for Twitter in India told TOI that it has appointed an “interim” chief compliance officer, adding that details had still not been shared with the IT ministry and this would happen “soon”. “We are keeping the IT Ministry apprised of the progress at every step of the process. An interim chief compliance officer has been retained and details will be shared with the Ministry directly soon. Twitter continues to make every effort to comply with the new Guidelines,” the spokesperson said. The Ministry said, however, that it is yet to receive any details from the company. “We have not got any details from Twitter,” a source said. The government clearly looks unhappy at the steps initiated by the company, especially as it believes that repeated reminders and even the temporary relaxation – which was extended as a “goodwill gesture” -- did not yield much result. The government had on June 5 issued “one last notice” to Twitter, asking it to comply with the statutory provisions under the new IT Rules or else risk losing legal immunity from any third-party content posted on the platform. The company had then assured the government that it would make the appointment in a week, though the government still awaits an intimation in this regard. Even the latest deadline has now been missed.

While most gyms in Gurgaon are still planning their reopening, a few opened on the first day. Few gyms reopen in Gurgaon, others plan to reopen soonAmong the few gyms that reopened on Monday was Fab Fit Gym. Urmimala Baruah, a personal trainer from the gym, shares, “The gym has reopened after a long time. Though people will take time to return, we know our customers will eventually come back. The last time when unlock happened, it took a while for our business to pick up and as it was getting back to normal, the second wave hit us. We have incurred losses but are hoping people will come back.” Anubhav Rai, Founder BOMISO Gym, shares, “We have come with a new concept. It is an outdoor training concept with equipment, and we have been getting queries from our members about the reopening. We will reopen on Wednesday since we are getting sanitisation and deep cleaning services done in our gym before reopening.” Gurgaon's gym owners are getting sanitisation and deep cleaning services done before reopening (Location courtsey: Bomiso Gym and Fab Fit Gym)‘Unsure about going to gyms’While gym owners are expecting their clients to return, gym enthusiasts stand divided.

---||Business||Rising prices of pulses, edible oils sear household budgets||NEW DELHI: Household budgets have been hit hard by a sharp increase in prices of edible oil and pulses for the past few months due to a string of factors, including a jump in global commodity prices. Over the last 12 months, sunflower oil has seen a surge of over 50% across metros (77% in Kolkata), while mustard oil, palm oil and other edible oils now cost at least 30% more. In case of pulses, too, there is pressure with Kolkata seeing a significant increase. Gram dal and tur dal have seen a spike of 25% and 24% in Kolkata over the past one year. It’s a similar story across India. Latest data on Monday showed retail inflation had surged to a six-month high of 6.3% in May due to higher fuel and food prices and posing a stiff challenge for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which is already battling to put growth back on track. The data showed oils and fats jumped 30.8% during the month while prices of pulses and products rose an annual 9.4%. The build of price pressures has come at a time when the economy is witnessing a sharp slowdown and households are combating reduced salaries, job losses and uncertainty against the backdrop of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The flare-up in food prices has taken economists by surprise. Adding to the problem is the increase in core inflation, which is minus food and fuel, while the increase in fuel prices have also added to the price pressures. “The upside inflation surprise comes when broader price pressures are also likely to build. The June reading is already tracking higher. Our tracker for vegetable prices is already up 7.3% m-o-m (for the first 13 days of June) versus 1.6% in May. Higher global prices continue to push up vegetable oil and beverage prices. On the non-food side, petrol prices are already trending 3% m-o-m higher than in May, even as the government has refrained from revising up LPG prices,” according to a Nomura research note. “The steady rise in industrial input costs along with evidence of squeeze in manufacturing margins suggests that firms will pass part of the higher cost to consumers. We also expect services inflation to rise as demand recovers alongside the economic reopening. Higher build-up in rural wages and rising inflation expectations are also medium-term risks,” said the note by economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi. The retail inflation data also showed that rural inflation continued to remain high at 6.5% while urban inflation was at 6%. Economists said the high rural inflation was a cause for concern. Economists expect food prices to moderate as lockdown restrictions ease and expectations of a robust monsoon which could have a calming impact on food prices. “If the spatial and inter temporal distribution in the months of July-August turns out to be favorable, then kharif sowing activity would get a boost. We believe this will be key in moderating overall inflation vis-à-vis FY21,” according to QuantEco Research. Trade experts also reckon that prices of edible oil will calm down due to the moderation in global prices which have already started. “By July there could be some cooling in retail prices and by December there could be substantial easing in prices,” B V Mehta, executive director of Solvent Extractors Association told TOI.

---||World||Nancy Pelosi says House to move forward with January 6 investigations||WASHINGTON: Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will move forward with investigations of the January 6 insurrection now that legislation to create an independent commission has stalled in the Senate, saying "we can't wait any longer" to probe the attack.  Pelosi's comments came as the House heard testimony Tuesday from military officials and FBI Director Christopher Wray about what went wrong that day, when hundreds of supporters of former President Donald Trump breached the Capitol and interrupted the certification of President Joe Biden's win. Pelosi met with several committee chairs before the hearing and said afterward that the final form of the investigations is "to be determined." She said she will make an announcement soon.  "Whether we have a commission today, tomorrow or the next day over in the Senate, or not, the work of the committees will be very important in what we're seeking for the American people - the truth," Pelosi said.  One option under consideration is a select committee on the Jan. 6 attack, a setup that would put majority Democrats in charge. More than three dozen Republicans in the House and seven Senate Republicans wanted to avoid such a partisan probe and supported the legislation to create an independent, bipartisan commission outside Congress.  But those numbers weren't strong enough to overcome GOP opposition in the Senate, where support from 10 Republicans is needed to pass most bills. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said he may hold a second vote after the legislation failed to advance last month, but there's no indication that Democrats can win the necessary support from three additional Republicans.  "We can't wait any longer," Pelosi said. "We will proceed."  Meanwhile, most Republicans are making clear that they want to move on from the Jan. 6 attack, brushing aside the many unanswered questions about the insurrection, including how the government and law enforcement missed intelligence leading up to the rioting and the role of Trump before and during the attack.  The hearing Tuesday in the House Oversight and Reform Committee was to examine "unexplained delays and unanswered questions" about the siege, with public testimony from Wray, Gen. Charles E. Flynn and Lt. Gen. Walter E. Piatt, the director of Army staff.  All three men were involved that day as the Capitol Police begged for backup. The National Guard did not arrive for several hours as the police were overwhelmed and brutally beaten by the rioters.  Echoing previous testimony from Defense Department leaders, Flynn and Piatt said the military needed time to develop plans for the National Guard response. Piatt insisted that he did not deny or have the authority to deny Guard help during a call with former Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund.  Rep. Carolyn Maloney, the New York Democrat who chairs the committee, criticized Wray for not providing documents her staff had requested and asked him if he believed the FBI should be blamed for the law enforcement failures on Jan. 6.  "Our goal is to bat 1.000 and any time there's an attack, much less an attack as horrific and spectacular as what happened on Jan. 6, we consider that to be unacceptable," Wray replied.  Seven people died during and after the rioting, including a Trump supporter who was shot and killed as she tried to break into the House chamber and two police officers who died by suicide in the days that followed. A third officer, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, collapsed and later died after engaging with the protesters, but a medical examiner determined he died of natural causes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nancy-pelosi-says-house-to-move-forward-with-january-6-investigations/articleshow/83557256.cms||---
---||World||US President Joe Biden picks Israel, Mexico, NATO ambassadors||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced his nominees to be ambassadors to Israel, Mexico and NATO, as he moves to strengthen US alliances in tough regions. Among a slate of names announced by the White House on Tuesday were Thomas Nides, a Morgan Stanley vice-chairman who served as a deputy secretary of state under former president Barack Obama, to serve as the ambassador to Israel. The close US ally is welcoming a new government after Israel's parliament ended Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year run as prime minister on Sunday. Biden also picked Ken Salazar, a former US senator from Colorado and interior secretary, as his ambassador to Mexico. The country is one of the United States' biggest trading partners and the Biden administration is working to manage immigration across the US-Mexican border. He also chose security expert Julianne Smith to represent the United States on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a key Western bulwark against Russia. Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Geneva on Wednesday at a time of increased tensions between the two powers. The White House also said Biden picked C. B. "Sully" Sullenberger to be an ambassador and serve as the US representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Sullenberger rose to fame in 2009 after gliding his Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River after hitting a flock of geese shortly after takeoff, in what became known as the "Miracle on the Hudson." He also joined Biden on the campaign trail when he was running for president. Biden also named his ambassador picks to Sri Lanka, the Gambia, Guinea, Paraguay and Costa Rica.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-president-joe-biden-picks-israel-mexico-nato-ambassadors/articleshow/83557347.cms||---
---||India||SII, Bharat Biotech seek hike in government price for Covid vaccines||MUMBAI: Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech (BB) are seeking higher prices for Covid-19 vaccines from the Centre amid concerns that the cost of Covishield and Covaxin shots in private hospitals is already high. The Centre’s procurement price has been in the range of Rs 150-200 per jab, for the orders placed with the companies from January onwards. Both companies recently sought a price increase, arguing that the current government-procurement price is “unsustainable”, especially in line with the substantial investments that have gone towards producing vaccines. They have argued that vaccine manufacturing is capital-intensive, complex and specialised process, and undertaken with “significant financial risk”, sources privy to the discussions told TOI. In April, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had said that the company is providing the shot at a “subsidised” rate of around Rs 150 to the government, significantly lower than what it charges for exports. He suggested the Centre should increase the prices as the company needed to invest in capacity addition, and had also sought Rs 3,000 crore to ramp up capacity. The Union health ministry announced on June 8 that it had placed an order with SII for 25 crore doses of Covishield, and with Bharat Biotech for 19 crore doses of Covaxin. It said that the 44 crore vaccine doses will be available till December, and 30% of the advance payment has been released to both the companies. The pricing per unit of the latest order has not been made available. On Tuesday, Bharat Biotech said the weighted average price of Covaxin for all supplies realised by the company is less than Rs 250 per dose. “The supply price of Covaxin to the government at Rs 150 per dose is a non-competitive price and clearly not sustainable in the long run,” the statement added. With the policy tweak recently, revenues of the manufacturers will be impacted, with the Centre procuring 75% of their output. Earlier, their realisations would have been higher on account of the states paying two to three times the central-government procured price. Earlier, SII received nearly Rs 160 per dose for Covishield while Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was procured at around Rs 210 per dose. While in the first order in January, the government procured 110 lakh doses of Covishield at Rs 200 per dose (excluding taxes) while 55 lakh doses of Covaxin worked out to Rs 206 per dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sii-bharat-biotech-seek-hike-in-government-price-for-covid-vaccines/articleshow/83557189.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The Allendale Township board voted 5-2 Monday, despite a recommendation from a group that the statue be replaced by one with Union soldiers who are Black, Native American and white.  "It's been made very clear to me that the majority of our residents wish for the Civil War statue to remain in the garden of honor," said Jody Hansen, township clerk and board member.  Dozens of people attended the meeting, which was held outdoors at a park bandshell, 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Grand Rapids.  "What better lesson can we teach our children than by being able to say, 'We had this thing. We thought it was OK. We have since learned that we were wrong,'" said area resident Cathy Seaver, who wants the statue removed.  Trustee Barb VanderVeen, who opposed keeping the statue, asked if the child, which represents a slave, could at least be removed. Trustee Candy Kraker said the artist indicated that removing it would damage the structural integrity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/michigan-town-to-keep-statue-of-black-child-south-soldier/articleshow/83557603.cms||---

---||World||US defends minority farmer debt relief despite legal fight||CHICAGO: The US Agriculture Department (USDA) is defending efforts to wipe clean government-backed loans to farmers facing decades of discrimination, despite a temporary restraining order on the debt relief plan issued by a US District court last week. A USDA spokesperson said the agency will be ready to process payments on an estimated $4 billion in debt relief for 17,000 Black, Indigenous, Hispanic and Asian farmers once legal battles are resolved. It planned to start the payments in June. "USDA will continue to forcefully defend its ability to carry out this act of Congress and deliver debt relief to socially disadvantaged borrowers," a USDA spokesperson said on Tuesday. The spokesperson said the government cannot appeal the restraining order, which pauses payments until the US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin rules more broadly on a lawsuit over whether or not the debt relief program discriminates against non-minority farmers. For decades, USDA employees and programs have discriminated against socially disadvantaged farmers by denying loans and delaying payments, resulting in $120 billion in lost farmland value since 1920, according to a 2018 Tufts University analysis. The Biden administration's loan forgiveness program is aimed at addressing those systemic inequities. The lawsuit, filed by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty on behalf of 12 white farmers, aims to halt the debt relief by claiming it excludes farmers on the basis of race. It is one of several lawsuits filed after the USDA detailed plans to implement the minority farmer debt-relief provision, which is part of the American Rescue Plan Act that Congress passed in March. Judge William C. Griesbach, US District Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, granted the temporary restraining order on June 10. "The obvious response to a government agency that claims it continues to discriminate against farmers because of their race or national origin is to direct it to stop," Griesbach said in the decision. Some Black farmers are not surprised the relief has stalled, having seen previous government anti-discrimination efforts underdeliver. "Talk is cheap. I can't buy grain with it. I want to know when you're going to help some farmers," said Lloyd Wright, a Virginia farmer who served as the director of the USDA's Office of Civil Rights in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Wright said Black farmers have been promised relief from federal discrimination in the past, only to be repeatedly disappointed. He suggests eligible farmers continue paying on loans, so they do not end up behind if the program is permanently blocked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-defends-minority-farmer-debt-relief-despite-legal-fight/articleshow/83557787.cms||---

On May 1, the US suspended entry by non-immigrants who had been in India in the preceding 14 days. Students wanting to enter or return to the US were exempted. Washington also kept its doors open for ‘persons of national importance’. It wasn’t long before desperate parents started applying for visas under the category. “A well-known builder, whose child will join the University of Southern California this August, has decided to take a chartered flight to Dubai and after spending a fortnight there, the family will enter the US to drop the student at his university in Los Angeles,” said study abroad counsellor Karan Gupta. “Some parents who have businesses in Dubai are staying put there and heading to the US from there,” said another counsellor Sonal Parekh. The trend of dropping off their children is very popular, especially among the parents of the thousands of undergraduate teens who head out every year. “There was a lot of heartburn when the US Consulate’s India office clarified that parents, even those holding US visas, could not travel with their children,” said Gupta. And creative travel plans emerged. If some are chartering flights, the budget-conscious could fly commercial to countries that are allowing Indians in and are simultaneously on the accepted list for the US. Several parents from the UK will route their trip to the US via Egypt. Some are planning to fly to Russia and from there to America. The US Consulate here has advised against booking flights with a stop in Europe as they have strict quarantine policies. “Parents are already stressed that in case of any emergency, they will not be able to enter the US till the travel ban is eased. Those like me, who hold valid US visas, feel the need to be with our wards to complete airport formalities, to navigate the new city, and reach the campus, set up their housing,” explained a parent. For students, the visa stress continued for a second day. After Monday’s fiasco, students applying for a visa appointment struggled to register on the US Consulate portal on Tuesday too. Many opted for the dial-in service to get an appointment. “After holding on for over an hour, I was told I could try logging into the appointment portal after 30 minutes,” said a frustrated candidate. The US Consulate sought to calm nerves with a statement on social media: “Since June 14, thousands of students have secured visa appointments for July and August. Thousands of appointments will remain available and we will open thousands more in coming weeks. We appreciate your patience as we diligently work to resolve the technical issues you have encountered.” Not many took this at face value. “Yesterday was complete chaos. The site was down almost the entire day. How were thousands of students able to secure appointments?” asked a candidate. Social media was also full of pleas by students to unlock their visa application accounts that were frozen on Monday for too many tries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/parents-charter-flights-take-detours-to-drop-children-to-us/articleshow/83557885.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The health ministry warned that lessons from the second wave show that the virus is highly transmissible and prevention is critical even as the data reflects some respite. Almost 85% decline in daily new cases has been noted since the peak on May 7 when cases touched 4,14,188. On June 14, this was down to 60,471. Active cases fell below 10 lakh after 65 days. This is a decline by 75.6% from the peak of active cases on May 10 across the country. Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, also shared that the number of districts reporting over 100 daily cases have reduced from 531 as recorded in the week ending May 4 to 165 in the week ending June 13. At present, there are 20 states and UTs where the active caseload is less than 5,000 and a drastic reduction is being noted in almost all states. Due to the restrictions being imposed in terms of containment activities, a sharp decline of 78% has been noted since the highest reported weekly Covid case positivity of 21.4% recorded between May 4-10 during the second wave. Also, a consistent increase in recovery rate has been observed since May 3 when it was 81.8% to 95.6% as on date. Speaking, about measures to prevent the spread of the virus, Niti Aayog member, health Dr V K Paul said, “testing and containment” will have to be the focus. “The virus transmission is low at present and it becomes important that when a positive case is identified the person must be separated and his contacts quarantined. In case a cluster is identified, measures to create micro containment zones must be taken.” It is important to localise the containment strategy and this requires the system and the community to work together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-precautions-key-warns-govt-as-positivity-rate-declines-to-4-8/articleshow/83558177.cms||---
---||World||Harvey Weinstein can be extradited to California, New York judge rules||NEW YORK: A judge on Tuesday cleared the way for Harvey Weinstein to be extradited to California from New York to face rape and sexual assault charges, nearly a year after Los Angeles prosecutors asked that the convicted former movie producer be moved.  Erie County Court Judge Kenneth Case in Buffalo, New York, rejected arguments by Weinstein's legal team that the paperwork for the move had not been done, and that Weinstein, 69, should stay in New York to get needed medical care.  "If California doesn't come to pick up Mr. Weinstein within a reasonable period of time, certainly come back to see me," Case told Norman Effman, a lawyer representing Weinstein.  Los Angeles prosecutors plan to extradite Weinstein between late June and mid-July so he can face an 11-count indictment accusing him of attacking five women from 2004 to 2013.  Mark Werksman, another lawyer for Weinstein, said in an email that Weinstein is appealing Case's decision and asking a Los Angeles judge to block the extradition "until he can receive the medical care he needs in New York."  The office of Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon first sought Weinstein's extradition last July, but it was delayed in part by the Covid-19 pandemic. It had no immediate comment on Tuesday's ruling.  Weinstein is serving a 23-year prison term following his February 2020 conviction in Manhattan for sexually assaulting a production assistant in 2006 and third-degree rape of an aspiring actress in 2013.  He is appealing his conviction and sentence, and has denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone.  Weinstein has been locked up since last spring at the maximum-security Wende Correctional Facility near Buffalo, where he attended Tuesday's hearing by video link.  Effman has said Weinstein, a diabetic, has suffered from cardiac, dental and back problems and was "almost technically blind," and at the hearing proposed letting him stay in New York until the Los Angeles trial began.  Colleen Curtin Gable, a New York prosecutor appearing on behalf of Gascon, countered that Weinstein could get medical care he needs in California.  "Los Angeles has some of the best medical care in not only the country but in the world, so all of the medical issues can certainly be addressed elsewhere," she said.  Weinstein's conviction is now seen as a watershed moment in the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and harassment by men.  The Los Angeles charges include forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint, and sexual penetration by use of force. If convicted, Weinstein could spend the rest of his life in prison.  Weinstein co-founded the Miramax film and television company, whose hit independent movies include "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/harvey-weinstein-can-be-extradited-to-california-new-york-judge-rules/articleshow/83558446.cms||---

Vaccination statistics show that 58% of total beneficiaries have been registered through on-site mode and nearly 80% of all vaccine doses have been administered through walk-in vaccination. Highlighting vaccination figures, the ministry claimed that facilitators such as health workers or ASHAs mobilised beneficiaries in rural areas and those residing in urban slums for on-site registration and vaccination directly at the nearest vaccination centres. Besides, facilitated registration through the Common Service Centres (CSCs) on CoWin and facility for assisted registrations through the 1075 helpline too assisted those who could not access or use the digital platform on their own. The ministry said all the facilitated registration modes, specifically operationalised for rural areas, are “functional and enabling equitable access to vaccination in rural areas”. It said it was evident from the fact that 16.45 crore (58%) beneficiaries out of 28.36 crore beneficiaries registered on CoWin have been registered in the on-site mode as on June 13. Similarly, 19.84 crore doses (nearly 80%) out of the total 24.84 crore vaccine doses recorded on CoWin as on June 13 have been administered through onsite/ walk-in vaccination. Denying the rural-urban divide, the ministry said the CoWin system offers a “completely flexible and inclusive framework” for facilitating vaccination recording in rural areas, and especially in the remotest parts of the country. It noted that out of the total 69,995 vaccination centres so far classified by states on CoWin as rural or urban, 71% (49,883) of them are located in rural areas where people can directly walk-in for on-site registration and vaccination. Referring to vaccination in remote areas, the ministry claimed that vaccination per million population in tribal districts is higher than the national average and more walk-in vaccinations are happening in tribal districts as compared to national average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/facilitators-ensured-there-was-no-cowin-digital-divide-govt/articleshow/83558367.cms||---

---||India||488 AEFI deaths, but these are not necessarily due to vaccination: Govt||NEW DELHI: Asserting that vaccines approved by the government are safe and the only weapon against the Coronavirus, the government on Tuesday said deaths reported post-vaccination standing at 488 were a small percentage of the number of doses given, but this did not mean they were due to vaccination. “We ascertain if it is a minor adverse event or it is a serious or severe adverse event. Then it is monitored and causes are ascertained. The vaccines approved by us, their safety parameters are very good. When 23.5 crore doses were given, AEFI (Adverse events following immunisation) deaths were 0.0002 per cent which comes to 488 deaths which does not mean these deaths were because of vaccination,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. AEFI is defined as ‘any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunisation’ and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine. Reports in the media said one case of vaccine related death was confirmed due to a severe allergic reaction. In a press statement issued earlier, the health ministry said that there have been media reports suggesting an increase in the cases of severe AEFI which have also resulted in ‘succumbing of patients’ post-vaccination. “It is clarified that these reports are based on incomplete and limited understanding of the matter at hand. It may be noted that the term ‘succumbed’ insinuates causality i.e. the deaths were caused due to vaccination,” it stated.  “It is also important and pertinent to note that the mortality rates for those testing positive for Covid-19 disease is more than 1% and Covid-19 vaccination can prevent these deaths. Therefore, the risk of dying following vaccination is negligible as compared to the known risk of dying due to Covid-19 disease,” the ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/488-aefi-deaths-but-these-are-not-necessarily-due-to-vaccination-govt/articleshow/83558636.cms||---
---||Business||Wall Street ends down as data spooks investors awaiting Federal report||Wall Street's main indices closed lower on Tuesday as data showing stronger inflation and weaker US retail sales in May spooked already-jittery investors awaiting the results of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting. Assurance from the Fed that rising prices are transitory and falling US Treasury yields have helped ease some concerns over inflation and supported US stocks in recent weeks. All eyes are now on the central bank's statement at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Data showed an acceleration in producer prices last month as supply chains struggled to meet demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy. A separate report showed US retail sales dropped more than expected in May. "There was a bit of a reaction to the economic data we got, which, for the most part, shows that the economy is starting to wean itself off stimulus, the recovery is slowing down a little, and inflation is continuing to grow," said Ed Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA. "We're seeing some very modest weakness, and it'll be choppy leading up to the Fed decision. Right now, the Fed is probably in a position to show they are thinking about tapering, but they're still a long way from actually doing it." The Fed is likely to announce in August or September a strategy for reducing its massive bond buying program, but will not start cutting monthly purchases until early next year, a Reuters poll of economists found. The benchmark S&P 500, the blue-chip Dow Jones and the tech-focused Nasdaq have risen 13%, 12.1% and 9.2% respectively so far this year, largely driven by optimism about an economic reopening. However, the S&P 500 has been broadly stuck within a range, despite recording its 29th record-high finish of 2021 on Monday, versus 33 for all of last year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.42 points, or 0.27%, to 34,299.33, the S&P 500 lost 8.56 points, or 0.20%, to 4,246.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.29 points, or 0.71%, to 14,072.86. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors slipped. Among them was communication services, which ended 0.5% lower, having hit a record intraday high earlier in the session. The largest gainer was the energy index, which rose 2.1% on oil prices hitting multi-year highs on a positive demand outlook. Exxon Mobil Corp had its best day since Mar. 5, jumping 3.6%. In corporate news, Boeing Co gained 0.6% after the United States and the European Union agreed on a truce in their 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies involving the planemaker and its rival Airbus. Having slumped 19% on Monday, Lordstown Motors Corp shares rebounded 11.3% after comments from the electric truck manufacturer's president on orders. Volume on US exchanges was 9.98 billion shares, compared with the 10.58 billion average over the last 20 trading days. The S&P 500 posted 36 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 21 new lows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/wall-street-ends-down-as-data-spooks-investors-awaiting-federal-report/articleshow/83558898.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Data dispels myth of young people being more at risk during 2nd wave||NEW DELHI: The comparative data of the first and second wave dispels the impression that more young people and children were at risk in the recent surge in Covid infections as there is no significant change in the proportion of persons who contracted the disease in the different age groups. During the second wave 22.7% of those infected were in the 31-40 group and this was 21.2% last year between July to December. The next most affected group last year was the 21-30 accounting for 21.21%. In the second wave, from March 15 to May 25, they accounted for 22.5% cases. Those in the 41 to 50 group were 17.3% cases last year and this time 17.26% of patients were in this age bracket. Follow live coverage on Covid-19Data for children shows that last year between July to December 3.28% patients were in the 1-10 group and this percentage was slightly lower at 3.05% in the second surge. Covid positive patients in the 11-20 years age group accounted for 8% last year and this rose slightly to 8.57% this year. Among elders, it turns out that the first wave impacted 9.14% in the 61-70 years age group and 8.22% were affected in the second wave. In case of those in the 71-80 group the virus infected 3.7% in the first wave and 3.55% this time round. Government experts warned that all age groups need to be careful and those more vulnerable need to be even more cautious given that the second wave established that the virus can mutate and is highly transmissible.

This got linked to another issue that if a third wave comes the children can be more adversely impacted."

He cited the data analysis on the proportion of population affected by the virus across age groups to say that all age groups have to stay alert. “Even today the population that has not been infected are susceptible to be affected by the virus and therefore everyone needs to take necessary precautions,” Agarwal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-data-dispels-myth-of-young-people-being-more-at-risk-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/83558847.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Business||MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos' ex-wife, donates $2.7 billion||NEW DELHI: MacKenzie Scott, the billionaire philanthropist known for her impromptu multi-billion dollar donations to charities and racial equity causes, announced on Tuesday that she has given $2.7 billion to 286 organizations. It is the third round of no-strings-attached, major philanthropic gifts Scott has made, which together rival the charitable contributions made by the largest foundations.  Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, wrote in a Medium post that she and her husband, Dan Jewett, made the donations to enable the recipients to continue their work and as a "signal of trust and encouragement" to them and others.  And she made clear in her announcement that she is troubled by the increasing concentration of vast wealth among a small proportion of individuals. She and Jewett worked with a team of researchers and philanthropy advisors "to give away a fortune that was enabled by systems in need of change."  "In this effort," she said, "we are governed by a humbling belief that it would be better if disproportionate wealth were not concentrated in a small number of hands and that the solutions are best designed and implemented by others."  In 2020, Scott made two similar surprise announcements, donating a combined $6 billion to Covid-19 relief, gender equity, historically Black colleges and universities and other schools. The 286 organizations chosen for Tuesday's announcement included "equity-oriented" nonprofits working in long-neglected areas and were selected from a rigorous process of research and analysis, Scott said.  "Because we believe that teams with experience on the front lines of challenges will know best how to put the money to good use, we encouraged them to spend it however they choose," she wrote.  Scott's wealth, estimated by Forbes at roughly $60 billion, has only grown since she divorced from Bezos in 2019 and walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon. Shortly after the split, the 51-year-old signed the Giving Pledge, a commitment developed by Bill and Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffett to get the world's richest to give a majority of their wealth during their lifetimes or in their wills. Jewett also became a signatory earlier this year.  David Callahan, the founder of the Inside Philanthropy website and author of "The Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age" says Scott's giving shows not only an emphasis on the wealth gap, but also an attempt to help raise the political voice of historically marginalized communities.  Since 2020, Scott has given big contributions to organizations led by minorities, women, or others from vulnerable populations. "And, she specifically has not wanted to do philanthropy in a way that puts her, the philanthropist, in the driver's seat," Callahan said.  "Many philanthropists are very, kind of, controlling," he added. "They think they have the best ideas. They pick and choose carefully who to give money to (in order) to find groups that are willing to carry out their ideas. And MacKenzie Scott is doing something quite differently. She's finding groups who have their own ideas and empowering them to do their work."  The latest recipients range from universities - including $40 million apiece to the University of Central Florida and the University of Texas at San Antonio - to refugee resettlement groups and civil rights groups, as well as arts and culture organizations that have suffered from a drop in giving as donors focused on more urgent needs brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.  The donations also went to nonprofits that focus on minority communities. The group Native Americans in Philanthropy, a recipient that connects philanthropic organizations to Native American-led nonprofits, said in a statement that the multi-million contribution will help them in their efforts to increase funding to tribal communities.  "MacKenzie Scott has recommitted to transformative work, the organizations that undertake it and the leaders whose ideas are often under-funded and overlooked," Erik Stegman, the executive director of the group, said in a statement. "It's important to note that she has also just written checks to these organizations, leaving her own interests to the side and giving up power to the organizations she's funding."  Scott's concern about the enormous gbetween the very wealthiest Americans and everyone else was underscored in a report last week from the nonprofit investigative journalism organization ProPublica. It reported that the richest 25 Americans pay less in tax than many ordinary workers do, once you include taxes for Social Security and Medicare.  Drawing upon Internal Revenue Service data on the country's wealthiest people, ProPublica reported that some of them have paid no income tax, or nearly none, in some years. Among them is Scott's former husband, Bezos, who, according to ProPublica, paid no income tax in 2007 and 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/mackenzie-scott-citing-wealth-gap-donates-2-7-billion/articleshow/83558998.cms||---
---||World||Ryanair CEO says diverted flight had to land in Belarus||LONDON: The pilot of a Ryanair flight that was diverted to Belarus last month, leading to the arrest of a dissident Belarusian journalist, had no alternative but to land the plane in Minsk, the head of the budget airline said Tuesday.  Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary appeared before a British Parliament committee to give evidence on the May 23 diversion. The scheduled flight from Greece to Lithuania changed course and landed in Belarus' capital. Opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich, who had been a passenger on the plane, was arrested.  O'Leary told British lawmakers that Minsk air traffic control warned the flight crew of a "credible threat" that if the plane entered Lithuanian airspace, "a bomb on board would be detonated."  The captain repeatedly asked to communicate with Ryanair's operations control center, but Minsk air traffic officials told him - falsely - that "Ryanair weren't answering the phone," O'Leary said.  "This was clearly a premeditated breach of all the international aviation rules, regulations, safety," he said.  O'Leary said the pilot was put under "considerable pressure" to land in Belarus instead of the more standard options of Poland or other Baltic countries.  "He wasn't instructed to do so, but he wasn't left with any great alternatives," he told members of the Parliament committee.  After the plane was on the ground, several "unidentified persons" boarded the aircraft with video cameras, according to O'Leary.  They "repeatedly attempted to get the crew to confirm on video that they had voluntarily diverted to Minsk," the Ryanair executive said. The crew refused to provide such confirmation, he said.  Western countries have called the forced diversion a brazen "hijacking" by Belarus. Outraged European Union leaders swiftly slapped sanctions on the country, including banning Belarusian airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc and telling European airlines to skirt Belarus. UK authorities took similar actions.  O'Leary said he did not support continuing such flight bans in the long term.  "We cannot have a situation whereby airlines, air travel, our customers and our citizens run the risk of being hijacked and diverted under false pretenses," he said. "But equally, far more UK citizens will be disrupted as a result of long-haul flights between the UK and Asia, for example, now having to fly around Belarus or avoiding Belarusian airspace."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/ryanair-ceo-says-diverted-flight-had-to-land-in-belarus/articleshow/83559151.cms||---
---||India||Court adjourns Jadhav case to Oct 5 on Pakistan govt appeal||ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: The Islamabad high court on Tuesday adjourned the hearing of a case related to the appointment of a counsel for Indian death row prisoner Khulbhushan Jadhav till October 5. The appointment of a lawyer for Jadhav remains one of the three contentious issues that has prevented India from participating in the review trial, the other two being the need for India to have unhindered consular access to Jadhav and also access to all case files. Pakistan has so far rejected India’s demand to appoint an Indian lawyer for Jadhav. India later asked for a Queen’s Counsel to represent Jadhav but that too was rejected. The attorney general of Pakistan, Khalid Jawed Khan, who represented the government during the hearing, sought postponement of the proceedings before a three-judge bench comprising chief justice of the HC Athar Minallah and Justices Aamer Farooq and Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. The HC accepted the federal government’s plea and adjourned the hearing till October 5. The court also issued notice to the counsel of the Indian high commission to appear before the court on the next date of hearing. Recently, Pakistan’s national assembly had approved a bill to provide Jadhav the right of appeal in a civilian court against a sentence handed down to him by a military court. Pakistan had enacted an ordinance earlier to allow a review in keeping with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) judgment that called for an effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav's death sentence by a military court. For India to join the trial though, it’s important that Pakistan first provides what the government has called remedial consular access or access to Jadhav in private. India believes this is not a normal case of consular access as, unlike in other cases, in Jadhav’s case, the conviction has already taken place. Consular access is normally provided just after arrest. India has also repeatedly told Pakistan that access in private will be in keeping with the spirit of the ICJ judgment. Indian authorities have previously avoided responding in the Jadhav case. In April, counsel for the Indian high commission, barrister Shahnawaz Noon, who had appeared in the HC in a separate matter to request the court to dispose of the case related to four prisoners following their release, had argued that Pakistani courts had no jurisdiction to review the Jadhav case. Last month, the Islamabad HC had urged the Indian government to cooperate with the legal proceedings as it concerned the “life of a human being”. Jadhav, according to Pakistan, was arrested on March 3, 2016, from Balochistan’s Mashkhel area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/court-adjourns-jadhav-case-to-oct-5-on-pakistan-govt-appeal/articleshow/83559495.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||At least 5 BSP MLAs meet Akhilesh, set off switch-over buzz||LUCKNOW: In what is being seen as a precursor to a realignment of political affiliations before the 2022 assembly elections in UP, at least five rebel MLAs from Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party met Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday. The meeting, which lasted for about an hour, has triggered speculation about the MLAs formally joining SP in the near future. The list comprised most of the seven MLAs suspended by BSP supremo Mayawati in October 2020 after the Rajya Sabha polls — Aslam Ali, Hargovind Bhargav, Mohammad Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Mohammad Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel and Vandana Singh — although it was unclear which of these seven had met Akhilesh.  Sources said initially six of the suspended MLAs were scheduled to meet the former UP CM but one of them dropped out at the last moment as he was busy with the zila panchayat polls where his wife is a candidate. Sources said all the six MLAs would formally join SP once the monsoon session of the assembly is over. Sources said some of these MLAs’ kin have already joined SP to coordinate with SP cadres ahead of the formal crossover. Suspended BSP MLA from Bhinga (Shravasti) Mohammed Aslam Raini, however, tried to play down the reports of his meeting with Akhilesh. “We can meet anyone,” he said, adding that there was no proof of any such meeting. About future political moves, Raini said 11 BSP MLAs were with him and all of them would get together and form a new party under the leadership of former BSP veteran Lalji Verma, who was recently sacked from the party. Verma, however, denied any such plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-least-5-bsp-mlas-meet-akhilesh-set-off-switch-over-buzz/articleshow/83559519.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui

While there is no official confirmation on dates, the joint statement issued after the Quad leaders’ summit on March 12 said there would be such a summit as soon as the occasion presented itself. This was also confirmed in a TV interview by Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu.  If Modi does go, it will be his first in-person meeting with US President Joe Biden. It’s not yet clear whether the Quad summit could be combined with a bilateral engagement with the US. Modi has yet another reason to go to the US in the fall of 2021 — to attend the high-level segment of the UN General Assembly as a UNSC non-permanent member. The Quad summit was actually announced by Biden’s Indo-Pacific czar Kurt Campbell to a US think-tank, Centre for New American Security (CNAS), a few days ago. The goal, Campbell said, was “for an in-person Quad meeting here in the fall”. Describing it as an “ambitious meeting,” he elaborated on the US plans for the intended summit. The first step, he said, would be to take the necessary steps on vaccine deliveries. The Quad, in its last summit, had resolved to have a billion doses of J&J vaccine to be distributed among the Indo-Pacific countries in 2022. Biological E, the Hyderabad-based vaccine manufacturer has been selected for the job. Campbell indicated the project was “on track” despite the huge Covid-19 surge in India. Sources said the effort currently was on two fronts — first, to increase Biological E’s capacities with funding from Japan and the US and second, to spread out production of the vaccines to other companies in India as well. Campbell said that apart from vaccines, the next Quad summit could focus on infrastructure building as well. A hint of this was provided during the G7 summit’s B3W (Build Back Better for the World) programme — generally seen as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/modi-may-travel-to-us-for-quad-summit/articleshow/83559548.cms||---

The trust also maintained that the said plot was bought to develop a four-lane road, which will be the main approach road to the Ram temple. “The area of the land is 1.2 hectare purchased at the rate of Rs 1,423 per square feet, which is less than the actual market rate in Ayodhya,” the trust said. It further clarified that for the same land, agreements were made between different parties many times since 2011 but they never materialised. An ANI report said that RSS ideologue Indresh Kumar on Tuesday called the land deal by the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust “transparent”, adding that the Opposition leaders are losing their integrity and respect by creating obstacles in the temple construction. Meanwhile, VHP international working president Alok Kumar on Monday said that defamation suits will be filed against Opposition parties who are trying to mislead people ahead of UP polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ayodhya-deal-transparent-opposition-creating-hurdles-rss/articleshow/83559592.cms||---

At a meet, chaired by him to review the measures to be prescribed as part of a comprehensive policy to mitigate the perennial flood problem, Shah took a slew of decisions to have a new system of coordination among the IMD, jal shakti ministry, central water commission and NDRF. He advised the Jal Shakti ministry to work out a mechanism for desilting of large dams, which will help in increasing dam storage capacity and help in flood control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shah-takes-stock-of-flood-preparedness/articleshow/83559617.cms||---

On Monday afternoon, while dashing home to catch a quick meal, he noticed a crowd swelling around a girl’s body. Overcome by curiosity, he parked his bike and pushed his way through the gathering. He suddenly fell to his knees, yelled, “It’s my daughter” and fell unconscious. Just a few hours ago, at their home in Moradabad’s Surajnagar village, a beaming Meenakshi Singh alias Teena (19) had bid goodbye to her father while he was leaving todistribute the cards. In between, she got a call from her fiancé, Jitin, who wanted to take her out for shopping. But he had other plans. Jitin allegedly strangled Meenakshi to death at a deserted stretch. He never wanted to marry her. Jitin was arrested on Tuesday. During questioning, he told police that he didn’t want to marry Meenakshi and was trying to call off the wedding, which led to an argument and he killed her. As per her family, Jitin had asked Meenakshi to reach the market for shopping. The girl’s mother accompanied her till the bus stand. A few hours later, Madanpal found her body on the road in Moradabad’s Thakurdwara area. He said, “I had fixed my daughter’s marriage with Jitin as they knew each other. On June 6, we gave gifts during a pre-wedding ceremony. But Jitin’s family members were not happy as they wanted more money. Jitin had even asked to postpone the marriage but it was not possible as we had distributed the cards and booked the venue as well.” SP (rural) Vidyasagar Mishra told TOI, “We’re trying to identify if anyone else was involved in the murder.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/distributing-girls-wedding-cards-dad-finds-her-body/articleshow/83559637.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Public health officials said an early assessment has revealed that Maharashtra has at least one lakh such beneficiaries — mostly healthcare and frontline workers. It is unclear how many such people are there in other cities. Officials suspect many healthcare and frontline workers — faced with delays — may have registered again with different phone numbers and IDs to get the second dose. These duplicate records are now being removed or merged, officials said, adding that the problem was detected during routine data-correction exercises. State immunization officer DN Patil said, “It’s difficult to say why so many had to re-register to get the second shots. This could have happened in case of healthcare and frontline workers who found themselves unable to get their second shots after the vaccine drive opened for citizens. These workers may have re-registered under the 60-plus or 45-plus age groups.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fully-vaccinated-too-showing-due-for-second-shot/articleshow/83559696.cms||Neha Madaan
---||India||Stop police sharing probe info with media: Karnataka HC||BENGALURU: Observing that police have no business to go before the media and disclose the identity and information of the accused and the complainant in a matter under investigation, the Karnataka high court on Tuesday directed the state government to come out with comprehensive guidelines in this regard. Granting time till July 20, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Oka pointed out that the purpose of directions will not be served if no disciplinary action is taken against those violating norms. He said that on many occasions, police would claim before the media that there’s a strong case against the accused or that the accused had confessed, among other things. This act of police going to the media or disclosing the identity of accused/ complainant as well as nature and material collected during the investigation affects the rights of the accused in bail matters and also the trial, he added. Earlier, the government advocate informed the HC that several circulars have been issued in this regard and claimed that probe officers are not disclosing any information regarding pending cases. The court is hearing a PIL filed by H Nagabhushan Rao, a Bengaluru-based advocate. It was filed in the wake of videos in cases involving former ministers going viral in the past couple of years. He sought a direction to police not to leak information collected during investigation regarding any case to either media or the public. Further, he sought a direction to the effect that any official found leaking such information should be dealt both departmentally as well as under criminal law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stop-police-sharing-probe-info-with-media-karnataka-hc/articleshow/83559790.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Arrest of arms suppliers by UP ATS exposes illegal weapon manufacturing network||Prayagraj: The arrest of six illegal arms suppliers has proved to be a shot in the arm for UP police in exposing the networking of racketeers who used to invite illegal weapon manufacturers from Bihar to shape “fined shaped kattas and pistols.” A joint team of UP ATS and Lalganj ( Pratapgarh) police had on Sunday arrested six persons from a house at Asrahi village and seized two country-made pistols of 0.32 bore, two country-made pistols of 0.315 bore, two country-made pistols of 0.12 bore, 23 half made pistols of 0.32 bore, 46 half made pistol’s magazines, 300 live cartridges of 0.32 bore, 17 frames of the country made pistols, 30 other barrels, and other apparatus on the spot. The police have also arrested six persons operating an interstate illegal weapon sale and manufacturing racket and identified them as Shyal Alam alias Chotu, Mohd Sarfaraz Alam, Mohd Azad, all residents of Munger, Triu Pati Nath Verma alias Guddu Gandhi of Gorakhpur, Swalheen Ansari alias Babloo of Lalganj ( Pratapgarh) and his son Aqleen Ansari of Lalganj. Police, however, said that arrested Swalheen Ansari alias Babloo was operating the entire racket of sale and manufacturing illegal weapons unit from his house for the past four to five years and he had been calling katta manufacturers from Bihar on demand for shaping fine shaped kattas and pistols. Police also revealed that Babloo has a vast network of agents working on a commission basis and supplying it to criminals gangs across UP districts. Arrested agent Tiru Pati Nath Verma told police that he had been in the illegal trade of weapons for the past four years and used to come from Gorakhpur to purchase kattas and pistols from Babloo. After purchasing kattas from Pratapgarh, he used to sell them at higher prices in Gorakhpur. He also confessed that he had given Rs 75,000 advance to Babloo about three months back and had demanded kattas and 100 live cartridges from him. Manufacturers from Munger in Bihar, who was arrested by the joint team of ATS and Pratapgarh police told police that they were invited by Babloo for shaping kattas and pistols and all expenses of boarding, travelling and other expenses were paid for by Babloo. Agents, who purchased illegal weapons from Babloo, used to sell them at higher prices in other states and districts. As the Munger made illegal weapons are high in demand among lawbreakers, Babloo found an easy way to invite katta manufactures from Bihar offering them higher prices and selling them to gangs through the agents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/arrest-of-arms-suppliers-by-up-ats-exposes-illegal-weapon-manufacturing-network/articleshow/83524364.cms||---

According to Raj Bhavan sources, the three-member search committee constituted by the chancellor interacted with about 20 shortlisted candidates on Tuesday. The search committee headed by L N Mithila University VC Surendra Pratap Singh consists of B R A Bihar University VC Hanuman Prasad Pandey and noted littérateur Ram Bachan Roy (government nominee). The committee would prepare a panel of three to five names for each university and submit the same to the chancellor. The search committee is likely to shortlist the applicants for the post of the pro-VC of Nalanda Open University on Wednesday for interaction later. The search committees for the appointment of VCs and pro-VCs of other universities are yet to be constituted, sources said. Appointments to the posts of VCs of Munger, Patliputra, Aryabhatta Knowledge, Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian, and Nalanda Open universities besides that of Purnia University are also likely to be made soon. The posts of Pro-VCs of Munger and Veer Kunwar Singh universities have also been advertised by the chancellor’s secretariat. It may be mentioned here that as many as six universities of the state are being managed by “officiating” VCs for the last several months as they do not have regularly appointed VCs. The situation has come to such a pass that one academic has been entrusted with the job of administering as many as four universities simultaneously. In other cases, one academic is handling two universities each simultaneously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/process-begins-to-appoint-vcs-against-vacant-posts/articleshow/83551299.cms||B K Mishra

---||Business||Pandemic helps diversify India’s startup ecosystem||Chennai: A maturing ecosystem and more recently the pandemic has led to the democratization of the country’s startup arena, and reduced the disproportionate investor interest enjoyed by founders from IITs, IIMs and similar ‘elite’ educational institutions. Data from research firm Tracxn show that among top 20 startups who raised early stage investment each year, the proportion of founders belonging to institutions other than IIT or IIM is on the rise. For instance, in 2015, 70% of the top funded startups had either IIT or IIM grads as founders, in 2020 this was down to 44%. Early stage investments (seed and Series A rounds) are typically the toughest for founders to crack, where alma mater plays a huge role in convincing VCs to take a bet on them. While the pedigree bias still exists, entrepreneurs from a variety of backgrounds are now able to access investors and raise money. Since the pandemic struck, almost all investments are being sealed via video conferencing, and investors say they are able to scout and invest in startups located beyond Mumbai or Delhi or Bengaluru, in India’s tier 2 cities. While India’s unicorn list is dominated by IITians, role models are beginning to emerge from ‘non-elite’ institutions, they added. The success of Byju Raveendran (founder of Byju’s), Vijay Shekhar Sharma (Paytm), Ritesh Agarwal (Oyo), and Kunal Shah (Cred), and Kamath brothers (Zerodha), who are not from the typical elite schools, have inspired entrepreneurs in recent years. Anand Lunia, partner of VC firm IndiaQuotient, said investors tend to have an affinity toward their alma mater and those from IITs and IIMs once dominated most of the VC industry. “However, new VC firms are now emerging, started by investors from diverse backgrounds and there is also a larger angel investor community today made up of non IIT/IIM alumni,” he said. Working at large startups is also helping non-IITian founders seal deals, he added. “Today, irrespective of where they studied, entrepreneurs who are resourceful and street smart with a great product and drive to succeed can access investors,” Jatin Desai, managing partner, Inflexor Ventures, said, adding that the VC firm even invested in a cybersecurity company CloudSek started by college dropout Rahul Sashi purely on product’s merit. Anup Jain, managing partner, Orios Venture, says that while educational background is indicative of one’s achievements to an extent, founder profile has turned more diverse in the last few years. “IITians are still starting up but other tier 2 engineering institutions are also coming to the fore and people from non-engineering disciplines are also turning entrepreneurs as the perception of risk goes down,” he said. Serial entrepreneur and investor Rajesh Sawhney, founder, and CEO of GSF Accelerator, says Zoom is democratizing access to investors. “In the last 18 months, most investment decisions have been made on video…We have funded startups from Kota and Pune, and evaluated companies beyond Mumbai or NCR,” he said. Many of these founders are also better positioned to understand the ‘Bharat’ category of customers where opportunities lie for internet companies, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pandemic-helps-diversify-indias-startup-ecosystem/articleshow/83554317.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The book value of the assets on offer are around Rs 12,554 crore and Authum’s bid of Rs 2,887 crore (on a net present value basis) would lead to a 23% immediate recovery for lenders. The Alpana Dangi-promoted Authum is a Mumbai-based NBFC with a focus on capital markets. Once the lenders approve of a bid, they will need to get clearance from the RBI for the company to change hands. The central bank has the power to reject a change in ownership if it feels that the new directors that come in do not meet its fit-and-proper criteria. The second-highest bidder is understood to be Hong Kong-based distressed asset fund ARES SSG along with Assets Care & Reconstruction Enterprise which has bid around Rs 2,770 crore — that works out to a 22% recovery for lenders. The other two bidders are Avenue Capital, another global fund that has bid jointly with Asset Reconstruction Company of India (Arcil), and the NBFC Capri Global. The voting for the best bid and resolution plan for RHF among the lenders concluded on Wednesday. Unlike other large debt resolutions, RHF is being restructured under the June 7, 2019 circular that provides a framework outside the bankruptcy proceedings. The resolution process is being managed by BoB Capital Markets along with management consultants Ernst & Young with Bank of Baroda as the lead bank. Along with RHF, lenders are also pursuing the resolution of Reliance Commercial Finance, another subsidiary of Reliance Capital. Once these two businesses are sold, Reliance Capital will end up resolving nearly Rs 20,000 crore of its debt liabilities. Care Ratings had downgraded RHF and Reliance Commercial Finance to default in 2019. Subsequently, lenders had classified the loan as non-performing and initiated recovery proceedings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/authum-tops-in-rel-home-bids/articleshow/83555662.cms||---

Meanwhile, the health department has floated tenders for procuring 700 neonatal and paediatric ventilators. The Paediatric Task Force, constituted to guide on Covid-19 treatment among the paediatric group during the anticipated third wave, recommended dedicated paediatric intensive care unit(s) at medical college/tertiary unit (one to two per district). The health department has preliminarily decided to add 1,600 paediatric ICU beds to the existing teaching and tertiary hospitals. Andhra Pradesh Medical Service & Infrastructure Development (APMSIDC) has invited bids for providing architectural and engineering consultancy services, including preparation of detailed project reports, for the proposed paediatric super specialty hospitals in Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Tirupati. The state government has recently decided to develop three paediatric super specialty hospitals with Rs 180 crore each in three different regions of the state. As recommended by the Paediatric Task Force, the government has added mothers, with children under the age of five, to the priority Covid-19 vaccination group. The vaccine has so far been administered to more than three lakh mothers. The health department has also decided to add several paediatric procedures and treatment protocols to Aarogyasri cover. The department will also conduct capacity building programmes for staff to prepare them to deal with the anticipated increase in paediatric Covid-19 cases. According to the projections, the state may witness 18 lakh new Covid-19 cases during the third wave. Of these new infections, it is estimated that 4.5 lakh children below 18 years may contract the virus. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Anil Kumar Singhal, said teaching hospitals would get 1,600 more paediatric ICU beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradesh-braces-for-the-third-covid-wave/articleshow/83552020.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Residents have shown interest in buying these devices, in anticipation of a possible third wave. Many families in the city experienced problems in buying essential medicines and medical devices during May when the second wave was at its peak. Medical dealers in the city increased the cost of pulse oximetre to Rs 3,000, a device that is usually available in medical and surgical stores for between Rs 650 to Rs 900. Similarly, many patients who underwent treatment while in home isolation and were in need of medical oxygen had to face a huge shortage at the peak of the second wave. These families are now buying oxygen concentrators at an exorbitant price. A few traders from the city had cashed in on the situation and were selling non-branded concentrators at around Rs 1.2 lakhs. The situation came under control only after the health wing and drug control authorities stepped in with corrective measures. The price of an oxygen concentrator with a capacity of seven litres per minute is now Rs 40,000 in the city. The cost of pulse oximeters has also reduced to Rs 700. With prices coming down, residents can be seen queueing up outside stores to buy these devices at a cheaper price. “We have been receiving a huge number of orders for oxygen concentrators in the last ten days. Many patients who recovered from Covid-19 are still in need of oxygen and their families are buying oxygen concentrators. Similarly, many families are buying these devices with the fear of the third wave and the Delta variant of Covid-19,” said Lavu Raghava Naidu, a surgical trader from Nakkal Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/locals-in-vij-stock-up-on-medical-devices/articleshow/83552143.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Patna||Chirag Paswan’s wrong decisions ruined LJP, it will now emerge stronger: Pashupati Kumar Paras||The LJP parliamentary party leader in Lok Sabha,Pashupati Kumar Paras, is confident of getting the approval of the party’s national council as the new party president. In an exclusive interview with TOI’s Jai Narain Pandey, Paras bares it all as to why he ousted his nephew Chirag Paswan from the party posts. Excerpts:What triggered the overnight coup in the party and prompted you to take over its reins from Chirag?There was nothing overnight. In fact, the fire in the party had been simmering against Chirag’s decisions during assembly elections for the last eight months. LJP leaders and workers put pressure on me to take over the reins or else the party will not survive. Because of the wrong decisions of Chirag, LJP slumped from 4th to below 8th place in Bihar. Our lone MLA and MLC also switched over to ruling parties. Being the brother of Ram Vilas ji, I could not digest all this. What was wrong with Chirag?When my elder brother Ram Vilas ji handed over the LJP to Chirag, he allowed an outsider to control the party as well as the family. Ram Vilas was ill, and he also did not intervene. We had been in NDA since 2014 and won the two consecutive Lok Sabha elections in Bihar. The party’s rank and file wanted to contest the assembly election as part of the NDA, but Chirag committed a hara-kiri by deciding to support one NDA ally (BJP) and oppose the other (JD-U). It never happens in politics. What next? How will you lead the party?Since 95% of the party workers and leaders are with me, the party’s national council meeting will be held in Patna within the next five days to approve my election as party president. LJP will emerge as a strong party as it was me who used to look after its organisational matters as Dalit Sena chief. I have been a 7-time MLA, one-term MLC and was minister four times. Is there any JD(U) role in the entire story as the party wanted a revenge on Chirag whose decision to oppose Nitish and his candidates damaged the party prospects in the assembly election? Is there any talk of a merger with JD(U)?No way. It’s all media gossips. No other party has any role to play in our matter. LJP is a cadre-based party and its Dalit Sena has workers in every nook and corner of Bihar. Did JD(U) MP Rajeev Ranjan alias Lallan Singh attend the meeting of the five LJP MPs at Vaishali MP’s residence in Delhi on Monday to chalk out the next plan?He had been invited over lunch only. You did not meet Chirag when he visited your house after the latest developments in LJP. Why?I was not at home. He is my nephew and is welcome to remain the part and parcel of the party. Whatever decision I took was under compulsion to save the party. Only leadership has changed, nothing else. You like CM Nitish Kumar and your statement on the election eve had earned Chirag’s wrath. How are your equations with the CM?Yes, I support Nitish who has done a lot for the development of Bihar.

The officials of the water resources department (WRD) and the disaster management department (DMD) have also been put on the alert. Chairing a review meeting meeting through videoconferencing, Nitish also asked the DMs to inform the families living in the low-lying areas beside the Gandak river about the floodwaters through intensive propaganda by loudspeakers, so that the action of evacuation, if situation demands, could be executed speedily. The CM asked the WRD officials to depute its engineers on all vulnerable points of the embankments alongside Gandak river to ensure its protection. Nitish further asked the officials to keep the NDRF and SDRF teams, already deputed in the districts, on high alert so that quick action could be taken in any adverse situation. WRD minister Sanjay Kumar Jha was also present at the review meeting. Earlier, WRD secretary Sanjiv Hans informed the CM that there was a possibility of high rise in the water level of Gandak river in the wake of heavy downpour in its catchment areas in Nepal. Hans also assured the CM that the WRD was fully alert in the wake of heavy discharge of water in the river from Nepal side. A senior WRD engineer told TOI that a major part of Nepal had been witnessing heavy downpour for the last three days because of the early arrival of monsoon there. “Excessive rainfall over the past three days in the Himalayan foothills have led to dangerously high water levels in all the tributaries that meet in Gandak river in central Nepal. Now, the rainwater is running towards Bihar borders. Most of the rivers in central Nepal are these days flowing above their respective danger marks, which has led to concern in the Bihar government,” the engineer, who did not want to be identified, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-bihar-districts-put-on-high-alert-as-heavy-rain-lashes-nepal/articleshow/83553402.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Patna||LJP cadres divided over support to two factions||PATNA: The members of Paswan community feel shocked over the upheaval in the LJP founded by Dalit leader late Ram Vilas Paswan about 21 years ago even before his ‘barsi’ (one year). “I am yet to overcome the shock following the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, who was popular among all sections of society,” said Awadhesh Singh, former representative of senior Paswan in Hajipur Lok Sabha constituency. Majority of the residents of Hajipur, Mahnar and Mahua subdivisions in Vaishali district, which have a sizeable population of Paswan community, still repose faith in the leadership of Ram Vilas's son . “Though the coup is not good in the larger interest of the party, it’s sure that Chirag will have an edge over rebels in the days to come. He will now emerge as the sole leader of LJP like Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in RJD,” said Gopi Paswan of Sultanpur in Vaishali. Ram Vilas was elected as MP from Hajipur with record margins. “It was because of the senior Paswan's popularity that his younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras won from Hajipur in 2019 elections,” said Mantu Paswan of Chamrahra village near Mahnar. The workers of LJP of Samastipur, from where Chirag's cousin and rebel Prince Raj won on the LJP ticket, said it would be a litmus test for Chirag to prove his political acumen. Prince, the LJP state president, is the son of former Samastipur MP late Ram Chandra Paswan. However, some people from Alouli from where Paras (the leader of the party rebels) was earlier elected to the state assembly, said it was expected after the death of Ram Vilas. “It’s Chirag's autocratic attitude, which led to the coup in the party. He seldom interacts with the workers. He doesn’t even respond to phone calls from the people of his native district,” said Mukesh Paswan of Alouli Bazar. A group of people belonging to the Paswan community from Nawada said the coup was a fallout of internal conflict in the Paswan's family. “Paras was sidelined by Chirag ever since he was nominated as national president of the party,” said Vivek Paswan, a diehard supporter of LJP. Most of the party workers are confused as to whom to support as both the warring groups belong to the same family. However, a large section of people from Hajipur oppose the national executive meeting to be held in Patna by the rebels. Meanwhile, a group of Chirag supporters created a scene outside the party office in Patna and shouted slogans against rebels led by Paras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljp-cadres-divided-over-support-to-two-factions/articleshow/83553195.cms||Ramashankar

His bullet missed the target and hit the cousin of the bride, killing him on the spot. Pratapgarh police on Wednesday arrested the accused identified as Vivek Singh in connection with the killing of the bride’s cousin, Prem Singh (38). Prem died of a gunshot wound at the wedding of his sister on Tuesday night . After the arrest, the accused Vivek confessed that he was in love with the bride, and fired a shot targeting the groom in order to stop the wedding. However, he missed the target and the bullet hit Prem, the bride’s cousin, killing him on the spot. The incident took place at Saraykher Kha village under Raniganj police station of Pratapgarh on Tuesday night. Police are also looking for the accomplice of the prime accused who was reportedly with him at the time of the incident. Deputy SP (Raniganj) Dr Atul Anjan Tripathi told TOI that the prime accused, Vivek Singh, a resident of Madartara village has been arrested in connection with the killing of Prem Singh (38), a resident of Saraykher Kha Lohartara village. Police, meanwhile, said that the marriage of one Nigam Singh’s daughter was to be solemnised at Saraykher Kha Lohartara village on Tuesday night. The groom’s party had come from Delhi. When the welcome ceremony was taking place and the cousin of the bride, Prem, was busy in arrangements, the accused Vivek, who was in love with the bride, arrived at the venue and opened fire targeting the groom. The bullet, however, hit Prem and left him critically injured. The family members took him to the district hospital where doctors pronounced him brought dead. Upon being alerted, a team of Raniganj police rushed to the spot and carried out preliminary investigations. The DSP said, “Initially, the police suspected it to be a case of celebratory firing, but a detailed investigation stunned senior cops. When Vivek Singh was arrested in connection with the firing incident, he himself confessed his intentions.” Following the investigations, an FIR under Section 302 of IPC was registered at Raniganj police station against two persons—Vivek Singh and his accomplice Firoz Alam. While Vivek has been arrested, his accomplice Firoz is still on the run. The DSP said that Vivek had been threatening the girl and his family of dire consequences if they dared to fix her marriage with someone else. The bride’s father told police that the accused had made futile attempts to prevent the fixing of his daughter’s marriage several times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/jilted-lover-aims-to-kill-groom-in-pratapgarh-village/articleshow/83583862.cms||---

The vigilance team led by DSP Surendra Kumar Mauaar also recovered Rs11 lakh from from below the bed cushion in his flat after a search operation. A simultaneous and separate raid led by vigilance DSP Satyanayaran Ram was also conducted in Arwal where state food corporation (SFC) assistant manager Mohammad Salahuddin (39) was nabbed for allegedly accepting Rs25,000 as bribe from one Dhirendra Kumar at his rented accommodation at Jaiprakash Nagar. In the East Champaran case, vigilance sources said the contractor had constructed Majhaulia-Sundarpur village road in RWD’s Dhaka division. The project was worth several lakhs but payment was not cleared. “Bablu met the engineer but he was directed to meet Srivastava. The data operator asked Bablu to pay 1.5% of the total payment as bribe for bill clearance. The amount was coming around Rs80,000,” a vigilance source said. Bablu lodged a complaint with the vigilance bureau, which verified the allegation and found it to be true. “The engineer was arrested soon after Bablu gave him the bribe. The data operator was also arrested soon after he entered the flat,” the officer said. He said Paswan failed to explain about the source of Rs11 lakh which was kept in his flat. He said Paswan is a native of Supaul and Srivastava belongs to Motihari. In the Arwal raid, sources said Salahuddin had demanded Rs25,000 from Dhirendra to make entry of his one truck rice in the district's SFC storage database. “Dhirendra is the PACS president of Sarauti panchayat. His rice worth around Rs7.5 lakh was already deposited by Salahuddin in the storage, but entry was not made,” another vigilance source said. He said the bribe was demanded to make this entry. The source said Salahuddin is a native of Dehri-on-Sone in Rohtas district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/engr-held-for-accepting-rs-80000-bribe-rs-11l-recovered-from-bed/articleshow/83548805.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Altogether 97 interdistrict private and government buses were operated from the ISBT involving 2,000 passengers on the first day. While 57 buses arrived at ISBT, 40 departed from there on the inaugural day. Buses for four districts – Nalanda, Nawada, Sheikhpura and Jamui – are being operated from the ISBT in the first phase. These buses were shifted from the congested Mithapur bus stand. Buses for other districts are targeted to be operated from the ISBT by the next month. Altogether 13 buses were fined for disobedience under the Motor Vehicles Act and Rs 34,500 was realised as fine from their operators. Patna district transport officer Purushottam said 13 bus drivers did not follow the order and started taking passengers from the Mithapur bus stand for Nalanda, Nawada, Sheikhpura and Jamui. “A team of transport officials was deputed at Mithapur to ensure that the buses take passengers from the ISBT. We spent all day to shift buses to the new terminus. It will take 5-6 days to streamline all the buses,” he said. Purushottam added, “The footfall of passengers on the first was more than 2,000 as the buses are running with 50% capacity.” At the terminal, people were made aware about the arrival and departure of buses through public address system. Since the ticket counters have not been made operational yet, passengers were seen collecting tickets from bus conductors. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said the ticket counters would be allotted to the bus operators soon. “Parking bays have been created for drivers to park their buses. We have also identified a location for buses for washing, cleaning and sanitization as the construction of workshop station is still on. Buses to all districts originating from Patna will leave from ISBT from July-end,” he said. According to the DM, the buses in the terminal will be parked on a ‘first-come, first- served’ basis. “The fuel station and electric charging station for e-buses will also come up at the ISBT soon,” Singh said. Spread over 25 acres of land, the ISBT has a capacity to facilitate 3,000 bus trips per day. As far as parking bays are concerned, there are 72 departure and 68 arrival platforms. It has four separate multi-storey blocks – Block A for arrival for buses, Block B for departure, Block C to connect the first two blocks and Block D for commercial use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/isbt-2000-passengers-travel-by-97-buses-on-inaugural-day/articleshow/83551395.cms||Faryal Rumi

Police had on June 6 arrested 39 persons, besides confiscated 29 vehicles following registration of an FIR at the district’s Civil Lines police station against Yadav and 200 others on charges of taking out a celebratory procession on the Etawah-Auraiya highway allegedly with a huge number of vehicles in violation of the Covid-19 protocol on June 5. The video of the procession was widely circulated on social media platforms. Taking serious note of pandemic violations, seven policemen including two inspectors, each from Auraiya and Etawah, besides three SIs and three constables, were suspended, while a deputy SP rank official, was shunted, over dereliction of duty. The police had also announced a reward of Rs 25,000 and were conducting raids to make Yadav’s arrest possible. Senior superintendent of police Etawah Brijesh Kumar Singh on Monday confirmed to TOI the arrest of Yadav. “He was arrested from Gate No 3 while on way to surrender in the court,” he added. The SSP said that there was a specific input about Yadav surrendering before the court following which a trap was laid and he was arrested jointly by the Civil Line Police and the Crime Branch on Monday. “Yadav was released from the district jail of Etawah in the evening on June 4, and on June 5 he took out a celebratory procession with his supporters from outside the jail,” he said. After the video of the procession went viral on social media, a case against Yadav and his 200 supporters was registered under sections 188, 269, 270 of the IPC along with 7 Criminal Law Act and Epidemic Act at the Civil Lines police station. Subsequently, police teams were formed in search of Yadav. However, 39 people involved in Yadav’s procession were nabbed. Police also confiscated 29 vehicles, but Yadav continues to evade police arrest, said the official further. “He has been taken to the Civil Lines police station where he is being questioned by the investigating team,” the official added.

The jump was driven by the solution business, which grew 76.7% sequentially. Compared to the year-ago period, revenues were down 33.7 % due to Covid. For full year FY21, revenue was Rs 266.8 crore, the operator of India’s No.1 FM radio channel Radio Mirchi said on Tuesday while announcing the fourth quarter results. ENIL reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (ebitda) of Rs 24 crore for the quarter and Rs 16.3 crore for the full year. The company said its balance sheet remains strong with cash reserves of Rs 218.3 crore as on March 31, 2021. Its profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter without exceptional items was Rs 70.3 lakh. ENIL made an impairment provision of Rs 97.5 crore in its Mirchi Love and Kool businesses because of the Covid-induced stress. The company said that its core Mirchi Brand continues to be strong even in these troubled times. As a result of the impairment provision, Q4 loss was Rs 65.7 crore, while the corresponding number for the full year was a loss of Rs 109.3 crore. The board recommended a dividend of Re 1 per equity share of Rs 10 each for the financial year 2020-21 at its meeting held on June 15. Commenting on the results, ENIL MD & CEO Prashant Panday said, “It was a tough quarter, but one with several positive news. Ad volumes grew over last year, indicating a return of advertisers to the medium. The solutions business turned in higher gross profits than last year, despite lower revenues. A very exciting feature is the share of digital revenues which grew to nearly 11.5% of revenues, indicating strong traction for the company’s digital assets. Operating costs fell by 32%. And while the impairment provision is unfortunate, we will strive to overturn its impact as the economy revives.” ENIL said its cost-cutting initiatives continue to yield savings with other operating costs (including event-related DVCs) down by 39% over the same quarter of previous year. FY21 overall cost including DVC reduced by 37.4% over last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mirchi-q4-revenue-up-17-qoq-in-tough-quarter/articleshow/83555584.cms||---

In comparison, the global average of digital footprint created by users stood at 15 new online accounts . Those aged over 50 created about 27 new online accounts during the pandemic. A large part of this digital activity is also here to stay as 36% Indians say they do not plan to delete or deactivate any of the new accounts created during the pandemic. India also fared better than other nations in users’ focus on digital security, especially in managing secure access. For instance, while digital accounts overload led to password fatigue in India with nearly half (47%) Indians ‘mostly or always’ reusing same passwords for various accounts, this was still better than the global average (82%) and other key economies like Australia (79%) and South Korea (59%). Over 70% of respondents in India have used two-factor or multi-factor authentication to access an online account across all time periods compared to around 67% globally, the study showed. However, at times, the contactless service offered by digital platforms outweighed the security risks for Indian users. 57% said they would rather place an order digitally than go and transact physically even if they had concerns about the website or app’s safety or privacy. The global average stood at 51%. Four in ten (39%) users also said they allow an application to track activities across other apps and websites, when asked. Prashant Bhatkal, security software sales leader, IBM Technology Sales, India/South Asia said consumers have become accustomed to the convenience of digital interactions during the pandemic, and this trend is expected to continue even after society returns to pre-pandemic norms. “To assure the greatest levels of security, companies in India must adopt a ‘zero-trust’ approach, develop and understand the context around every user, every device, and every interaction making it a mission-critical agenda,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-reliance-on-digital-tech-more-sustained-study/articleshow/83554561.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The association said that the controversies in the tree felling case were defaming the department and amounted to an insult for forest officers. Government should not crucify officers who implemented its order and the association offered its support to bring out the truth in this matter. In a statement, the association said that trees were cut using an order issued by revenue department on Oct 24, 2020 and no trees were cut from forest land but Pattaya land. "Forest department has only issued transit pass to transport wooden logs which were cut from the trees situated in revenue land following an order issued by revenue department. Forest officers have no resources to ensure the validity of certificates issued by revenue department officials based on GO and political pressure. Hence, even if there were doubts about the ownership of the trees; it is difficult to clear it. Range officers and association had sent letters to higher officials on the issue several times but no guidelines were issued," said the statement signed by association president Saju TS and association general secretary Dhaniklal. The association said that it was due to the efforts of forest officers, including range officers, which brought out the activities of the mafia engaged in illegal tree felling. Forest officers have not failed to protect trees grown on forest land. "Picturising forest officers as corrupts in the name of tree felling on revenue land demotivates entire officers of the department. If forest officers are made scapegoats by taking disciplinary action, we will be forced to launch severe protests," the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/attempt-to-blame-forest-officers/articleshow/83556762.cms||---

On Tuesday, the index opened 200 points higher and scaled a new intraday peak of 52,870 and closed at 52,773, up 222 points. On the NSE too, the Nifty scaled a new high at 15,902 points and closed at 15,869, up 57 points on the day. So far this month, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net bought stocks worth $2.3 billion, or about Rs 17,000 crore, combined data from CDSL and BSE showed. The month’s net infusions came after two consecutive months of net outflow. The reversal in FPI flows came on the back of strong resilience shown by leading Indian companies across sectors despite the pandemic-induced lockdowns in May and June, falling new daily Covid cases in recent weeks and a slow but steady rollout of vaccines across the country, market players said. In the process, the market is ignoring the rising inflation numbers including the WPI that rose above the double-digit mark last month and also the more-than-expected consumer inflation number. “Market ignored the CPI data which came in at 6.3% in May, higher than expectations on account of increase in food & energy prices,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head (retail research), Motilal Oswal Financial Services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-nears-53k-on-fpi-buying-spree/articleshow/83555761.cms||---

Ghanshyam Prajapati, 28, who worked as a casual labourer, lost his wife Lata six months ago. Lata died while giving birth to their third child, a baby boy. Ghanshyam, a resident of Ekta Society, a slum area near central warehouse near Borsad crossroads in Anand city, left a note mentioning that he was not able to cope up with his wife’s death. “He has mentioned in the note that he was missing her. He was under depression. After wife’s death, her parents were taking care of their six-month-old son. He also mentioned that he is taking his two daughters along with him,” said B D Jadeja, deputy superintendent of police, Anand. Neighbours in Ekta Society found the trio dead after breaking open the main door of the house on Tuesday morning. While two girls – Priyanshi, 7 and Mansi, 3 were lying on the floor, Ghanshyam’s was found hanging from the ceiling. Cops have learnt that the two girls were playing outside their house till late on Monday night while Ghanshyam himself was playing a popular mobile game till around 1 am. On Tuesday morning, neighbours got suspicious after the family did not open the door even as the milk delivery man kept knocking on the door for quite some time. Cops are waiting for the postmortem report to ascertain whether the father strangulated his two daughters or made them consume any poisonous substance. Ironically, in his note, the man has mentioned even details of the two bank accounts that he holds. Sources said that the man, a native of Dudhwada village of Vadodara’s Padra taluka, himself had lost his parents at an early age.

The flight had operated last on April 9 and after that it has remained suspended. Station manager of Air India Arindam Chattopadyay said the flight would remain suspended till July 31 due to government’s guidelines that only 50% of flights would operate in the country. Air India officials said they have been receiving queries from residents who want to travel by air, but are helpless due to the government’s instructions. They added that the number of such queries was not high, but people were willing to travel by air, which was considered safe, as situation has improved on the Covid front. Sources at the airport said the airlines has fewer number of ATR 72-seater flights and has to cater to multiple centres so that could be a reason for not operating the Ludhiana-Delhi flight. They added that since a sizeable percentage of residents have got vaccinated and second wave has receded in Ludhiana and Delhi, people have started inquiring about the flight. Airport officials said that flights were suspended around April 9 as the occupancy was less than half on most of the days for around a month. Residents are disappointed with the suspension of flight since early April. “I have to frequently travel to Delhi for business. Since the start of the pandemic and after lockdown ended last year, I have been travelling by air as it is safer than road travel. So it is upsetting for persons like me. Even buyers are not coming to Ludhiana because of such hindrances, which have resulted in losses to business,” said Manpreet Singh, a city-based businessman. Low occupancy The data of Delhi-Ludhiana flights indicates that during the first 20 days of March, the average occupancy of the flight was mostly below 50%. It was 52.14% on March 20 and had fallen to 30% by March 27 when the last flight operated in the month. In April, the average flight occupancy was between 31.4 to 37.14%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/delhi-flight-will-remain-suspended-till-july-31/articleshow/83551921.cms||Shariq Majeed

The doctors will, however, continue to attend to Covid and emergency patients. The national headquarters of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) had issued a call for this protest which was endorsed by the state branch of the association. IMA national president-elect Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh said Ramdev’s remarks misled a large population and pushed the country a decade back in health awareness. “It was after Ramdev’s insulting comments that many people began avoiding vaccines and even engaged in scuffles with the immunisation teams. Action should be taken against Ramdev under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897,” he said. Dr Singh urged PM Narendra Modi to speak a few words in his popular interactive programme, ‘Mann ki Baat’, to boost the morale of the country’s doctors who have been uninterruptedly fighting the battle against the pandemic. Acting president of state IMA Dr Ajay Kumar said Ramdev insulted the doctors and the line of treatment being followed to help people beat Covid infection. He also expressed concern over rising violence against doctors. “At least 25 cases of acts of violence during the two waves of Covid came to the notice of the IMA in Bihar,” Dr Kumar said. A case against Ramdev was earlier lodged by IMA state secretary Dr Sunil Kumar at a police station here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ramdevs-remarks-doctors-four-hour-stir-on-friday/articleshow/83551520.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Business||NCLT doubts Videocon’s sale remained confidential||Mumbai: In its order approving the resolution plan submitted by Vedanta for the Videocon Group, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has raised doubts over maintenance of confidentiality during the process. NCLT has highlighted how Vedanta’s bid was close to the liquidation value, which is a secret. Pointing out that the successful applicant was paying “almost nothing” and the creditors were taking a haircut of 95.9%, the tribunal has called upon the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to review bankruptcy regulations. Under the resolution plan, out of the total claim amount of Rs 71,433 crore of creditors, claims admitted are for Rs 64,838 crore and the plan that was approved was for an amount of only Rs 2,962 crore, which is just 4.15% recovery and the total haircut to all the creditors is 95.85%. The court also compared the 99.3% haircut that the operational creditors had to take with a “tonsure” or “total shave”. In its order, the NCLT requested lenders and the buyer to pay more to operational creditors, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises. The order appointed R K Agarwal, former whole-time member at Sebi, as an observer and permanent invitee in the steering committee to ensure smooth functioning and change over to the successful resolution applicant. What comes out from the order is that the winning bid by Vedanta is very close to the liquidation value. The assenting creditors get 4.9% of their money back, which is in proportion to what is paid by the successful applicant. Dissenting creditors in this case will get 4.6%, which is in proportion to the liquidation value as estimated by lenders. “Surprisingly, the resolution applicant (Vedanta) also valued all the assets and liabilities of all the 13 companies and arrived at almost the same value of the registered valuers. According to regulations, the liquidation value and fair market value is kept confidential and informed to the committee of creditors (CoC) members only at the time of finalising the resolution plan and even in the present case the resolution bids were opened in the 15th CoC meeting held on September 2, 2020, wherein liquidation value and fair market value was informed to the members of CoC,” the court observed in its order. “Given the facts and circumstances as discussed above, a doubt arises upon the confidentiality clause being in real-time use. Therefore, we request IBBI to examine this issue in depth to ensure the confidentiality clause is followed, without any compromise in letter and spirit by all the concerned parties, entities connected in the CIRP,” the order said. The order goes on to say that alternatively, the IBBI can frame appropriate regulations, safeguards thereby maximising the value of the assets of the corporate debtor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-doubts-videocons-sale-remained-confidential/articleshow/83555706.cms||---

The miscreants also damaged a police vehicle in heavy stone-pelting. Police suspect the liquor smugglers had made a call to the helpline number to invite them to the village and attack them. The raiding team consisting of assistant sub-inspector VN Manjhi, constables Premjeet Singh and Raghunandan Thakur and a driver was returning from the village after failing to find anything suspicious when they were surrounded and heavily pelted with stones. Manjhi and Singh sustained head injury. Thakur escaped with a minor injury. Soon after the incident, a reinforcement of more than 100 armed police personnel was rushed to the village. A search operation was launched and it continued till Tuesday morning. Almost all the villagers except a few women and children fled soon after the reinforcement reached the village. At least 25 armed police personnel are still deployed there. More than six persons from the village have been detained for interrogation to know about those involved in attacking the police team. Sadar SDPO Sandeep Singh told TOI over phone that it would become clear only after investigation that whether the call made on the helpline number informing about suspected liquor smuggling in the village was a trap. “The villagers in the area were traditionally involved in country liquor manufacturing. They get irked over police raids. However, nothing objectionable was found there on Monday night and the raiding team led by the ASI was returning when heavy stone-pelting started,” the SDPO said. He said it was dark and raining and fields were filled with water, making things extremely difficult for the policemen. “Premjeet fell in a field while trying to save his life and lost his rifle,” he said. Singh said the rifle was recovered from the place where the constable had fallen to the ground. “Raids are going on to nab those involved in attacking the police team,” he added. However, Parsa Bazaar police station SHO cum DSP (probation) Priya Jyoti told TOI that a liquor smuggler had taken away the constable’s rifle in the night and it was recovered by the police from the village on Tuesday morning. “Premjeet was hit on the back of his head by a stone. He fell down and lost consciousness for a few moments,” Jyoti said, adding further investigation is going on in connection with the attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/three-cops-injured-during-raid-on-liquor-smugglers/articleshow/83548949.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Monsoon showers have added to the woes of people as main roads dug up for laying sewerage pipes by the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (Buidco) three years ago have not been repaired yet. According to sources, Buidco had assigned the task of laying sewerage pipes in the locality to a private firm in 2018. The company concerned had dug up the main roads and bylanes of the locality in June 2018 to complete the project. Under the plan, each house of the locality was to be connected with the sewerage pit. Unfortunately, most houses are yet to be connected with the sewerage system. “Concrete roads were badly damaged as the roads were dug up for laying sewerage pipes. The work completely stopped due to the Covid pandemic and locals are now forced to live in a miserable condition,” said a Kalyani Nagar resident. Shankar, another resident of Kalyani Nagar under ward number 11 of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “Sewerage system has not been made functional even this monsoon. Waterlogging has been a perennial problem in the locality.” Project manager and incharge of the ongoing project of the private firm, Sarvanand, said it was the responsibility of the PMC to repair the damaged roads. He said the company was authorised to lay the sewerage pipes only. Power supply too continues to be erratic in the locality during evening hours. Power pilferage is said to be one of the reasons for frequent interruptions in power supply in Mitra Mandal Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dug-up-roads-add-to-rain-woes-at-anisabad/articleshow/83553049.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Business||Cos can achieve success by improving work experience||By Sonica AronMuch has been written and spoken about employee experience and it has never been more critical than in the current turbulent times. An organisation might have the greatest product or the most superlative service offering, the most sophisticated machinery, the most streamlined and efficient processes. But at the end of the day, it is the people who market and sell those products and services, and run those machines and processes. Products, services, machines and processes — all will get obsolete or will get revamped or will depreciate. But the trust, loyalty, tacit knowledge and experience that the workforce carries only appreciates with time. Employee experience & expectations Therefore, it becomes imperative in challenging times that we pay special attention to the employee experience that we are providing to our workforce. There is direct correlation between employee experience and talent attraction, engagement and retention and, therefore, organisational productivity and profitability. Employee experience is an employee’s perceptions and feelings about their journey through all the touchpoints with their organisation, starting with selection process till the exit. While HR policies and practices have a strong role to play, most employees experience organisations in multiple ways — through their team members, their informal network, the physical and virtual infrastructure, but most importantly through their manager. Employee expectations from organisations have evolved with time, and it is important to take note of the evolving demographics of the workforce as well as the impact of the pandemic. Up to 46% of the Indian workforce comprises millennials and India has the largest generation-Z workforce. According to the ninth Deloitte global millennial survey, this workforce wants to work for purpose-driven organisations, wants adequate time off to stay stress-free, and wants organisations to take cognisance of the emotional wellbeing needs of employees. The pandemic too has changed a lot for people. The way of life as we have known has undergone a significant shift. Priorities have changed. Our way of consuming things, celebrating life, being entertained, unwinding, destressing, valuing relationships — everything has changed. Employee experience, what used to be viewed as touchpoints along the life stages within the organisation, will now need to be viewed more holistically as employee experience at different life stages in an employees’ life. This is a massive shift which organisations, HR, leaders and managers will need to make and integrate in their interaction with their people as well as in their policies and processes. An experience is something which is felt, not through one medium but many. Therefore, everyone will have a role to play in building the desired employee experience. Role of leadershipLeadership will play an important role in not only integrating the overarching purpose of the organisation but also setting the tone for a culture that is built on curiosity, empathy and transparency. Curiosity to understand the lived realities of each and every employee and what they really need at different life stages — professional and personal, to be able to stay stress-free and productive, engaged and effective. Empathy to be able to come up with solutions that work for a diverse workforce, to be able to put people first should the need arise, to be able to listen without judging. Transparency in all decision-making and communication to build and enhance trust. Role of HR HR will need to come up with real-time solutions, and they have. A large number of companies have rolled out employee-friendly policies to help people tide over the extremely challenging time that the second wave of the pandemic has brought. These include extending medical insurance, providing trauma counselling, offering bereavement and compassionate packages, providing mandatory downtime for employees to heal, having a food delivery service, giving access to self-quarantine facilities, organising vaccination camps, and a lot more. However, this has been crisis management. Another challenge looming large is the emotional wellbeing of employees who are parallelly struggling with deliverables, long working hours, stretch targets, fatigue with the ongoing pandemic and the uncertainty. As the second wave abates, which it will, the fear of the third wave will exist. Normalcy is not returning any time soon. Building an ongoing psychologically safe work environment through policies, processes, communication will be an ongoing effort. Role of managers Direct managers play the most critical role in how an employee experiences the organisation. Whether all the well-intentioned policies are implemented in spirit, the team culture is reflective of curiosity, empathy and transparency — all depends largely on the manager. This chapter was never a part of any managerial development journey and managers are also learning on the job. Balancing between business deliverables and team member well-being, ensuring a smooth employee experience virtually or in hybrid working models — it’s all new to them too. This is a capability which will need bolstering across organisations through 2021 for sustainable success. At the end of the day, it will augur well to remember that one size does not fit all. Flexible and customised experiences which meet the needs of a diverse workforce, people from different walks of life, with different perspectives, life stages, genders, orientations, abilities, experiences and aspirations must be woven into the fabric of the organisation.

On Monday, Paras virtually dethroned his nephew and Ram Vilas’ son Chirag Paswan from the party president’s post, as he grouped together four of the six LJP Lok Sabha members around himself to become the parliamentary party leader. After Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday recognized the five LJP MPs as the real party on the floor of the House, Paras asked the Election Commission to recognize the breakaway group as the real LJP, which, in turn, would pave the way to his elevation as the party’s national president. Technically, Chirag still is the party president. As the sources said on Tuesday, both Paras and Chirag were having legal consultations to stake their respective claim to the LJP. While Paras is mulling over becoming the party’s new national president, its formalization would require the endorsement by the national council. Curiously, Chirag had dissolved both the national council and state executive committees in February this year. Yet, the question that has been haunting is why did Paras effect the coup in the LJP, or why did Chirag lose the track of the secret story he had written? On the face of it, it required two deaths – of Samastipur MP and Dalit Sena chief Ram Chandra Paswan on July 21, 2019, and of Ram Vilas on October 8, 2021 – and the vaulting vaulting ambition of Chirag to be not only the “head boss” in the LJP, but also in total command of the party in a short spell of time for the plot to move. It all started two months after the death of Ram Chandra, as Ram Vilas, on September 24, 2019, removed Paras from the post of the LJP state chief and made him Dalit Sena head. He also made Chirag in-charge of the party’s state unit. While Prince Raj, son of Ram Chandra, was made the LJP state chief by Chirag on October 26, 2019, the decision caused a first sign of rift in the famously united “Paswan family”, with Paras feeling both wounded and slighted. Chirag became the LJP national president on November 28, 2019 to find a footing for himself in the state’s politics through the assembly elections next year. From February-March 2020, Chirag, in the run-up to the October-November assembly elections, took anti-CM Nitish (Kumar) line and, in fact, walked out of the NDA. He set up most of his party candidates against the JD(U) contestants that worsted JD(U)’s performance under Nitish, even as the LJP could win only one seat. Nonetheless, Nitish waited for his day to avenge it. From here, Chirag was caught in his own trap. He, on February 23 this year, installed the party’s former MLA Raju Tiwari as the working state president, which humiliated Prince Raj, and left yet another wounded member from the family by the wayside. By April, Paras had already been cultivated by the BJP, which, after its rout in the West Bengal assembly elections, needed Nitish and his JD(U) both in the state and nationally. By implication, Chirag had become an expendable commodity, and the LJP could continue to be in the NDA, which was to the liking of Nitish, too. Through the coup enacted by Paras, Nitish has avenged the injury caused to him by Chirag, but the BJP, both nationally and in the state, is the real victor, as it has found two allies back in the fold placed strongly – JD(U) and LJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/slighted-paras-took-nearly-2-years-to-effect-coup-in-ljp/articleshow/83553108.cms||Abhay Singh

The defense counsel was present in the court room while the CBI counsel was connected virtually. The court hearing lasted for about two hours before the matter was posted for June 18. Earlier, due to Covid-19 curfew in the state, case hearing was deferred five times. On April 28, the court of special judge of Shimla had convicted accused Anil Kumar alias Neelu Charani after holding him guilty of the crime on all four charges. The court was first to pronounce the quantum of sentence on May 11, but the hearing was deferred by a week due to the imposition Covid curfew in the state, then to May 28, June 3 and then June 8. When the convict was presented before the court on June 8, the court posted the matter to June 15. The defence counsel argued against death penalty to the convict, saying his mother was dependent on him. However, the CBI counsel argued that the convict had two more brothers and they could take care of his mother. A minor girl had gone missing in Kotkhai on July 4, 2017, and her body was found from the forests two days later. The post-mortem report had confirmed rape and murder and a case was registered. The incident had led to massive public outcry and massive protest demonstrations were held across the state. BOX SC refuses to hear ex-IGP’s plea for restoration of bail New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea for restoration of bail to former Himachal Pradesh IGP Zahur Haider Zaidi in a custodial death case, saying that attempting to influencing a witness, who is a senior IPS officer, is a “very important” charge. Zaidi, one of the accused in the case related to the custodial death of a man who was among those arrested on charge of gang-raping a minor school girl in Kotkhai in Shimla district in 2017, was granted bail on April 6, 2019, by the top court which later transferred the case from Shimla to Chandigarh. The special trial court at Chandigarh, in January 2020, cancelled Zaidi’s bail after a prosecution witness and IPS officer Soumya Sambasivan alleged that she was being pressured by him to influence the trial. “If you can attempt to influence an IPS officer then you can influence and tamper with other witnesses also,” said a vacation bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M R Shah.

---||Pune||Police denied further custody of firm partner||Pune: A magisterial court on Tuesday rejected the Paud police’s plea for custodial remand of Nikunj Shah (39), one of three partners in the SVS Aqua Technologies company, for five more days in connection with the Pirangut fire tragedy case and sent him to magisterial custody till June 28. Judicial magistrate first class S R Patil said, “From perusal of remand paper, it appears that there is no progress in the investigation. Grounds mentioned in the further police custody remand application are almost similar to those mentioned in the earlier application. They are not just and proper. Therefore, further police custody remand is being rejected and the accused is being taken in magisterial custody remand till June 28,” the magistrate said. Lawyer Harshad Nimbalkar, representing Shah, told TOI, “We shall now move a bail plea on behalf of our client in the sessions court, considering that Section 304-II IPC charge (culpable homicide) applied in the case is triable by a sessions court.” A total of 17 people, including 15 women, were killed and four others were injured in the fire on June 7 at the company’s plant at Urawade near Pirangut. The Paud police had arrested Shah on June 8 after an expert panel set up by the Pune district collector to examine the circumstances leading to the fire cited negligence and several shortcomings on the part of the company in taking care of health and safety of the workers. Nimbalkar argued that the police had erred in applying the culpable homicide charge as the incident, at the best, could be a case of negligence. He cited two SC Court judgments, including the one in the Union Carbide case, in support of his argument.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-denied-further-custody-of-firm-partner/articleshow/83554452.cms||Vishwas Kothari
---||Chandigarh||‘Emergency situations need quick decisions’||Chandigarh: Dismissing the allegations of supply of vaccines to select private hospitals and procurement of Fateh kits as “politically motivated,” Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said there was no question of government profiting from the pandemic. Accusing the Akalis and AAP of spreading misinformation and raising “non-issues”, he accused them of trying to push their electoral agenda. Denying any wrongdoing, he said “quick and unusual decisions” need to be taken in an emergency situation. Amarinder said he was with his officials 100% on these issues and no amount of “opposition hullabaloo” could undermine the true intent of government, which was focused on protecting people’s lives. He said doctors and bureaucrats had been doing an excellent job on Covid front. He added that he had taken note of large-scale gatherings being organised by SAD against the state government in violation of Covid protocol. The 40,000-odd doses made available to some private hospitals was a one-time measure to provide vaccination options to non-priority groups in 18-45 category, he said. Hospitals were provided vaccines at the price at which they were to buy from manufacturers, he said. The decision was taken as there were initially only two private hospitals in Punjab that had procured the vaccine from the Centre’s 25% quota, he said. Students and others travelling abroad needed vaccines urgently and were willing to pay, so the government decided to make it available to private hospitals as an emergency measure, he said. Since the government decision was not taken in the right spirit and thereby withdrawn. The entire money went into the health department’s vaccination fund and was to be used to buy vaccines given free by the state, he added. The government has distributed 7,475 Fateh Kits, covering 80.92% of currently active cases in home isolation. Health secretary Hussan Lal said of the 42,000 vaccines given to private hospitals, only 1,300 were used and the remaining were returned to the state government. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/emergency-situations-need-quick-decisions/articleshow/83556755.cms||---

---||Goa||Seafoam makes appearance at Agonda coast in Goa||POINGUINIM: Locals were in for a surprise at Agonda beach in Canacona taluka as the shoreline was found covered with seafoam during the past few days. Scientists dismissed fears of any harmful effects, unless it prolongs for many days. Senior principal scientist of the National Institute of Oceanography, Arvind Kumar Saran said that such a situation is quite common at the onset of monsoon due to the phase reversal of the coastline current which brings to the shore all unwanted matter that churns in the oceans. This phenomenon occurs on the shorelines of other beaches along the Indian Ocean as well, he said. Saran said that the sea pushes such matter to the coastline due to strong winds and water current. Foam is nothing but a floating substance, and is not harmful to humans, he said. However, if it persists for a longer period upto a week or more, it can partially be harmful not just to humans but nature as well, he added. A senior geographer and nature enthusiast cum environmentalist, Dr F M Nadaf said seafoam is a common phenomenon. It mainly happens due to the presence of algal blooms, and the intensity increases due to powerful wind and sea waves. Mostly, seafoam is not harmful to humans. It is believed that seafoam is a health and productivity indicator of the ocean ecosystem. Seafoam was also noticed last year, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seafoam-makes-appearance-at-agonda-coast/articleshow/83559018.cms||---

Dr Baldeep Singh of the hospital said, “The patient is a one-year-old boy who was brought to the paediatric out-patient department (OPD) by an NGO. He had a birth defect—an additional rudimentary leg from the back in addition to the two normal ones. The third leg was neurologically intact although the power in that leg was reduced.” “This ‘tripod deformity’ is seemingly due to a parasitic Siamese twin, the body of which degenerated leaving the leg behind in the other twin, which fused with the back of the baby. The patient had undergone an MRI scan which showed the presence of femur tibia fibula and the knee joint in the additional leg,” said the paediatrician. He added that after reaching this diagnosis, a decision was made by the expert team of doctors at the hospital to remove this leg. The hospital authorities said that the surgery required a multi-disciplinary approach with the involvement of four departments. The neurosurgery team was headed by Dr RK Kaushal, orthopaedic team by Dr Mohd Yamin, paediatric surgery by Dr RJ Singh and plastic surgery by Dr Ravinder Tah. “The surgery lasted for over six hours in which the rudimentary leg was detached from the nervous plexus, amputated and then the skin defect was closed,” said the hospital authorities. Dr Kaushal said, “There was a spinal cord connection of the third leg with an associated meningomyelocele. The MMC was repaired and the nerve connections detached carefully. The patient is currently in the paediatric ICU and recovering. This was one of the rarest and most challenging cases I have seen in my career.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/city-docs-team-removes-third-leg-of-haibowal-kid/articleshow/83551990.cms||---

They want a relief package that brings them out for the lockdown-forced financial crisis. Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal (PPBM) state general secretary Sunil Mehra said: “The count of coronavirus cases has declined drastically, which has encouraged the state government to increase the operational timings of the shops and offices and lift Saturday’s lockdown. We welcome these changes but these alone aren’t going to help us. What we need at this stage is a relief package to overcome the crisis we have gone into. During the lockdowns, the shop sales were down to only 5% but the expenses did not reduce, and these remain the same. Every trader in the market is debt-ridden now and it is hard for us to come out of this problem without any support from the government.” Mehra said if the state government wanted to save the traders and thousands of jobs, it should be quick to declare a relief package of paying them back a minimum of two months’ electricity charges. They also need support for paying bank interest and staff salaries. Besides this, the government should also waive municipal duties such as property tax for at least two years to get the shops and offices back on course.” Business Bachao Morcha president Gurdeep Singh Gosha said: “Frequent lockdowns have broken the backbone of the trader fraternity. Our earnings have vanished due to a huge drop in sales, while our expenses such as interest on bank loans, electricity bills, and staff salaries have remained the same. This is pushing us into complete financial mess. Every shopkeeper, be it wholesaler or retailer, has suffered huge losses due to the lockdown and it seems unlikely that even 30% of these businessmen will ever recover. The only solution is for the state government to announce a relief package for the small traders and shopkeepers. This is the least required to save them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/relaxations-not-enough-city-traders-seek-relief-package/articleshow/83551974.cms||---

The body was shifted to the District hospital for postmortem. On the basis of a complaint, we have detained his relative Vinay Soni, who is also an Air Force employee and a resident of Unnao’s Achalganj, for questioning. Prateek’s family has accused Vinay of calling him over some pretext and later murdering him.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur university to reduce exam & college fees for students||NAGPUR: In a major respite to lakhs of Nagpur University (NU) students, its management council on Tuesday took an ‘in-principle’ decision to reduce the examination and college fees in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many student organisations, including ABVP, BJYM and NSUI, had been demanding fees reduction as the students' families faced massive financial constraints. Their activists had even staged protests on the university premises. TOI was the first to report on the students’ plight and how their parents had either lost their jobs or suffered losses in their businesses due to pandemic-induced lockdown. “We’ve constituted a committee of council members who would study the situation, frame modalities and submit a detailed report. We’ve given them a deadline of ten days for the task. Based on their recommendations, further decisions would be taken,” pro-vice chancellor Sanjay Dudhe told TOI. The panel would include senior member Rajesh Bhoyar, commerce dean Sanjay Kavishwar, Milind Barahate and Vishnu Changde, who had first tabled the proposal and followed it up rigorously. He was also part of a delegation led by MLA and city BJP chief Pravin Datke, which had submitted a representation to the pro-VC in this regard on May 21. The delegation also had the likes of former mayor Sandeep Joshi and Shikshan Manch coordinator Kalpana Pande. Many Senate members — Samay Bansod, Tarzan Gaikwad, Waman Turke, Pravin Udapure, Sameer Parate and others — had also met Dudhe with the same demand. “After I moved the proposal, there was some opposition initially, particularly from the members representing the affiliated colleges. However, in the end, all agreed to find a middle path to provide respite to the students in this pandemic year,” Changde told TOI. According to him, the panel wouldn’t face any problem in waiving the examination fees charged by NU, as it would be in their hands, but they were expecting opposition from private colleges on reduction of tuition fees. “We’re thinking of waiving the entire fee for forthcoming exams, as a one-time concession. As far as reducing college fees is concerned, certain issues cropped up during discussions on how they will manage salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff along with maintenance of property and premises. It was then decided to devise a formula which would be acceptable to all,” Changde added. He clarified that the students from backward and other categories receiving scholarship from the government in form of exam and tuition fees wouldn’t be eligible for the concession. “It was decided to provide discounts only to students who didn’t receive any benefits from the government. We had informed the NU administration and colleges that they aren’t profit-making bodies and must sacrifice to provide some succour to the aggrieved students, many of whom lost their parents to coronavirus,” Changde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-to-reduce-exam-college-fees-for-students/articleshow/83556745.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ludhiana||Fined manufacturers start stir against PSPCL||Times News NetworkLudhiana: Up against the huge UUE (unauthorised use of electricity) penalties, the city’s small manufacturers started a protest at Punjab State Power Corporation Limited chief engineer’s office here on Tuesday. They will continue it till Friday, last working day of the week. Because of Covid-19, batches of five will sit there in two-hour shifts.Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association president Jaswinder Singh Thukral said: “PSPCL has exceeded all limits of harassment by registering UUE cases against dozens of our businessmen and imposed penalties equivalent to double their yearly usage. The only fault was to draw a bit more than the sanctioned load for a few days but they have been punished as if they were involved in some big-time power theft. We had given the corporation till last week to correct its mistake, waive the penalties, and withdraw all the UUE cases but it did nothing, so we are forced to take the path of agitation.”From Tuesday, these owners of small factories started a chain of protest against the department till Friday. If the PSPCL does not budge from its stand, then they will take their protest to the Patiala office of its chairman and occupy it till their demand is accepted.United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) president D S Chawla said: “The PSPCL should not take this protest lightly. This is just a trailer. Behind each of the five businessmen from different sectors who sit on this protest are thousands of members. If this issue is not resolved, all these businessmen will come out on the streets for justice. The penalties imposed by the PSPCL are illegal totally, as there was no instance of power theft. Only a little more load than sanctioned was drawn and everyone paid the corporation for every single unit. Then how does it amount to using power in an unauthorised way? The entire industry is together in this fight and will do whatever it takes to get these penalties waived.”Asked about the issue, PSPCL chief engineer (central) Bhupinder Khosla told TOI: “PSPCL has not taken any unjustified action against any businessman or factory owner. Our department has done everything under the rules and regulations. In cases of running overload, penalties have been imposed under Section 126 of the Electricity Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fined-manufacturers-start-stir-against-pspcl/articleshow/83551999.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NIA arrests two more in Antilia-Mansukh Hiran cases||MUMBAI: National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Sunday arrested two more people, including a confidant of a retired inspector as part of the probe into the planting of explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house at Carmichael Road and subsequent murder of Scorpio owner Mansukh Hiran . Santosh Shellar and Anand Jadhav are residents of Kurar village in Malad. Sources said that Tavera which NIA had seized last month belongs to Shellar, a confidant of a former policeman known for encounter killings. With this arrest, the total number of accused arrested in the case touched seven. NIA is probing the planting of gelatine sticks outside Ambani’s house on February 25 and subsequent murder of Scorpio owner Mansukh on March 5. An NIA court remanded them to police custody till June 21. NIA sources said that they want to confront the duo with arrested police inspector Sunil Mane in Taloja jail. Mane and Sachin Waze had on March 4 called Mansukh to Ghodbunder Road in Thane, posing as inspector Tawde, took him to a hotel and handed him over to the killers. NIA also stumbled upon CCTV footage of the two arrested accused taking Mansukh’s custody. NIA suspects Mansukh was handed over to Shellar and Jadhav. Shellar then took Mansukh in the Tavera to an unknown location and strangled him, before throwing him in Thane creek. On March 5, police recovered Mansukh’s body in a creek. Sources said the name of one of the two accused had cropped up in the mysterious disappearance and murder of two key witnesses in Chhota Rajan aide Ram Lakhanbhaiyya fake encounter case of 2006. The witnesses, Anil Bheda and Shailesh Tailor, were found murdered. NIA’s preliminary investigation suggested that Waze wanted to take the credit of “solving” the gelatine sticks case and restore his image that he lost during his 16 years’ suspension in the alleged custodial death of terror suspect Khwaja Yunus. The other plan was to kill two suspected criminals outside Ambani's house in the fake encounter and take credit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-arrests-two-more-in-antilia-mansukh-cases/articleshow/83559587.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Chandigarh||Punjab yet to pick up pace in vaccinating population||CHANDIGARH: Even as vaccines are considered effective against the fast-spreading and highly infectious Delta variant (B.1.6.17) of Covid-19, immunisation is yet to pick pace in Punjab. There have been studies suggesting that two doses of vaccines are effective in reducing the risk of hospitalisation from Delta variant that fuelled the second wave of infection in Punjab. It has now become the most dominating strain in the state leaving behind the earlier the commonly found Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of concern. The Delta variant’s domination in the state can increase if the pace of vaccination is not increased. Adding to the woes of the health authorities, there has been a rise in samples that tested positive for another highly infectious Gamma variant of the virus. The Delta variant accounts for about 90% of the samples found positive for variants of concern in May while the share of earlier dominant Alpha strain has dropped to about 2%. Out of 138 samples examined by the National Centre for Disease Control and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology for whole genome sequencing, Delta variant was detected in 124 samples while Gamma variant was found in 11 samples and Alpha in three. Delta Plus, a more virulent version of Delta, has not been detected in Punjab so far. In the month of April, out of 252 samples in which variants of concern were found, B.1.6.17 variant was found in 117 while in 132 UK variant was found. Gamma variant was found only in three samples. Despite the high prevalence of Covid-19 variants of concern, the state government has not been able to increase the coverage of the vaccination drive that started in January. As of June 14, Punjab has managed to fully vaccinate only 2.8 people out of a population of 100 while 16.5 have received at least one dose. A total of 57,47,484 vaccine doses have been administered. Non-availability of doses in the required number is held as one of the key reasons for the slow pace of the vaccination drive. Punjab vaccine nodal officer Vikas Garg said that the pace depends on the availability of vaccine doses. As per the data shared in the media bulletin, the drive lacks consistency in the number of doses administered in a day. In the last two weeks, there have been days when the count of vaccination crossed 96,000 while the number of people jabbed remained below 30,000 on a couple of occasions. “For consistent numbers, we need to receive a regular supply of vaccine,” said Garg. Punjab received 2.13 lakh doses of Covishield and 70,000 of Covaxin on Tuesday from the central government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-yet-to-pick-up-pace-in-vaccinating-population/articleshow/83556786.cms||Vinod Kumar

As far as we are aware from public information, there was a lacuna in GO, withdrawn in Feb 2021, that was exploited by some to make a fast buck in this business.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: UPSC gets fake complaint, DGP Tomin J Thachankary seeks probe||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The race to the post of the state police chief got murky after DGP Tomin J Thachankary requested chief secretary VP Joy to probe if other aspirants for the post/interested parties tried to scuttle his chances. Thachankary submitted a formal complaint to Joy after a police investigation found that the person who filed a complaint against the officer to union public services commission (UPSC) chairman Pradeep Kumar Joshi, had died six years ago. “I suspect that a conspiracy has been hatched by some interested parties/aspirants to block my selection to the panel of candidates to be included in the list of the state police chief,” his petition (accessed by TOI) said. Last Wednesday, UPSC had forwarded a six-page complaint to the state government asking it to furnish comments on the same. The complaint, without a date, was sent to UPSC in the name of KT Thomas from Vathuruthy in Kochi. Upon Joy’s instructions, the police conducted an enquiry and found that the petitioner had resided at the said address but had passed away six years ago. The police then submitted a report to the chief secretary that it was a false complaint. In the complaint that unleashed a string of allegations against Thachankary, it has been alleged that there is a move to ‘install a corrupt and criminal-minded IPS officer’ as the next state police chief. The petition alleged that Thachankary is close to CPM and has cultivated an illegal nexus with businessmen, criminals, power brokers and political leaders during his career. The petition said that Thachankary should have been dismissed from the service long ago, and put behind bars for the criminal activities he committed by misusing his position. “I have no comments to offer in this matter,” Thachankary said, when asked about his petition. Currently, he is serving as DGP (investigations) in state human rights commission. The selection of state police chief will be from the list of three officers that UPSC will prepare and send to the government. Ever since Centre revised the rules making it the prerogative of UPSC to pick the final three names eligible for the post, the prediction has become uncertain as the criteria for shortlisting eligible names also includes the competence and integrity of the contenders that would be assessed on the basis of reports from agencies like the intelligence bureau, CVC and department of personnel and training, in addition to their service records. On the basis of seniority, Arun Kumar Sinha is the senior-most officer eligible for the post. However, Sinha, who is presently the director of the special protection group, is unlikely to return to Kerala, which would mean that Thachankary will be the next senior-most in the list if UPSC would include his name in the panel. Other frontrunners for the post are vigilance director Sudesh Kumar, ADGPs B Sandhya and Anil Kant from the 1988 batch of IPS officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/upsc-gets-fake-complaint-thachankary-seeks-probe/articleshow/83556864.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Meerut||We are carpenters not amulet makers, cops making false case: Son of man attacked in Ghaziabad||BULANDSHAHR: The son of a 72-year-old man, who was beaten and whose beard was allegedly cut by a group of men in Ghaziabad, told TOI the police was "making a false case and weaving a fake narrative” that his elderly father was attacked over personal enmity. Ghaziabad police had filed an FIR after a video purportedly showing the men attacking Abdul Samad Saifi turned up on social media platforms and invited widespread condemnation. But Ghaziabad’s superintendent of police (rural) Iraj Raja refuted claims that the attack was a hate crime spurred by the faith of the victim. He said, “There was no instance of chanting of Jai Shree Ram. He has not mentioned anything of that sort in the FIR.” The alleged attack took place on June 5. Babboo Saifi, the elder son of Samad, said, “The entire police narrative is concocted. We have nothing to do with magic or ‘taveez’. We are Saifis and have been working as carpenters for generations. The police statement that Muslims were involved in the assault is false too. Beard is a Muslim identity and no Muslim will cut it off forcibly.” Babboo said his father could barely talk because of his “serious health condition”. According to police, Saifi was a ‘taveez’ maker and had given it to one of the main accused for good fortune, "but it didn't work". The SP claimed, “We have phone call records to prove that main accused Pravesh Gujjar and Samad were known to each other, and on the day of incident Gujjar had sent a bike to fetch Samad. Samad is an amulet seller and Gujjar had bought an amulet from him. He was told it will ward off evil forces. But Gujjar believed the amulet had an adverse effect on his life and blamed Samad for that.” Ghaziabad Police have booked six men, mostly Muslims, for the attack. Other than Gujjar, police said five more were involved in the assault on Samad. Two of them, Kallu and Adil, were arrested in Ghaziabad’s Loni in the early hours of Tuesday. Their three accomplices identified as Poli, Aarif and Mushahid are on the run. Samad’s son alleged, “Muslim youths have been framed to give it a different narrative.” The family also raised questions on the authenticity of the complaint on the basis of which the FIR was filed on June 7 at Loni police station. “When we reached Loni police station to file a police complaint, the policemen were not interested. One of them even said it is better not to have a beard in summer. He said, 'Now that the beard is cut, it's good, air will pass through in this intense summer heat'. It was the inspector who drafted the police complaint and filed an FIR. They did not write what we told them,” Babboo said. When asked if his father was forced to chant Jai Shree Ram, he told TOI, “Does a 72-year-old man have choice when surrounded by a large number of men abusing and thrashing him? You can make him say anything.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/we-are-carpenters-not-amulet-makers-cops-making-false-case-son-of-man-attacked-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/83552057.cms||Sandeep Rai

The agreements will specify building, floor and flat number for which the tenant will be eligible once redevelopment is complete, said housing minister Jitendra Awhad. He said all residing in the chawls as on January 1, 2021, will be eligible for free 500 sq ft housing. Awhad visited N M Joshi Marg BDD chawl and met members of organisations representing residents of chawls. Residents blamed Mhada officials for not completing the survey and starting work. At N M Joshi Marg, 275 families have been shifted to transit accommodation in buildings built by Mhada on mill land around 1.5km from their residences. These residents were shifted in June 2019, but redevelopment is yet to start. “Mhada and collector’s office surveyed 10 buildings and around 800 tenants are to be shifted out. The shifting of other residents is yet to be done, and unless that is done, the buildings cannot be demolished and redevelopment cannot start,” said Krishnakant Nalge, chairman, N M Joshi Marg BDD Chawls Residents’ Association. The government also decided to let PWD, which originally owned the chawls, and has previous records to conduct the eligibility survey. At Worli BDD chawls, an initial survey has been done but the eligibility list is yet to be put while at Naigaum, following continued opposition from some residents, the survey has not been done. Nalge said the tenements they have been shifted to are self-contained and are spread over 225 sq ft, as against their tenement of 160 sq ft. “The buildings are new, construction is good and we have more space, but the government must expedite redevelopment,” he said. Awhad said there will soon be an inauguration by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, and redevelopment will then commence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-to-sign-agreements-with-bdd-tenants-before-transit-shift/articleshow/83552142.cms||Clara Lewis

Patil was booked by Rabale police for murder under IPC section 302 and section 30 of Indian Arms Act for contravention of licence or rule. Patil’s deceased son Vijay (35), resided in Vasai, and was a computer engineer, while Sujay (32) is a stock-broker. Senior inspector Yogesh Gawade said Bhagwan admitted he was annoyed with his sons as they told him he was behaving like a miser despite having money and property. “On Monday evening, he called them over to get them to pay the premium. Bhagwan said he expected them to take care of his financial needs after retirement. He fired two bullets at Vijay and one bullet grazed Sujay. Vijay succumbed to injuries during treatment at Indravati hospital in Airoli that day,” he said. Gawade said, “Bhagwan retired as assistant sub-inspector in 2011. Hence, he is 68 and not 75. Residents said Bhagwan was short-tempered. His younger sons stayed separately with their wives after he quarreled with them four years back. The quarrel had reached the police station, but no complaint was lodged. His eldest son, who has health issues, is staying with him. Vashi JMFC court on Tuesday sent him to police custody till June 17.” He was not allowed to attend Vijay’s funeral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/navi-mumbai-ex-cop-lost-temper-as-sons-called-him-miser/articleshow/83559601.cms||George Mendonca
---||Kanpur||Kanpur: Panel suggests action against nurse, pharmacist||KANPUR: A three-member committee of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college on Monday recommended that sister-in charge of Covid hospital, Manjulika Mishra, and pharmacist Nagendra Bajpayi be suspended after they were found accused of involvement in the Remdesivir injections scam at Lala Lajpat Rai hospital where injections were allegedly issued in the name of dead Covid-19 patients. Besides, a show cause notice has been issued to eight other nursing staff members. Principal GSVM medical college Dr RB Kamal told reporters here on Tuesday that the three-member committee had sent the recommendation for suspension of sister-in charge of Covid hospital Manjulika Mishra and pharmacist Nagendra Bajpayi to him. The committee had also served a show cause notice to eight nursing staff. “For further action, we had submitted the probe report to the district authorities.” To recall, a major scam had surfaced, wherein Remdesivir injections were allegedly issued in the name of dead Covid-19 patients during the second wave of Corona at the GSVM medical college-run LLR hospital. The alleged scam, which was operational during the second wave of Covid-19 at LLR, involved its nursing staff. It was alleged that the injections were removed from the store by the staffers. The injections were issued in the name of at least two dead patients, including a woman who died of Covid-19. As per the prescription issued by the doctor, the female patient died on May 22 but Remdesivir injections were issued in her name on May 26. Subsequently, a three-member committee comprising CMS LLR Dr Jyoti Saxena, Dr Arun Kumar Arya, professor paediatric department and chief pharmacist Rajendra Singh Patel was formed to probe the scam. Similar allegations came to fore on April 30 when the crime branch busted a racket and nabbed four persons - two members of LLR hospital nursing staff and a private hospital employee. The arrests were made after a sting operation was done by a cop posted at the Kakadeo police station. The cop, who approached the accused as a decoy customer, managed to strike a deal with the accused for Rs 30,000 to Rs 35,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/panel-suggests-action-against-nurse-pharmacist/articleshow/83556876.cms||---
---||World||Israeli airstrikes target Gaza sites, first since ceasefire||GAZA CITY: Israeli aircraft carried out a series of airstrikes at militant sites in the Gaza Strip early Wednesday, the first such raids since a shaky cease-fire ended the war with Hamas last month. The airstrikes targeted facilities used by Hamas militants for meetings to plan attacks, the Israeli military said, blaming the group for any act of violence emanating from Gaza. There were no immediate reports of casualties. On Tuesday, hundreds of Israeli ultranationalists, some chanting “Death to Arabs,” paraded in east Jerusalem in a show of force that threatened to spark renewed violence. Palestinians in Gaza responded by launching incendiary balloons that caused at least 10 fires in southern Israel. The march posed a test for Israel's fragile new government as well as the tenuous truce that ended last month's 11-day war between Israel and Hamas. Palestinians consider the march, meant to celebrate Israel's capture of east Jerusalem in 1967, to be a provocation. Hamas called on Palestinians to “resist” the parade, a version of which helped ignite last month's 11-day Gaza war. With music blaring, hundreds of Jewish nationalists gathered and moved in front of Damascus Gate. Most appeared to be young men, and many held blue-and-white Israeli flags as they danced and sang religious songs. At one point, several dozen youths, jumping and waving their hands in their air, chanted: “Death to Arabs!” In another anti-Arab chant, they yelled: "May your village burn.” In a scathing condemnation on Twitter, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said those shouting racist slogans were “a disgrace to the Israeli people,” adding: “The fact that there are radicals for whom the Israeli flag represents hatred and racism is abominable and unforgivable.” The crowd, while boisterous, appeared to be much smaller than during last month's parade. From the Damascus Gate, they proceeded around the Old City to the Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray. Ahead of the march, Israeli police cleared the area in front of Damascus Gate, shut down roads to traffic, ordered shops to close and sent away young Palestinian protesters. Police said that officers arrested 17 people suspected of involvement in violence, some of whom threw rocks and attacked police, and that two police officers needed medical treatment. Palestinians said five people were hurt in clashes with police. The parade provided an early challenge for Israel's new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, a hardline Israeli nationalist who has promised a pragmatic approach as he presides over a delicate, diverse coalition government. Though there were concerns the march would raise tensions, canceling it would have opened Bennett and other right-wing members of the coalition to intense criticism from those who would view it as a capitulation to Hamas. The coalition was sworn in Sunday and includes parties from across the political spectrum, including a small Arab party. Mansour Abbas, whose Raam party is the first Arab faction to join an Israeli coalition, said the march was “an attempt to set the region on fire for political aims,” with the intention of undermining the new government. Abbas said the police and public security minister should have canceled the event. “I call on all sides not to be dragged into an escalation and maintain maximum restraint,” he said. In past years, the march passed through Damascus Gate and into the heart of the Muslim Quarter, a crowded Palestinian neighborhood with narrow streets and alleys. But police changed the route Tuesday to avoid the Muslim Quarter. Instead, the route went around the ancient walls of the Old City and through Jaffa Gate, a main thoroughfare for tourists, and toward the Jewish Quarter and Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray. Damascus Gate is a focal point of Palestinian life in east Jerusalem. Palestinian protesters repeatedly clashed with Israeli police over restrictions on public gatherings during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in April and May. Those clashes spread to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a flashpoint site sacred to Jews and Muslims. Tensions at the time were further fueled by protests over the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers, also in Jerusalem. At the height of the tensions, on May 10, Israeli ultranationalists held their annual flag parade. While it was diverted from the Damascus Gate at the last minute, it was seen by Palestinians as an unwelcome celebration of Israeli control over what they view as their capital. In the name of defending the holy city, Hamas fired long-range rockets at Jerusalem, disrupting the march and sparking the Gaza war, which claimed more than 250 Palestinian lives and killed 13 people in Israel. After capturing east Jerusalem in 1967, Israel annexed the in a move not recognized by most of the international community. It considers the entire city its capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state. The competing claims over east Jerusalem, home to Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites, lie at the heart of the conflict and have sparked many rounds of violence. Hamas had called on Palestinians to show “valiant resistance” to the march. It urged people to gather in the Old City and at the Al-Aqsa Mosque to “rise up in the face of the occupier and resist it by all means to stop its crimes and arrogance.” In the afternoon, Hamas-linked Palestinians launched some incendiary balloons from Gaza, setting off at least 10 blazes in southern Israel, according to Israel's national fire department. Abu Malek, one of the young men launching the balloons, called the move “an initial response” to the march. Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, of the internationally backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, called the march an “aggression against our people.” In neighboring Jordan, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the march as “unacceptable,” saying it undermined efforts to reduce friction between Israel and the Palestinians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-launches-airstrikes-on-gaza-palestinian-security-sources/articleshow/83559892.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||‘Centre’s contention in SC can’t be taken at face value’||Kozhikode: IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said that the contention by Centre in the affidavit filed before the Supreme Court that the recent MHA order allowing citizenship to non-Muslims belonging to neighbouring countries who have been residing in 13 districts of five states is not related to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019 cannot be taken at face value. Addressing the media in Malappuram on Tuesday, he said that the party had filed a petition in SC after realizing that the MHA notification was an attempt to implement CAA through the backdoor. "If it was not related to CAA as they claim, then everyone should be eligible for citizenship. There is a differentiation on the basis of religion in the order. We will be filing a counter affidavit and have sought time for it," Kunhalikutty said. The petition filed by IUML in the apex court had said that the MHA notification dated May 28 – which empowered district collectors to grant citizenship to applicants belonging to minority communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christians – from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh under Citizenship Act of 1955 was illegal and ran counter to the provisions of the Act itself which does not allow classification of applicants on the basis of religion. The MHA order empowered authorities in Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab to grant citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from the three countries who have been residing in the specified districts. Kunhalikutty added that Kerala government and political parties who had waged agitations against CAA should seriously view the moves by the Centre to grant citizenship to non-Muslims hailing from neighbouring countries through an MHA order. "It is a serious issue. Some states have already started implementing the order. If we remain idle, then the notification will get implemented," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/centres-contention-in-sc-cant-be-taken-at-face-value/articleshow/83556931.cms||---

The Taj Mahal will only allow 650 tourists on its premises at a time and tickets will only be sold online. No such caps are in place for other monuments like the Agra Fort or Fatehpur Sikri. “There is no cap on the number of visitors to the Taj. But at a time, only 650 tourists will be allowed in. The decision was taken to comply with the Covid-19 protocol,” Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh told TOI. Superintending archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for Agra circle, Vasant Swarnkar, said, “Of the 464 authorised photographers, only 117 photographers will be permitted to enter at a time.” Before the pandemic hit, the Taj would see a footfall of up to 80,000 people a day. With Covid-19 safety in mind, “all visitors must wear masks. Thermal screening will be done at the gates, as will random sampling,” Singh said. Swarnkar added, “The monument will be sanitised thrice a day. No one will be allowed to touch railings or any surface of the mausoleum. Tickets will only be sold online.” Districts across the state are under a night curfew from 7pm to 7am. A weekend curfew is also in place. So, it is not clear if the Taj Mahal and other monuments will be open on weekends because no decision has been taken about this yet, an official said. But Singh did confirm that the mausoleum will open at sunrise, as it always has. The Tourism Guild of Agra was relieved with the announcement. Vice president of the organisation Rajiv Saxena said, “It indicates the government is keen to restore normalcy. We hope the 650-tourist limit is lifted soon.” The Centre had shut centrally protected monuments under ASI on March 17, the order for which was reissued on April 15. The order to reopen, which Union minister of state for culture and tourism Prahlad Singh Patel tweeted on Monday, said, “Considering the prevailing situation, now, it has been decided that all the centrally protected monuments/sites and museums (under ASI) shall be opened from 16.06.2021.” It added that the opening would have to comply with executive orders by state or district disaster management authorities, and with guidelines and SOPs issued by the Centre or state governments while “regulating the flow of visitors”. About 3,700 monuments countrywide are protected by the ASI, most of which are in Uttar Pradesh (745).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/taj-to-reopen-today-after-3-months-with-650-in-at-a-time/articleshow/83552179.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Rajkot||Palanpur: Boy or a girl? Parents chose a daughter!||PALANPUR: One and half years ago, parents of eight-year-old Shamima (name changed) were surprised to see male organs developing within their daughter’s private parts. Was she a girl or a boy? Upon investigations, doctors found that she was genetically a boy as she had XY chromosomes but she could be both as she had a vagina as well as a penis developing from her clitoris. Finally, the parents decided that as they had raised their beloved child as a daughter, they would want to retain female as the primary sex for her. Doctors at Palanpur Civil Hospital said that they have performed a surgery wherein the penis growing out of her clitoris was removed. “It is good that the parents wished her to be a daughter. It would have been tough if they had wished her to be a boy because while she had XY chromosomes, she does not have testicles or scrotum. She has a fully developed vagina and urethral opening from where she passes urine,” said Palanpur Civil Hospital superintendent Dr Sunil Joshi. He is a urologist and had performed her surgery. Doctors said Shamima belongs to a poor family and was born with pseudohermaphroditism, a rare condition of having both male and female genitals. She is studying in Class III and is a brilliant student. The surgery was performed four months ago and the girl was under strict observation. Dr Joshi said that the girl will have to be carefully monitored over the years to provide much needed interventions when she reaches puberty. “Since she has XY chromosomes, it is possible that she may start producing testosterone. This will have to be controlled to avoid her voice getting cracked or her developing moustache or facial hair. If she develops testicles or scrotum, they may have to be removed through treatment,” said Dr Joshi. Meanwhile, the parents are aware that the girl does not have a uterus. Whether she will have ovaries will only be revealed with time as ovaries are not currently perceptible in the girl, said Dr Joshi. The worried family went to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital many years ago and were advised that the surgery need not be imminent and can be performed when the child had matured. “We had to remove the male organ because the parents wanted a girl child,” said Dr Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/boy-or-a-girl-parents-chose-a-daughter/articleshow/83552148.cms||Pramod Panwar

Amika George, 21, daughter of Kishore and Nisha George, who became a torchbearer for young women battling the period issue in the UK has become the youngest recipient of the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). At 17, Amika had started an online campaign that drew the attention of the British government to the matter. "I saw an article in the BBC on girls missing school every month as they found it difficult to afford pads," said Amika, who recollects being "shocked" and "angry". "So, I started the Free Periods petition calling on the government to take action." It caught on and she was encouraged by the positive response from young girls. She remembers getting an email from a 15-year-old, who "used to miss school every month because her mum wouldn't have money for food and heating. "She suffered in silence," recollects Amika. "But when the Free Periods scheme became available, she could go to school without any worries." Amika gets vocal about the taboo prevalent in society on the subject of menstruation. "We work to dismantle the taboo. It's so disappointing that in 2021 we still feel embarrassed to talk about periods," said Amika whose initiative 'Free Periods' is now a limited company "with an amazing team that works with schools to monitor the government scheme." "We hold the government to account," she says. The arrival of the pandemic posed another challenge. “Donations of pads to charities fell drastically as we were not able to leave our houses. The Covid crisis has shown us all the cracks in our communities and sadly it is women who have been hit the hardest,” Amika said. But the Cambridge University student is determined to fight on and she feels "thrilled to be able to represent young people who have felt unseen or forgotten, who have felt sidelined or misunderstood". Amika says that she wanted to accept the Honour to show that "as a young person of colour, who comes from an immigrant family, we hold so much power in our words and actions, and that we are being recognised as real political actors in spaces which were previously closed to us". "I know that my family and people in the Malayali community in Britain have suffered over the decades with racism and feeling like outsiders, and this award is for them," said Amika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/uk-malayali-girl-gets-queens-honour/articleshow/83549279.cms||T C Sreemol

Josephine was accompanied by two panel members Shiji Shivaji and Shahida Kamal while visiting the couple at Vithanassery, near Nemmara, where they have been living since March this year. “The claim of a woman that she hid in a small room of her husband’s family house for 10 years without anybody noticing is unbelievable and shrouded in mystery. The commission does not believe it and has directed the police and crime branch to investigate the matter thoroughly to bring out the facts,” said Josephine. “Imprisonment is imprisonment whether you are fed with honey and milk and looked after well,” she added. Josephine hit out against the police for not properly investigating the missing person case filed by Sajitha’s parents 10 years ago. “This is an unusual incident and the first of its kind in the state. Since both of them do not have a complaint the commission did not file any case against them, but will further investigate it,” Josephine said. The commission members later visited Rahman’s parent’s house at Ayiloor and inspected the room where Sajitha claimed to have lived for 10 years. “It is a very small room, the size of a small bathroom, with no basic facilities for anybody to live for so long,” she said. Meanwhile, Sajitha appealed to the commission not to file any case against Rahman and allow them to live in peace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/captivity-can-never-be-justified/articleshow/83556990.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Don’t bar students over fee dues, says MLA in PIL||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday directed the state government and its education department to file an affidavit in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar seeking interim orders to enable school fee payment in instalments and not to debar any students from either online or physical classes over fee arrears or non-payment or withhold their progress report. Bhatkhalkar and a few others filed the PIL for directions to the Uddhav Thackeray-led government to strictly implement the 2011 Act that regulates school fees and to protect the interests of students during the pandemic. Bhatkalkar’s counsel Biren Saraf said the plea was to make sure students are not the sufferers and the state may be directed to ensure that unaided schools do not factor in expenses that are not incurred during the lockdown to enhance fees. The state’s lawyer placed a June 7, 2021notification issued by the school education department by which the state formed a divisional fee regulatory committee. The HC bench of Justices S P Deshmukh and G S Kulkarni sought an affidavit from the state to place on record information regarding functioning and address of this authority after Saraf said the authority, who parents may approach with their queries and grievances, is not even functional. The state regulates school fees in government and aided schools. For unaided schools, the management decides the fees in a process laid down under the 2011 law. Saraf said mechanism set out under the Act does not impinge upon the autonomy of unaided schools to fix fees as has been held in a catena of SC judgements. “Demanding fees for overheads and other activities tantamount to indulging in profiteering and commercialisation,” said the PIL. Saraf said schools had been shut for a long period in 2020-2021. “School managements shall have saved overheads and cost on incidentals such as petrol, diesel, electricity, maintenance, stationery charges etc,” said Saraf. The PIL recognised that schools did incur expenses on software and hardware to conduct online classes and a balance is required to be maintained while deciding fees. The petitioners requested the state to also direct educational institutions to consider any representation from parents ion remitting annual fees for 2020-21 and 2021-22 “sympathetically” on a case-to-case basis. The other plea is that schools do “not withhold the name of students/candidates for board examinations or any scholarships on the ground of non-payment of fees/arrears.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-bar-students-over-fee-dues-says-mla-in-pil/articleshow/83559619.cms||---

The hospital administration, however, said that they had not received any complaint on the issue, but will probe the matter once the woman files a formal complaint. The issue came to light when a woman attendant told media persons on Tuesday that she and her other colleagues were being pressurized to have physical relation with their supervisors. According to sources, the hospital administration had recruited these attendants in March and April on temporary basis when Covid-19 cases were at peak. A woman attendant in Jamnagar’s G G hospital has alleged while talking to media persons on Tuesday that they are being pressured to have physical relations with supervisors. The hospital had recruited these attendants in March-April on a temporary basis when covid cases at peak. The criteria were that the attendant should have passed Class 10. These attendants were assigned to care of patients by providing them food, water and help the nursing staff if required. As the number of coronavirus cases decreased, the hospital administration started relieving these attendants. However, while opposing the hospital’s decision, one woman alleged before media persons, “We did not get salary and we are being fired without notice. The women being are asked to keep physical relations with supervisors and if they refuse they are shown the door.” When contacted, Dr Dharmesh Vasavda, in-charge medical superintendent of GG Hospital said, “We have not received any complaint of physical or sexual harassment or the kind of allegations that woman is making before the media. We will ask her to file a proper complaint before taking any action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/woman-attendant-alleges-sexual-harassment/articleshow/83552294.cms||---

Though none are expecting very high footfall in the opening week, they have nevertheless worked out the maximum head count in the facility to ensure that they do not breach the 30% footfall limit set by the government. The malls that have been shut for 45 days with only preventive maintenance carried out during this period saw hectic activity on Tuesday with housekeeping staff cleaning and sanitizing the facility and store employees readying the outlets for business. “We are ready for business. Sanitization is complete. We have thermal check cameras installed at each entrance and also auto head count facility that will track the number of people entering and exiting the mall to ensure the maximum limit is not breached,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. At Quest, the mall management is not too worried about the head count as footfall after the mall reopened following last year’s lockdown had not recovered to even a fifth of the capacity. “This is a calibrated approach with the economy being gradually opened up in a phased manner so that infections do not spike again. We will continue to provide a safe environment for customers with all Covid protocols in place,” said Quest mall vice-president Sanjeev Mehra. While there is overall public wariness about the Covid situation after a very challenging experience from mid-April to mid-May, lack of public transport is another reason why mall operators initially do not expect a high turnout. “We don’t expect footfall to beyond a few hundred on weekdays and a couple of thousand at the weekends. The numbers will increase once public transport is back on road. Till then, customers with essential purchase requirement will walk in,” said Mani Square director Sudarshana Gangulee. According to Ramesh Pandey, whole time director of Ambuja Neotia group that operates the twin City Centres, the malls will be 100% operational. “The formula that we had worked out last year to ensure that we shared the pain of retailers will be in place this time too. We all have to survive these turbulent times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/malls-ready-for-biz-to-use-thermal-guns-auto-headcount-machines/articleshow/83554603.cms||Subhro Niyogi

On April 23, she had taken her husband, who had suddenly developed Covid-19-like symptoms, to four hospitals and been denied admission. In a heart-rending photograph that captured in one frame the sorrow and misery of the pandemic, she was seen trying to resuscitate her husband as he lay dying.  He didn’t make it. The image was shared widely and drew messages of support, of people wanting to help, but there was little to go on. The register at the last hospital where she had tried her luck only mentioned two names, Ravi Singhal and Renu Singhal. A month and a half on, TOI traced her, and found her agonising over what the future holds. In a two-room house at Avas Vikas Colony in Agra she can’t afford anymore — rent is Rs 2,500 a month — she broke down. “My daughter Bhumi is 16, a Class X student. My husband was the sole earner in the family. We have nothing to go on,” Renu, 43, told TOI. The family doesn’t have a ration card or an Ayushman Bharat card. She hasn't been able to find a job because of the pandemic. Her husband Ravi, 47, sold pethas for a living, making just enough to live by — there were no savings. “I can’t even cover the basics. My constant worry is about my daughter’s future. I request (UP) CM Yogi Adityanath to provide us with some relief. I am struggling,” she added. Ravi’s illness, Renu said, began on April 20 with a mild fever. They didn’t think much of it. But two days on, he could hardly breathe. By early morning on April 23, his condition had turned serious. “I hired an auto and rushed him to the hospital nearby. I was told they did not have oxygen. I tried two other hospitals, but they had no beds. Then, I was asked to go to Sarojini Naidu Medical College (SNMC),” she recounted. SNMC is a government hospital. “By the time I got there, my husband had started losing consciousness. I went into the emergency ward and requested staff members to get a stretcher and help me get him into the hospital. I cried, I begged. But no one listened to what I had to say,” she said. “I was told to take my dying husband elsewhere.” Helpless and distraught, when she came out and went to the auto, she found her husband struggling to breathe. “He was pressing my hand hard, as if asking me to save him. And then, his body turned limp. I tried giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation so he would not die. But I could not save him. He died outside the hospital, waiting for help.” It was at this point that a passerby took the photo and posted it on social media, where it went viral. She, of course, was unaware at the time, lost in grief. “I pray no one suffers the way I did. I was utterly helpless,” she said. “I still am.” While thousands saw the image and wanted to help, no one knew how to reach her. Will help come her way now? Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “We will ensure the woman and her daughter get benefits under government schemes soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/last-seen-giving-cpr-to-dying-hubby-woman-in-viral-image-says-lifes-hard-no-help/articleshow/83552241.cms||Deepak Lavania

These charges had formed the basis of their preventive custody on October 6. The other charges against them, including sedition and under UAPA, still stand. Maant police had in its report before the SDM said the four meant to “breach the peace” in Hathras, where a Dalit girl had been gangraped and murdered, which is why sections 151 (preventive arrest), 107 (security for keeping the peace) and 116 (inquiry as to truth of information) of the CrPC were invoked against them and they were remanded to judicial custody. On Tuesday, the order by SDM Ramdutt Ram said, “Charges of breach of peace under Section 116(6) of the CrPC have been dropped and the accused have been discharged from the matter.” The CrPC section referred to in the verdict says, “The inquiry under this section shall be completed within a period of six months from the date of its commencement, and if such inquiry is not so completed, the proceedings under this Chapter shall, on the expiry of the said period, stand terminated.” Defence lawyer of the four accused — Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, 41; teeq-ur-Rehman, 28, Masood Ahmad, 28, and Mohd Aalam, 37 — in this case, Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi, told TOI, “Police couldn’t provide evidence to substantiate charges of breach of peace within six months since the case began.” He added, “The charges in this first case, on the basis of which the four had been detained in the first place, could not be proven. That could help in the other cases as well.” The FIR registered against the four men at the time had listed six smartphones, a laptop and pamphlets of ‘Justice for Hathras Victim’ as evidence that “the men were going to Hathras to disrupt peace,” TOI had reported. They were then booked under Section 124 (sedition), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) of the IPC, along with sections 14 (holding property derived or obtained from commission of terrorist act) and 17 (raising funds for terrorist act) of the UAPA, and sections 65 (tampering with computer source documents), 72 (breach of confidentiality and privacy) and 76 (provisions to confiscate digital evidence) of the IT Act. Cases for these are still on. Mathura SSP Gaurav Grover said he “could not comment” on a verdict by an SDM court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/breach-of-peace-charges-dropped-against-4-pfi-men-held-on-way-to-hathras/articleshow/83552391.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Ernakulam Central Police, which filed a custody application on Monday, was given permission to take him into custody till Friday evening. Sources said that investigators had sought a seven-day custody of the accused who was remanded in judicial custody on Friday. However, the court granted only four days. Joseph, who is accused of restraining, torturing and sexually assaulting a woman in an apartment at Marine Drive was arrested by the police from his hideout in Thrissur on Friday with the help of residents. "We received him in custody and we hope to collect more details about the accused over the next four days after interrogation. The requests to get the bank details and sources of income have already been sent to concerned banks where the accused has accounts. We will also look into the case registered against him at the Vanitha Police station in Kochi city based on a complaint by a Kakkanad woman that she was assaulted by Martin who wanted to stay at her flat," said police sources. According to the police, Joseph – who is a Thrissur native –was residing in Kochi and had been in a live-in relationship with the survivor for several months before he allegedly turned violent and started torturing her during the last months of 2020. The case was registered against the accused under IPC Sections 376 (rape), 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 days or more), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means or weapons) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-get-custody-of-martin-for-4-days/articleshow/83557066.cms||---
---||Delhi||Victory of democracy, say kin of those granted bail||New Delhi: Delhi High Court’s order for the release of Pinjra Tod members Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha in relation to February 2020’s northeast Delhi riots led to celebratory reactions in the city. Civil society members welcomed Tuesday’s verdict and described it as a victory for students. They also said the judgment set a precedence for cases that are appropriate for trying under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.“We hadn’t expected such a decision,” said Shahnawaz Hussain, Tanha’s brother. “Our lawyer told us only last night that there would be a hearing on Tuesday. We continued to pray and when we got a call about the judgment, we were elated. Hopefully, Asif will be released soon.”Kalita’s mother, Kalpana, alluding to the bailed Pinjra Tod activist’s birthday on June 18, told a new agency in her hometown of Dibrugarh: “We got a super birthday gift. On her last birthday, she was in jail. We couldn’t even wish her. Today, we can say that it’s a victory for democracy, not simply Devangana and Natasha.”Kalita’s husband, Andre Ling, and Narwal’s brother, Akash, expressed delight at the high court’s order. “It is a wonderful judgment that demonstrates serious engagement with the chargesheet, clearly exposes the absence of evidence to substantiate a prima facie UAPA case against Devangana and Natasha, carries forward the true democratic spirit of this country and strengthens our faith in the judicial system,” said Ling. But he cautiously added, “We can’t relax until Devangana and Natasha are actually out of jail. We don’t know what twists and turns remain ahead.”Akash said, “We believe the judgment holds the promise of benefiting those who have UAPA cases slapped against them for reasons that have nothing to do with terrorism or sedition. Moreover, it insists that protest and terrorism should not be conflated and that to use the term ‘terrorism’ so casually is a threat to India’s democratic spirit. We hope that many like us will now be reunited with their near and dear ones arrested under UAPA for exercising their democratic rights.”Pinjra Tod, the organisation to which Kalita and Narwal belonged, said in a statement, “We hope this will pave the way for the bail of others implicated under similar false conspiracy charges. Today, we also remember Mahavir Narwal, the father of Natasha, whose presence is sorely missed at this moment.”Reactions came from many civil society members and activists. Writer Akhil Katyal, friend of both Kalita and Narwal, said, “Natasha, Asif and Devangana are students. Our country should be prizing and nurturing them instead of confining them to jails. I welcome this decision and hope it is extended to all political prisoners in the country. Dissent should be common in any democracy, not an exceptional act inviting punishment.”Safoora Zargar, a Jamia student and an accused in the Delhi riots case who was given bail on grounds of her pregnancy, told TOI that she was relieved. “It is sad that in a democracy, the courts have to reiterate that dissent and protests do not constitute a conspiracy against the country,” she said. Kavita Krishnan, secretary, All India Progressive Women's Association, thought the students should have got bail long ago. Krishnan said this judgment set a precedent and “there should not be any delay in granting bail to all political prisoners jailed under UAPA”. She noted, “The judgment says the police’s case was non-existent and so all charges should be dropped.”In a statement, Mohammad Salman Ahmed, president, Students Islamic Organisation of India, of which Tanha was a member, the false charges were “an attempt to suppress the young leadership of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act movement” and to attribute to them the “blame for the Delhi pogrom”.Advocate Shahrukh Alam pointed out this was the first set of bails on merit in a UAPA case. “The order also directly attacks the prosecution’s contention that dissent is meant to terrorise others,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/victory-of-democracy-say-kin-of-those-granted-bail/articleshow/83554806.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Delhi||HC: Not Even Prima Facie Material For UAPA||New Delhi: Foundations of our nation can’t be shaken by protests by college students within the confines of a university, Delhi High Court noted in its bail order on Tuesday in which it rejected allegations under the anti-terror law, UAPA, against three students, Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha.To drive home its central point that any crime, however heinous, can’t fall under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act when other penal provisions such as Indian Penal Code (IPC) are there, a bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani used bail jurisprudence under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), and not the stringent UAPA, to decide the plea.“We are of the view that the foundations of our nation stand on surer footing than to be likely to be shaken by a protest, however vicious, organised by a tribe of college students or other persons, operating as a coordination committee from the confines of a university situated in the heart of Delhi,” the bench observed, while stressing that UAPA can’t be “casually applied to criminal acts” without “essential character of terrorism” and a “terrorist act”.After it found absence of even “prima facie” material to qualify slapping of UAPA by the prosecution, the court noted that the phrase “terrorist act” could not be permitted to be casually applied to criminal acts falling within the definition of conventional offences under IPC.Since UAPA is not made out against the accused, “the additional limitations and restrictions for grant of bail do not apply” and the court can fall back upon CrPC, the bench noted. Offences under the “UAPA are treated as extremely serious, inviting very severe punishment; and therefore, the formation of an independent judicial view by the court at every step of the way, is imperative”, it added.HC further noted that there was no allegation that the anti-CAA protest had extended even to the whole of National Capital Territory of Delhi. A perusal of the chargesheet reveals the protest and the disruptions it allegedly caused were restricted to northeast Delhi, it added. “It would, therefore, be a stretch to say that the protest affected the community at large for it to qualify as an act of terror.”In cases where a crime can be “adequately addressed and dealt with by the ordinary penal law of the land, the court must not countenance a state agency ‘crying wolf’,” the bench underlined. Grant of bail “cannot be thwarted merely by asserting that an offence is grave”.While granting bail, the court took into account Narwal and Kalita’s educational background, profile and position in life and said it saw “no reason to suspect or apprehend that they are either a flight risk or that they will indulge in evidence tampering, or witness intimidation, or will otherwise impede the trial in any way”. All three have been booked under multiple FIRs in which they have secured bail. Tanha was on custodial bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-not-even-prima-facie-material-for-uapa/articleshow/83554819.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Rajkot||Exporters resist China’s demand for virtual inspection of fish plants||RAJKOT: China the biggest importer of frozen fish from India has demanded a virtual inspection of the Indian fish processing plants. However, this hasn’t gone down well with the exporters here who are resisting the move and asking Indian agencies to act sympathetically. China last week suspended import from 10 Indian seafood companies including four companies of Veraval after they they found traces of Covid on the packaging. But the Indian exporters are disputed this allegation and have sought clarification. The export to China from Gujarat coast has dropped by over 30 percent in the last financial year and now, owing to the fresh dispute, exporters fear further drop in the current financial year too. China accounts for around 50 percent of total fish exports from the Veraval coast. Following the detection of Covid traces on the frozen fish together with the rising in Covid cases in Guangdong province, its Zhanjiang port has suspended import of frozen food from 11 countries including India from June 20 to July 15. According to Indian sea food exporters, after the detection of Covid traces on frozen fish packaging, testing protocol has been tightened further with the Chinese authority detaining containers that are being exported from India. Veraval sea food exporters are in a dilemma and seeking help from the Indian government. President of Seafood Exporters Association of India (SEAI), Jagdish Fofandi said, “We don’t have any clear picture of what Chinese authorities want to test, what’s the finding of Covid test of fish. We follow all the guidelines for seafood exports issued by Indian government agencies for Covid while exporting.” Chinese authorities have allegedly found Covid traces on the outer carton of packaging, a claim which the exporters have refuted. “We freeze fish at minus 20 degrees and keep the packaging at minus 40 degrees. There is scientific evidence that Covid virus can’t survive in such subzero temperature,” Fofandi argued. According to the Indian exporters, the Chinese authority wants to inspect ‘suspected’ exporters’ plants and will prolong the suspension on import if they find even minor errors. This kind of inspection started in some of the plants of Andhra Pradesh. Generally, the Export Inspection Council of India (EICI) inspects the seafood exporters’ facilities, identify nonconformity and suggest changes based on which exporters modify or upgrade their plants. According to the exporters, if the stalemate continues they won’t need to procure fish from the fishermen from the next season which starts from August 1, as they will have stock of frozen fish from the last season. Nearly Rs 50 crore dues of Indian exporters stuck The Indian container clearance at Chinese ports takes two to three months. As a result, around Rs 50 crore amount of the Indian exporters are now stuck with the Chinese importers. All the containers are being tested before their release. Kenny Thomas, an exporter of Veraval said, “Around Rs 35 to 50 crore is stuck with Chinese importers. As per terms they have to pay us only after clearance of our containers from the Chinese authority and they dictate the terms.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/exporters-resist-chinas-demand-for-virtual-inspection-of-fish-plants/articleshow/83552395.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

This association comes at a crucial juncture to promote indigenous manufacturing at par with global standards. Mission Bharat-O2 is a step towards the larger vision of SIIC to nurture a self-sustainable healthcare system in India. Ansys has nurtured a legacy of contributing towards development initiatives across India. In the recent past, Ansys has also collaborated with AIPL, an SIIC incubate, in the design qualification of the oxygen plant. It was able to provide critical design insights by leveraging its expertise in computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics. Commenting on SIIC’s vocal for local vision, CEO, SIIC, Nikhil Agarwal said, “The SIIC team at IIT-Kanpur aims to turn the country into a manufacturing hub by supporting product innovation that originated from cutting-edge research and development. Our incubated companies have contributed immensely since Coviod-19 struck India. With this experience, we want to go a step further to build a nexus of local manufacturers who will put India on the map of the global manufacturing hubs. The support from Ansys is a much-needed contribution in that direction.” Speaking about the initiative, area vice-president (India and South Asia Pacific, Ansys), Rafiq Somani said, “Mission Bharat O2, under the aegis of SIIC, IIT-Kanpur is a crucial step towards indigenisation of oxygen concentrators and plants that will go a long way in fighting Covid-19 here. We at Ansys are committed to the ‘Make in India’ initiative”. The Mission Bharat O2 project, led by Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, professor in-charge, Innovation, will support local manufacturers to develop oxygen plants and concentrators. The initiative will operate on a decentralized model to generate indigenous manufacturing capabilities and a distribution network of quality health infrastructure. SIIC has also selected eight manufacturing partners from 70 plus participants who competed to manufacture indigenous oxygen plants and oxygen concentrators under the Mission Bharat O2. With this initiative, SIIC IIT- Kanpur has taken a step forward to make the Indian healthcare manufacturing ecosystem self-sustaining by reducing dependence on imports. As a coveted funding partner, Ansys support will pivot SIIC’s efforts towards efficient execution of the Mission Bharat O2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/siic-iit-kanpur-raise-funds-from-ansys-for-manufacturing-oxygen-concentrators/articleshow/83557128.cms||---

Even as doctors prepared to operate, came the next bad news — he was also Covid-positive. But the infant, now 50 days old, has managed to beat both.  For Arup and Jaba Chandra, the joy of becoming parents was cruelly tempered just days before their baby turned a month old, when they found he had obstructed cardiac TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection), a rare condition affecting less than 1 in 10,000 babies. The residents of Katwa in Burdwan had noticed that the baby was gasping for breath. The anxious parents rushed the boy — named Kian — to a government hospital in Burdwan, which asked them to go to Kolkata.  Arup’s friend at the RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), Kolkata,suggested paediatric cardiac surgeon Debabrata Nandi. “In TAPVC, both oxygenated and deoxygenated blood comes to the right side of the heart and gets re-circulated, resulting in heart failure and increased lung pressure,” explained Nandi. Kian was all set to undergo open heart surgery, when the Covid test turned out positive. The baby was put on ventilator due to heart failure. The surgery had to be deferred, for it was deemed extremely risky. But Nandi went for an emergency lifesaving procedure, Balloon Atrial Septostomy (BAS), to release pressure from the heart. A repeat RTPCR test after 10 days came out negative, and his condition stabilised for open-heart surgery, which was performed on June 1. After the surgery, little Kian required prolonged oxygen support because his lungs were damaged by Covid complications. The baby was finally discharged from hospital after 23 days. The guest support cell at RTIICS raised fund for both the surgeries. “We had to pay only Rs 6,000 from our pockets,” said Arup.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/50-day-old-beats-covid-and-a-rare-congenital-heart-disease/articleshow/83560003.cms||Sumati Yengkhon

They also demanded that all political prisoners arrested under the UAPA be released.CPM chief Sitaram Yechury said the court verdict was a “very refreshing reaffirmation of Constitution and rule of law” even as his party hailed the judgment and said the government must apply this standard to all false cases and release all political prisoners.“Delhi High Court order granting bail in the UAPA case connected to the northeast Delhi violence, for three detenues is most welcome. It is a step towards undoing the gross injustice by committed by the Home Ministry in manufacturing cases against activists protesting against the unconstitutional CAA,” the CPM politburo said in a statement.Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan welcomed the order and said Narwal, Kalita, and Tanha, were “maliciously arrested by Delhi police under UAPA in the riots case”.DU professor Apoorvanand, who was questioned by Delhi Police in connection with the riots in August last year, said the whole exercise “was to shield real perpetrators”. “None of them should have been arrested in the first place,” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/activists-hail-order-granting-bail-to-accused/articleshow/83554789.cms||---

The heritage Town Hall in Chandni Chowk is to become a hotel or a tourist facility. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has issued tenders for the leasing of the famous building to a private party for its redevelopment. According to the plan, the complex will be leased out for 33 years with a minimum reserve price of Rs 1.92 crore per month as licensing fee. Jai Prakash, the outgoing mayor of the north corporation, said the transformation of Town Hall into a heritage hotel complex would help generate revenue for the cash-strapped civic body while also ensuring the maintenance of the structure that was constructed in 1863 and which has been lying vacant for over a decade. “Instead of leasing it out for a lengthy period like 99 years, we decided on a medium-term scale,” said the mayor. The site where the yellow brick-and-stone building with carved white trims stands was once a garden created by Jahanara, daughter of Mughal emperor Shahjahan. The Begum ki Sarai in the garden was a VIP guesthouse and an inn for wealthy Persian traders in the mid-1600s. The construction of the present building started in 1860 and was completed in 1863. Authors Gaynor Barton and Laurraine Malone in their book on Old Delhi disclose that the building was known as Lawrence Institute and housed the Delhi College of Higher Studies before its purchase by the then municipality for 1,35,457 in 1866. In 2010-12, the municipality shifted its headquarters to the new multi-storied Civic Centre on Jawaharlal Nehru Marg. There were several proposals to reuse the vacant complex for various purposes, but nothing materialised. In 2012, the last commissioner of the unified municipal corporation, K S Mehra, came up with a plan to transform Town Hall into a cultural heritage centre. The plan was submitted to the central government a year later, but the project didn't see the light of day. The current project document states, “The complex may be used for hotel, museums, library, children’s activity rooms, auditoriums for cultural activities with historical significance, demonstration room, light and sound programme, fine dining areas, street food of India, etc. This will provide an excellent historic ambience and experience for citizens to live the culture of the city with modern amenities. The hotel will be the most exciting experience for those who want to be part of the history and culture of Delhi as a living experience.” The total area of the complex under the possession of the north corporation is 13,735 sq metres, all of which is open for redevelopment. A corporation official said, “Broadly it can be divided into three sections: the main building, courtyard and press building. Since the building uses the construction material from the mid-colonial era such as stones, lime plaster, burnt bricks and timber, the standing structure requires strengthening and refurbishing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/switch-from-civic-centre-to-hotspot/articleshow/83588144.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||Not family dispute, resolve fee row with school: Bombay HC to parents||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday nudged parents of a Malad (east) school that had denied 203 students access to online classes due to non-payment of fees to physically meet its management to resolve issues. “This is not some family dispute. This is about students at school,” said a bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrakant Bhadang. The court heard a petition by 203 students, most between 6-13 years, of Seth Juggilal Poddar Academy, an ICSE school. The petition stated for 2020-21, the parents had paid 50% fees and the delay was “due to loss of job or loss of business or exhausting of all savings during the lockdown period.” On April 29, the school was directed to “sympathetically” consider individual representations.  The school’s advocate, Arvind Kothari, said except for 84 students, whoever asked for paying fees in instalments were allowed. He said 84 parents did not make any representation. Petitioners’ advocate Disha Karambar said the school did not respond to representations made earlier. She also the instalment facility is only till June 30. Karambar said there is also no consideration for those seeking leaving certificates. “The school is insisting that first term fees should be paid,” she said.  The judges said since there was no embargo on movement now, parents can ask their representatives to meet the school’s management to resolve issues. They said their April 29 order was passed on the lines of the Supreme Court’s order to consider each case. “Now there is no restriction on movement. Let them physically come to the school,” Justice Jamdar told Kothari.  Karambar said all possible attempts were made to contact the school authorities. “There is no one to address queries,” she said, urging that the remaining 84 students be allowed to join online classes.  The judges said they would direct the school to keep its representative present and added that the parents must approach the school as it is about students. “If this is an issue, I will get it resolved,” Kothari offered, adding that the school can give 2-3 months more for payment of fees.

FOGWWA has written to Union textile minister Smriti Irani alleging that yarn manufacturers are speculating yarn prices. Speculation is resulting in increase of yarn prices exponentially putting the weavers in a tight spot and affecting the fabric cost. FOGWWA office-bearers said that if yarn is included in the act, the manufacturers will not be able to form syndicate and increase the prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fogwwa-wants-yarns-under-essential-commodities-act/articleshow/83552460.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Monsoon knocking but rivers still not cleaned||DEHRADUN: While the monsoon has arrived early in the city with predictions of heavier showers in the coming days, the Dehradun Municipal Corporation has come under flak from residents for not completing the work of cleaning of the rivers on time.Residents have complained that stretches of the Rispana and the Bindal are still full of dirt and garbage despite DMC claiming that it had cleaned the rivers. Only the bigger drains have been cleaned so far. Officials said that the work of cleaning the rivers was in progress at various sites in the city. “The work will be completed very soon to avoid any problems for the people during the monsoon,” said Kailash Joshi, chief municipal health officer, DMC. On Tuesday, TOI team visited the Mothrowala area, one of the sites from where the Rispana passes. The locals told TOI that although the administration had placed an iron and steel mesh along the river, people still dump garbage in it. A number of cows and stray dogs could be seen eating the garbage, which included plastic bags. Devendra Singh, a local resident said, “We see people throwing garbage here every day but when we stop them, they pick up a fight. If agencies start pressing criminal charges against such individuals, then maybe they will learn. Otherwise just because of a few careless people, everyone in the locality will suffer during the monsoon.” In the past, several residents and environmental groups have taken up the task of cleaning the rivers in the city but the situation hasn’t improved. A few days ago, Dehradun district magistrate, Ashish Srivastava, had tasked the irrigation department and the DMC to clean the drains and rivers before the monsoon. “Pollution of the riverbed happens through the year and becomes worse during the monsoon when the rivers are in spate. Stringent action should be taken against people who pollute the river. I cross the Bindal every day and feel ashamed of what we have made it look like,” said Vinod Kansal, a resident of Prem Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/monsoon-knocking-but-rivers-still-not-cleaned/articleshow/83552426.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Restaurants, bars hope for tax relief to tide over crisis||KOLKATA: Hit by the pandemic, bar and restaurant industry, one of the largest employment generators in the state, is looking for some sops from the government. The industry is hoping for a greener pasture from June 16, after being closed for almost 45 days, following the relaxation announcement by the Mamata Banerjee government. As per data by the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), the bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata alone has suffered a loss of Rs 4,000 crore-Rs 4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic in April 2020. It employs over 80,000 people in the greater Kolkata area alone. The president of HRAEI, Sudesh Poddar, told TOI that it is very difficult for the industry to survive without some relief from the government. HRAEI member and owner of restaurants like Peter Cat and Mocambo, Nitin Kothari, also agreed with him. A few other restaurant owners like Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion, Mio Amore, also felt the same. According to Poddar, some sops like relief in excise licence fee for some months, property tax relief and some relief in government duty on electricity would be of great help for the industry. He pointed out there are around 8,000 restaurants and bars taken together in the greater Kolkata area. “The total turnover of the industry would be no less than Rs 8,000 crore per year. In the last 15 months starting from April 20, only 4-5 months were good for our industry. So the loss was huge, considering the fact that home delivery and takeaways for most of the restaurants is not more than 10%-15% of normal business,” he added. Kothari said he has lost more than 50% of revenue in last 15 months. “Yes, some relief is required to stay afloat. We are dealing with perishable commodities. We cannot resale food after a certain period so loss of one day too is a loss for us,” he added. Anjan Chatterjee, the founder and chairman of Speciality Restaurants that has brands like Mainland China, Oh! Calcutta, Haka, Asia Kitchen, feels that return of customers this time would be slower than the first wave because of higher mortality this time. “Only from September 20 to March 21, there was an upswing. In last 16 months, we have suffered 70% loss in business. The impact was huge. Most of the restaurants in malls are in bad shape,” he added. Debaditya Chaudhury, director of Chowman, Oudh and Chapter 2 also added that loss of business was more than 50%, though for him, home delivery was relatively better than others. “It will take a year to recover,” he added. Rozario agreed with Chatterjee by saying that restaurants in malls have suffered the most. “Lot of restaurants are on the verge of closing down because of high rents,” he added. Kabir Azhar, director of Aminia, one of the leading biryani chains in the city, also felt it would take some time for the industry to recover fully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurants-bars-hope-for-tax-relief-to-tide-over-crisis/articleshow/83554690.cms||---

Dr Jayesh Lele, secretary general of IMA, told TOI over 10,000 doctors from Delhi would be participating in it. “It will be a symbolic protest. Doctors will be wearing black badges, masks, ribbons, shirts and running awareness campaigns against violence targeting healthcare professionals,” he said. The doctor added that the medical fraternity was not in favour of hampering health services in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Across the country, we have 3.5 lakh doctors who are going to participate in the protest,” said the IMA secretary general. IMA said there has been a series of violence against doctors in the past two weeks in Assam, Bihar, West Bengal, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and other places. “We are demanding the implementation of central hospital and Health Care Professionals Protection Act with IPC and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), standardisation and augmentation of security in each hospital, and declaring hospitals as protected zones, among others,” said an office bearer of the medical body. “The action committee of IMA, after considering all the aspects and to express our concern, anger and solidarity, has decided to observe June 18 as IMA National Protest Day with demand to stop assault on the profession and the professionals with the slogan ‘save the saviours’,” he added. On yoga guru Ramdev’s alleged recent disparaging remarks against allopathy, IMA said the legal course was under way and would be followed up. “Ramdev has now publicly issued a new statement saying that ‘doctors are devdoots' and he will also go for vaccination. But the mental agony/verbal violence inflicted on us is unforgettable,” IMA added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ima-plans-protest-against-assault-on-docs-tomorrow/articleshow/83588209.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Hours after allowing locals to visit Char Dham shrines with RT-PCR report, Uttarakhand reverses decision||DEHRADUN: After allowing residents of the Char Dham districts to visit the four shrines on Monday, the Uttarakhand government reversed the decision later that day. Late on Monday evening, the government said that no pilgrims will be allowed on the annual pilgrimage and a decision will be taken after the unlock process starts in the state on June 22. The state had allowed residents of Rudraprayag to visit Kedarnath shrine, Uttarkashi residents to visit Gangotri and Yamunotri and Chamoli residents to visit Badrinath with RT-PCR reports. Cabinet minister and state spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “A matter related to the Char Dham yatra is pending in the Uttarakhand high court. The hearing is scheduled for June 16. We were informed about it by the Char Dham Devasthanam Board soon after we made the announcement. Now, we will take a call on opening the yatra for devotees after the HC pronounces its decision. Once the HC verdict is out, the Devasthanam Board will issue SOPs for the yatra.” The minister said that efforts were underway to start the yatra on a small scale. “Keeping the current situation in mind, we have decided to start the yatra with a limited number of people. Preparations are underway and a decision will be made soon.” The Char Dham shrines were opened as per schedule around mid-May but pilgrims were not allowed. The pilgrimage had been curtailed last year too. The turnout of Char Dham pilgrims in 2020 was 3.1 lakh, barely 9% of the 34 lakh devotees who took the pilgrimage in 2019. A lion’s share of the footfall is witnessed during May-June. After that, the footfall reduces from July to mid-September due to the monsoon. From September to October, there is again a rise in the numbers. In November, the shrines close for the winter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hours-after-allowing-locals-to-visit-char-dham-shrines-with-rt-pcr-report-ukhand-reverses-decision/articleshow/83552514.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||BJP seeks LG’s intervention on drain clean-up||New Delhi: Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri has sought lieutenant governor Anil Baijal’s intervention for cleaning of major drains so that the capital does not witness flooding during monsoon. Bidhuri wrote to the LG on Wednesday seeking his intervention. “It is clear that the monsoon will hit the capital by or before June 29. Due to the failure of Delhi government to get the big drains falling under the public works department desilted in the pre-monsoon period, many parts of the city may face flooding. Around 1,400km of drains on both sides of the major roads in Delhi are cleaned by PWD and 400km of small drains by the three municipal corporations. PWD has not yet cleaned these drains,” Bidhuri said. The BJP functionary claimed that the corporations have already cleaned the small drains under their jurisdiction. “This has resulted in a paradoxical situation as due to the blockage of big drains, the small ones also get flooded, which results in flood-like situation in low-lying areas,” Bidhuri stated. No reaction from the AAP government was available despite repeated attempts by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-seeks-lgs-intervention-on-drain-clean-up/articleshow/83588293.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Challaned for not wearing mask, BJP MLA from Roorkee throws money at cop, video goes viral||MUSSOORIE/ROORKEE: A video purportedly showing Roorkee MLA Pradeep Batra flinging money at a policeman in Mussoorie after he was asked to pay a challan for not wearing a mask recently went viral on social media and drew flak from residents and members of the opposition Congress. While the MLA said that he was wearing a mask and was wrongfully penalised, police said they were simply doing their duty and the MLA was found without a mask. The incident happened on Sunday evening on the Mall Road. According to government guidelines, people (both residents and tourists) are allowed to move around on the Mall Road only till 1 pm unless they have a valid reason. “He (Batra) was stopped for not wearing a mask and also for moving on the road during the curfew hours,” said a policeman who was present during the incident but did not wish to be named. Mussoorie circle officer (CO) Narendra Pant said that the SI who issued the challan was simply doing his routine duty. “The officer was simply following instructions. However, we have launched an inquiry into the matter to check if there was any misconduct on either side,” Pant told TOI. In the video, the cop, a sub-inspector, can be heard saying to the MLA, “How are you roaming around without masks? Roaming around is not allowed.” To this, Batra requests the cop to be polite and says he and his family had their masks on all the while. His son says they were only going back to their hotel. When the cop insists that Batra has to pay a challan for Rs 500, he flings the money and goes away with his family. Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, the MLA said, “I had visited Mussoorie with my family. We were taking a stroll down the Mall Road and were headed to our hotel when I spotted the SI berating some tourists. When I confronted the police officer, he started questioning me about my whereabouts. I told him I was a legislator and offered to show him my card, but he refused to see it and said he would challan me for not wearing a mask. That is not true, my family and I had masks on,” the MLA said. “To avoid further confrontation, I gave him the challan amount. However, tourists should not be treated this way,” he added. Batra said that he wants “strong action against the cop for misbehaving with a legislator”. Meanwhile, local residents condemned the MLA for violating curfew rules. “We laud the policeman who did his duty. The behaviour of the MLA is shameful and as a public representative, he has set a bad example,” said Pradeep Bhandari, a resident.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops return stolen valuables of Rs 2 crore to owners||MUMBAI: The Central Mumbai police on Tuesday returned to complainants stolen valuables that were recovered by police. The valuables were returned to complainants in 14 offences registered with the city police. These include two important cases involving gold bars worth Rs 1.3 crore that a Byculla jeweller was duped of and jewellery worth Rs 24.5 lakh that the robbers stole after murdering a 77-year-old woman in her Worli bungalow in February. Police returned jewellery worth Rs 1.9 crore. The programme was organised at the Byculla office of additional commissioner of police Dnyaneshwar Chavan, where police commissioner Hemant Nagrale handed over the recovered valuables to its rightful owners. “We have returned jewellery and other properties in 14 cases,” said Chavan. The quickest recovery and return of property was in the Byculla robbery case of May 31 this year. Jeweller Bharat Jain (56) and his associate were travelling to their factory on a two-wheeler to deliver gold bars when the robbers intercepted them on a motorcycle. One of them was wearing a police uniform. The two robbers snatched the bag containing gold bars weighing 2,480gm and fled. Police arrested four accused in the case, including police constable Khalil Shaikh, within 48 hours of the crime. Joint police commissioner Viwhsas Nangre Patil said that while cases of theft are widely reported, the programme of returning lost property often goes unnoticed. “The speedy detection, recovery and return of properties to complainants also encourage men in khaki to stay motivated. It also increases people’s faith in police,” said Patil. The Worli police had arrested two persons — Amarjit Nishad (22) and Abhijeet Joriya (22) — and recovered stolen jewellery worth Rs 24.5 lakh. The duo had murdered 77-year-old senior citizen Vishni Dolwani in her bungalow in February this year. “We had arrested the accused within 30 hours and recovered the robbed jewellery,” said Anil Koli, senior inspector of Worli police station. Nishad worked at Dolwani’s bungalow as a domestic help. Police also returned a bullet bike which was stolen two years ago, two mangalsutras and gold chains to its owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-return-stolen-valuables-of-rs-2cr-to-owners/articleshow/83559645.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Tikri, one of the protests sites like Singhu, Ghazipur, and Dhansa, has 30x30-foot shelters fitted with cooler, inverter, beds, DTH, and air-conditioners. The camp has fridges stocked with food and desi ghee. It also has water tanker, mosquito nets, and for a new identity and address, a milestone in front of every shed. There’s attached bathroom and toilet. The 1,000 tents in a 20-kilometre row at Tikri has unique numbers for the Punjab and Haryana farmers to recognise their spot. They have parked their tractor-trailers opposite to each other along the highway to the national capital. Each shed can hold 50 farmers but the occupancy on Monday was only 10 to 20. Activists pass time with some hookahSome farmers fitted ACs but almost every shed had fridge, coolers, and dish TV. Farmers dug up pits for toilets and put a water tanker in front of each shed, where they also have gas cylinders, flour, utensils, and the good old kundi-sota (mortar and pestle sets) for grinding chutney. The camp is adorned with posters of Bhimrao Ambedkar and Bhagat Singh. Posters of Bhagat Singh, B R Ambedkar and Sir Chottu Ram keep actvists motivated at the Tikri protest siteFarmer Wazir Singh (72) of Petwar village near Narnaund town in Haryana’s Hisar district said: "Here since December, we are dug in for a long fight. A village committee rotates the shift, sends all the supplies, and does all the fundraising. We are determined to break Modi (the Prime Minister)." He said: "We might seem only a few but, at one call, the entire village can reach the Delhi border in two hours if the government tries to use force. These milestones in front of their sheds are a message to the government, that we are ready to make this camp a permanent residence." A milestone of a village kept outside a tent to help people from the village identify itJaipal (55) of Farmana in Rohtak district said: "Farmers are no longer politically naïve. Seven months of agitation has taught us to cook and help out each other. The Punjab and Haryana farmers have developed a new relation. We have our eyes on the Uttar Pradesh elections, where our fellow peasants are ready to teach the BJP a lesson. We spend the day playing cards, smoking hookah, and chatting. We have developed an understanding on the SYL issue, that it’s all politics." Rajesh Kumar (45) of Buradahar village in Jind district said: "Modi jhooth ki factory hai (Modi is a lie maker), who took our votes and deceived us. We must oust him, however long it takes. On one call, we can fill this camp with lakhs of farmers, thanks to our network. The clashes with police in Jind, Hisar, Sirsa, and Tohana were proofs of this undercurrent."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tikri-combat-ready-with-bunkers/articleshow/83557459.cms||---

Many have already registered their staff for vaccination, while some employees have decided to get vaccinated on their own so that they can join work as early as possible. Restaurants and bars have been shut since the middle of May, when the government levied restrictions after a surge in cases due to the Covid-19 second wave. “We have registered all our employees for vaccine and some of them have even got the jab. It is important that our employees inoculated so that we can operate without any hindrance,” said a representative of Broadway Hotel. Over five thousand people are directly dependent on bars and restaurants in central Kolkata, which includes the waiting staff, management,cooks and bouncers. Last year the bars were allowed to reopen only in August,but it was not before Durga Puja that customers returned to their favourite eateries and bars. “The business had just picked up and we were getting decent footfalls when the second wave struck, and places were shut down again. Last year many of our employees were forced to take up odd jobs to fend for themselves. We do not want to take any chances this time,” said the owner of a bar in Esplanade. Many owners are planning to inform their customers once all their staff members are vaccinated. “We will not only message our regular customers but also put it up on our property that every staff has been vaccinated. This will generate confidence among our customers, who can then visit us without any stress,”said the owner of a crooners’ bar in Chandni. In the pre-pandemic times some of the bars in central Kolkata would fill up by 5 pm catering to office goers and families. Owners now feel that even catering to 50 percent capacity will help them run their establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fb-industry-in-city-rushes-to-vaccinate-staff/articleshow/83554835.cms||Zeeshan Javed

We will now set up a system that will ensure that all such builders can conduct online registrations from their offices in coordination with the property registration department. This will reduce footfall at the sub-registrar offices,” Thorat told TOI. A senior revenue official said with the pandemic-induced restrictions in place, e-registration was initiated as a measure to revive the real estate market. The software was last year submitted to the government-notified cyber security agency for clearance from. The official said the step would create a digital infrastructure that would help developers register the sale agreements from their offices and reduce footfall at the property registration offices. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) chairman Satish Magar, who was among the first developers to register his projects in Nanded City with the earlier software, said, “ People were scared to visit registration offices due to the pandemic. We were working with the government on the new software, which will be good for the realtors and consumers.” Credai (national) vice-president Shantilal Kataria said, It is imperative that the registration department introduces such facilities. It is a good reform and can benefit builders and consumers, besides being a transparent process.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/push-for-e-registration-for-first-sale-of-properties-from-october-thorat/articleshow/83554864.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Times ViewSome restrictions have been eased but they have not been withdrawn totally. This reflects the situation on the ground; the virus’s spread has slowed but the virus is still there. We must keep this in mind as we go about our new-normal routine. The eased restrictions are an acknowledgement that livelihood is important. But irresponsible behaviour and disregarding rules can set back both life and livelihood. Armed with guitars, microphones, keyboards and octopads, the crooners — out of job for several months — demonstrated for more than one hour demanding return to livelihood and also a vaccination drive for the artists and musicians of this industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crooners-sing-in-protest-demand-vax/articleshow/83554863.cms||---

So far, 27 patients have turned up and their complaints ranged from weakness, chest pain, breathlessness, body ache and anxiety. Doctors at the clinic prescribed yoga and a healthy diet. “A lot of people who had recovered from Covid-19 had approached me about the after effects. We are advising them to seek physiotherapy. They need to avoid crowds, wear masks, follow a yoga routine and pay special attention to diet. In case of a problem, they can contact a doctor,” said senior chest physician Dr AK Joshi. The clinic will be especially beneficial for residents of Almora, Pithoragarh and Bageshwar. These are among the state’s nine hill districts which were relatively unaffected during the first wave of Covid-19 last year but were adversely affected in the second wave, accounting for 30% of the state’s total caseload in the last two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/almoras-first-post-covid-clinic-opens/articleshow/83552643.cms||---

On April 23, she’d taken her husband, who had developed Covid-like symptoms, to four hospitals but was turned away. In a heart-rending photograph that captured in one frame the misery of the pandemic, she was seen trying to resuscitate her husband as he lay dying. He didn’t make it. The viral image drew messages of support, of people wanting to help, but there was little to go on. The register at the last hospital she went only mentioned two names, Ravi Singhal and Renu Singhal. A month and a half on, TOI traced her and found her agonising over the future. In the two-room house rented out at Rs 2,500 a month at Avas Vikas Colony in Agra, she broke down. “My daughter Bhumi is 16, a Class X student. My husband was our sole breadwinner,” Renu, 43, told TOI. The family doesn’t have a ration card or an Ayushman Bharat card. She hasn’t been able to find a job because of the pandemic. Ravi, who was 47, sold pethas for a living, making just enough to live by. “I can’t even cover the basics. My constant worry is about my daughter’s future. I request CM Yogi Adityanath to provide us some relief,” she added.  Ravi’s illness, Renu said, began on April 20 with a mild fever. Two days on, he could hardly breathe. By April 23, his condition had turned serious. “I hired an auto and rushed him to the hospital nearby. I was told they did not have oxygen. I tried two other hospitals, but they had no beds. Then, I was asked to go to Sarojini Naidu Medical College, a government hospital,” she recounted. “By then he had started losing consciousness. I went into the emergency ward and begged staff members for a stretcher. But no one listened,” she said. When Renu got back to the auto, she found Ravi was struggling to breathe. “He pressed my hand hard, as if asking me to save him. Then his body turned limp. I tried giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but could not save him.” It was at this point that a passerby took the photo which later went viral. “We will ensure the family gets benefits soon,” Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/failing-to-save-hubby-with-cpr-she-labours-on/articleshow/83560167.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Kolkata||Cops, Kolkata Municipal Corporation to check vaccine certificates of morning walkers at Lake and parks||KOLKATA: Policemen will be deployed at Rabindra Sarobar to check the vaccination status of those who come for morning walk at the lake. Of the 12 gates, only six will be opened to regulate the access. “The gates will be manned by our security guards who will be assisted by Kolkata Police. They will check the Covid vaccination certificate to ensure the person has received both doses,” said a KMDA official. Similar arrangements will be made for morning walkers at Subhas Sarobar lake, the official said. At Eco Park in New Town and Central Park in Salt Lake, too, only those who are completely vaccinated will be allowed entry. In the other parks in Kolkata, security guards engaged by Kolkata Municipal Corporation have been tasked with checking vaccine certificates. “We have asked the security guards to check the documents when allowing morning walkers into the parks. But we have also made it clear that they should not be impolite or get into a confrontation with people,” a KMC parks department senior official said. The excitement over reopening of parks and the two lakes on Wednesday has been tempered by concerns over the vaccination rider. Some senior citizens whose only form of exercise and social engagement was at parks have downloaded the vaccination certificate in their cellphones to show at the entrance. “I don’t want to lose out on the walk,” said Sibendu Mukherjee who is looking forward to the round at Maddox Square. But not all are enthused with the pre-condition, particularly those who have received only one shot and are yet to get the second because of the time interval between the two doses being increased to 12 weeks. Even many youngsters in the 18-plus age group say it is unfair to be penalised for not taking a vaccine shot when getting a slot for the jab has been difficult. KMC and KMDA, the two agencies that oversee the maintenance of parks and lakes in the city, geared up for Wednesday by deploying additional sweepers to clean the pathways. Lawyer Ankit Agarwal pointed out that the government needs to allow a window in the evening so that those who are unable to take morning walks, either due to work pressure or health conditions, could exercise later in the day. “I hope the government will consider the request,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-kmc-to-check-vaccine-certificates-of-morning-walkers-at-lake-and-parks/articleshow/83554887.cms||Suman Chakraborti

While one of them died on the spot, the other succumbed to his injuries while being rushed to the hospital. The victims had come to their farm to take stock of the crops when an argument, which took place between the two parties, turned ugly and the assailants opened fire at the victims. They, later, fled the spot. Police officials said that the land dispute between both the parties is the reason for the killings. The victims, Gurkirtan Singh alias Soni, 30, and his younger brother Gurpej Singh alias Peji, 28, were residents of village Malsi Lanka at Kichha road in the city. The assailants have been identified as Rakesh Mishra alias Pappu Mishra and his nephews Shivam and Shubham. SP city Mamata Vohra said, “Six bullets were fired from a .315 bore rifle. Gurkirtan died on the spot while Gurpej was declared brought dead at Medicity hospital in Teenpani area.” She further added that both the families were at loggerheads since sometime as their farms were adjacent and there was an ongoing dispute over the ownership of the perimeter fence of farmland. Based on the family’s complaint, a case has been registered against Rakesh Mishra, Shubham and Shivam under IPC sections 302 (murder), said the police. Meanwhile, hundreds of villagers assembled at the spot and demanded immediate arrest of the accused. Heavy police force was deployed in the village to avoid any untoward incident.

Due to the pandemic, strict protocol was followed and no gathering of crowd in corridors or common areas was allowed. Raja Iqbal Singh, councillor of GTB Nagar, became the mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and Archna, councillor of Holambi Khurd, its deputy mayor. South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s new mayor is Sagarpur West councillor Mukesh Suryan and the deputy mayor is Pawan Sharma, councillor of Chhawla. East Delhi Municipal Corporation picked Shyam Sunder Aggarwal, councillor of Raghubarpura, as its mayor and Kiran Vaidya, councillor of Mayur Vihar, as the deputy mayor. All of them belong to BJP. This will be the last term of the BJP-run corporations before the next civic elections, which are due in April 2022. With an eye on a possible third wave of Covid-19, the north corporation will focus on beefing up health facilities, said its new mayor. “Either it is improving infrastructure at hospitals, motivating doctors and nurses, or completing the pending projects before the next wave, I have already started asking officials for updates,” said Singh. “Our stress will also be on making the corporation self-reliant for the projects. We will pursue Delhi government for releasing all our due funds and revive our source of finances,” he added. The south corporation mayor promised improvement in all sectors. Through surprise visits and frequent review meetings, the corporation will improve sanitation and garbage collection, and try to attain 100% waste segregation and improve quality of services at hospitals and polyclinics, said Suryan. “However, the priority will be on increasing the admission rate and bringing the learning level at corporation schools at par with public schools,” added Suryan, who was earlier education committee chairman. During his tenure, the corporation had managed to get 1.15 lakh admissions. East corporation mayor Aggarwal said he would work for facelift of east Delhi. The members of standing committees in three municipalities were also elected unanimously or through voting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-mayors-and-deputies-for-last-term-before-polls/articleshow/83588401.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Surat||First NRG Manchester councillor wants more Indians to join politics||SURAT: Sixteen years ago, he went to the United Kingdom from Bharuch to pursue post-graduation courses in information technology and business administration. But soon Vimal Choksi found himself getting involved in the social activities and started to actively help the Indian diaspora in Manchester region. As a result, he soon became the go-to man for the Indian-origin people there for all their issues. In May 2018, Choksi got the opportunity to contest the elections for the Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council. His efforts spoke when a population consisting of 95% white community elected him as the first Indian-origin councillor. A councillor for over three years now, Choksi wants to increase participation of Indian community in the politics there. “It surprised me that despite having a large community here, there was hardly any political participation of Indians outside London especially in the north-western region,” said Choksi, adding “The thought as to why it took 60 years for an Indian like him to get elected as a councillor baffled me!” Choksi’s continuous efforts and community services in Greater Manchester region were recently recognized nationally when his name featured among the list of 1,129 people in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List. He will be honoured as Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). “I am passionate about helping our community and the difference that we can make in their lives. I want more Indians to come forward to understand the system or join and we will offer them all guidance and support,” he told TOI. Choksi has been vocal about the issues affecting the Indian diaspora and during the pandemic last year has led calls for Indian consulate in Manchester. “There were people looking for help on Twitter, those I have never met even called and messaged seeking help. Being in this position I was able to extend extra support to help them get government grant and financial schemes during Covid,” he said. In 2019 general election, Choksi helped an Indian-origin MP from the constituency of Stockport to get elected as MP in north-west.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/first-nrg-manchester-councillor-wants-more-indians-to-join-politics/articleshow/83552694.cms||Jay Pachchigar
---||Pune||Irrigation dept stops dam water release for rural areas||Pune: The state irrigation department on Tuesday stopped the release of water from the Khadakwasla dam into the Mutha canal for rural areas, following decent spells of rain in the last two weeks in Daund, Yavat and Indapur, and the subsequent drop in demand for water.The irrigation department officials said there was no plan to release water in the immediate future. The four dams in the Khadakwasla circle had 6.5 TMC stock on Tuesday. It would now be used to meet the drinking water requirements of the city and its adjacent areas.Tuesday’s collective stock of 6.5 TMC in the four dams in the Khadakwasla circle was about 0.5 TMC more than the last year’s stock on the same day. Khadakwasla had around 48% live water stock on Tuesday, while Panshet and Varasgaon were 16% and 31% full, respectively.The city is unlikely to face any shortage of water this year because of the adequate stock now. The city lifts about 1.5 TMC water each month from Khadakwasla. The existing stock can meet the city’s water requirement for over four months.Besides the dams in the Khadakwasla circle, the city draws water from the Bhama Askhed dam. On Tuesday, the dam’s stock was 2.9 TMC -- 38% of its total capacity.Officials from the state irrigation department said the city should use water judiciously and prevent wastage. Officials said the catchment of the dams had received around 100mm rainfall since June 1, but the storage had not recorded any increase so far.“The catchments are yet to receive continuous heavy rain, which could increase the water storage. The catchments receive maximum rainfall in July and August,” an official said.The Pune Municipal Corporation had earlier urged the state to increase the city’s annual water quota because of the increase in population and more villages getting merged in the city limits.The stock in Pavana dam, that supplies water to Pimpri Chinchwad, was at 39% on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irrigation-dept-stops-dam-water-release-for-rural-areas/articleshow/83554917.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: In a first, 50kg pet dog undergoes bariatric operation||MUMBAI: Deepika’s finally getting back into shape. The 50kg 7-year-old Indie cross breed, pet to a family in Pune, underwent weight-reduction surgery last week. According to doctors, the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was the first such operation done on an animal in India. Over the last few years, Deepika’s ebullience had been waning. She had put on weight, had difficulty walking, could barely stand, panted excessively. Further, she had been diagnosed with a host of ailments such as liver, kidney, cardiac and high BP besides cataract, thyroid and hernia, said Dr Narendra Pardeshi, veterinary laparoscopic surgeon from Pune. Despite a controlled diet, exercise and medicines, Deepika’s condition had worsened, her owner said. But thanks to the surgery, she is now 45kg. Deepika’s owner Daisy Daruwala said, “She had become lethargic. At one point, she was popping more tablets than the food she ate.” As Deepika’s condition continued to worsen, Dr Shashank Shah, a bariatric surgeon attached to Lilavati Hospital, Bandra, proposed that the bariatric surgery would work on the dog. “Excess of grelin, a hormone, reduces metabolism. This, in turn, affects the liver, the viscera and other organs,” said Dr Shah. “In Deepika’s case, the curvature of the stomach was detached to reduce the size of the stomach by 70%, and sutured. So, the patient consumes lesser food and yet feels satiated.” Having shed 5kg, Deepika now stands, even walks around the house. Her panting has reduced, the high blood pressure is now in better control and the ECG is normalising, Dr Pardeshi said, “Were it not for the surgery, Deepika would have been bed-ridden in a couple of years… This surgery will give her a better quality of life and a longer lifespan.” For the last few days, Deepika has been feeding on diluted chicken stock. A week into the surgery, the canine is already looking slimmer and feeling better, said Daruwala whose family had to avail of a loan for the surgery. “She is back to walking around the house,” said Daruwala. “We can’t wait for her to bounce back completely.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-a-first-50kg-pet-dog-undergoes-bariatric-op/articleshow/83590658.cms||Alex Fernandes
---||Kolkata||Office-goers opt for pool cars, bike cabs to travel||KOLKATA: The demand for car-pooling and contract carriages peaked on Tuesday as people found commuting to office and back a challenge in absence of public transport. Many car owners have downloaded the pooling app so that the cost of fuel is shared among passengers. A good percentage of office-goers opted for bike-cabs as a pocket friendly means. But a majority of office-goers, who were asked to join work by their authorities, said that it would be a costly affair to travel to office. “Unless buses, autos and trains are allowed to run, we end up paying three to four times our usual cost of commuting. Because of a steep rise in diesel prices, a twelve seater van is asking for Rs 150 a day for my trip to my office at Salt Lake Sector V and back home. Normally, I pay Rs 30 for a round trip by bus,” said Arka Saha. Phones of school bus owners and carpool operators hasn’t stopped ringing since last evening with people enquiring about charges for a trip to office and back from Wednesday. “We have no complaints. For more than one year our vehicles have been lying idle as schools did not open,” said Barun Das, carpool operator. The pool car owners have been approached individually “through personal contacts” so far and not by any company. “Several requests have come. Office goers from the same building in Dalhousie or Park Street have approached us. Some approached us on behalf of their company, since our vehicles are now lying idle, their company might be interested in using them. The cars need to beready, hence we have sought time to work out modalities,”said Poolcar Owners’ Welfare Association vice-president Arupam Dutta. The association has sought time to speak to transport minister Firhad Hakin in this issue on Wednesday. The West Bengal Contract Carriage Owners’ and Operators’ Association said that the request for buses have mostly been for the smaller ones and limited to the districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/office-goers-opt-for-pool-cars-bike-cabs-to-travel/articleshow/83554923.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Only 50% of the total sitting capacity of the PMC auditorium can be occupied as per the Covid restrictions. The civic body has decided to make arrangements so that none of the elected members miss out on the meeting. So, the option of using both new and old auditoriums of the civic body at the same time was being explored. The new arrangement was finalised on Tuesday. “We will make arrangements so that both audio and video transmissions can be done in both the auditoriums,” Ganesh Bidkar, leader of the house in the PMC, told TOI. The civic body has 164 elected members. The five nominated members are also allowed to attend the general body meeting, but cannot cast vote. The general body meeting needs to be held once a month. If a corporator remains absent at three consecutive meetings, then his membership can be cancelled. After the unlock phase started, the PMC had attempted to conduct a general body meeting in June 2020, with presence of 100 elected members.

---||Mumbai||Four months after Japan warned of Mumbai Metro 3 delay, state mum||MUMBAI: The delayed, underground Mumbai Metro 3 project from Cuffe Parade to Seepz is now staring at a major cash crunch. The reason—the indecisiveness of the state government. On February 17, 2021, Japanese ambassador to India, Suzuki Satoshi, wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, expressing fears of an impending “cash crunch” and “significant delay or stagnation” for the project. Satoshi’s letter, accessed by TOI, requested the CM to approve the revised project cost for the fourth tranche of the loan so that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is funding the metro, can release the money. Times ViewThe delay in the completion of the underground Metro has both financial and social implications for a city that is in desperate need of better infrastructure for public transport. The north-south line will provide commuters an alternative to crowded local trains and take a huge chunk of traffic off the roads. The state must find a way to end the legal impasse over the Kanjurmarg land and get the last mile of the project expedited.“…your approval… is required as soon as possible, at the latest by the end of this week, to avoid shortage of cash in the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL),” it said. TOI has learnt that four months later, the state government has failed to give its approval even as the project cost has escalated from Rs 23,136 crore to Rs 33,406 crore. The chief minister’s office refused to comment, but a senior state official told TOI any decision is unlikely to be taken by the state government till the issue of the Metro 3 car shed is resolved in the high court. A MMRCL spokesperson too chose not to comment. Last December, Bombay high court stayed the suburban collector’s decision to hand over the Kanjurmarg plot for the car shed. “Since then, there has been virtually no initiative on the part of state agencies to vacate the stay,” said government sources. Since 2013, JICA has disbursed roughly Rs 13,425 crore in three tranches for the Metro 3 project. “The JICA’s last tranche of Rs 2,800 crore disbursed in 2018 will run out by December,” highly placed sources told this newspaper. “The Japanese agency has agreed to disburse an additional Rs 6,500 crore, but it is awaiting the state’s approval for it,” they said. The protocol is that the state must first approve the cost escalation proposal and convey its decision to the union ministry of housing and urban affairs. Once the Centre clears it, JICA disburses the loan. The Japanese ambassador’s letter dated February 17 to the CM says the fourth tranche will have no bearing on the construction of the Metro 3 depot. “…your approving the fourth tranche will not affect the decision on the location of the depot,” it said. “JICA stands ready to consider another loan to support the construction of the depot when the issue of its location is resolved,” said the letter. A two-page annex note attached to the ambassador’s letter said the approval of the revision of the total project cost reflecting actual fund requirements is “indispensable” for MMRCL. “During JICA’s detailed fact finding mission with MMRCL, conducted from December 2020 to January 2021, it was recognized that there is a real possibility for MMRCL to face fund shortage within the next fiscal year (FY2021) if additional loan cannot be provided by end of this fiscal (FY2020),” it said. “As a financer of this project, the government of Japan and JICA are strongly concerned that the project would potentially face serious difficulties such as significant delays or stagnation, unless the loan is extended in a timely manner,” said the ambassador’s annex note. MMRCL, the project implementing authority for the 33.5 km Metro 3 line, has already spent Rs 18,000 crore on the project. About 70% of the work including 95% of tunneling is complete. Though the metro car shed comprises barely 4% of the work, the project cannot be commissioned without it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-mths-after-japan-warned-of-metro-3-delay-state-mum/articleshow/83559213.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

Curtailment to the extent of 30% in all major subjects will be applicable, just as the previous academic year 2020-21, Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye told TOI. “It is informed that in view of the seriousness of the pandemic, postponement of exams and the forthcoming assembly elections, etc, for new academic year 2021-2022, curtailed syllabus for class 10 and 12 will remain the same,” states the circular by the Board to schools. The pandemic has altered the academic schedule, delaying the start of the academic year and eating into instructional days. With the state assembly elections scheduled early next year, many school staffers too are utilised for polling duty. However, Board officials said that the persisting pandemic situation was the major reason it was decided to continue with it. “Because of the pandemic, we have decided to continue with the curtailed syllabus. There will be 30% deduction, same as last year,” said Shetye. Officials said assembly elections are planned in consultation with the board and will not have much actual impact on the exams. The board had curtailed the syllabus in the subjects of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics in Class 12, in line with the parts left out by the Central Board of Secondary Education. Goa Board had said that it has taken the CBSE’s line in these subjects for Class 12 for the benefit of students who will be answering competitive exams at the national level. For Class 10, the portion stands curtailed by 28% to 30% for all first, second, third language subjects, besides mathematics, science, social science. For 12, portion has been curtailed in 33 subjects across the streams of arts, commerce and science and also for some subjects of the vocational stream. The trimming of syllabus has also been done for children with special needs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/class-x-xii-to-see-their-syllabus-curtailed-again/articleshow/83557471.cms||---

Leader of the Opposition in North Delhi Municipal Corporation Vikas Goel said the citizens of Delhi were keeping a close watch on all the scores and would give a befitting response to these corrupt methods of BJP by throwing them out of the civic bodies in the upcoming elections. South Delhi Municipal Corporation Leader of the Opposition Prem Chauhan said the new mayors had been accused of corruption. East civic body Leader of the Opposition Manoj Tyagi said, last year, BJP-led east corporation had seen rampant corruption with respect to garbage cleaning, CCTV installation in schools and hiring of security guards. Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said the Aam Aadmi Party members should ponder before they speak, as their callous statements often make them a laughingstock, like on Wednesday, when they questioned why BJP changes mayors every year. “Before speaking, they should have studied the Municipal Act, which clearly specifies the  of mayor every year. Second, nothing can be more vague than a corruption allegation on new mayors. All three have been councillors for over four years and have held held offices in the civic bodies, yet no allegation stands against them. AAP’s allegations are baseless and false,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-alleges-new-mayors-corrupt-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/83588449.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court refuses to stay release of movie, ‘Sherni’||NAINITAL: Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday refused to stay the streaming of ‘Sherni’ – a movie which is scheduled to be released on June 18 on an OTT platform. The court, however, has listed the petition for further hearing on June 23. An application, filed by wildlife activist Sangeeta Dogra, has been moved in a PIL that is already pending before the court. The original PIL deals with killing of animals declared maneaters and glorification of hunters. It demands a ban on engaging private shooters or hunters to kill maneaters. The case was mentioned by Dogra before the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma. In her fresh application, Dogra sought a stay on the release of the movie. The bench, while denying relief, said it will take up the matter next Wednesday. In her application, Dogra alleges that in the movie a tigress is declared a “maneater” and is shown to be shot dead by a hunter who owns sports category weapons and is not authorized to do so. By showing a private individual can kill a tiger, the film encourages ‘kangaroo court proceedings’, the application contends. The application adds that the trailer of the movie appears to “glorify hunting and sports category weapons, use of drones and other hunting equipment and techniques which are unlawful in India”. The application further says in the movie, a tigress (baghin) is called a sherni (lioness), indicating that the creators of the movie do not know the difference between the two. Dogra added “that the storyline of the movie is an ongoing issue in the country and this may create dissent among villagers and animal rights activists”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-refuses-to-stay-release-of-movie-sherni/articleshow/83552774.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kolkata||After RG Kar, SSKM conducts Cov autopsy||Kolkata: After RG Kar Medical College, IPGMER starts conducting pathological autopsy on bodies of Covid victims. On Tuesday an autopsy was conducted on the body of 57-year-old Debasish Mukherjee at SSKM. The Haldia resident was on ECMO support during Covid treatment at a private hospital on June 14. “Pathological autopsy is a new step in medical science. We will not restrict ourselves to dissecting bodies of the covid deceased but expand it to cases where patients died and doctors could not understand the cause. The credit for allowing such dissection goes to IPGMER director professor Manimoy Banerjee,” said Diptendra Sarkar professor of surgery. The hospital has already formed a team of doctors — Uttara Chatterjee, Indani Das, Raja Roy — from pathology, forensic medicine and microbiology departments respectively apart from Sarkar. The team will be conducting the second autopsy on the body of Tapas Ranjan Joardar (72) on Wednesday. The Dhakuira resident died on Monday during Covid treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-rg-kar-sskm-conducts-cov-autopsy/articleshow/83554990.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Meerut||Excessive use of pesticides in riverbed farming threatens biodiversity in Hastinapur sanctuary||Meerut: Fertile banks of the Ganga all across its course propels unhindered riverbed farming and use of vast quantities of pesticides that pose a great threat to the Gangetic biodiversity. The activity takes place all along the river’s course from Bijnor till Prayagraj and does not spare even the state’s largest state sanctuary -- Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (from Bijnor to Garh Mukteshwar) and Ramsar site (Garh to Narora).Notably, the sanctuary also witnesses conservation of river species, like gharials, Gangetic dolphins and turtles jointly organised by WWF India and UP forest division.Speaking with TOI, field officer of WWF India Sanjeev Yadav said, “Though we continuously sensitize farmers towards biodiversity and have even convinced them to become Ganga praharis thus becoming stakeholders in the conservation process, but the area is too vast to include everyone with limited resources. Pesticides enter the food chain of this biodiversity. Fish are the carriers of pollutants which are the food for gharials and dolphins. Then, riverbed farming also leads to destruction of turtle eggs. The adverse effect can drastically compromise the overall health of species.”According to Shyam Singh, a farmer, “We grow vegetables here which are prone to insect attack and are overpowered by weeds as well. So, we have to use glyphosate which is an herbicide and an insecticide also.”According to an official at the district agriculture office, “Farming on both sides of the river is an evil necessity particularly when pesticides and other chemicals are used as it affects the river ecology. However, an organic farming belt will come up on both sides of the river in Uttar Pradesh. State horticulture and Jal Shakti departments are rolling out a plan to convert a five-km radius on both sides of the river into an organic farming belt. Under this plan, farmers will be discouraged to use chemicals in the form of fertilisers, insecticides or pesticides and only organic ways will be encouraged to not only have healthy crops but also prevent pollution in Ganga.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/excessive-use-of-pesticides-in-riverbed-farming-threatens-biodiversity-in-hastinapur-sanctuary/articleshow/83552760.cms||Sandeep Rai

It is expiring on September 15. The HC questioned her advocate Rizwan Siddiquee on why she had not moved court earlier. A bench of Justices P B Varale also verbally remarked the “application is vague” and said she could have approached her lawyer and court earlier had she been more vigilant. Siddiquee submitted that she has to travel abroad for a film shoot and her production team was already on location. Ranaut’s application said that the Regional Passport Office (RPO) had raised objections to her renewal and sought a court nod when she disclosed the FIR against her by Munawar Ali over allegedly inflammatory social media posts. Rizwan Merchant, counsel for Ali, raised preliminary objections to her plea saying it nowhere places any refusal or order by the passport officer on record. He also said she has not made the RPO party to her application. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-passport-renewal-plea-vague-court-tells-kangana/articleshow/83559668.cms||---
---||Delhi||Plea seeks dry rations for all needy people||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the stand of the AAP government on a plea challenging its non-PDS guidelines for distribution of ration. A bench of justices Navin Chawla and Asha Menon issued notice to the Delhi government and Centre on an application filed by NGO Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, which said that foodgrains should be given to all needy persons. The plea also sought a direction to the AAP government to modify the May 27 guidelines to the extent that it should not be a mere one-time relief measure and that the beneficiaries may receive dry ration (foodgrains) for every calendar month until further orders. The petitioner claimed that the Delhi government has stopped distributing dry ration to non-PDS beneficiaries at several centres. “The impugned guidelines have put an arbitrary limit of 20 lakh beneficiaries under the scheme. This limit of 20 lakh appears to have no rational basis. The provisioning and the estimate of the number of persons who are in need of the benefits under the scheme ought to be based on the number of people who in fact had benefited under a similar scheme last year,” the application stated. “During the first wave of Covid-19 last year, nearly 69.6 lakh people, who did not possess ration cards, registered under the e-coupon scheme and were provided dry rations following orders by the court,” it added. “Therefore, rations must be provided to all those who are in need, as also ordered last year,” the petitioner stated, adding that authorities must provide a helpline number for people to register complaints regarding problems with registration or availing benefits under the scheme. Nodal officers must be asked to place on the official website the action taken by them within 24 hours of receiving a complaint, the plea suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-seeks-dry-rations-for-all-needy-people/articleshow/83588517.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Residents flock to sweet shops as they open after a month in Uttarakhand||DEHRADUN: Sweet shops in the state opened on Tuesday after a month-long gap. People could be seen flocking to the shops in the morning. On Monday, as the curfew was extended by another week to June 22, sweet shops were allowed to open for five days. In several parts of the city, shopkeepers said they will need at least two days to streamline their raw material supplies and complete sanitisation work. Shop owners said that they hoped a majority of the orders would be online so as to avoid the risk of contagion. Ravi Uniyal, a sweet shop owner in Dharampur area said, “It’s a relief to be back in business after so long. Our regular customers have also called to ask if we are open. It will take a day or two to stablise things but it will be business as usual for all of us soon, we are hoping.” Another sweet shopkeeper in the city, who did not wish to be named, said, “During these times, most customers are placing their orders online, which is a safer option. The shops have opened but we plan to deliver to people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-flock-to-sweet-shops-as-they-open-after-a-month-in-state/articleshow/83552785.cms||Abhijeet Singh
---||Goa||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant rules out early polls, elections likely in February ’22||PANAJI: CM Pramod Sawant on Tuesday said the state assembly elections are likely to be held on schedule in February next year. The previous assembly elections were conducted in February 2017. Sawant, who had last week announced that BJP would fight the polls under his leadership, ruled out early elections. “They will be held on time, tentatively in February,” he told reporters. Political parties, meanwhile, have already begun gearing up for the polls although the Covid-19 pandemic has set them back where campaigning is concerned. Aspiring candidates of most parties have also started claiming for tickets and announcing their candidatures. BJP national general secretary (organization) B L Santhosh and Goa desk in-charge C T Ravi had arrived in the state last week to take stock of the political situation in Goa. Emissaries of the Congress high command are also expected in Goa, with state desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao likely to arrive this week ahead of an organisational shake-up within the state Congress unit. Rao is expected to hold meetings in each of the 40 constituencies to take stock of the party’s presence at the grassroots level. With an aim to defeat BJP in next assembly elections, regional outfit GFP is trying to forge a grand alliance. Party president Vijai Sardesai had recently called for the opposition to unite to defeat BJP in the polls even as he underscored the need for “repositioning Goa to undo the damage caused by the BJP government”. MGP senior leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar said that his party will launch a movement on June 18 - which marks the anniversary of Goa Revolution Day — to bring down the BJP regime in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-rules-out-early-polls-elections-likely-in-feb-22/articleshow/83557491.cms||---

On Tuesday, the Hiranandani Heritage Residents Welfare Association told cops that some “unscrupulous elements” had played a fraud on it and “put the health and wellbeing” of its members in “serious peril.” TOI spoke to some residents, who said there were many red flags right at the start: None of the recipients received an invoice for payment and none suffered any common side-effects associated with the vaccination. “The team had no laptop or mobile app used for online verification in vaccination centres,” said a resident. “They only physically checked and noted down people’s Aadhar number and said we would get an OTP a few days later that we had to convey to them,” said resident Gopal Sura. Concern turned to fear when 150 of the recipients got vaccination certificates from different hospitals carrying different dates. “The fraudsters collected around Rs 5 lakh and left us worrying about what was injected,” said a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/frauds-organise-fake-vaccination-camp-at-mumbai-society-pocket-rs-5-lakh/articleshow/83560291.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Chandigarh||Democratic rights encompass right to dissent as well: SKM||Bathinda: Attacking the Union government, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha has accused it of doublespeak on the issue of freedom of expression. The umbrella farm body on Tuesday alleged while the Centre had signed on a joint statement about the freedom of expression saying it was against politically motivated internet shutdowns but in practical it was doing the opposite. As per news reports, ‘G7 and Guest Countries: 2021 Open Societies Statement’ accommodated the Government of India’s view that internet freedoms are subject to national security and law and order situation. Morcha said India signed on the joint statement which encourages values such as freedom of expression, both online and offline, as a freedom that safeguards democracy and helps people live free from fear and oppression. Prime Minister in his speech upheld the importance of cyberspace as an avenue for advancing democratic values and not of subverting the values. It is ironic that central government was making statements on issues which it faild abysmally in practice, SKM claimed. From the time farmers’ movement started, the government had been trying to curb the freedom of expression of the protestors as well as their supporters, it alleged. Farmer unions and their supporter groups in India had found their social media spaces restricted time and again, it claimed, adding that it was the case even for supporters based elsewhere. The internet shutdown that was enforced on the peaceful farmers’ movement had no justification either, it claimed. Suspension of Twitter accounts some farmer groups and their supporters continued even now, it claimed. The freedom of expression was a basic democratic right of all citizens, and the government could not curb it based on its own political motivations as was happening right now, alleged the morcha. Democratic rights encompass more rights than just freedom of expression. Right to dissent and right to protest were an integral part of democracy, it said.SKM said it was reported that an FIR was registered for uprooting the foundation stone laid for BJP office in Jhajjar. Morcha condemned the action and asked for the withdrawal of the FIR immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/democratic-rights-encompass-right-to-dissent-as-well-skm/articleshow/83557550.cms||---

According to the officials, waste management around the river Ganga has been a big concern. To reduce littering around the place and ensure regular cleaning, a dedicated workforce was required. The external agency will not only carry out sanitation works round the clock but will also conduct regular awareness drives for local shopkeepers, priests and residents. Rishikesh has seven ghats including Chandreshwar ghat, Nav Ghat, Triveni ghat, Adhetanand ghat, 72 Sidhi ghat which will be maintained by over 70 sanitation workers, 10 supervisors and one site manager. The agency hired will also have an officer for support. Availability of boats, life jackets and other adequate safety gears for the workers and the visiting officials will be made mandatory. The officials also added that sanitation workers will be uniformed and will carry identity cards. They will be equipped with automated cleaning tools. A schedule will also be available to show the details of cleaning timings at all the ghats. The time for disposing of the waste generated from the ghats and crematoriums will be fixed. Daily progress report will be monitored through a logbook specifically describing the quantity of various types of waste collected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-dedicated-workforce-to-clean-7-ghats-within-municipal-limits-of-rishikesh/articleshow/83552804.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi LG dials UP CM for more water, seeks status report from DJB||NEW DELHI: Amid reports of the water crisis worsening in different parts of the capital, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday spoke to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and requested him to increase Delhi’s share. He will also speak to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar with the same request. Delhi Jal Board (DJB), on the other hand, has been asked to submit a comprehensive status report, followed by a detailed time-bound action plan, to address the crisis. Delhi has an installed supply capacity of 930-940 million gallons per day (MGD) potable water, but has a supply-demand gap of more than 300MGD, which gets worse during the summer. The city is hugely dependant on these two states for its raw water. DJB, responsible for supplying potable water to most of the capital, sources 612MGD water from Haryana and 254MGD from Uttar Pradesh while the rest comes from subsurface sources like tubewells and ranney wells. It gets around 375MGD water from the Yamuna and the two canals supplying water via Haryana-CLC canal and Delhi Sub Branch Canal, while 220MGD is sourced through the Bhakra Nangal storage. A recent video from Vivekanand Camp in Chankyapuri, which went viral, showed women climbing a water tanker, while another huge group was seen waiting with empty vessels. The chaos broke out as soon as a tanker of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) reached the camp. The LG has sought a detailed report from DJB and NDMC on water shortage, especially in slums. He has been monitoring the supply situation, a source said. “Apart from the supply, its management and distribution in terms of limiting leakage and wastage and the issue of unequal distribution per person in different localities need to be addressed at the earliest,” the source added. The situation has worsened after water production recently got affected at the Chandrawal water treatment plant (WTP) as a result of excessive algae in the Yamuna. DJB had stated on Saturday that the water would be available at a low pressure, especially in tail-end areas till the situation improved. Some of the affected areas are Civil Lines, Hindu Rao Hospital and adjoining areas, Kamla Nagar, Shakti Nagar and adjoining areas, Karol Bagh, Paharganj, Old and New Rajendra Nagar, Patel Nagar (East and West), Baljeet Nagar, Prem Nagar, and Inderpuri and adjoining areas. The plant was operating at 90% capacity on Tuesday, a DJB official said. Water tankers are available on demand on the emergency helpline number and the central control room on 1916, a DJB official said. While battling Covid-19, Delhi has been facing repeated supply disruptions in the past few months due to increased levels of ammonia, industrial pollutants, low raw water supply and increase in silt levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lg-dials-up-cm-for-more-water-seeks-status-report-from-djb/articleshow/83555209.cms||AlokKNMishra

Businessman Dinesh Chhajed had suffered a paralytic attack on June 11 after his blood pressure shot up. He was rushed to D N Mehta Hospital in Navsari town where a CT scan confirmed a blood clot in his brain. Later he was shifted to a private hospital in Surat. However, the doctors at the private hospital declared Chhajed brain-dead on June 14 and informed Donate Life organization that promotes cadaver organ donation. “We met the family members of Dineshbhai and counselled about cadaver donation. His wife Jayaben readily agreed. After receiving consent from the family, we informed State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) convener Dr Pranjal Modi and told him about heart, kidneys and liver transplantation,” Nilesh Mandlewala of Donate Life told TOI. As there was no patient in need of a heart transplant in the state, the heart was allotted to a Mumbai-based hospital where it was transplanted into a 30-year-old Navi Mumbai resident. The heart was transported via a chartered flight from Surat to Mumbai on Tuesday morning. The two kidneys and a liver were transported to Ahmedabad by road. One kidney was transplanted into a 47-year-old woman from Ahmedabad and another into a 17-year-old student from Surat at IKDRC in Ahmedabad. The liver was given to a 43-year-old man from Ahmedabad. Two corneas were handed over to Surat-based Lok Drishti Eye bank. Chhajed’s wife Jayaben said, “My husband had been involved in social service throughout his life. He was always ready to help others in whichever way he could. We have just followed what he had been practicing all his life by donating his organs to people who need them. It death too my husband has helped six lives.” Chhajed is survived by his wife and a 13-year-old son Jinag, a class VIII student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/in-death-navsari-bizman-donates-life-to-six/articleshow/83552834.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Allow us to open shops, say traders of Mussoorie||MUSSORIE: Some 500 shopkeepers on Tuesday stood in front of their shops or in the balcony of their homes, holding placards, in a protest to demand that shops be allowed to open immediately in Mussoorie. “When tourists are allowed to come to the town, hotels are allowed to open, why can shops not open normally too?  After suffering losses for two consecutive peak tourist seasons, it is now a matter of survival for the shopkeepers. The government must think of our plight too,” said Rajat Aggarwal, president of Mussoorie Traders Association (MTA). Uttarakhand had, on Monday, extended the statewide curfew to June 22, allowing some select shops to open. “Most of the shopkeepers are in dire straits as they have to pay rentals, salaries and take care of their families. We insist that the shops be allowed to open and electricity and water bills be waived off,” demanded Jagjeet Kukreja, secretary of MTA. Notably, carrying an RT-PCR test for tourists has been mandatory for the last two months. On Monday, the state allowed some relaxation and now visitors can carry negative rapid antigen reports as well to enter the state. This has increased footfall in the hill town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/allow-us-to-open-shops-say-traders-of-mussoorie/articleshow/83552837.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Mumbai||College dropout cons 13 of Rs 1.7 lakh with sob stories||MUMBAI: A second-year agriculture college dropout who duped flyers at Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai airports of over Rs1.7 lakh in six months is in police custody. Modella Dineshkumar (22), a Guntur (AP) resident, siphoned money from flyers claiming he had missed his flight and urgently needed to go to Chandigarh for a medical exam or some other sob story. He duped high-profile flyers of Rs7,500-10,000, promising to return it soon after he reaches home, police said. Dineshkumar tried to dupe Nagpur resident, Raghunandan Thakare (27), a marine engineer, on June 14, after duping him earlier at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport on January 1. “Dineshkumar was caught after he met the same flyer. His victims believed him and gave money,” said deputy commissioner of police (zone VIII) Manjunath Singe. Thakare got suspicious when he noticed Dineshkumar near the baggage belt. Thakare was to fly to Nagpur when he met Dineshkumar the second time. Thakare said, “I got emotional when the accused showed his ticket and said he missed his flight to Chandigarh. I transferred Rs7,500 through an e-wallet to buy a ticket. He promised to repay once he reached home. Few days later, when I called, he made fun of me.” This time, he was arrested by a team led by assistant inspector Swati Nalawade. “He would fool flyers by giving the excuse that he had to appear for an exam, or he was going to Vijayawada as his mother was serious or he wanted to pay fees for his medical exam. In six months, he duped at least 13 flyers,” said Sahar police senior inspector Dinkar Shilvate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-college-dropout-cons-13-of-rs-1-7l-with-sob-stories/articleshow/83559671.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Digital divide surfaces as universities weigh undergraduate admission test option||KOLKATA: The online-offline debate has again surfaced, this time for undergraduate admissions. With the state board, CBSE and CISCE cancelling the Class XII board exams as a precaution against the novel coronavirus, several universities are exploring the option of holding entrance tests. Some private universities and institutions are thinking of online entrance exams, while others, mostly state-run universities, say they may hold physical exams, considering the digital divide among students. “Entrance tests could not be held at Jadavpur University last year due to the pandemic. Online admission tests were ruled out as many applicants would not have had access to high-speed internet. In 2019, the arts faculty admitted students based on admission test marks and Plus-II scores. This formula is likely to be reintroduced as the admissions begin in July,” said an arts faculty teacher. A meeting of the UG admissions committee or individual faculties will be convened after the state council announces the Plus-II marking formula. “Some science departments are keen on entrance exams. But that will depend on the logistics and feasibility in August,” said a science faculty teacher, adding a final call would be taken after the marking formula was framed. Calcutta University has adopted a wait-and-watch policy. “A decision will be taken in the syndicate meeting,” said a CU official. Presidency University has, however, scheduled its UG admission tests in August, to be conducted by West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board. “Till now, the plan holds,” said a WBJEE official. The official said, “The entrance test is unlikely to be moved online as candidates may find it difficult to access internet.” But St Xavier’s University, Kolkata, will hold online entrance tests this year. Vice-chancellor Father Felix Raj said so far, the university admitted UG students based on their Plus-II scores. But there will be a deviation this year and admissions will entirely be based on entrance test scores. The online admission tests will be held between July 10 and 12. A set of mock tests will also be conducted on July 8 and 9. The online submission of application forms and fees started from June 14 and will continue till July 3. “The entrance tests will examine candidates’ proficiency in English and reasoning skills. . It will give a level playing field to all applicants,” Fr Felix Raj said. MAKAUT will continue to hold online exams for vocational programmes, including BBA and BCA. “Our applicants have access to internet,” said vice-chancellor, Saikat Maitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/digital-divide-surfaces-as-univs-weigh-ug-admission-test-option/articleshow/83555085.cms||---
---||Delhi||Just 1 heatwave day in Delhi this summer, the lowest since 2011||NEW DELHI: Delhi has had comparatively salubrious weather this year, with only a single heatwave day so far — the fewest since 2011 when one heatwave day was recorded between March and June. This year too, the only heatwave day recorded was on March 29. With the rainy season around the corner, meteorological officials say another heatwave day is unlikely now in 2021. A heatwave, in India Meteorological Department definition, is when the maximum temperature is at least 40 degrees Celsius and 4.5 degrees or more higher than normal temperature or the maximum touches 45 degrees Celsius in a meteorological region. The data shows that March 29 recorded 40.1 degrees Celsius, eight degrees above normal. After IMD classified this as a ‘severe’ heatwave day, Delhi hasn’t logged another heatwave day since. In April, the highest maximum recorded was 42.2 degrees Celsius on April 28, four above normal. May was even cooler, with the highest touching just 41.6 degrees Celsius. IMD data shows the mean maximum temperature for June is 37.5 degrees Celsius, two below the monthly normal of 39.5 degrees. So far, the warmest day has been 42.2 degrees Celsius on June 9. Earlier on May 19, under the influence of Cyclone Tauktae, the city recorded the highest ever single-day rainfall for the month of May. The impact of Cyclone Yaas then helped keep the mercury level from rising. Normal temperatures in May and June touch 43-44 degrees Celsius, with 45.6 degrees in 2019 being the maximum. Last year, four heatwave days were recorded in Delhi, five in 2019, three in 2018, five in 2017 and two in 2016. The highest number of heatwave days recorded in Delhi in the last decade was seven in 2014. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “In Delhi, most of the heatwaves days occur in April, May and first week of June. However, not a single heatwave hit the city from April onwards this year because of a series of western disturbances and cloudiness. Also, the maximum temperature this year has not reached the peaks of earlier years.” Srivastava added, “Delhi is now seeing pre-monsoon activities, including thunderstorms and cloudiness, and monsoon is imminent. It is, therefore, unlikely that there will be heatwave day in the second-half of June.” IMD data analysed by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) confirmed Delhi’s maximum temperature in May this year was the lowest in the last 70 years. "The summer of 2021 got rare relief from heatwaves because of over five western disturbances and cyclone Tauktae,” pointed out Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, CEEW. “Delhi recorded below normal maximum temperatures and increased wet spells, with more than 60mm of single-day rainfall during a spell. This, coupled with the string of western disturbances, hindered the rise of mercury in NCR. This will also influence the intensity and onset of the monsoon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-wave-less-for-delhi-to-worry-about-this-year/articleshow/83588562.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The court, however, asked the state to file its reply on the issue. The benchpassed the order on a writ petition moved by the AIMPLB which challenged the order of the sub-divisional magistrate of Ram Sanehi Ghat issued on April 3 ordering demolition of the mosque. The petitioner has also demanded direction for local authorities to restore the mosque and allow the management committee to reconstruct the mosque and to direct the discontinuation of the use of the area as a park. AIMPLB also sought to direct the state to pay it Rs 25 lakh for defraying expenses for reconstruction of the mosque.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-reserves-order-on-plea-for-namaz-at-disputed-site/articleshow/83560338.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Delhi||Showers cool Delhi, but it’s not monsoon||NEW DELHI: A short but intense spell of pre-monsoon rain was recorded in several parts of the capital on Wednesday. It brought down the maximum temperature to 34.2 degrees Celsius, which was five degrees below normal. While the monsoon is still a few days away, India Meteorological Department forecasts the possibility of very light rain on Thursday as well. Another spell of rain is expected on June 19 and 20. “Large scale atmospheric conditions are not favourable for further advancement of monsoon into Rajasthan, remaining parts of Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. However, there could be slow progress into some more parts of Uttar Pradesh during the next five days in association with the existing cyclonic circulation over east Uttar Pradesh in the lower levels,” said IMD’s daily monsoon bulletin. While the Met department had earlier forecast monsoon rains to reach Delhi by June 15, its progress has slowed down considerably over the last 48 hours. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, says little rain activity is currently occurring in west and east Uttar Pradesh. “For Sunday, we have a yellow alert at the moment. So far, these are pre-monsoon showers,” said Srivastava. While no rainfall was recorded at Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station, Pitampura recorded 24.5mm of rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm. Najafgarh, Pusa and Palam stations also received short but intense spells of rain, recording 0.5, 0.5 and 0.9mm of rainfall, respectively, during this period. The Met department forecasts parts of Delhi to receive a drizzle on Thursday with the maximum likely to settle around 37 degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/showers-cool-city-but-its-not-monsoon/articleshow/83588597.cms||---

A two-year-old Chow Chow, which was being flown to Mumbai on an Air-India flight for treatment on Saturday, was found dead on arrival. But a golden retriever, which was on the same flight, was fine. “Different breeds of dogs react differently. Chow Chow is a special breed that needs extreme care. Considering the dog was unwell, the airline should have been more careful and spoken to vets about his vulnerability and cancelled the reservation. The owners should also have been extra cautious and avoided air travel during summer, considering breeds like Chow Chow undergo extreme trauma and dehydration on strenuous flights,” said Subir Bhattacharya, a veterinary surgeon in Kolkata. The distraught owners of the pet, Gultu, have lodged a police complaint against the airline that had certified the dog fit for travel. The family said they were taking their pet to Mumbai for an urgent eye surgery that vets in Kolkata had refused to perform amid the pandemic. The travel plan was finalised on a short notice, which forced them to book a flight. The dog was put in the cargo on a Rs 14,000 ticket, twice the passenger fare. According to owner Pratyusha Banerjee, before the dog was handed to AI Cargo, he was jumping around. Officials had assured her of taking utmost care of her pet and that the cargo hold had oxygen supply and AC. Banerjee said the landing in Mumbai was a hard one, followed by one-and-a-half hours of confusion. On reaching the domestic cargo facility after one-and-a-half hours, she was told her dog was dead. An Air India spokesperson said the death could have been due to trauma on flight. Two dogs were in the cargo hold of Flight AI 676 that day. While one arrived fit and fine, the other died, he said. “Air India accords top priority to provide safety and comfort to pets on flights. Pets can travel with Air India only if the sender meets all the requirements of our carriage of pet policy, including providing a prescribed cage. In this case, all documentation was done and criteria was met to the satisfaction of the airline and consignor. The death was unfortunate. But oxygen was not an issue as another dog was fine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vets-flag-trauma-concerns-after-death-of-dog-during-air-travel/articleshow/83555139.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Kainchi Dham Mela cancelled for second consecutive year||NAINITAL: Covid restrictions imposed across Uttarakhand have led to the cancellation of the annual mela at Nainital’s Kainchi Dham for the second consecutive year. However, hundreds of pilgrims visited the shrine and prayed to Neem Karoli Baba from the road across the temple. Speaking to TOI, Vinod Joshi, one of the administrators of Kainchi Dham, said, “In the past 57 years, this is only the second time that the Mela has been cancelled. We took the decision after consulting all the stakeholders since it is necessary to avoid mass gathering and prevent the spread of Covid-19. However, all the rituals have been conducted as per our traditions and we hope that pilgrims get to attend the Mela next year,” Joshi said. Meanwhile, the pilgrims said that they understand the Covid situation in the country and therefore, prayed to Neem Karoli Baba from across the road. “We were hoping the temple would open when the Covid cases lessen. We will follow all the precautions and respect the administration’s decision,” one of the pilgrims, Nithesh Bisht, said. Visited by many famous people including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Kainchi Dham is one of the most revered shrines in Kumaon region.

The VBA, on it’s Twitter handle, made the announcement of Ambedkar’s participation. After the Supreme Court turned down the reservation for the Maratha community, Sambhajiraje had met several leaders and Ambedkar was one of them. Ambedkar’s presence at the protest will help the cause, claim the Maratha activists and they are eager to welcome. Meanwhile, Sambhajiraje surveyed the Shahu Samadhi Sthal premises and planned the seating arrangements keeping the social distancing rules in mind. The pandal for the activists of the Maratha community will be raised on the side. In front of it, a covered platform is being erected for the public representatives to stand and announce what they will do to get the demands fulfilled. Sambhajiraje said: “The Marathas were on streets for several years. We have been raising our voice for the community for decades and now it is the time for the MLAs and MPs to speak for the cause. Let the community know where their representatives stand — for or against. I also appeal to the Maratha workers from across the state to not throng Kolhapur. Our’s is a silent protest and not a rally or march.” No formal invitations have been extended to the MPs and MLAs. They have to participate voluntarily, said Sambhajiraje. District guardian minister Satej Patil announced that all Congress MLAs will be present at the protest. He said, “We have always supported the demands. The state government is positive and taking steps to fulfil the demands at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-ambedkar-to-take-part-in-silent-sit-in-protest-today/articleshow/83550323.cms||---

The woman alleged that the accused cop Naresh Kapadiya had kidnapped her in his car threatening police action last year and raped her. In her complaint, the woman alleged that during lockdown last year when she was going to buy milk, the accused kidnapped her in his car. He threatened her with police action as she was not wearing a mask. Instead of taking her to the police station, the accused took her on Navsari road and allegedly beat her after stripping her. The woman alleged that the cop clicked her pictures and raped her. She further claimed that Kapadiya used those photos to blackmail her. “It seems the accused cop and the woman had an affair with each other. Following the dispute, they have lodged complaints against each other,” said a police officer in Bardoli. Meanwhile, the woman and her husband were booked on a complaint filed by accused cop Naresh Kapadiya’s wife Parvati under The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The complaint was registered with Bardoli police station. Parvati alleged that the woman and her husband had come to her residence and abused her. They allegedly hurled caste-based abuses at her. Preliminary investigation revealed that Kapadiya was posted at Palsana police station and after a video of him fighting with the complainant woman went viral in January 2021, he was transferred to Umarpada police station.

---||Delhi||Pray hard or avoid Minto Road if it rains heavily this monsoon in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The public works department (PWD) may have promised a separate drainage system at central Delhi’s Minto Bridge area, perhaps the most problematic stretch in the capital during every monsoon, but no progress has been made so far. Officials say they will install more suction pumps at the site and will stop vehicular traffic on the stretch if it rains heavily to avoid any untoward incident. Every year, especially during the monsoon, the area under Minto Bridge, at the key traffic junction of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Marg and Swami Vivekananda Marg (formerly Minto Road), experiences regular waterlogging. To fix the problem permanently, PWD has decided to appoint a consultancy firm to develop an independent drainage system for the area. It will be the first time that Delhi will get a separate drainage system for a particular area. However, no headway has been made yet. The decision to build a separate drainage system was probably triggered by the drowning of a 56-year-old man in the waterlogged area last year following a heavy rain. Police had said Kundan Kumar’s van got stuck under the bridge and he couldn’t escape. Government officials said the consultancy firm would also be asked to submit a few solutions to renovate the drainage system of the area in a feasible way. Ever since the plan has been chalked out, tenders are being floated, but the talks haven’t materialised with any firm. The first two tenders had received poor responses. The third time, PWD got two potential bidders, but the process got stuck due to the Covid-19 lockdown. An official said the work would start by early July, but the new drainage system won’t be ready during this monsoon. The consultancy work will take three months, following which construction work will begin. The consultancy work will include assessing the existing drainage system and its catchment area and preparing a comprehensive plan for the independent drainage system. Currently, most of the rainwater in the area drains into the Delhi Jal Board lines via a drain measuring 2 metres in diametre. According to an official, the existing drainage system in the area around Minto Bridge comprises a deep barrel drain, which was built during the British era. Both sewage and drain water go into the same line and flow into the Yamuna. Since sewerage has increased over the years, roads begin to get waterlogged when it rains. The new project aims to create a separate pipeline for rainwater so that it drains out faster. The area under the bridge is particularly vulnerable as it is a naturally low lying area, said an official. For years, the department has been deploying pumps in the area to remove rainwater during heavy rainfalls. This is the first time PWD has been working on a permanent solution to end the heavy waterlogging every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pray-hard-or-avoid-minto-road-if-it-rains-heavily-this-monsoon/articleshow/83588681.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

While the district administration on Tuesday held a meeting with authorities from Aurangabad circle of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) among others, no formal announcement was made till late evening. Jaswant Singh, founder president of Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation (ATDF), said that the tourism industry has sought help of public representatives, including Shiv Sena MLC Ambadas Danve, to reach out to the state government to press for the demand of reopening. “We are hopeful that all monuments located in and around Aurangabad reopens soon. The district administration has been requested to take a positive stand on our demand,” he said. Earlier, in its communication dated June 14, ASI has allowed reopening of all monuments from Wednesday. Such opening, however, shall be in strict compliance with the state or district level disaster management authority. District collector Sunil Chavan could not be reached for his comments. Earlier, he had told TOI that monuments located only within municipal limits of Aurangabad would be permitted for reopening if ASI makes a formal request. The district administration was non-committal about opening of monuments located within rural areas of Aurangabad, including Ajanta and Ellora caves as these area still come under ‘Level III’ as per the latest order under Break The Chain and still face certain Covid related curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tourism-industry-hopeful-of-reopening-ajanta-and-ellora/articleshow/83550387.cms||---

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Rats lead to seizure of liquor parcelled from Karnataka||KOCHI: The excise sleuths in Ernakulam seized around three bottles of Karnataka-made liquor that were parcelled to a Kochi native via India Post’s speed post service on Tuesday, thanks to rats. Along with the pint bottles of whiskey, the sender kept a packet of mixture as ‘touchings’ within the parcelled box for the recipient and this attracted rats. The post office officials, who noticed the large hole made by the rats to get access to the mixture, found the bottles and alerted the excise. The excise officers launched a probe based on the address of the sender and the recipient written on the parcel. T A Ashok Kumar, deputy excise commissioner, Ernakulam, said that it was the ‘sender’s generosity’ to keep a mixture packet in the parcel that led to the seizure. “Otherwise the parcelled liquor would have been safely delivered to the recipient. Using courier services to smuggle narcotic products is a common practice but the speedpost smuggling attempt has surprised all and it raises suspicion of people using it as a medium to smuggle in liquor during the lockdown,” he said. “If the rats had not made a hole in the packet, the post office official would not have been suspicious. The addresses and phone numbers of the sender as well the recipient are clearly written on the board making it easy to investigate. However, we are yet to confirm the addresses and the phone numbers. The culprits will be nabbed only after that,” said K R Ramprasad, assistant excise inspector, who made the seizure. A case has been registered under Section 58 of the Abkari Act and the offence entails a punishment of prison life up to 10 years. The liquor made in other states is not allowed to be sold or consumed in Kerala. Though the officials suspect the parcel to be a transaction between two friends, it is yet to be found whether it has any commercial interests. Preventive officer Jayalal and civil excise officers Fredy Fernandez, Ranjith, and Vimal were also part of the team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rats-lead-to-seizure-of-liquor-parcelled-from-karnataka/articleshow/83555136.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

A meeting to be convened by PWD minister P A Mohammed Riyas and Kochi mayor Anil Kumar is expected to decide on how the road works in the city can be carried out after clearing all the hurdles. Kochi corporation authorities will be preparing a detailed report on the roads to be constructed or renovated, the main obstacles for implementing the projects, etc. Mayor Anil Kumar will be convening a special meeting of the corporation officials prior to the meeting convened by the minister to be held on Thursday. “It will be after the meeting with the minister that a clear idea on whichever roads can be included in the fast-track project would be available,” Kumar said. The state government has already announced in the 2021-22 budget that it would undertake work on some of the roads in Kochi. Kochi corporation authorities had requested the state to support the measures to enhance the infrastructure in Kochi. Following our requests, the government has included some of the road projects in the city in the budget. One of the major road projects proposed is an elevated road parallel to Pandit Karuppan Road in Thevara. Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has already been entrusted with the preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) of the elevated road. Another major work which has been undertaken by the state government is Goshree-Mamangalam Road. The Roads and Bridges Construction Corporation of Kerala (RBDCK) has undertaken the preparation of the DPR of the road project. All the cost of Goshree-Mamangalam Road, including the cost for the preliminary works and preparation of DPR, will be borne by the state government. The Goshree-Mamangalam Road has been designed as a four-lane road. The work on the project, which had been announced a few years ago, couldn’t be started due to disputes over land acquisition. The fund for land acquisition for widening the road will be borne by the state government. Widening of Thammanam-Pullepady Road has also been undertaken by PWD. The widening of K P Vallon Road and the work on the Madhura Company-Kannangatt bridge also will be undertaken by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-to-fast-track-pending-road-works-in-city/articleshow/83555198.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The jetty will come up near the Silver Line station at Inforpark as an integrated hub. Presently, Water Metro has completed terminal at Vyttila and Kakkanad (Chittethukara) and is getting ready for operation. With higher speed boats, it will take only 20 minutes to reach Kakkanad from Vyttila Mobility Hub, stated the release. Vyttila is the first transport hub in India where Metro rail, Water Metro and bus terminals meet. This will be connected to the Silver Line Kakkanad station where Metro would also meet, which will make it the first hub where rail, Water Metro and Metro meets. Water Metro will form the easiest connection to Vyttila without any traffic congestion. From the Infopark Silverline, it will take only 10 minutes to reach Nedumbassery airport, stated the release. Water Metro got its environmental clearance in October 2019, which was obtained in a record time for any such project of wide spread in India after a full season study. The project is spread across 38 terminals in 10 different islands over 76 route kilometres. KMRL had started the construction of Water Metro terminals immediately after obtaining the environmental clearance as tenders were kept ready to be awarded. The initial terminals were poised to be completed in 15 months at Vyttila and Kakkanad. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the country and the nation went to a prolonged lockdown when the work was picking up in the initial months. Despite the prolonged lockdown and restrictions, the terminals were completed and got ready for operation. As many as 16 terminals, including the major terminal at High Court, have now resumed construction as the restrictions are eased. The construction of 100-pax boats is progressing at Cochin Shipyard. The batteryoperated boats are first-of-its kind in the world. The boats are extremely efficient and design was model tested in MARIN Netherlands, before the pandemic started. Propulsion system is by Siemens, which uses the most advanced LTO Batteries. These batteries can be charged in less than 15 minutes. Despite severe logistics issues and highly-challenging innovative design, Cochin Shipyard has completed the first boat and is undergoing various tests for final certification. The second lockdown stuck when the boat was about to start its trials. With contractors returning, the shipyard swung back to full action. The design has created a lot of interest in European countries, stated the release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/water-metro-to-be-extended-till-infopark/articleshow/83555165.cms||---

Radha Mule, an engineering student, said that the unlock process taking place since June 7 has made youth and other working population vulnerable to Covid infection. “I personally witnessed some vaccination sites where health staffers were waiting for beneficiaries to come to open the injection vial. In such a scenario, there is no harm in vaccination citizens above 18 years of age,” she said. Sagar Gaikwad, a 30-year-old rickshaw driver said that he was keen to take the vaccine but was forced to wait. “Being a part of public service, we are equally exposed to the risk of Covid-19. I could not enrol for vaccine earlier when the doses were given for 18-44 age group for a brief period,” he said. When contacted, Dr Smita Nalgirkar, immunization officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said that it was a policy decision from the government to halt the vaccination for 18-44 age group. “We cannot take any call on expanding vaccination drive at our level. The state level authorities have been keeping a constant watch on the immunization programme against Covid-19 and come out with further announcement, if any,” she said. Aurangabad city reported 1,658 vaccinations on Tuesday, taking total number of doses offered to 3,32,203. It includes 24,709 citizens between 18-44 age group who have taken the first dose and another 1,122 from the same age bracket who have been administered with the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-citizens-demand-vaccination-for-18-44-age-group/articleshow/83550430.cms||---

The agitation will take place on the Raosaheb Thorat Hall grounds and will be led by Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, said Karan Gaykar, the state coordinator of the Maratha Kranti Morcha, at a press conference. He said all people’s representatives would be called for the silent protest to check if they support the reservations for the Maratha community. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal, state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, and all the MPs and MLAs would be invited. People participating in the agitation would wear black clothes and sport black bands on their forearms. They will also wear black masks. While it will be a silent protest, only the people’s representatives would be given an opportunity to speak. The people’s representatives who do not attend the protests would be considered unsupportive of the Maratha reservations, said Gaykar, adding that the next agitation would be in front of the houses of such people’s representatives. Agitations against suspension of political reservations of OBCs The Akhil Bharatiya Samata Parishad and other OBC organisations have decided to stage agitations to protest against the suspension of political reservations of the OBCs in Maharashtra and other issues. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the executive committee members of the Akhil Bharatiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad in Nashik. The meeting took place at the Bhujbal Farm in the presence of regional president Balasaheb Kardak, district president Dileep Khaire and other senior members. As per the recent decision of the Supreme Court, on a petition against reservations to OBCs in local self-government bodies in five districts of Maharashtra, a large number of political reservations for the OBCs would be reduced in the municipal corporations, municipal councils, town councils, zilla parishads, etc. Balasaheb Kardak said while there will be no effect on reservations in government jobs or education, the cancellation of political reservations would be a huge blow to OBCs. They have decided to stage agitations for 15 days across Nashik district from June 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/silent-maratha-quota-protest-in-nashik-planned-on-monday/articleshow/83550424.cms||---

Lions Club of Rander Adajan offered help of Rs 5,000 to each family who lost any of the parents of a child while Rs 10,000 was given to all those children who lost both parents. “The financial aid was distributed with support of Lions Club of Coppel, Texas in the US. By doing this we just want to send a message that we should not be defeated and continue to move ahead by supporting each other,” said Rajesh Nakrani, a leader of Saurashtra Patel Seva Samaj. Mahesh Savani, a businessman, has been helping fatherless children by paying their school fees for the past few years. He has paid fees of 9,200 children in 274 schools till now. “I have been paying needy students’ fees even before the pandemic struck. I will continue the service in schools that I am part of and also support other students as well,” said Savani. Vilas Patil, a textile businessman, will pay school fees of 37 students. “Due to the sudden death of parents these children are in need of support to complete education. I have found 21 such children and am searching for others,” said Patil. “The private trust-run schools will adopt all those students who lost both parents,” said Savji Hoon, president of Swanirbhar Shala Sanchalak Mandal, Surat. They are not required to pay any school fees. If a student loses his father, he will not have to pay fees for a year, Hoon added. Other school promoters like Mahesh Patel of Vidhyakunj School in Rander and Sanjay Dungrani of Brilliant Vidhyalay in Dabholi too have offered free education to students who lost parents in the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/helping-hands-reach-covid-battered-students/articleshow/83553062.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Eamcet, ECET may be postponed||HYDERABAD: The government is likely to defer common entrance tests (CETs), including the Eamcet in the wake of delays in conducting final-year degree examinations and releasing intermediate results due to the second wave of the pandemic. Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) has already deferred postgraduate engineering common entrance test (PGECET) which was scheduled to take place from June 19 to 22, owing to the state lockdown. Authorities said plans are afoot to defer other CETs too. “We have decided to postpone ECET (engineering common entrance test) and Eamcet too which are scheduled for the first half of July. We are set to put forward a proposal to the education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy who will take a final decision on the same,” said Papi Reddy, chairman, TSCHE. While the ECET is scheduled for July 1, Eamcet is currently scheduled for July 7, 8 and 9. “If the government decides to defer CETs, we will have to seek fresh slots from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to conduct the examinations. In addition to this, we will also have to ensure that the revised dates don’t clash with other entrance exams,” said Reddy. The fate of integrated common entrance test for MBA/MCA admissions scheduled for August 19 and 20, law common entrance test and PG law common entrance test on August 23 and education common entrance test on August 24 and 25 depends on completion of undergraduate degree courses. TSCHE will not be able to hold these examinations before final semester exams are conducted. “We are prioritising conduct of the final year degree exams without jeopardising the health of students. We have to wait and watch as to how the situation progresses over the next few weeks. The CET exams for PG courses may be deferred if there is further delay in conducting the degree final year exams,” said Navin Mittal, commissioner of collegiate and technical education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eamcet-ecet-may-be-postponed/articleshow/83555203.cms||Preeti Biswas

Following flash floods during the pre-monsoon showers, the engineering and health team of the city corporation worked together to scoop up over 500 loads of waste and silt from the canal from Bakery Junction to Vanchiyur. So far, the flow of water along the canal has been smooth. The health wing also found takers for the silt filled dirt collected from the canal. The corporation had invited tenders to remove the mounds of dirt piled up at Putharikandam ground and received 10 tenders. While seven of them demanded money from the corporation to transport the waste, three of them agreed to pay the corporation for the silt and dirt. The corporation eventually awarded the tender to a person who agreed to pay Rs 1 lakh for the dirt mound. “We had around 60 loads of waste piled up at the ground. We decided to go for tender to avoid any unnecessary controversy. To our surprise, we found a guy willing to pay Rs 1 lakh for the silt, probably looking at the presence of sand,” a health official said. Interestingly in 2016, when the former KSUDP team took up cleaning of canal, they had to confront the tedious job of properly disposing enormous quantity of waste collected from the canal. The engineering wing had teamed up with the railway engineering wing to clean the canal at Thampanoor. “We gave our full technical support and cleared the grates which had blocked the flow of water. Around 87 loads of silt was removed from the area through which canal runs across the railway station,” an official said. Familiar scenes of flooding had returned to Thampanoor as the area, including the railway station, was marooned in the night showers in the second week of May. The city corporation had in April launched a pre-monsoon cleaning drive. The campaign inaugurated by mayor Arya Rajendran began with removal of waste from Amayizhanjan canal. The corporation planned to remove waste piles accumulated in the city and to clean canals and storm water drains during the pre-monsoon cleaning drive. It was following the flash flood that also affected the shops at Chalai, the corporation decided to launch an extensive cleaning mission ahead of the monsoon. Corporation officials had reported that the cleaning of the canal was completed in May. However, desilting works were pending and there was a dispute between the corporation and irrigation over desilting. Besides, former minister Kadakampally Surendran also said that the railways had blocked the flow of the canal under the railway lines which worsened the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/500-loads-of-waste-cleared-from-amayizhanjan-canal/articleshow/83555216.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The whistle-blower in the case, Raju Shah, as well as the SIT raised an objection to run the plea before Thane court judge Rajesh Kakani. Shah’s lawyer Shekar Jagtap argued that the prevention of corruption sections have been removed from the case and the matter is being probed by the Thane crime branch. Jagtap argued that Kakani’s ACB court does not have administrative powers to hear the bail application of a regular matter. The court dismissed this plea.

According to sources, the board has already started the process of preparing the results expecting that it would receive a positive response from the government to its report on pre-determined criteria for declaring results. On Monday, the state government released orders cancelling intermediate second-year public examinations and directed the TSBIE to prepare and submit pre-determined objective criteria for declaration of intermediate second-year results after due consultations, for approval of the government. The board secretary Syed Omer Jaleel submitted his report on Tuesday for the state’s approval. While intermediate first-year marks will be taken as primary criteria to award class 12 marks, various other criteria have also been submitted to the state for awarding marks to students of different streams. For example, the board recommended the state to award cent per cent marks in practical examinations to all science stream students. Likewise, a number of other criteria were suggested to award marks for students of commerce and art streams, and for students of vocational courses, bridge courses, among others. Sources said that the board is making all arrangements to release results within a week after receiving the government’s approval. On June 9, the state government had announced the cancellation of the intermediate second-year exams by considering the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy had announced that a committee would be constituted to finalise the modalities for results. The secretary was also instructed to issue orders for promoting all inter first-year students to the second year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inter-2nd-yr-results-in-a-week-after-govt-nod/articleshow/83555211.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Another group from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is due to arrive on Wednesday. Khwaja Hussain of the AIKMS and Kirti Kisan Union vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala said the central government was under the impression that paddy transplantation season will dwindle the numbers at the protest sites. They accused the Centre of telling the state governments to block the farmers’ electricity subsidy. That’s like implementing the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 through backdoor, as it serves the interests of the corporate houses. They say the longer this movement goes, the more it will expose the "corporate controlled government policies and build a mass consciousness against capitalism".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/telangana-farmers-reach-delhi-border/articleshow/83557774.cms||---

The looters took away goods, including electronic gadgets, clothes, indoor and outdoor sports gear and toys, totally worth over Rs 70 lakh. The police later managed to recover 40% of the stolen goods. The container was heading from Bengaluru to Aurangabad when the driver lost control due to the slippery road condition after the rains at one of the turns near Terkheda village on the Solapur-Dhule national highway. Police had to deploy drone cameras and a force of 80 personnel to carry out the search and recovery of the goods at a nearby hamlet, Laxmipardhi Pidhi. The injured driver and cleaner managed to go to a nearby hospital after the container turned turtle, upon which the hamlet residents began stealing the goods. People travelling in several cars and heavy vehicles passing along the highway also joined in the looting spree. Osmanabad superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan told TOI, “The hamlet has a considerable population and several cases of dacoity have been filed against the residents there in the past.” The police had a tough time recovering the goods from the villagers. They took the sarpanch and a couple of villagers into confidence before deploying personnel in a police jeep to make an appeal for returning the goods. Deputy superintendent of police Motichand Rathod, who headed the recovery operation at the hamlet, said 40% of the goods have been recovered so far. “We have registered a case of theft at the Yermala police station. Four people have been named as accused. Those who do not return the goods voluntarily will face action,” he added. Personnel from five police stations and the crime branch were engaged in the recovery operation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/donetruck-turns-turtle-people-steal-e-commerce-goods-worth-rs-70l/articleshow/83550578.cms||Mohammed Akhef

If things go according to plan, the construction work will start in the next few months. To begin with, the hospital will be started with 120 bed capacity, before it is expanded further. The Takht Sachkhand Sri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib Gurdwara Board in Nanded passed the resolution. Board’s chairman Bhupinder Singh Minhas told TOI, “We have a budget of Rs 150 crore for setting up medical college and hospital at Nanded. We have ample land available, so the cost of land will be zero. A major portion of the budget will go into getting best of the medical equipments.” He said that apart from providing all the possible medical facilities and services, a separate guest house will be constructed for stay of medical experts from different parts of the country as well as world. They would hold regular camps for periods ranging from five to eight days. An entire floor will be dedicated to super speciality pediatric care. To ensure that the work is carried out within stipulated time, a 13-member committee headed by Padma Shri Vikramjit Singh Sahney has been formed. The other members include cricketer Harbhajan Singh and singer Mika Singh. Board has decided to name the super-speciality hospital after Guru Gobind Singhji Maharaj, the 10th Sikh Guru. It was decided to set up the project in Nanded, and not in Hyderabad or Aurangabad, as it is a strategic location bordering Telangana and Karnataka. It also has good railway, road and air connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gurdwara-board-okays-hosp-medical-college-at-nanded/articleshow/83550555.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Both the accused and the victim were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. According to police, Shaik Fareed, a DCM van driver and Syed Mahbub, an auto driver from Prem Nagar in Miyapur, were close friends. They used to meet frequently and consume liquor. On Monday night, Fareed returned from work and met Mahbub at Prem Nagar. “Under the influence of liquor, Fareed and Mahbub had an argument over a petty issue when they were at street number IX of Prem Nagar.

---||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray’s list of 12 for council with governor: RTI activist||MUMBAI: RTI activist Anil Galgali on Tuesday claimed that the list submitted by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to Raj Bhavan for nomination of members to the legislative council is with governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “During the hearing of an appeal filed by me, I have been informed that the list of 12 eminent persons is with the governor himself and that the information will be available only after the governor takes the decision,” Galgali said after his appeal was heard by the Raj Bhavan deputy secretary. A Raj Bhavan official declined to comment on the on-going proceedings as well as on the list submitted by the CM in November 2020, saying the entire case is sub judice. “We have no comments to offer, since the Bombay high court is seized of the case. It will be wrong to comment on the sub judice matter,” he said. On April 22, Galgali had filed an application under the RTI. Galgali had sought the list of persons recommended by the state cabinet on November 6, 2020, and the present status of the case. At the time Galgali was informed that the list of the 12 persons was not available in the public administration office of Raj Bhavan. Galgali had challenged the letter before the appellate authority, which was heard on Tuesday. Galgali claimed that he was informed the list is with the governor. State Congress president Nana Patole had strongly criticised the governor, saying it was wrong on the part of the governor to delay the decision. “We are surprised and shocked over the manner in which the governor was tackling the proposal. It was expected that Koshyari will take the decision in a reasonable time. For obvious political reasons, he is not taking the decision,” Patole said a week ago. A delegation comprising chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had brought to the notice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Koshyari was deliberately not taking the decision. Following the meeting, MVA leaders were expecting that Koshyari will take a decision, but so far there is no response. “We feel that Modi did not act on our plea,” an NCP minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-uddhavs-list-of-12-for-council-with-guv-rti-activist/articleshow/83559694.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||Land auction in Greater Hyderabad: Upset price at Rs 25 crore/acre for phase 1||HYDERABAD: The state government has fixed Rs 25 crore per acre as upset price (minimum price to be quoted) for the first phase of land auctions in Kokapet and Khanamet in Greater Hyderabad. While the upset price for the total 65 acres comes to Rs 1,625 crore, the government is hoping to net about Rs 3,000 crore in the e-auctions to be held on July 15. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) have issued a notification for sale of 13 land parcels in Neopolis and Golden Mile projects in Kokapet and Khanamet. MSTC Ltd, a GoI agency, will help the state government in conducting the e-auctions. While the registrations began on June 15, a pre-bid meeting is being planned on June 25. Among the plots that are being slotted for auction, the smallest one is a one-acre plot in Neopolis, while the biggest one is 8.94 acres that is also located in Neopolis. .  The government said prospective bidders will have to quote Rs 20 lakh minimum (increasing on the base price) over the upset price. Officials said this will help in discouraging non-serious bidders. Similarly, the EMD has been fixed at Rs 5 crore and the registration fee is Rs 23,600 and Rs 11,800 respectively by TSIIC and HMDA bid participants. Since the bidding amount is huge, the government has decided to provide instalment facility for successful bidders. The notification said the bidders will have to pay 33 per cent of the total bidding amount within seven days as first instalment, another 33 per cent of the amount, second instalment within 60 days and final and balance amount before October 25. “If the bidders fail to pay instalments of their bid amount, their EMD amount and instalments will be forfeited and the plot will be auctioned in the next phases,” a senior HMDA official said. The Rangareddy district collector has been directed by the government to issue an NOC for the successful bidders to get loans from banks with a condition that they forward the registered sale deed directly to the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/land-auction-upset-price-at-rs-25-cr/acre-for-phase-1/articleshow/83555245.cms||Koride Mahesh

I followed all the procedures, paid the fees and passed the test. After a while, I received the learner’s licence. To my utter shock, I found a photograph of a young woman printed against my name,” Chede, an interior designing student, told TOI. He added that once he got the licence at noon, he headed straight to the regional transport office (RTO). “I couldn’t find anyone there since it was lunch time. After waiting for an hour, I approached an official who said it might have happened due to a technical glitch and it would be corrected. I requested the official to address the issue without any delay. I clearly remember filling in all details, including my Aadhaar number, correctly. If I had not done so, I would not have received the test link and the OTP on the phone,” he added. An RTO official said that the matter was being looked into. “We are investigating the matter and trying to find out what went wrong. It is possible that the applicant might have entered his details wrongly, but it is too premature to say anything.

---||Nagpur||Another staff strike hits garbage collection in half of Nagpur city||NAGPUR: Door-to-door garbage collection was affected in half of the city yet again on Monday after around 850 BVG India sanitary workers stopped work over lack of facilities. The affected areas include those under Gandhibagh, Satranjipura, Lakadganj, Ashi Nagar and Mangalwari zones. Though officials from Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s solid waste management (SWM) department claimed that the work of lifting garbage remained affected only till noon, residents and elected representatives said that door-to-door waste collection was not at all done. This was the fourth time the BVG employees resorted to strike in this calendar year. Similar is the situation with AG Environ. Since NMC replaced Kanak Resources Management Limited with two new agencies — AG Environ and BVG India — garbage collection in the city has been marred with frequent strikes by employees. This time, the strike was called after employees were denied casual leave by BVG India. Health officer (SWM) Dr Pradip Dasarwar was not available for comments. A senior official from NMC’s SWM department said they will verify BVG India employees’ claim. “The firm has been directed to resolve the issue at the earliest and resume services without any delay, else NMC will initiate disciplinary action against them,” the official said. Sources, however, said that earlier both the companies, especially BVG India, had appointed excess staff due to political pressure. Later, unable to meet its establishment expenditure, it had sacked many employees. Now, it is understaffed. Despite being entitled to 10 casual leaves per year, the firm deducts salary of employees even if they take one-day leave, miffed employees alleged. Employees claimed that both AG Environ and BVG India are bending rules as per their convenience. Despite bringing this to NMC’s notice, no action is being taken against the firms, the employees said. A senior official from the state labour commissionerate told TOI that casual leave is one of the basic rights of the employees working in any registered firm. The official, however, said the commissionerate has not received any formal complaint. “If we receive any complaint, we will definitely initiate action,” the official said. Senior corporator Manoj Sangole expressed concern over frequent strikes by the garbage lifting companies. “Since 2019, strikes by the garbage firms’ employees have increased, raising hygiene issues in the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-staff-strike-hits-garbage-collection-in-half-of-city/articleshow/83521347.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

According to Balanagar ACP K Purushotham, the incident happened at Dawood Basthi in Jagadgirigutta on Monday night when a worker, Sri Hari alias Mohammed Usman, attacked the victim Mohammed Jaweed, 30, a welder, with a knife. The trigger for the attack was a minor road accident in Dawood Basthi caused by Mohammed Jaweed’s nephew on Monday afternoon. “A four-year-old girl from Dawood Basthi suffered minor injury in a bike accident. After an argument between the family of Jaweed and his sister with locals, the girl was shifted to a local hospital by Sri Hari along with others,” the ACP said. After first-aid to the girl, Sri Hari along with others reached the neighbourhood and picked up an argument with the bike rider’s mother, who is Jaweed’s sister. “Sri Hari abused Jaweed’s sister using filthy language. Jaweed came to know about the incident and, after closing his shop, returned to Dawood Basthi and had an argument with Sri Hari. The latter stabbed him with a knife multiple times. Jaweed was declared brought dead at a local hospital,” the ACP said.

Two of these men were arrested from Noida in Uttar Pradesh and Gurugram in Haryana. The third is a jeweller from Mumbai, who had bought the stolen valuables from the other suspects, police said.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Private schools flush with funds, says govt in SC over fee issue||NEW DELHI: Arguing that schools had surplus funds ranging from Rs 1 crore to Rs 48 crore, Delhi government’s special leave petition in the Supreme Court challenged Delhi High Court’s order allowing schools to charge annual and development fees. After the closure caused by Covid-19 last year, all schools had been directed to collect tuition fees only, not the annual and development fees. This had been challenged in court by Action Committee, an association of private schools, and the high court had lifted the restrictions on the annual charges on May 31. In an affidavit submitted as part of the SLP, Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, headed the list of 35 schools with surplus funds with Rs 48 crore. This figure was determined after evaluation of the fee hike proposal applicable for session 2020-21 and projections for 2021-22. Four other branches of the same school are also on the list with funds ranging from Rs 11 crore to Rs 34 crore. Among the schools with surplus funds of over Rs 10 crore were mentioned Air Force Bal Bharti, Birla Vidya Niketan, two branches of Bal Bharti School, Mother Mary School, Mayur Vihar, St Mary’s Senior Secondary School and Arwachin Bharti Bhawan Senior Secondary School. The rest of the institutions on the list had funds Rs 1-9 crore. DPS Society chairman V K Shunglu did not respond to calls and messages for a reaction to Delhi government’s SLP. Similarly, the principal of Birla Vidya Niketan and the management committee member of Bal Bharti Pitampura refused to comment. The principal of Air Force Bal Bharti pleaded, “I will have to see the document before I can comment on it.” There were no responses either from the other listed schools that TOI contacted on email and phone. The government cited figures to show that in most schools, less than 60% of the tuition fees collected was used to pay salaries. The SLP said, “It is pertinent to point out that the fees proposal of the petitioner schools have been examined by the appellant before this hon’ble court and found that most of the schools had sufficient surpluses, and accordingly their fees enhancement proposals had been rejected. Only in some cases were this found necessary and so allowed.” Delhi government also argued that the judgment in the Indian School, Jodhpur vs State of Rajasthan case as being the basis for educational institutions being allowed to charge annual and development fees couldn’t be applied to Delhi. It pointed out that the powers of the Directorate of Education to regulate fees had been affirmed by the Supreme Court twice and twice also by division benches of Delhi High Court. Further, the government stated that tuition fees were meant to cover the standard establishment costs, including salary, provisions for DA, bonus, etc., and other terminal benefits concerning curricular activities. However, the annual charges were levied to cover all the regular expenditures that were not included in the tuition fees and for overheads and expenses related to sports equipment, cultural and co-curricular activities distinct from other school activities. All such activities were not happening due to the pandemic, the government said. “It is further pertinent to point out here that the learned Single Judge has failed to examine that in most of the cases the expenditure on salary and establishment is 40-50% of the total fees charged by the school,” the SLP said. “However, in some cases it is 70%, which means every school has sufficient funds after charging tuition fees to meet its expenses. Further, the development fees aren’t adequately utilised in the lockdown scenario. Secondly, all the capital expenditure, except furniture and fixtures, is to be maintained by the society running the schools and is not to be maintained from the tuition fees charged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pvt-schools-flush-with-funds-says-govt-in-sc-over-fee-issue/articleshow/83555305.cms||Shradha Chettri

In the latest development at the rehabilitation and resettlement site, a family from Nagla Ganeshi has applied for electricity connection for their permanent stay.Officials said that the family of Kishan Singh has already got their house constructed. “For construction activity, the electricity and water are being provided at the site. However, no domestic connection has been offered so far,” said additional district magistrate (land acquisition), Balram Singh.He added, “Many other villagers have also got the ground floor of their houses constructed. We want more and more families to shift to the newly developed township. Once people start staying, other villagers will also be motivated to shift.”The area in Jewar Bangar is being developed to house over 3,000 families from the six villages of the Jewar sub-division of GB Nagar district.As the water supply line for households is still being developed, most of the villagers are getting water lifting pumps installed in their houses. Officials from Pashimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) have set up a camp in the vicinity to expedite the process of power connections.A senior officer from the Jewar sub-divisional office of the power department said, “As of now, we are going to offer temporary connections to the villagers. A meter will be installed and it will be regularised later on. No extra charges will have to be paid to turn the temporary connection into a permanent one,” said the officer.The temporary connection is being offered at the construction sites and applicants have to pay Rs 4,000 as security fees. As the township is in the development stage, the domestic connection will be offered once the transmission network is established across all seven pockets within the township.Officials from Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) said that a water supply network is also being laid down and connections to all the plots will be offered next month, once the overhead tank for the colony gets functional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/at-airport-rehab-township-a-rising-demand-for-power-connections/articleshow/83559404.cms||Shalabh
---||Goa||ISL likely in Goa again; Qatar, UAE foreign options||Panaji: Organisers of the Indian Super League (ISL) have told participating clubs to prepare for another edition of the league inside a bio-secure bubble, almost certainly in Goa. FSDL, the body that organises the league, had an online meeting with CEOs of all clubs on Wednesday where plans for next season were outlined. Goa, Bengal and Kerala have been shortlisted as the three states that can host the ISL. But given that Goa successfully hosted the last edition inside a bio-secure bubble, it’s unlikely that the organisers will look beyond this state. “The last season in Goa was a successful one, so it does not make sense to look anywhere else,” a source who has been tracking the development told TOI on Wednesday. “The three competition venues are good, there were no complaints about the training venues and there are enough starred hotels.” This time, though, the organisers won’t shortlist training grounds and hotels. Instead, clubs have been told to choose on their own and agree terms with the local authorities. According to sources, three teams – Mumbai City FC, ATK Mohun Bagan and NorthEast United FC – will play their home games at the Nehru Stadium at Fatorda, while FC Goa, Hyderabad FC, Jamshedpur FC and Bengaluru FC will be based at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim. The last-four ranked teams will move to the Tilak Maidan in Vasco. If the league is moved out of Goa, it will be held abroad. “There are concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic. Nobody really has any idea about the third wave or how badly India will be hit later this year. If things go out of hand, the league will be held either in Qatar or UAE,” said the source. The ISL will kick off mid-November and culminate in March with a break for international football in late January as India are drawn to play the opening game of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers. All 11 clubs, including SC East Bengal, attended the meeting. According to sources, SC East Bengal were not scheduled to attend the meeting but were summoned by the organisers and told to get their house in order. “If SC East Bengal don’t sort out the problems (with the club) at the earliest, ISL will go ahead with 10 teams,” said the source. The club and investors, Shree Cement, have been looking in opposite directions over the signing of the final agreement that would permanently transfer the sporting rights of the club to Shree Cement East Bengal Foundation, the entity which has a 76 percent stake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-likely-in-goa-again-qatar-uae-foreign-options/articleshow/83586234.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Chandigarh||Farmers block highway over power disruption||Patiala: Farmers on Tuesday blocked the Patiala-Chandigarh highway near Daun Kalan village of Patiala against the PSPCL for its failure to resume power supply in agriculture sector after the supply was hit due to damage during a recent storm. The villagers of Daun Kalan said they had made efforts and erected around 80% of damaged electricity poles themselves, but the power supply was not resumed at the agriculture pumpset (AP), following which they staged a protest for around two hours. Villagers claimed that the paddy sown has been affected as farmers could not irrigate their fields due to shortage of power supply. Protesting farmers under BKU (Ekta Ugraha) claimed that many villagers had to use alternative ways to get electricity supply, but the costlier diesel had increased the input cost of irrigating fields. “The government has failed to ensure eight-hour power supply to farmers during paddy season. Electricity has not been available for a week,” said Randhir Singh, a protester. BKU (Ekta Ugraha) Patiala president Manjit Singh Nyal said they had filed complaints too, but no action had been taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-block-highway-over-power-disruption/articleshow/83557807.cms||---

The IMD had issued an orange alert for the district — predicting heavy rainfall from Sunday till Tuesday. However, the sustained showers lashed the district only on Tuesday. District disaster management officials said the district had received around 5.2mm rainfall till Tuesday noon. The southwest monsoon has covered all the parts of the district and the ghat areas are witnessing good rainfall. Station-wise rainfall recorded in the district was Gagan Bawda (40.9mm), Gadhinglaj (21.3mm), Chandgad (10.6mm), Ajara (6.1mm), Shahuwadi (5.1mm), Bhudargad (1.6mm), Radhanagari (1.4mm), Shirol (1.1mm), Karveer (0.7mm), Hatkanangle (0.5mm), Panhala (0.5mm) and Kagal (0.3mm). The figures suggest that Gagan Bawda, the gateway to Konkan, received the highest rainfall in the district. Kagal, Hatkanangle and Panhala received the least on Tuesday. There has also been an increase in the dam water storage across the district following three days of rain in the catchment areas. The Radhanagari dam has filled up to 24%, Tulsi (49%), Warna (39%), Patgaon (40%) and Dudhganga dam (30%) of capacity. Meanwhile, the Panchaganga river water level has also increased to 12.7 feet, as noted at the Rajaram weir in Kasba Bawda, on Tuesday. Waterlogging was reported at several low-lying places in the city like Parekh Bridge, Devkar Panand and Shahaji Vasahat area due to drainage blockage, which was cleared after some time by the KMC workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/after-2-days-of-drizzle-rain-lashes-kolhapur-on-tuesday/articleshow/83550588.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Avenues for this noble pursuit are plentiful, but who would have thought that the 20-year-old would choose to get behind the wheel of an ambulance and ferry bodies of Covid victims to the crematorium. A first year science undergraduate at Vivekanand College here, Priya has been transporting bodies in a 9am-9pm shift from the government-run CPR Hospital and other private hospitals to the Panchaganga crematorium. Not just that, she helps place the bodies in the ambulance and also assists the Kolhapur municipal corporation staff in preparing the funeral bed at the crematorium. Priya, from the Jadhavwadi area of the city, says her parents supported her in this endeavour. Her father works in an industrial unit in Shiroli while her mother is an insurance agent. “I have been doing this work for the past 15 days and have so far ferried around 65 bodies from the hospitals to the crematorium. I had learnt to drive a car and decided to give to society as I had free time after my lectures got over. The ambulance has been donated for Covid service to CPR Hospital by social activist Harshal Surve and garment shop owner Prashant Pophale,” she says. Asked how the experience was initially, Priya says, “When I first donned the PPE kit to drive the ambulance, I was very nervous but somehow managed to keep calm. Now, however, it is a routine job,” she ffurther said I have great support from everyone at the hospitals, the crematorium and volunteers from Bhawani Foundation, to which Surve belongs. The support encourages me to continue with my work.” A volunteer from the foundation was full of praise for Priya. “When women are usually kept away from crematoriums, Priya handles her task with ease. Her work is quite unusual during the pandemic, when even relatives do not go near the bodies of Covid victims,” he said.

The authority will take the help of experts for site evaluation, designing of buildings and infrastructure projects, structural audit and for putting up signage, lights at crossings, and intersections, as well as for landscaping and maintaining the overall character of the place.Chief executive officer, GNIDA, Narendra Bhooshan, said the firms are being shortlisted so that they can be empanelled. “Once we are able to select the companies after evaluating their background and expertise, we will be able to appoint them directly for designing our own projects. Apart from flyovers, underpasses and new industrial blocks, we also have to provide common amenities to residents,” he said.Having a staff strength of less than 275, GNIDA has outsourced several operations to contractual workers and vendors. Officials said the planning division is acutely short-staffed, with five officials available for architecture and urban designing work.Apart from 200 residential projects, the authority has more than 54,000 allottees who have bought plots for building houses, industries, commercial establishments and other institutional establishments. Several people have also taken plots under the Kisan Abadi Scheme. “The existing planning team is overburdened because, apart from fresh applications, it also has to scrutinise building plans of existing allottees who want to expand their units,” said a senior official. “They do not get time to work on projects being undertaken by the authority and we have to hire consultants for that,” he added.The authority is also planning to make provisions to set up an educational institution and hospitals in its area, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gnida-to-select-architects-for-its-own-projects/articleshow/83559410.cms||Shalabh
---||Aurangabad||Pheasant-tailed jacanas keep their date with Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Few pheasant-tailed jacanas — an attractive bird species known for undergoing sweeping metamorphosis during the breeding season — have been spotted at the Salim Ali lake in Aurangabad. Known as ‘kamal pakshi’ in vernacular language, the bird develops a sickle-shaped tail and a golden nape to attract a mating partner. A spot visit to the Salim Ali lake revealed at least three pheasant-tailed jacanas using the shallow water body as their new home. Bird expert Kishor Pathak said the pheasant-tailed jacanas are found visiting Aurangabad after mid-summer and they stay on till around September. “The bird was found breeding within the limited waterbodies located in and around Aurangabad. The female pheasant-tailed jacana is polyandrous in nature and mates with multiple males during the breeding season. The bird is also found shifting its eggs if any threat is sensed,” he said, adding that the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary also serves as a home for the pheasant-tailed jacanas. While the spotting of the bird at the Salim Ali lake has brought joy among the bird-lovers, the habitat destruction due to rampant water pollution at the lake has left many worried. “Despite constantly raising our voices, there is still no check on the direct release of waste-water into the Salim Ali lake. The widespread and dense presence of water hyacinth inside the lake highlights the serious level of water pollution. While the limited presence of water hyacinth is good for the aquatic and shore birds among other creatures, uncontrolled water pollution is posing a threat to the Salim Ali lake,” Pathak said. Vijay Patil, the garden superintendent of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pheasant-tailed-jacanas-keep-their-date-with-aurangabad/articleshow/83550646.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Chennai||Did you fire your maid? Here is the untold story||By R Geetha & Priti Narayan Domestic workers are among the most severely impacted informal workers by the slew of lockdowns imposed since the start of the pandemic. Many have suffered from non-payment of wages and abrupt termination of employment, without legal recourse to compensation or redressal, and are routinely subject to poor working conditions. Veni, 45, and her younger sister Amala were recruited by a domestic workers’ agency in Chennai and sent to New Delhi to work as full-time domestic workers in a household a few years ago. Once they got there, they realised they weren’t being paid the salary decided nor given meals as promised. Their mother faced sexual harassment at the hands of her employer at the agency here. “We could not tolerate our working conditions, so all of us quit,” Veni recalls. “My mother has still not received the full pay for the work she did. But this is how she raised us, by doing domestic work in very harsh conditions.” While there is no exact data, India is estimated to have anywhere between four million and 90 million domestic workers. A majority of these are women, a significant proportion of whom are the primary breadwinners in their families. No legislation stipulates the wages, working conditions and protections of these workers, demonstrating how undervalued the labour of domestic workers is. The National Platform for Domestic Workers (NPDW) was formed in 2012 specifically to demand a comprehensive central legislation for domestic workers, following decades of organising around the issue. This is necessary given that a large proportion of domestic workers are also from other states, and are more vulnerable to exploitation for that reason. The NPDW drafted a Domestic Workers Regulation of Work and Social Security Bill in 2017, stipulating registration of workers and emplo- yers, the provision of identity cards for workers, regulating working conditions, hours and wages, and setting up grievance redressal mechanisms and a social security fund. However, it is yet to become a law. Domestic workers are also demanding that India ratify the ILO Convention 189 that recognises the contribution of domestic workers to the global economy and mandates protection of their rights. Being recognised as workers in accord- ance with the ILO Convention also provides protection on the basis of the governing body’s fundamental conventions, which includes elimination of forced labour, and abolition of child labour. This is important given that many below the age of 18 are employed as domestic help. Some states such as Maharashtra have taken steps to recognise and protect domestic workers. Though Tamil Nadu does not have a separate legislation, domestic workers have a welfare board set up under the Tamil Nadu Manual Workers Act 1982. Through it registered workers receive benefits, including pensions, maternity benefits, educational assistance for children and accident relief. However, a 2016 report by the Centre for Workers’ Management estimates that only about 3% of domestic workers in the state have access to this social security. The minimum wages set by TN for domestic work in 2018 is only `37 per hour, and not adhered to by most employers. The new labour codes passed in 2019 and 2020 claim to cover all informal workers, but leaves out domestic help. They are also restricted to those in the organised workforce. Domestic workers therefore have very few protections or tools to bargain with their employers. Domestic workers who do not live with their employers are considered part-time workers, even if they work in multiple households. Precarity during pandemic“90% of our members are struggling to eat one good meal a day,” says Clarammal, state-level coordinator of the Tamil Nadu Domestic Workers Union. While workers are more impacted this year, compared to 2020, many find themselves in debt from last year, and are struggling to pay rents, she says. While the Tamil Nadu Domestic Workers Welfare Board only announced a paltry `2,000 as one-time relief during lockdowns last year, it is yet to provide any relief in 2021. Domestic workers are facing abrupt termination of employment and non-payment of wages during the pandemic. “Work used to be somewhat easy to find through our social networks and word- of-mouth, but for the past year there has been no work. Potential employers are demanding that we produce proof of vaccination,” Veni says. Some are also being denied work and refused entry into apartment buildings because they face the stigma of residing in dense, urban poor neighbourhoods and caste-based exclusionary logics. No concerted effort has been made by the government to vaccinate domestic workers either. In contrast, world over, care and domestic work are being recognised as critical in fighting the pandemic. Recognising the labour of domestic workers and the precarious conditions in which they work is particularly necessary at this time. State-level welfare boards alone are not adequate: a tripartite structure must be set up, that includes representatives of workers, employers and the government, which can look into wages and terms of employment, in addition to social security and welfare. Grievance redressal mechanisms and a complaints committee on sexual harassment must also be set up as suggested by the NPDW in their model bill. Domestic workers must be prioritised for vaccines so that their lives and livelihoods can get back on track. Relief must be distributed irrespective of whether they have ration cards, because several migrant domestic workers do not have them, and are therefore left out.

---||Mumbai||Make info about flats sold public: MahaRera||Mumbai: With increasing complaints about builders illegally allotting the same flat to multiple buyers, the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) has now directed them to publicly disclose if an apartment has been sold or booked. “To avoid multiple transactions of flats/plots, it is necessary to provide the information as soon as sale is concluded or booking is made,” it said, adding builders would also be required to specify if the flat was mortgaged. Real estate market experts said there are cases where builders issue only a letter of allotment to the buyer; a sort of confirmation that the flat is booked. “The flat can be sold again to any other allottee without the first allottee knowing. The same flat may be even mortgaged to financial institutions. In that case neither the first nor the second allottee is aware of the flat being sold nor is the financial institution aware of the sale,” said a leading property consultant. “The developer thus raises funds illegally for the same flat from two to three different parties,” he added. Navi Mumbai-based builder, Manohar Shroff, said Navi Mumbai has become a “cheaters paradise”. “Because of a few notorious builders and brokers, the entire industry is suffering,” he said. According to Shroff, in one instance, a builder cheated several investors and fled to Pune. In another, a builder absconded with Rs 100 crore and a third did multiple sales of shops in CBD Belapur and cheated buyers. “Purchasers must get their documents registered at earliest,” he said. Lawyer Anil Harish, an expert on property laws, said, “It appears that even after the advent of RERA, some developers are still issuing multiple allotment letters in respect of the same premises. This is obviously wrong, both under the civil and the criminal law. But buyers have also to exercise vigilance.’’ Harish said purchasers should check the RERA website to see if the project is registered and building approvals have been obtained. “Are the premises or even the entire building mortgaged, for example for a construction loan? If so, insist on a release from the lender for the premises in question. Also take search of the records of the sub-registrar to check title and for mortgages,’’ he said. Experts said buyers must register the agreement if more than 10% of the flat value is being paid. “Stamp duty on an allotment letter or a letter of intent or an MOU could be 1% of the price in order to encourage people to register. Credit must be given for this 1% against the stamp duty on the agreement, so later you have to pay only the remaining 4%,’’ said Harish. Pankaj Kapoor of Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, said the basic premise of RERA was to curb such menace and practices. “The Act stipulates that developers upload information about the units mortgaged and sold on the RERA website. In the past, many builders of projects stuck in NCR and MMR were seen to be indulging in similar practices that caused extreme difficulties to consumers and lenders. Strong punitive action should be taken against such developers as it dents the consumers’ confidence and brings the whole sector to disrepute,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/make-info-about-flats-sold-public-maharera/articleshow/83590963.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

Pharmacists in the district said that as Covid cases were coming down, demand for the injection had been on the wane too. Over the past 15 days, they said, they haven’t sold a single vial of remdesivir to patients’ relatives. Health officials said they had no option but to keep the stocks. They said that until there were further instructions from the government, these vials could be used during the third wave. The injections are due to expire in January next year. The situation is a sharp contrast to that in April-May, when people were running pillar to post for the antiviral medicine and social media was flooded with requests from patients’ relatives. Rajiv Tyagi, general secretary of the District Ghaziabad Chemists and Druggists Association, said, “The situation was quite bad then. I alone would get more than 100 calls daily for the injection. People faced a lot of trouble and travelled hundreds of kilometres to Haryana to procure remdesivir. The situation started to improve by the second week of May. But by then, the worst of the wave had started to subside. At present, over 2 lakh doses of this injection are available with the stockists.”According to official figures, on April 1, the health department had a stock of just 200 doses of remdesivir, which could be given to only 40 patients. Between April 1 and May 31, the department received 6,255 doses, of which 3,395 were provided by the Uttar Pradesh Medical Supplies Corporation Limited, 2,345 by the Meerut division and 315 by a pharmaceutical firm. Over 50% (3,236) of these were consumed, while 3,019 are left.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/once-out-of-stock-gzb-now-has-3k-remdesivir-doses/articleshow/83559411.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Chandigarh||Govt school students must be given mobile phones, data card: Teachers||Ludhiana: As most government school students do not have necessary infrastructure to continue studying from home, teachers demand that government should provide sources for the students, especially mobile phones and data packs. Talking to TOI , Hardev Singh Mullanpur district president of Democratic Teachers’ Front and a primary teacher at Government Primary School Gahaur said “Students are facing a lot of issues in online studies, as half of them in the class do not have access to smartphones. Even if they have, their parents take that to the work. In my school, only 80 students attend class out of 126 students. Even if the department wants to conduct online classes, they should also provide resources like mobile phones to students.” A teacher at GSSS Panjdoraiyan, Deep Raja, said, “There are a few books available for students. So, there is always an issue for those students who do not attend online classes. At times there are no written orders and only verbal orders and teachers have to follow the same. Even ACR is being considered on the basis of such activities.” He adds, “Students also, suffer when the posts of lecturer are not filled. Only master cadre teachers are teaching students. Students even during summer vacation are involved in various competitions and parents are objecting to it.” Teachers claim that they have been asking for donations from people and the government have taken full credit for these smart schools. Teachers also claim that they should be given time to teach academics rather than involving them in non-teaching works and a tool and a mediator between department and students. Amandeep Singh Dadhahur, another teacher, said, “There is always an issue with students during this pandemic and online studies. Students do not study seriously as either they have odd jobs to do or their parents have taken the phone with them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/govt-school-students-must-be-given-mobile-phones-data-card-teachers/articleshow/83550680.cms||Mehak Jain

Across the state, over 9,000 vehicles were registered at 50 RTOs, sources said. There were over 4,000 applications for the online learner’s licence across Maharashtra. The licence will be uploaded minutes after the applicant takes the MCQ-based test. Statistics showed that when it came to private cars, over 100 cars and SUVs were registered online in Mumbai at four RTOs in 24 hours. While Wadala RTO (eastern suburbs) registered the maximum of 40 cars, this was followed by 32 cars at Andheri RTO, 19 at Borivali RTO and 16 cars at Tardeo (island city). The newly introduced online system also enabled dealers to register 353 scooters and motorcycles till Tuesday afternoon. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had launched the two new online systems —for learner’s licence and for dealer point registration of vehicles. Of 110 RTO services across Maharashtra, 85 are now available online. “The new online system has saved a lot of time, money and energy. Also, everything from registration to paying taxes is done online now,” said a car dealer from Mulund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/495-vehicles-registered-online-in-mumbai-city-in-24-hours/articleshow/83559716.cms||Somit Sen

A division bench of chief justices Dipankar Datta and Ravindra Ghuge has scheduled the matter for next hearing on Wednesday. On May 7, the HC had directed the state to fill up at least 50% government and semi-government vacancies in the health department and had kept the matter for a hearing on Monday. Additional government pleader Sujeet Karlekar on Monday submitted that the process for filling up of class III and IV posts had been initiated and in another eight to 10 days, the agency through which this recruitment will be carried out will be finalized. “An affidavit in this regard will be filed soon,” he submitted. The issue of recruiting class-I and class-II health staff cropped up, following which the HC directed the state to make MPSC a party to the case and asked it to file an affidavit in this regard. Jaleel, who is appearing as a party in person in the matter, has highlighted that 2,048 posts are vacant in the health department in Aurangabad district, including Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Government Cancer Hospital and Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s health department. The Aurangabad MP also moved another plea before the HC raising the issue of mucormycosis and pleaded for inclusion of the Government Dental College and Hospital as a party to the PIL. The HC replied that a criminal PIL on this issue was already being heard at Aurangabad bench and gave him liberty to file an intervention plea in that matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/make-mpsc-party-to-pil-on-health-dept-vacancies-hc/articleshow/83550710.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Vedant, a visually challenged commerce student from KTHM College in Nashik, won the coveted medal from a large pool of 6.5 lakh students from 900 affiliated colleges and research centres. The medal shows appreciation for academic merit and behaviour towards teachers and peers and participation in social and extracurricular activities. A total of 1.61 lakh students will get their degrees via post, university officials said. The entire programme, except for Vedant’s medal ceremony, was virtual and webcast. Vedant, who is totally blind, feels deeply about disability perceptions. “The real disabled are those who have all their senses and yet do nothing with their lives. I want to change the perception towards the disabled. My dream is to break blindness stereotypes. My aim is to inspire people to do their best in life. My parents, teachers and society have helped me, and one day, I want to help in return,” he said. He has fought many battles to keep going with education. “As a blind student, I was discouraged from taking Sanskrit in Std X. I scored 99/ 100 in the exam. I was refused a seat in a reputed college in Nashik on account of being blind. They said it was the wrong choice. I topped the CPT exam, and have cleared the first level of the intermediate exam. I want to become a CA,” a bouyant Vedant said. His parents Umesh and Jayshri said their son has been an achiever right through. “He topped in Std X in the state in his category, has completed his Visharad exam in tabla, he is a flautist and can play the harmonium, has been a college representative, a chess player and was instrumental in donating the cornea of his grandparents to four persons. He also has a distinction in BCom. Beyond all this, he has been guiding and motivating people with visual impairment, helping their families understand their world and the children with Braille and software,” Mundada said. Vedant’s optic nerves were damaged and he lost his vision when he was one and half years old. “We were heartbroken. We went to many hospitals for his treatment, visited temples and even delved into superstition to get back his vision. Once we accepted it as God’s will, we worked towards making his life better. He never disappointed us. It is an honour to be known for our son’s achievements,” his father said. Principal of KTHM College VB Gaikwad said Vedant was an exemplary student. “From academics to behaviour to his enthusiasm to be a part of everything, he was amazing and we are happy to teach such students.

Its president, Adesh Gupta, leader of Opposition in assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir blamed the AAP government for the water crisis. “The Kejriwal government claims to have laid pipelines in 93% of the colonies, but where are the pipelines and why doesn’t water come in them?” asked Gupta. Before 2014, when most of the colonies had no supply pipeline under the Congress government, Rs 1,109 crore used to be spent on water tankers, Gupta said. “But despite chief minister Arvind Kejriwal claiming that 93% of the colonies have pipelines, Rs 1,783 crore is being spent on water tankers. It is quite surprising,” he said, adding that people still have to stand in long queues to fetch a bucket or two of water. Areas like Tughlaqabad, Anand Parbat, Mandawali, Burari and Shakti Nagar even now do not have water supply, he claimed, accusing Kejriwal of not paying attention to the water crisis. “In 2019, a survey said that of 21 cities in India, the quality of water is the worst in Delhi,” he said. “The situation will further worsen. Why Delhiites are being compelled to drink this contaminated water?” Bidhuri claimed that in the past six years, Delhi government had given Rs 47,000 crore to Delhi Jal Board for providing clean water but even now over 40% of Delhi didn’t get filtered water. “DJB has not been able to meet the quantity of water required for Delhi. Not a single new water treatment plant has come up during Kejriwal’s tenure and even his assurance about making underground reservoir near the Yamuna is just on paper,” Bidhuri claimed. Kejriwal’s July 2019 promise of constructing off-river reservoirs on a 20km stretch between Palla and Wazirabad along the Yamuna for recharging groundwater is also yet to be implemented, he alleged. Gambhir said, “A year ago, the country’s biggest water filter was to be installed in Ghazipur area, which could have helped 50,000 people get a litre of water for just 20 paise. Home delivery would have been available at 50 paise per litre. But the proposal is still lying with DJB.” Despite repeated attempts, AAP didn’t comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-says-no-piped-water-in-many-parts-targets-govt/articleshow/83555379.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Recently, in the news was the story of how a CPI leader and a Congress family had named their children after political leaders and ideologies. Salem’s Mamata Banerjee was likely named when her namesake was a brave Congress activist in West Bengal staring down the ruling CPM — a long time ago when she was barely a leader in her own right. Tamils name their children after gods and goddesses, their own fathers and mothers, or their forefathers. They also name them after their heroes, well known personalities from across the world, or whoever is trending. There is a certain freedom that Tamils exercise in naming their children.

The decision was taken in a meeting held on Monday. According to the dairy farmers, the hike is unavoidable and due to the increased costs of various inputs and the new rates will be applicable from Tuesday. Paramjit Singh Bobby president of the Haibowal Dairy Association said, “Due to unavoidable circumstances. our association has decided to hike the rate of milk being supplied by our members by Rs 3 per litre. The new rates will be applicable from tomorrow and the rate of buffalo milk has been increased from Rs 70 to Rs 73 per litre. The rate of cow milk has been increased from Rs 55 to Rs 58 per litre, while rate of buffalo-cow mix milk will be increased from Rs 55 to Rs 58 per litre. This increase was inevitable as our input costs have shot up significantly due to increase in the rate of petrol, diesel, transportation and cattle feed. Moreover, Covid too has had huge impact on our businesses and along with sales coming down, the cost of livestock has increased by almost Rs 50,000 each animal. So it has become a very challenging task to run the dairy farming business.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haibowal-dairy-association-hikes-milk-rates-by-rs-3-per-litre/articleshow/83550759.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala highway heist: Probe team claims money belongs to BJP||THRISSUR: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the recent highway heist case at Kodakara has informed the court that their probes make it clear that the money that was looted in the case belonged to the BJP. The SIT submitted the probe report before the judicial first class magistrate, Irinjalakuda, on Tuesday while objecting to the plea submitted by the complainants in the case claiming the money seized by the police. The complainants included Dharmarajan, who allegedly sent the money in the car; Shamjeer, who is the owner of the car and Sunil Naik, who claims that he had given Rs 25 lakh which was looted from the car. The report said the money was hawala money and was being brought from Karnataka for distributing to the BJP leaders in different parts of the state. The SIT report discloses that the BJP leaders had summoned Deepak, one of the prime accused in the looting case, to the party office and had threatened him. BJP leaders from Thrissur were the first to reach Kodakara immediately after the highway heist incident which happened there in the wee hours of April 3. However, instead of lodging a complaint at the nearby police station, they have taken the occupants in the attacked car to the BJP office. The complaint was given to the police only four days later (on April 7), the police report said. The report said origin of the money was being investigated, and only Rs 1.40 crore of the Rs 3.5 crore looted have been recovered so far. The report had also disclosed that the statements given by Dharmarajan to the police and his statement before the magistrate under the Section 164 CrPC have never mentioned that the money belonged to him. Meanwhile, BJP state spokesman B Gopalakrishnan strongly refuted the findings in the police report and alleged that the SIT was only parroting the absurdities being stated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The police must divulge the evidence they have relied on while arriving at these conclusions. Such baseless stories are being released to the media by the police as part of the CPM design to tarnish the BJP,” Gopalakrishnan alleged. The goons who had looted the money had followed the car, which was carrying the cash in two other vehicles, and intercepted it by creating an artificial accident, near Kodakara. The SIT headed by Thrissur range DIG A Akbar had already recovered about Rs 1.5 crore in the case and as per reports Rs 3.5 crore was looted in the incident that happened near Kodakara on April 3, a couple of days before the assembly elections. The SIT has also arrested about 20 accused in the case. Interestingly, the initial complaint was that only Rs 25 lakh was looted from the car. Later Dharmarajan, who claimed to have sent the money, had conceded to the police Rs 3.5 crore was lost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/highway-heist-probe-teamclaims-money-belongs-to-bjp/articleshow/83555374.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Hyderabad||Readers’ Corner||I baked my first birthday cake Selina Singh Covid-19 has spread like wildfire. We are now forced to maintain social distance where, in fact, we want to mingle with every friend of ours in school and outside. Washing hands with sanitizer is a definition of our hygiene and I miss the hugs and touches of our own near and dear ones. But the coronavirus has also brought about an evolution in my life. Now, I get to spend quality time with my family members and also learn new skills. I have picked up some easy snack recipes and I even baked my 11th birthday cake – the first self-made cake of my life! I have learnt to appreciate nature -- I sit and watch different species of birds and insects in my terrace whenever I get the time – participate in various household chores and have even learnt coding and made myself aware about the basics of technology. A highlight of the lockdown was the birthday celebrations of my grandparents. When I saw my granny blow the candles on her 70th birthday cake and dance with me to new-age dance numbers, my heart melted. I also got time to spend with my pet -- Labra. He got sick in between and I took care of him – his foods, medicines etc and realise that there are so many things that animals can convey even without speaking. Sitting in the comfort of my house with my family, while hearing of all the horrible things happening to people around us, has also made me realise how fortunate I am. This virus has indeed helped me become a better person, acknowledge the value of a family and realise the importance of friends and teachers in my life. I will, never again, take any of these things for granted.

One of the oldest referral hospitals for children in India, ICH will be part of the pan-India Phase-III clinical trial for a vaccine by Zydus Cadila on children aged between 12 and 18 years. “We have got a clearance from our internal ethics committee for the trial. This is part of a pan-India study on 1,500 children. In our institute we will be engaging 100 volunteers,” said ICH professor, Jaydeep Choudhury, who would be co-investigating the trial with associate professor, Monjori Mitra, the principal investigator. After Covaxin, ZyCov-D is the second indigenous vaccine to be tried on children. While the trial on Covaxin is being taken up by some select institutes like AIIMS Patna and Delhi, ICH will be the first to take up the trial for children’s vaccination in Bengal. The institute has already begun the process of recruiting volunteers. A local school has even approached the institute, volunteering help in case they could mobilise volunteers among their students. The screening process will start soon. The vaccine vials are expected to arrive in the Kolkata hospital in a couple of days. “With the hypothesis of a third wave and possibility of more children being hit, it is important for them to be vaccinated. If the vaccine proves its efficacy, this can offer a ray of hope and protection to children,” said ICH director, Apurba Ghosh. A DNA plasmid vaccine ZyCov-D uses genetic code in the virus aiming at stimulating immune response. The vaccine is expected to help the body develop specific antibodies for defence against the virus. “In a pandemic situation one cannot afford to wait for the complete clinical evaluation of a vaccine’s efficacy. If the trial for this vaccine can generate immunogenicity in terms of neutralising antibody titre and safety data proving its efficacy, it is likely to be clinically effective as well. And if it gets EUA (emergency use authorisation) before the third wave hits, it will be used for the paediatric population,” said senior clinical trial specialist, Santanu Tripathi, former head of clinical and experimental pharmacology at School of Tropical Medicine. All the three vaccines currently being administered in India —Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V — are also rolled out under EUA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-vaccine-trial-on-kids-in-kol-at-ich/articleshow/83555364.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The duo has been shifted to a hospital and doctors said that they are unconscious but their condition is stable. According to the police, 28-year-old Suvarna Dorik and 22-year-old Ashwin Parmar, who work in BDR Lifesciences Private Ltd in Padra were found in an injured state inside the department by other staff on Monday evening. Their throats were slit with some sharp weapon. “The quality control department gives access only to select employees. This duo had access to the department where they work. We are trying to ascertain if it was a case of suicide or attempt to murder,” said M A Karmuar, Padra police inspector. Karmur told TOI that their throats were slit with a knife that was found nearby. While Suvarna is a microbiologist, Ashwin works as a lab boy in the company located in Luna village. Their throats had exactly the same wound at the same spot. “We will be able to gather more details only after the duo regain consciousness,” Karmur added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-found-with-throats-slit-in-factory/articleshow/83551574.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC firm on probe into role of Sonu Sood, MLA Zeeshan Siddique||MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Wednesday told the state government to scrutinise the role of Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique and actor Sonu Sood in the illegal supply of remdesivir injection, reports Rosy Sequeira. “We expect the state government to please scrutinise their action because without their action it was not possible for anyone to know (of remdesivir availability),’’ said a bench hearing a case on Covid-19 management, adding they projected themselves as “messiahs” to the public. The HC was told about supply of remdesivir by Sood Charity Foundation and Siddique in response to social media appeals despite the Centre’s control on allocation. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told a bench of of Justices S P Deshmukh and Girish Kulkarni a criminal case has been filed in a magistrate’s court against BDR Charitable Foundation and its four trustees in the same matter. Also, BDR Pharmaceuticals which supplied remdesivir vials did not have a license under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. He said in the case of Sood, the inquiry is “pending at the doorsteps of Cipla” which supplied it from Bhiwandi to a pharmacy store inside Lifeline Hospital, Goregaon (east). To the court’s query, AG replied that no case has been filed against Siddique. “All he did was divert persons to the trust. It is the trust who has supplied medicines,’’ he added. Justice Kulkarni asked, “To divert, according to you, is not an offence?” The AG replied that the trust had possession of the medicines and distributed them. “Ultimately it all happened at the behest of a person who told them to go and get the drug. To direct innocent persons to avail of illegal supply is not an offence? Before we pass any order you examine the (legal) position,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges said the common man would not have known of remdesivir’s availability unless Siddique and Sood projected themselves as “messiahs” to the public and gave the impression that the government was not coming to their help. They said while the government was making efforts to procure the medicines, the public perception was there was a “parallel agency.” “We leave it to good conscience (of State) to examine the role of these two," said Justice Kulkarni. “We’ll examine the role of these two individuals, how far they are incriminating,” the AG replied. Observing that it was important to know about the illegal supply of medicines without verification, the judges referred to a news report on “illegal supply” of vaccines to a housing society in Kandivli (west) during a private vaccination drive. “This was very disturbing to know. These kinds of things should not happen,’’ said Justice Kulkarni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-firm-on-probe-into-role-of-sood-mla/articleshow/83591017.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 150 vax certs have names of hosp staffers||Mumbai: A society in Kandivli has complained to police about being “taken for a ride” by a group of people who held a vaccination drive in its premises. A resident, Gopal Sura, said the group of vaccinators “only checked Aadhaar card of residents and said they’d get an OTP a few days later that recipients had to convey to the group”. Concern turned to fear when 150 of the recipients got vaccination certificates from different hospitals (Nanavati, Lifeline Hospital and BMC’s Nesco jumbo centre), carrying different dates. “The fraudsters collected around Rs 5 lakh from us and left us worrying about what has been injected,” said another resident. Most recipients were in the 18-44 age-group who needed vaccination for trips abroad. Additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant said, “We will inquire and take action.” A police source said the Covishield vials had ‘Not For Sale’ stamps in red on them. Deputy civic commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar said, “When a society or corporate organises a drive in its premises through a private hospital, they must sign a memorandum of understanding and intimate the local ward office about it.” It is learnt the 150 certificates (100 bearing the name of Nanavati Hospital, which has since filed a police complaint) have names of genuine employees of the hospital named. “We don’t know how the employees’ password was acquired by the fraudsters,” said a police officer. In the case of Hiranandani Heritage, BMC officials are not sure if an MoU was signed as the local ward office was not informed. “We have also not received any complaint. We will ask the society for details,” said Shankarwar. The association has alleged that a man claiming to be a sales representative of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital approached it for on-premises vaccination for its residents (Kokilaben hospital has clarified it doesn’t do housing colony drives outside Andheri). One Mahendra Singh arranged vaccines and collected money from the society. “Singh claimed he had organised drives for 5,000 people of a corporate house. He also held a camp in an architecture college in Borivli on June 3,” said Sura. Kandivli police are inquiring about Singh. His phone has been switched off. Police are questioning a person whom Singh engaged for a day by paying Rs 1,000. The person has pleaded innocent, claiming he is poor. Residents contacted the hospitals, which clarified they were not involved in the drive. On Tuesday, many residents took to Twitter. “This tweet is to bring to notice a SCAM,” Neha Alshi tweeted. “There are doubts about whether we were actually given Covishield or was it just glucose or expired/waste vaccine,” said Alshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-150-vax-certs-have-names-of-hosp-staffers/articleshow/83555460.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Hyderabad||‘It is usually an idea that fails, never the entrepreneur’||‘It is usually an idea that fails, never the entrepreneur’ A six-member panel of experts answer queries from TOI readers about developing a startup idea, opportunities that T incubators offer to fledgling enterprises and various schemes available to entrepreneurs seeking funds. Q. I am a finance professional with a zeal for entrepreneurship. What are the factors that one needs to keep in mind while developing a startup idea? How do you decide the commercial viability of a product? -- Mihir D Shah Ravi N: Begin with the assessment of the market. It is very important to thoroughly understand the market before you can go further. So, spend time talking to people – at least five people who can be potential customers. Once that’s done, go back and see what it is that you bring to the table to provide a solution that caters to the demand in the market. Thirdly, understand if the solution is something that makes for a large enough market-base (you wouldn’t be selling it to only five people). Once that’s checked, you can start with building a startup around it. Q. I am interested in launching a market research provider. I have tried this on a small-scale and it’s been successful. My start up would give employment and livelihood to many, mainly women. Kindly guide me. -- Kavitha Rani G Deepthi R: You have multiple options. First, you can come to WE-Hub, or approach any other incubator for that matter, to leverage its partnership with the local startup ecosystem, to scale up your enterprise. Second, depending on the product, you can use the help of the incubator to connect with customers that you are trying to reach. Third, if you want to grow internationally, incubators like the WE-Hub can help with cross-border collaborations. In fact, if you approach us, we can connect you to the right incubator too, in case We-Hub is not the place. In terms of financial support too, we can help in connecting with female-focused venture capitalist funds or female venture capitalists (VCs), looking to put their money in women-driven enterprises. Q. I have an idea and we are already building an app around it. But our MVP is not ready yet. Do we qualify for funding? What will VCs look for in us? The idea, the team that's building it, or past experience? -- Bhuvanesh P Ravi N: It mostly depends on the idea/product. Sometimes, VCs bet on the team if they have strong past credentials. Otherwise, they are usually asked to test the product on a certain number of people first, and be assessed based on its strengths etc. Ajit R: Some of the important things to bear in mind before approaching for funding are: Where is the product market? What have you identified that nobody else has stumbled upon? What is your unique capability to solve that problem? Deepthi R: Incubators get a lot of grants that they disburse to many just-out-of-college startups -- at the idea to prototype stage. You can apply to that. Secondly, Startup India has several new schemes that you can explore. Thirdly, many banks these days are investing in startups, you can look at that option. And finally, you can also avail of loans that many are offering without any collateral. Q. I have an idea for a start up on electric vehicles. What are the government policies that can help me? -- Sai Prashanth Sujai K: The electric vehicle (EV) phenomenon is here to stay and will get bigger in the next 10 to 20 years. Hence, it is the right time for one to step into this space. Further, there are various scheme and incentives that are on offer for those exploring startups around EVs. They can get a slew of tax exemptions. For instance, the central government rolls out a subsidy to manufacturers when they intend to sell their vehicles -- this varies in limit from three-wheelers to four-wheelers to buses. Then Telangana has two sets of incentives. First is a tax benefit. There is no road, registration or lifetime tax imposed on these products. This allows the manufacturer to make the product available at a cheaper rate to the consumer. Secondly, somebody willing to set up a manufacturing unit – small or big doesn’t matter – in Telangana can avail up to 20% of their capital investment as subsidy. There are other incentives like 100% reimbursement on GST and transport subsidy on parts/units that are imported. Discount on land and leasing space is another benefit extended by the state. Ajit R: While funding is crucial, those entering this space must be mindful of the large number of startups that are already competing in this space. So, they should ideally go to an incubator to get a sense of the competition. They should also be aware of rules, regulations and risks involved in this space. And apart from EVs, the other area that people can look into is – waste disposal. We are creating so many batteries that in the next 20-30 years there will be a huge problem of disposal. If someone can come up with a solution around this, they will have tremendous competitive advantage over others. Q. I have an idea to start a publication company/rooftop solar installation firm/ startup for mattress and comfort products that will improve living standards of lower income households. What government policies/avenues are available to me? -- K Keerthi Reddy, Rushikesh Reddy, Ajay Prakash Jayesh R: If you are a student who is towing with an idea, then the best thing to do is get incubation support. Many colleges have their own facilities – like colleges affiliated to JNTU can avail of the J-Hub – even as many others are in the process of doing so. If you are not a student, then there are other incubators outside – T-Hub, We-Hub, T-Works etc -- that you can reach out to. Secondly, if you are at a stage where you have clarity about which direction you are taking for your startup and you want to start looking for funds – to bring it to MVP level – there are some seed funding facilities of the government that you can avail of that are there to support very early-stage startups. Incubators can also connect you to investors like Hyderabad Angels. In fact, we are in the process of setting up a T- fund wherein a portion of it – we haven’t decided on the finer details -- can be reserved for very early-stage startup ideas. Finally, sometimes we assist startups by giving them an opportunity within the government -- be it in the area of healthcare, education, agriculture etc -- if there’s some relevance for the government in it. Q. What is the technical support I can expect from government institutions while creating a product-based startup? Which is the right institution for me to approach? -- Shekhar Rao Ravi N: T-Hub is extremely specialised in building the underpinnings of technology to any startup that is building a solution. Most of it is software based; based on AI, data sciences and so on. We are beginning to see that more and more startups are using these almost like an operating system. In fact, some of it is taken as a basis upon which they build their solution. When it comes to hardware, T-Works is the place to look at as it can help you with prototyping, testing and so on. Deepthi R: Research institutes and corporates often allow for their testing facilities to be used, for certain validation, depending upon what the product is. So, approaching T-Hub or We-Hub can help with gaining access to these testing labs. Leveraging our collaborations with corporates can also help startups get hands-on support from real world engineers and their testing labs. Ajit R: RICH works in the areas of life sciences, agriculture and sustainability. In each of these spaces one has to first work on the ground – often hospitals in case of life sciences and fields for agriculture – to test the product. That’s where we step in. We help startups gain access to these ‘labs’ and prepare them for the particular market that they intend to enter – be it India or overseas. Q. What is the time that one should give a startup for it to take off, before deciding it is a failure? -- Karishma C Jayesh R: When you start with an idea, you arrange for some funding – from friends, family or your own savings. When that starts coming to an end and you realise you have not made any progress, or your product has not achieved any visibility, that’s when you start to pick up the signals. But we still do not call it a failure, because every failed attempt also leaves behind some valuable learning with you, which you use in the next enterprise. I personally know hundreds of people whose first venture did not take off, but they had the mental ability and agility to pivot and make a new, successful, product. This is most important – to assess if you have the mind and ability to be an entrepreneur. To be so wedded to an idea that you are willing to take it all the way and find a solution. And if it doesn’t work, learn from it and move on. Ajit R: If you run out of money, it’s not a failure. Sometimes it also happens that the idea you have is too ahead of its time (like what happened with e-learning many years ago). If you are not able to develop an MVP, go back and connect with other people who can help you take a fresh look at it. Understand why you are not able to make progress and see if you can find solutions to work around them. Ravi N: Failure is not of an enterprise, it’s of an idea. One needs to separate the two things. In fact, investors often look for people who have failed since they are faster at eliminating the problems at an early stage. Deepthi R: Give incubators, mentorship programmes a chance to help you understand where and why you are hitting a roadblock, before giving up on an idea. Q. I am in the final stages of developing a mobile application that aims to create employment for workers in the unorganised segment. Do I need to register the app with any government agency? Also, since the app intends to collect Aadhar details, as a security measure, do I need to get any permissions? -- Rohit Sanghi Jayesh R: The Telangana government is coming with a policy for assisting migrant workers upskill and improve their current employment status. Once this policy is announced, we will be happy to look at this app and see if it can be useful for us. Secondly, you can also connect with NAAC (since a large section of workers in the unorganised section work in construction) to see what avenues are available. Also, while there is no need to register with any government agency, permission is certainly required to collect Aadhar details. I suggest you refer to the IT Act and familiarise yourself with the new rules regarding this. Q. Is it advisable to do a course/training programme in entrepreneurship before taking the plunge? What are the avenues available? -- Ankush Sikdar Shrikant S: There are various programmes that we offer, which might benefit entrepreneurs. In December last year we started an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Mindset Development Programme where one is familisarised with the basics of this field -- what qualities one needs to have to become an entrepreneur, etc. At TASK we also run an Entrepreneurship Development Programme, which is in collaboration with all eco-system partners – including T-Hub, We-Hub, RICH etc – which is also very helpful for people who want to start an enterprise. This apart, we run a Technology Entrepreneurship Prograrmme, with ISB, which is basically for tech entrepreneurs. Already over 2,000 people have benefitted from this. Since we work very closely with the entire startup community, we keep coming up with new notices on courses and programmes depending on the requirement and necessity. We have webinars/videos too that one can access. All of this is open to everyone. Q. A lot of startups like mine (we work on developing LED products), suffered miserably due to the Covid-induced slowdown. Is the government doing anything to help such enterprises revive? -- Prashanth Kumar Jayesh R: There is a national scheme that any SME including a startup, which is going through difficult times, can avail of. It is under the ‘Atmanirbar Bharat’ package -- the Prime Minister’s Rs 20 lakh crore Guaranteed Emergency Credit Line scheme. That apart, Telangana has also taken up some measures in a gradual and calibrated way. For instance, if a startup is into manufacturing something which can be used by some large company that’s within our ecosystem, we are helping them connect with each other for the former’s benefit. Sujai K: If someone is already running something and there is a problem, we can also help and get them customers. But it is difficult to say how without knowing the details. This is done on a case-by-case basis. But startups can certainly approach us with their problems. Q. Does the state only promote tech-driven startups? I have an idea to take art-based products and sell them through e-commerce. It can help build a platform for artists to showcase their art and earn from it too. Can I get help? -- Vishal Khoshekay Jaeysh R: Our incubators are not all about tech. We have an incubator dedicated for animation, gaming, visual effects – it’s called the Image incubator – which one can avail of, if the work pertains to these areas. But if one’s startup has something to do with visual arts or performing arts, we have a Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University in Masab Tank which also has an incubator that you can take the help of. There is nothing to say that we only encourage tech startups. In fact, majority of the startups at We-Hub are non-tech. Q. I have a lot of experience in HR processes like recruitment, third party payrolls, running in-house payrolls, HR compliances, HR engagement etc. What kind of enterprises can I think of floating? -- J Karthik Rao Ravi N: The pandemic has thrown up opportunities for people to manage work from home, digital ways of managing people, keeping them productive, upskilling them and workforce management – especially in scenarios where they are not physically meeting their managers, colleagues etc. To be able to employ digital technologies to make these things happen has huge possibilities that one can explore. Ajit R: There are many startups in the HR space because it has multiple opportunities. It is, in fact, one of the most productive areas for automation. Q. Would like to know how the government supports startups particularly in the IT sector. How can we attract funding or what funds are available and what would be the criteria for the same? -- Savith Desiraju Ravi N: Just to reiterate, there are different types of funding that one can avail of. First, there are grants that are available to very early-stage startups that have interesting ideas. Various government agencies -- central and state -- have these schemes. Second, there are non- collateral loans that are available for such work and third, is equity where one can give up a part of the company to get funding. Q. We are from 360 DigiTMG that offers a data science certification course. It has strategised to focus on emerging trends and technologies and has special emphasis on corporate market. How we can partner with the Telangana Academy for Skill and Knowledge as we want to bring change in the digital space in Telangana. -- Satish Kumar Shrikant S: We have spoken to the startup and are in the process of evaluating their services. There are many other startups that are available in the same space, so we might end up using only some specific programmes. Also, currently we have partners who are offering these programmes pro bono, because of the pandemic. That’s not the case with this one and that’s a constraint. I would suggest, the founders take another look at their product and see if they can make it more affordable and accessible to youth from the districts and rural areas. We are focusing on programmes that empower such youth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/it-is-usually-an-idea-that-fails-never-the-entrepreneur/articleshow/83556768.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Early arrival a mirage as monsoon plays truant||NEW DELHI: The capital recorded another hot and humid day on Tuesday with only AyaNagar in southwest Delhi receiving a drizzle during the day. Rain eluded other parts of the capital and relief in the form of the southwest monsoon is likely to be delayed too. Met officials said the onset of monsoon in Delhi could be delayed by 7 to 10 days, taking it closer to its original onset date of June 27. India Meteorological Department had earlier forecast the monsoon to reach Delhi by June 15. “Due to approaching or mid-latitude westerlies winds, further progress over remaining parts of northwest India is likely to be slow. The progress of the monsoon is being monitored continuously and further updates will be provided on a daily basis,” said IMD’s monsoon bulletin on Tuesday. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said the progress of the southwest monsoon had been impacted over the last 48 hours and while it had touched eastern Uttar Pradesh, less rainfall was likely in the next few days. Srivastava says the advancement of the monsoon into western Uttar Pradesh is likely to give an indication for Delhi as well. “At this rate, the delay could be anywhere from 7 to 10 days, however, we will get a clearer picture by Wednesday, when there is still a chance of rain. After that, the chances of rain reduce,” he said. Delhi recorded a maximum of 38.7 degrees Celsius on Tuesday – one degree below normal. Relative humidity oscillated between 44 and 81 per cent in the last 24 hours. IMD has forecast gusty winds of up to 50 km/hr to be recorded across Delhi on Wednesday, with chances of light rain. While there may be a possibility of very light rain on Thursday as well, no rain is expected on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, improved further with the AQI dropping to 113 (moderate) from Monday’s reading of 124. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, a body under the ministry of earth sciences, says the air quality is expected to improve further in the next few days. “Wind speed is forecast to stay high for the next three days and isolated rainfall is likely for the next two days in Delhi. Rainfall and aerosol washout are expected to improve AQI.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/early-arrival-a-mirage-as-monsoon-plays-truant/articleshow/83557968.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The advisory came a day before the government’s eased restriction norms start from June 16 to June 30. The state has asked KMC commissioner and district magistrates to “remain on high alert notwithstanding the fact that the cases of infection have come down significantly over the past few weeks.” The order by state chief secretary HK Dwivedi said “district Covid data” must be analysed to identify if any zone is reporting high prevalence of cases. In the order, the CS said, “Strong surveillance measures must be instituted in these containment zones.” The measures will include early testing, tracing, and tracking of suspected cases. Better clinical management of these cases must be ensured and meetings with all the relevant stakeholders must be held on a regular basis to ensure that the measures are implemented strictly.  In Kolkata, containment zone list was last revised in end-January, which showed two zones — two high-rise clusters in Ballygunge Circular Road and Gurusaday Dutta Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-dms-told-to-map-local-hot-spots/articleshow/83555439.cms||---

The joint entrance test (JET) will be conducted by the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI), Kolkata, for both institutes, as per the agreement between the institutes to alternatively manage the JET every two years. According to the FTII, talks about starting the procedure for this year are still underway. “The JET is generally held in February and classes start by August. However, it is already the month of June. We are still in talks with the SRFTI over if and when the admissions process will be held.

---||Delhi||City depends on two states to meet 90% of potable water need||New Delhi: Being a water-stressed city with very few internal raw water resources, Delhi depends on two neighbouring states for meeting 90% of its potable water demands. The city has an installed supply capacity of 935 million gallons per day(MGD) against an estimated daily requirement of 1,235MGD. According to a Delhi Jal Board (DJB) official, the 14,935km-long drinking water pipeline network has been expanded gradually and pipelines have been laid in 1,633 out of the 1,799 unauthorised colonies. “Water has been released in 1,573 colonies, while 115 colonies will require no-objection certificates from the forest department and Archaeological Survey of India and some are located in the Yamuna O-zone,” he said. “The deadline for all feasible colonies has been fixed as December 2022 before the second Covid-19 wave hit the city.” Heavy reliance on neighbours has resulted in several disruptions in Delhi’s water supply in recent times because of high silt and turbidity levels in Upper Ganga Canal, low water levels in the Yamuna, and rise in ammonia and industrial pollutant levels in the river water coming from Haryana. In April, TOI had reported that during the preceding two months, the ammonia levels in the Yamuna had remained at maximum treatable limit of 0.9 ppm or above for 35 days. The economic survey released by Delhi government in March stated around 93% of the population was covered by piped water supply, if public hydrants were also included. Around 1,200 water tankers have been roped in by DJB to serve the remaining deficient areas during this summer, an official said. The socio-economic survey of Delhi 2020 shows tapped water supply is available in 70.9% households while another 10.8% houses use drinking water from outside taps. Around 7.7% houses use bottled can water while another 5.04% depend on water tankers. Just around 1% (0.96%) of the population relies solely on hand pumps. A DJB official said supply of unpolluted raw water from the neighbouring states was necessary for uninterrupted supply to houses. DJB sources 612MGD water from Haryana and 254MGD from Uttar Pradesh while the rest comes from subsurface sources like tubewells and ranney wells. Additionally, 220 MGD water is sourced through Bhakhra-Nangal storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-depends-on-two-states-to-meet-90-of-potable-water-need/articleshow/83555488.cms||---

While commenting on BJP leader A N Radhakrishnan’s statement that “the chief minister will be sent to jail and then his children will have to meet him there”, Vijayan said, “BJP had issued even bigger threats and I had slept at my home itself during those occasions.” The message is clear from BJP that it is threatening a system which has launched a probe in a case in which they are involved, said Vijayan while referring to Kodakara hawala case in which the role of several BJP leaders are alleged. “The threat is that the chief minister should take the initiative to end the investigation or else the chief minister will have to face its consequences. The threat is even more serious when a leader claims that the chief minister’s children will also be sent to jail,” said Vijayan. “Since I am a chief minister now, I have several kinds of security cover and protection. But there was a period when I had nothing and then the BJP had come out with such and even bigger threats. I slept at my home even during those days. So such threats will not affect me,” he said. “It has to be understood that there is an investigation going on in a major case (gold smuggling). There was no report till today that either the state government or the chief minister had interfered in the probe or had tried to scuttle the investigation. Now the threat is that the people in the government will be trapped with the ongoing investigation,” the CM said. The government and the chief minister had faced such threats earlier too. They had several intentions when the probe was launched. But nothing had worked. That was the reason why the BJP leaders have started coming out with threats, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-flays-bjp-leader-for-threatening-him/articleshow/83555494.cms||---

This is exactly the route taken by BTech final year student Anuj Banka to get his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Banka, a student of a Bangalore institute, who is now at home due to the pandemic, had been desperately trying to book a slot for himself, but without any success. He came across an initiative by Project Life Force (PLF) assuring a jab after donating blood. “I donated blood on June 1 and got my first dose five days later. This is a wonderful initiative where I helped an ailing persons while getting the vaccine for myself,” said Banka. Banka had donated blood at Tata Medical Centre and PLF that has tied up with Techno India Dama Hospital had assured his vaccine slot at the hospital’s vaccination centre. Jeniffer Desai, another Kolkata resident, too, got her vaccine slot under this initiative. “We hope more people respond to this initiative. There still is an acute shortage of blood,” said Ajay Mittal of PLF. Coinciding with the World Blood Donors’ Day on Monday, AMRI Hospitals launched a similar initiative, offering slots to people who donate blood at their blood bank. Ritam Chakraborty, head, transfusion medicine and blood bank at AMRI Hospitals, Dhakuria, said, “Keeping in mind the shortage of blood, we had to come up with this unique idea.” “Anybody donating blood will receive a confirmed vaccination slot at any of our hospital’s three units,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/give-blood-and-get-jab-initiative-by-city-hosps/articleshow/83555471.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A similar trend was witnessed on the first two Bada Mangal – a festival celebrated in Lucknow on all Tuesdays of the Jyestha month of the Hindu calendar. According to LMC records, at least 72 groups and individuals voluntarily donated wheat, pulses, vegetables and fruits after registering themselves on the online portal ‘mangalam.in’ which was specially started by LMC for the purpose. Earlier, devotees used to organize bhandaras (community feast) for the poor. However, for the last two years, such gatherings have been discontinued in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The portal provides a platform to the people who cannot organise bhandaras but still want to serve the needy. LMC has set up eight community kitchens where food packets are prepared for distribution in several areas, including hospitals. About 1,000 food packets are being distributed daily. On Tuesday, the number increased to over 1,500. In a press statement, LMC said food packets were distributed in 34 localities including Hazratganj, Munshipulia, Alambagh, Parivartan Chowk, Raqabganj, Keshavnagar and Aliganj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lmc-kitchens-get-grains-veggies/articleshow/83557963.cms||---

The posts are deans of academics, research, recruitment and admissions. “The post of dean has been defined in the UP State Universities Act, 1973, along with the eligibility, powers and duties. A post of dean created by amending LU statutes will violate the Act because appointment on such a post will be based on the vice-chancellor’s discretion,” the resolution stated. “The statutes already allow the VC to appoint an officer on special duty and coordinator or director for various assignments and projects for administrative/academic convenience,” it added. On Friday, LUTA had written to the chancellor and governor Anandiben Patel, requesting her to reject the Lucknow University executive council’s proposal for including four posts in Chapter 11A of the statutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/luta-for-revocation-of-proposal-to-appoint-four-deans/articleshow/83557997.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Nearly 20k coaching classes shut down in 15 months||PUNE: Coaching classes, especially those training students for board examinations, have taken a big hit due to the lockdown with as many as 20,000 of the one lakh institutes across Maharashtra shutting down over financial problems. The Maharashtra Coaching Classes Action Committee, a collective of six major coaching associations, has decided to start operations of coaching classes from June 21. The associations said if theatres and malls are allowed to reopen at 50% capacity then their educational institutions should also be given priority and classes should be given permission to function with the same restrictions. President of Coaching Classes Teachers’ Federation and Social Forum of Maharashtra Bandopant Bhuyar said, “Since the last 15 months, our classes have been shut completely. This gave rise to a major financial crunch among the owners and they found it difficult to pay the salaries of the faculty members and non-teaching staff. The rent for the premises also became a burden and to top all these there were recurring expenses such as daily expenses, light and water bills among others. Many could not pay these bills and were forced to shut down forever.” The president of Maharashtra Class Owners’ Association Santosh Vaskar said, “Many coaching class owners had to sell off the movable assets and pay rent for the premises and yet they failed to sustain the effort. Talks with the government to allow operations have failed and now the owners are losing patience.” President of the Association of coaching Institutes in Nagpur Rajnikant Bondre said they could follow a hybrid model where some subjects could be taught online and some offline to avoid crowding. “Considering all the rules and regulations, we intend to start offline coaching from June 21 across Maharashtra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-20k-coaching-classes-shut-down-in-15-months/articleshow/83558007.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Thane||Thane: Biker dies after plunging into unguarded pit||THANE: A 26-year-old gym trainer from Diva died after his bike plunged into an unguarded 12 feet deep water-filled trench in the middle of a road in Thane early Tuesday. Thane police said the biker, identified as Prasad Deulkar, was on his way home after staying at a relative’s place the previous night. Locals, who witnessed the bike disappear into the crater, alerted the Wagle Estate police and municipal officials. Times ViewThe swift arrest of the contractor is welcome, but it's not enough. The Thane civic body cannot shrug off its responsibility. It should have ensured works were completed in time. The reason contractors are brazen enough to not even put up barricades is the lack of accountability. Now, after the arrest, enforce accountability and prosecute the offender as well as civic officials who looked the other way.Deulkar was fished out after a two-hour rescue operation, but police said he had lost consciousness as his head had possibly hit exposed underground utility pipes. He was later declared dead by doctors. Police have arrested the Mumbai-based contractor as initial investigation revealed there were no barricades at the spot. The municipal corporation has also started a probe. Santosh Kadam, chief of the regional disaster management cell at Thane, said the incident occurred around 6 am on the service road along the Eastern Express Highway, near Cadbury junction. The road was dug up for construction of a culvert, but the work wasn’t completed before the monsoon despite a warning issued by the municipal commissioner recently. “The biker might have been speeding and perhaps failed to notice the pit as there were no barricades to warn motorists. He suffered massive head injuries and by the time he was brought out, he had lost consciousness and was later declared dead,” senior inspector D Dhole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-biker-dies-after-plunging-into-unguarded-pit/articleshow/83555520.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Maratha youths flay Maoists, say no to their joining offer||NAGPUR: Rejecting the Maoist offer to join them, the youths under the aegis of Maratha Yuva Sangh here have flayed them for killing the innocent people and resorting to violence for their vested interests. After the Supreme Court struck down Maratha reservation in Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) secretary recently released pamphlets calling youths from the community to join them in their armed fight against the government to get justice. In a press communiqué, the organization stated that the Maratha community members believed in peaceful demonstrations and since the last few years, it had been organizing several such rallies involving thousands of its members on the reservation issue. “Even when a large number of young people from the community came together, they never resorted to any violence. The Maratha society considers people of all castes, religions, creeds and sects in the country as its own. We also respect the Constitution of India, and have immense faith in the system,” Maratha Yuva Sangh president Mahesh Mahadik said. Adding that the Naxalite movement didn’t believe in the Constitution framed by Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, he said people with such thoughts and traditions had now started advising the Maratha community. “Who has benefited from Maoists armed violence till date is a matter of research. Instead of preaching the Maratha community, they should work for the uplift of the tribal, backward and Dalit communities. They should immediately stop killing police, who sacrificed everything for protecting the people, and allow the government to develop the remote and backward areas,” Mahadik said.

---||Delhi||Cong claims AAP govt failed to start supply through pipelines laid long ago||New Delhi: Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) president Chaudhary Anil Kumar on Tuesday alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party government has failed to start water supply through the pipelines laid in many colonies long ago — during the Congress regime in the capital. He claimed that this is resulting in acute water shortage in Delhi. He also claimed that only 2.2% of Delhiites get round-the-clock water supply in the city, which has been a legacy continuing since the time of the Congress government. He said most residential areas get intermittent water supply, while slum clusters and unauthorised colonies have to depend on water tankers. He also said that the Kejriwal government has been unable to get more water to Delhi than what it has been receiving earlier. He said Kejriwal is promising to replicate the ‘Delhi Model’ of development, even though Delhiites are thirsting for water as the mercury soars. Delhi government couldn’t be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: 43-year-old bank manager won over Covid but lost sight||LUCKNOW: A 43-year-old bank manager from Gonda, Jeetendra Mishra survived Covid-19 but lost both his eyes to mucormycosis—commonly known as black fungus. He had contracted the disease during treatment. Mishra, a lively person before he lost his eyesight, now seldom talks. He has become reclusive but his family says he is still as determined as he used to be. There are many such patients who beat Covid-19 but grappled with black fungus soon after. Despite being rushed to a medical facility for treatment, many lost their eyesight, owing to the lack of knowledge around the rare disease. Many also lost part of their nose, facial or jaw tissues when the fungus gnawed on their insides. Several are still admitted, waiting for parts of their face or an important organ to be removed. Mishra had contracted Covid-19 in early May and had recovered in just a week. In home isolation, he did not need an oxygen cylinder though he was put on steroids. “Five days after his recovery, he started getting a headache, affecting one side of his head. This was followed by redness and swelling around his eyes. Two days later, he had lost eyesight,” said Mishra’s brother-in-law Narendra. “Jeetendra is holding on to hope that his eyesight will return. The family is also motivating him though doctors have said that it is an irreversible damage. Surprisingly, because of his will power, his right eye that was immovably shut has started to open a little,” said Pathak. Shravasti resident Inamullah, admitted at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), is looking forward to his eye surgery. Little does he know though that the surgery is not to recover his lost eyesight, but to completely remove the eyeball from its socket. “He had tested negative for Covid-19 on April 12 but his eye function started to get affected. The tissue around his nose has been removed and sent for further testing. He has lost complete eyesight in the right eye. The left eye is also affected,” said his son Ehsan. Shashank Vajpai (42) from Sitapur has also had to give up his eye due to the disease’s impact. The onset of symptoms was similar to that of others. Following surgery at a private superspecialty facility in Lucknow, Shashank is left with one eye, no sinus and little nasal tissue. “My brother is holding on somehow. It is depressing to see what he had to go through. His eyeball had to be taken out else it would have affected more organs,” said his brother Mayank. “Whenever someone calls or visits, we guide them around what and how much Shashank knows about his health and how much can be discussed with him. The disease has changed our lives fully,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-43-year-old-bank-manager-won-over-covid-but-lost-sight/articleshow/83558045.cms||Yusra Husain

As part of this, the party would organize dharnas at 15,000 centres at 11am on Wednesday. BJP core-committee members staged a sit-in in front of Palayam Martyrs’ Square on Tuesday against the alleged witch hunt of the government against BJP leaders. BJP former state president Kummanam Rajasekharan, who inaugurated the dharna, said that CPM was using cheap tactics since it lacked strength to take on BJP directly. “The attempts to implicate state president K Surendran by registering a case against him on the basis of a statement of a person who withdrew his nomination on his own in the assembly election shows how weak CPM has turned out to be. CPM is doing this because it identifies BJP, not Congress, as its main opponent,” he said. BJP state vice-president A N Radhakrishnan said that the state was experiencing an undeclared emergency under the LDF rule. He accused the state government of conspiring against political workers and claimed that Pinarayi Vijayan’s police had tried to wrongly implicate BJP leaders in Kodakara hawala case. “If Pinarayi Vijayan plans to put K Surendran in jail, he will not sleep in his house for long. He will have to go to jail to meet (his) children,” he said. Senior BJP leader P K Krishnadas said many leaders were of the opinion that BJP leaders and cadres need not cooperate with the Kodakara investigation, unless the police have obtained necessary permission to question them. “LDF and UDF leaders have stooped to a level where they don’t have any qualms in promoting even anti-nationalism as part of their anti-BJP stance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/alleged-witch-hunt-bjp-to-step-up-protests/articleshow/83555540.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Family goes on outing; bodies of woman & son found 35km apart||PUNE: The Bharati Vidyapeeth police found the body of a six-year-old boy at Jambhulwadi off the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass on Tuesday evening while his mother’s body was found by Saswad police in the afternoon at Khalad village near Veer dam, nearly 35km away, four days after they had left the city along with the woman’s husband for an outing. Police said the husband, a manager with a private insurance company, was still missing. The Lohegaon-based family had left on the outing on June 11 in a self-driven SUV hired by the man for 3-4 days. They were supposed to return on Monday night. The Saswad police said the woman (30) was found murdered with her throat slit. She was wearing a T-shirt and track pants. An officer said she was murdered somewhere else and her body was dumped at Khalad , nearly 45km from Pune. Some villagers spotted the body and alerted the police. Senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station said the boy’s body was found near an eatery“He was strangled to death. Some local residents spotted the body and alerted the police,” he said. Kalaskar said, “The woman’s husband had hired the SUV and left for the outing on June 11. The SUV was found abandoned at Market Yard on Satara road around Monday midnight. The relatives had contacted the car company, which helped them trace the SUV. Blood stains were found on the vehicle’s seat.” The officer said the couple had informed their relatives that they would return on Monday. “The last call with the relatives was on Monday morning. Subsequently, the couple stopped answering calls. The relatives then approached different police stations, including Market Yard. They had photographs of the family members. After finding the boy’s body on Tuesday evening, we called the relatives to the spot and they identified him,” Kalaskar said. “In the meantime, we came to know that the Saswad police had found the body of a woman. We contacted them and shared the family’s photographs. The Saswad police confirmed it was the same woman,” he said. Kalaskar said it was not yet known where the family members had gone after June 11 and where the crimes occurred. “Things will become clear once the woman’s husband is located,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/family-goes-on-outing-bodies-of-woman-son-found-35km-apart/articleshow/83558036.cms||---
---||Delhi||Corporations not ready for rains in Delhi: AAP||NEW DELHI: AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak has accused BJP-led corporations of doing little preparations before monsoon. He claimed that only 20% of desilting work had been completed, which might lead to waterlogging in the city. “Monsoon is approaching in Delhi but BJP’s MCD has not cleaned drains, which may result in waterlogging. If waterlogging happens in the city and someone dies, then BJP will be responsible,” said Pathak. “Last year, a child died due to waterlogging in the Karol Bagh while many jhuggis were washed away. In Delhi, around 90% of drains are under the jurisdiction of the MCD. Majority of them are in residential areas and the reason behind repeated waterlogging is that these drains are not cleaned,” said Pathak. North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash, however, claimed that more than 99% of desilting work had been completed in north Delhi areas.“Why are they not disclosing the desilting status of major drains falling in the jurisdiction of PWD, DSIIDC, DJB and Irrigation and Flood Control department? While MCD drains in residential areas are desilted throughout the year and work is going on at war footing on major ones, PWD and other Delhi government departments are yet to get silt lifted from several places in east, south and north Delhi,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Pathak should stop misinformation campaign on drains’ cleaning. “MCDs have by and large completed cleaning of small drains falling under their jurisdiction while major drains and nallahas like Barapullah and Najafgarh drains have not been cleaned by Delhi government’s departments because of which there was heavy waterlogging on most roads after pre-monsoon showers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-corpns-not-ready-for-rains/articleshow/83558068.cms||---
---||Pune||From lend-a-phone to doorstep learning, Pune ZP shows the way||Pune: Pune Zilla Parishad has 2.26 lakh students on the rolls of which 37,263 students do not have cellphones or internet access, as per official figures. But education officers in various talukas have come up with their own methods to reach out to their students. When online classes could not be accessed by nearly 9,000 children in their taluka, Indapur gram panchayat’s education department came up with a simple yet innovative solution— Lend-a-mobile. Various gram panchayat members and others in the village give their cellphones every week for some time to these students for studies. ToI had reported in March that over 2,000 videos related to all subjects and chapters for Standards I to VIII were uploaded by teachers from Indapur schools. They have had over 2000 subscribers and crossed one lakh views. “I have a list of 3,800 people who helped students by lending their cellphones. This activity was carried out from July to November after which physical classes were allowed. Now, we are planning to restructure this scheme. For example, it is not good for students in standards I to IV to have the cellphones to themselves. We have devised a plan so that the parents can use the cellphone and ask questions. Secondly, there is a lethargy among students when it comes to online classes. We have a plan to use online classes interspersed with offline classes so that groups of 3-4 students in one area can be taught together for an hour or so,” RR Bamane, Indapur extension officer for ZP, told TOI. Jyoti Parihar, deputy education officer, at Pune Zilla Parishad said the ZP has decided to create groups for students without online access. “The teachers will go to these groups, give activity sheets and teach for a few hours every week. Volunteers too will be roped in to assist in teaching. Since there is a delay in receiving textbooks, we have told all teachers to retrieve last year’s textbooks from students and distribute them this year to the new batch till new textbooks arrive,” said Parihar. head: Going That Extra Mile Bhor taluka under the Pune ZP’s jurisdiction has come up with a creative curriculum with a blend of online and doorstep education They have a dedicated task force of school teachers and have a plan to implement learning even during the pandemic. They found that too many PDFs were being circulated and it was hard to monitor them They wanted the curriculum to give equal importance to art and craft, academics as well as physical activities So they designed a curriculum and implemented it for two months after which the schools were shut They decided to have an online component and go for a completely offline mode of teaching For this academic year, a team of 110 teachers has created weekly activity sheets for each class The teacher will give it to the students at their homes and collect it at the end of the week quote The teachers have also been told to keep all the data, such as data of evaluation, the performance of activities in a file, and also give a copy to the students. We can monitor the performance of the children, what topics they are finding difficult and what more can be done to help them.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: History wrapped in seepage and peeling of plaster||LUCKNOW: Located in the heart of the city, the 19th century protected monument, Shahnajaf Imambara, is a victim of apathy and neglect. With monsoon already here, the over 200-year-old monument, especially its central dome, needs immediate repair for seepage and crumbling of plaster. Shahnajaf Imambara also houses the grave of Ghaziuddin Haider, the first ruler of Awadh who built the monument in 1816-17. According to experts, antique Belgian chandeliers adorn the main hall of the Imambara and if they get affected due to poor upkeep, it would not be possible to replace them. Spokesperson of All India Shia Muslim Personal Law Board, Maulana Yasoob Abbas, recently visited the Imambara and highlighted its poor condition. On Monday, a representation was sent to the superintending archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Lucknow circle, by heritage activist Mohammad Haider for repair of the monument. “It is unfortunate that the Imambara is being neglected by authorities and not being repaired and renovated. The monument is to be protected by the Husainabad & Allied Trust (HAT) and the Nawabs had left money for its renovation. Still, the monument is being neglected,” he said. “The dome has seepage and the plaster is peeling off. Due to this, the structure may weaken and crumble which will be a huge loss. If the antique chandeliers get damaged, it will be not be possible to replace them,” he added. “If HAT, which comes under the district administration, cannot look after renovation work, the monument should be handed back to the Shia community. We will preserve our religious places overtaken by the administration,” he added. Haider also highlighted the importance of the monument both to religion and history. “Under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, the ASI is duty bound to ensure preservation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/history-wrapped-in-seepage-and-peeling-of-plaster/articleshow/83558096.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Mucormycosis treatment drains financial resources of families in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Much like Covid-19 treatment, treatment for mucormycosis too has drained off financial resources of many families, mid-way through the treatment. These patients then are being redirected to government hospitals. In most of the cases, patients are redirected to government hospitals only after undergoing surgeries at private hospitals, saying that the hospital cannot supply them with the mandatory anti-fungal injections unless they remain admitted. “My father was operated for mucormycosis at a corporate hospital in the city and after removal of one eye and jaw, we were asked to go to the government hospital for anti-fungal injections or pay per day charges to remain admitted for the injections. First the Covid-19 treatment and now the treatment for mucormycosis has left us with no more resources,” said Sriranjani (name changed on request). In yet another case, a patient who was operated upon thrice and both the eyes were removed was later on discharged by the hospital when the family couldn’t pay any more. The patient was shifted to the state-run Gandhi hospital where he succumbed, said Y Pavan, the patient’s relative. In most such cases, private hospitals do not arrange for the necessary anti-fungal injections, leaving the patients to fend for themselves, citing unavailability of the injections. However, government authorities say that there is no shortage of injections currently and as per the official mechanism required to apply for anti-fungal injection amphotericin-B, hospitals need to send a list of the patients requiring this injection to the state health authrities, following which the injections are given. “Hospitals are reluctant to do daily follow-ups for patients who have already been drained of resources. In most cases, they would have already made lakhs in treatment and the injection doesn’t leave them with much scope of profits. While we do not encourage patients operated upon in private hospitals to be admitted in government hospitals, there is no option but to take them in. This, however, leads to blocking of beds just for the injection,” said an official from the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mucor-treatment-drains-financial-resources-of-families/articleshow/83555612.cms||---

A team of the Vadgaon Maval police, led by senior inspector Suresh Nimbalkar, took the suspect, Arif Shaikh (25) of Thergaon, into custody for murdering Kishore Londhe (25) and dumping his body into the river on January 1. “Londhe, Shaikh and a few friends had celebrated the year-end at Ardav village in Maval taluka. After consuming liquor, Londhe and Shaikh had a heated argument. Shaikh and others then bludgeoned him to death,” Nimbalkar said. He said the police did not have any clues about the victim. “We had sent his photograph to police stations in Pune Rural, Pimpri Chinchwad and Pune city. There was a similarity between the victim and a person reported missing at Khadak police station. We verified the victim’s DNA samples with his relatives but it did not match,” Nimbalkar said. Eventually, a tea stall owner from Market Yard identified the person in the photograph as Londhe on June 2. “He also informed us that Londhe stayed with his sister lately,” Nimbalkar said. The police then traced Londhe’s sister. She identified his clothes and rings. “She told us that Londhe was alcoholic and stayed away from home for months without informing them. So, no one bothered to approach the police,” Nimbalkar said. “We found that he was in contact with a cellphone number registered in a woman’s name. We also found that a suspect from Wadarwadi, recently released from jail, was also in contact with that cellphone number. We questioned him and found that Shaikh was using the cellphone,” Nimbalkar said. Nimbalkar said the police got information that the Wakad police had arrested Shaikh in February in a molestation case. “When we contacted the Wakad police, we found that the Buldhana district police had taken Shaikh into custody in a rape case,” he said. He said the police then went to Buldhana and found that Shaikh had revealed his involvement in Londhe’s murder to them. “The police had contacted the Wakad police. But, as there was no missing person’s complaint registered, the Buldhana district police did not probe further,” Nimbalkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-detect-murder-after-6-months-1-held/articleshow/83558087.cms||Mihir Tanksale

Two persons have been arrested and further investigation is on.” According to the police, an attempt was made to deface the nameplate at the residence of Singh. “No attack or physical assault has taken place on Hon'ble Member of Parliament,” Delhi Police tweeted. Sanjay Singh said his residence located in North Avenue was attacked by unidentified individuals and claimed that the attack was linked to his stand against alleged scam in purchase of a piece of land for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The MP has sought a probe by CBI and the Enforcement Directorate into the alleged scam. “I want to clearly tell the BJP government and its goons that no amount of attacks or even my death will deter me from exposing any scam in Ram temple. It is an insult to crores of Ram devotees who donated for the temple construction by ignoring even their most urgent financial needs.

At a recent meeting of the special task force chaired by the chief secretary, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and municipal corporations were directed to make time-bound action plans as per the plastic waste management (amended) rules 2016. DPCC and urban local bodies have been asked to develop a plastic waste monitoring dashboard on their website showing daily generation, collection, segregation, recycling, processing and disposal at landfills. The dashboard, which will help in identification of gaps in the entire process, has to be set up by month-end. “DPCC should make concerted efforts to ensure that all industrial units, which are functioning in Delhi and are falling within the purview of the Act, are registered within a prescribed time limit. DPCC should conduct awareness regarding registration of manufacturers, producers and recyclers to bring more producers into the registration net by August. Thereafter, DPCC should conduct a special enforcement drive in September and October against unregistered plastic manufacturing and recycling units,” said an official. The chief secretary, during the meeting, highlighted the importance of all stakeholders to work together and evolve a pragmatic action plan with clear timelines and responsibilities. “ULBs have been directed to assess gaps and submit a time-bound action plan to attain 100% segregation, collection, and recycling of recyclable fractions and processing of unrecyclable plastic waste fractions. Besides, ULBs have to constitute plastic waste task forces in each ULB headed by the respective commissioner and a plastic waste management cell in each ULB to closely monitor compliance of the rules,” according to the minutes of the meeting. The environment department will have to submit an action plan towards creation of public movement in consultation with MCDs and the education department by month-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/agencies-told-to-make-time-bound-plan-to-eliminate-single-use-plastic/articleshow/83558109.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

On Tuesday NIA officers visited the spot as part of an enquiry but they are yet to take formal action and the probe is still being conducted by the state police. The officers of anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of the state police too visited the spot. NIA has shown interest in the case owing to suspected terror links in this case. Three months ago, a search was conducted here based on an intelligence communique received from Tamil Nadu Police’s Q branch that people with terror links might be holed up in the forest here. They had sent this message based on information extracted from an extremist from Tamil Nadu, who was caught in Uttar Pradesh. Following this, forest department had also tightened vigil in this region. On Tuesday, one more gelatine stick was found around 35 metres away from the spot where explosives were found on Monday. On Monday morning, explosives were found by forest department officers at a cashew farm on forest land. As many as two gelatin sticks, six batteries, detonators and electrical wires were found from the spot. Tuesday's search operations were led by Range DIG (Thiruvananthapuram) K Sanjay Kumar Gurudin. Sniffer dogs were brought to comb the region inside a 2km radius around the spot along with members of the bomb detection and disposal squad. Speaking to TOI, DIG Gurudin said that the explosives appeared not more than a few weeks old. “'This area is part of a plantation that is frequented by workers. If the explosives were abandoned here several months ago the workers would have found it much earlier,” he said. It is also learned that the investigation of the case may be handed over to ATS. However, Gurudin said that the decision in this regard has to be taken by the state police chief and he is yet to take such a call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nia-officers-ats-arrive-after-explosives-found-in-pathanapuram/articleshow/83555710.cms||---

Patil is the main accused in the Rs 513-crore loan fraud-hit Karnala Nagari Sahakari Bank Ltd. ED will produce him in court on Wednesday. ED registered a money laundering case into alleged fraud at the bank. They arrested Vivekanand after questioning him on Tuesday after he refused to cooperate in investigations. ED assistant director Sunil Kumar, in his arrest order, stated that there was reason to believe Vivekanand, a resident of New Panvel, was guilty of money laundering. Vivekanand was arrested under sub-section (1) of section 19 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. ED sources Vivekanand is the key accused and he had used 65 forged accounts to siphon money from the bank with the help of fictitious transactions. ED’s investigation found he used part of that money to purchase properties for himself, family and for developing a stadium. Vivekanand has represented Panvel and Uran in the legislative assembly. He was chairman of the bank, Karnala Sports Academy and other institutions. He and 75 others were earlier booked by Panvel police after a cooperative department audit found him guilty of mismanagement of bank funds. The bank has 50,689 depositors with over Rs 524 crore deposits. The bank had given loans to 436 persons to the tune of Rs 562 crore. RBI had stopped its operations for close to a year-and-a-half.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-mla-nabbed-by-ed-in-karnala-bank-scandal/articleshow/83559732.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Pune||PMC may buy tablets with study material funds to help students||PUNE: The standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation has approved a proposal to buy tablets for needy students with the funds earmarked for uniforms, raincoats and other accessories they are provided. A final decision will be taken in the general body meeting before the process for procurement begins. A proposal was moved by former deputy mayor Siddharth Dhende who said that last year crores of rupees was earmarked to buy various school-related accessories in both 2019-20 and 2020-21 under the direct-benefittransfer scheme but remained unspent as schools remained closed due to Covid-19 pandemic. “With the budget allocated for uniforms, sweaters and shoes we can easily buy tablets and internet packs for the civic school students. A reasonable tablet if purchased in bulk can be bought at Rs 5,000, so 50,000 such tablets can be purchased at least for students from Standard IV onwards if we utilise the money unspent last year and this year,” said Dhende. “Online education is the need of the hour. So, we have approved this proposal as soon as it was tabled. The administration will decide about procurement,” Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee, said. He said tablets were procured by the civic body a few years ago for students, but they will have to ascertain how much they were utilised. Dhende said the municipal commissioner had responded to the idea and would meet the administrative staff to discuss it. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar did not respond to calls or messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-may-buy-tablets-to-help-students-access-online-learning/articleshow/83558113.cms||Ardhra Nair

Now, students who are waiting for their passport stamping and biometric updation want these to open as Covid -19 cases are declining. The commission took similar measures last year when VFS centres in the country were closed during the beginning of the pandemic, only to finally reopen in November 2020. A student who plans to go Canada for fall intake, said, “I got my passport request on April 30 and since then I am waiting for passport stamping, which has to be picked by VFS. As my passport has not been stamped, I cannot book flights right now when I can get cheaper deals.” Another student said, “Other embassies have opened their visa application centres for their services since June. Now, the Covid -19 situation is controlled and yet Canadian visa application centre is closed.” Immigration official Harkanwal Singh Dhuri said, “It normally took around two weeks for the passport to come back to students. Although there is no direct instruction regarding when the centres will reopen, once the services resume, VFS centres will waive the deadlines for passport submission and biometric collection (30 days and 90 days respectively). No further action will be required from applicants, and the letters they have received will be valid despite expired dates. The passport date is extended and many students are tweeting #OpenVFSGlobal and tagging Canadian High Commission as India has no direct role in this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/students-push-for-reopening-of-canadian-visa-centres/articleshow/83551060.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Excessive use of pesticides in riverbed farming threatens biodiversity in Hastinapur sanctuary||MEERUT: Fertile banks of the Ganga all across its course propels unhindered riverbed farming and use of vast quantities of pesticides that pose a great threat to the Gangetic biodiversity. The activity takes place all along the river’s course from Bijnor till Prayagraj and does not spare even the state’s largest state sanctuary -- Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (from Bijnor to Garh Mukteshwar) and Ramsar site (Garh to Narora). Notably, the sanctuary also witnesses conservation of river species, like gharials, Gangetic dolphins and turtles jointly organised by WWF India and UP forest division. Speaking with TOI, field officer of WWF India Sanjeev Yadav said, “Though we continuously sensitize farmers towards biodiversity and have even convinced them to become Ganga praharis thus becoming stakeholders in the conservation process, but the area is too vast to include everyone with limited resources. Pesticides enter the food chain of this biodiversity. Fish are the carriers of pollutants which are the food for gharials and dolphins. Then, riverbed farming also leads to destruction of turtle eggs. The adverse effect can drastically compromise the overall health of species.” According to Shyam Singh, a farmer, “We grow vegetables here which are prone to insect attack and are overpowered by weeds as well. So, we have to use glyphosate which is an herbicide and an insecticide also.” According to an official at the district agriculture office, “Farming on both sides of the river is an evil necessity particularly when pesticides and other chemicals are used as it affects the river ecology. However, an organic farming belt will come up on both sides of the river in Uttar Pradesh. State horticulture and Jal Shakti departments are rolling out a plan to convert a five-km radius on both sides of the river into an organic farming belt. Under this plan, farmers will be discouraged to use chemicals in the form of fertilisers, insecticides or pesticides and only organic ways will be encouraged to not only have healthy crops but also prevent pollution in Ganga.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/excessive-use-of-pesticides-in-riverbed-farming-threatens-biodiversity-in-hastinapur-sanctuary/articleshow/83553493.cms||Sandeep Rai

In less than a week, three of the nine cases of fraud involving a sum of Rs 2 lakh were solved and Rs 1.15 lakh retrieved and credited back to the victims’ bank accounts. In contrast in 2020, a total of 49 cases of cyber fraud involving over Rs 1 crore were registered in the district, of which only 12% could be recovered. Abhishek Yadav, SSP Muzaffarnagar, said, “Earlier, it used to be a lengthy process wherein a victim would approach a thana from where a report would go to cyber cell, resulting in loss of crucial time. Many times, victims would not report to avoid the lengthy process and slim chances of recovery. As per bank rules, if the crime is reported within 24-48 hours, there is a high chance of reversing the entry. A single window approach at the dedicated cycber crime centre enables a victim to report the crime without hassles.” People can also lodge a complaint on a dedicated phone number, 9454401617. The cyber crime centre is manned by 10 police personnel, including two inspectors. It is housed in two buildings—the one at the main police office where the SSP sits deals with the public while administrative work, records, etc are situated at crime branch building. Sanjay Kumar of New Mandi who had lost Rs 20,000 to a fraudster pretending to be a relative said, “I approached the cyber crime cell and lodged a complaint, and after an investigation, my money was credited back into my bank account.” Another victim of cyber fraud, Pinku Kumar of Mansoorpur village said, “ Someone withdrew Rs 69,000 using my debit card to make an online purchase. The cyber crime police contacted the online seller and it cancelled the order placed using my debit card. And money was returned to my account.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mngrs-new-cyber-crime-centre-solves-3-of-9-cases-in-4-days/articleshow/83553483.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The woman allegedly spent time with him in a hotel, and later demanded Rs 15 lakh to not publish a video of their intimate moments. Narendra Patel, 45, a resident of Kudasan in Gandhinagar, runs a photocopy and printing shop in Sector 11. On Sunday he filed a complaint with Sector 21 police stating that about two months ago a woman who identified herself as Payal came to his shop to get printouts of documents which she sent to his mobile phone. “When I gave her the printed documents and gave her back her change, she smiled and said bye. She then started sending me messages and we started chatting,” Patel stated in the FIR. After some time, she sent Patel a message asking him to meet her at Infocity. They later booked a room at Hotel Haveli using Patel’s documents. After spending some time there, they left. Patel stated in his FIR that they did not contact each other for about 15 days after that. Later, Payal along with a man named Vanraj called him over the phone and alleged that he had raped Payal. They demanded that Patel pay Rs 15 lakh or they would publish a video of his encounter with her on social media. “I got disturbed and disconnected the phone. I also did not have money they were demanding,” stated Patel. “On June 11, Payal and Vanraj came to my house and in the presence of my wife and mother and showed me the video. I got very scared, but my family told me that I should not succumb to such blackmail. My friends also supported me and encouraged me to file a complaint,” stated Patel. On June 13, Patel filed a complaint with Gandhinagar police for extortion, criminal conspiracy and abetment against the woman and the man who identified himself as Vanraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-15l-demand-woman-blackmails-shop-owner/articleshow/83555617.cms||---

As per the cumulative data shared by IMD, 10 of the 12 rain gauge stations in the state recorded rainfall exceeding 10cm. On Monday, Pernem received the highest rainfall of 180mm, followed by over 50mm rainfall (from 8.30am to 8.30pm) on Tuesday, resulting in over 200mm of rainfall thus exceeding 20cm. Mapusa received 111mm on Monday and 46.5mm on Tuesday and Old Goa received 129mm on Monday followed by 30mm on Tuesday. The rainfall activity on Tuesday was comparatively lesser than Monday. The IMD has issued an orange alert for Wednesday, continuing with the warning for heavy to very heavy rainfall. The heavy showers kept the fire and emergency services on their toes as the continuous downpour led to uprooting of trees and damage to structures at many places. On Tuesday, the fire services control room received 13 calls for tree falls and three for animal rescues. Of these, there was a buffalo rescued after having fallen into a well in Kudnem, Bicholim. Similarly, a dog that had fallen into a well in Loutolim was rescued. Yet another dog was rescued from a trench in Muslimwaddo, Bicholim. However, There were no calls for human rescue or flooded homes, as of 10pm on Tuesday. Sources in the fire and emergency services, Margao, said that a tree fell across the road near Cine Vishant, Aquem, thus blocking traffic for some time before the fire brigade personnel arrived and cleared the road. A tree also fell on the busy road at Malbhat, Margao, thus disrupting traffic. The road was later cleared of the tree. Rainwater entered a hotel at Agalli. Services of fire brigade personnel were requisitioned and the water was pumped out. Meanwhile, at Murida, Salcete, a fire broke out in a bungalow owned by Shriganesh Sangodkar causing loss of over Rs 4 lakh.

On Monday afternoon, while dashing home to catch a quick meal, he noticed a crowd swelling around a girl's body. Overcome by curiosity, Madanpal parked the motorcycle and pushed his way through the gathering. He suddenly fell to his knees, yelled, “it’s my daughter” and fell unconscious. Just a few hours ago, at their home in Moradabad’s Surajnagar village, a beaming Meenakshi Singh alias Teena (19) had bid goodbye to her father while he was leaving to distribute the cards. In between, she got a call from her fiancé, Jitin, who wanted to take her out for shopping. But he had other plans. Jitin allegedly strangled Meenakshi to death at a deserted stretch. “Although in love” he never wanted to marry her. Jitin was arrested on Tuesday. During questioning, the accused told police that he didn’t want to marry Meenakshi and was trying to call off the wedding, which led to an argument and he killed her. According to her family, Meenakshi Jitin had asked Meenajshi to reach the market for shopping. The girl’s mother accompanied her till the bus stand, oblivious of the youth’s plan. Her father, Madanpal, was in a neighbouring village to distribute the cards. And a few hours later, the father found her body on the road in Moradabad’s Thakurdwara area. Madanpal said, “I had fixed my daughter’s marriage with Jitin as they both knew each other. On June 6, we gave gifts during a pre- wedding ceremony. But Jitin’s family members were not happy as they wanted more money. Jitin had even asked to postpone the marriage but it was not possible as we had distributed the cards and booked the venue as well.” Superintendent of police (rural) Vidyasagar Mishra told TOI, “We have registered an FIR against Jitin under the section of murder. He has been arrested. During questioning, he said that he didn’t want to marry the girl which is why he took such a step. The couple was getting married on June 20. We are trying to identify if anyone else was involved in the murder along with Jitin.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-coming-home-after-distributing-invitation-cards-for-daughters-wedding-finds-her-body-on-the-road/articleshow/83553500.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Amid pandemic, St Xavier’s to use 50-50 exam grading pattern||MUMBAI: As the new academic session kicks in this week, students at St Xavier’s College will be awarded grades based on a 50-50 exam evaluation pattern. The college has decided to reduce the dependency on exams based on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). From the 60-40 pattern of assessment, where 60 marks were for semester-end exams and 40 for internals, the college has moved to a 50-50 pattern, albeit only for the pandemic period.St Xavier’s College has been toying with the idea for some time but got an approval from the governing board recently. “Since internal evaluation will be for 50 marks now, teachers have the liberty to introduce new components. We are now encouraging them to include case studies in internal assessments,” said principal Rajendra Shinde. TOI had earlier reported how a few autonomous colleges are looking at evaluating students in mu-ltiple ways throughout the year in internal exams, to reduce the reliance on MCQs. Jai Hind College will be holding a workshop to share the best practices among departments and seek feedback from the students on the assessment pattern, said principal Ashok Wadia. Many colleges are plann-ing to have a combination of subjective and MCQ-based questions for postgraduate exams. While not many autonomous colleges have opted for a change in the weightage at this stage for undergraduate courses, several are planning to include case studies in internal assessments. After a seminar by Mumbai University, many autonomous colleges are planning to incorporate community-engagement case studies in their internal assessments. Jai Hind and Nagindas Khandwala College have been using case studies for some time now. Ravindra Kulkarni, pro-vice-chancellor of Mumbai University, said that the idea to have community engagement projects in the curriculum has been floated by the UGC and the All-India Council for Technical Education. “These can be offered as an elective programme in affiliated colleges. Students can earn two credits for the same,” said Kulkarni. Giving examples, he said, commerce students can opt for a project on the budget of a local municipal body or chemistry students can choose a water quality assessm-ent project of a lake. While autonomous colleges can include it in internal assessm-ents, for affiliated colleges, the programme is yet to get a nod from the university’s academic council, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-amid-pandemic-st-xaviers-to-use-50-50-exam-grading-pattern/articleshow/83559462.cms||Yogita Rao

The programme, which is at its preliminary stage, has already been introduced at a few prisons in other parts of the country. With the state’s largest prison not accepting visitors for over a year due to the pandemic — prisoners are only allowed telephonic calls with permission from the jail’s authorities — the e-mulakhat facility is expected to resolve most issues, a jail official said. Full-fledged introduction of the initiative has been delayed due to connectivity issues caused by the ongoing highway expansion work and cyclone Tauktae, the official said. E-mulakhat requires computers, a sound system, and kiosks within the prison. The official, however, said that it would not be effective unless the connectivity issue is sorted out. “Ours is the only prison in the state, and so the facility has been extended to us. Although it was started prior to the enforcement of Covid-19 restrictions, it was halted due to connectivity issues,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-colvale-prison-inmates-can-meet-kin-friends-virtually/articleshow/83555667.cms||---

Following the corona-induced lockdown in April and May 2020, the sanctuary was closed for till October. When it reopened, there was a lack of tourists. Not many slots were booked even on weekends and holidays. The officials said that from last October to June 15 this year, Gir Sanctuary recorded an income of Rs 2.4 crore, including Rs 13 lakh earned in April. During the same period, the income from Devaliya Interpretation Zone was Rs 2.7 crore, including Rs 7.83 lakh collected in April. The officials said that during the financial year from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021, the sanctuary’s income was only Rs 7 crore which was 36% less compared to financial year 2019-2020. The officials said that income of jeep owners and even guides registered a similar decline. A jeep owner refusing to be quoted said that the income this year has registered a 50% decline and drivers are finding it hard to survive. Many of the drivers are switching to other professions to make a living. Jumabhai Kartiya, sarpanch of Sasan village, said, “The drivers and guides of the sanctuary are in real bad shape. The entire tourist season has ended on Thursday. On Monday, Tourism Minister Jawahar Chavda was in the area to flag off five tourist buses in Devaliya. So, we requested him to make a representation to the government to start lion tourism in Devaliya soon so that drivers and guides get some income.” Kartiya said the minister has promised to talk to the government. He said that the drivers have turned labourers and are now employed in clearing forest areas of trees which were uprooted during Tauktae cyclone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gir-sanctuary-closed-revenue-down-by-36/articleshow/83558189.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Wholesale markets and popular places like Sarojini Nagar continue to be on the path of recovery. Traders’ associations say the recovery rate is much better than that of last year’s unlock period. Ashok Randhawa of the Sarojini Nagar market traders’ association said, “On Monday we had around 25% of the normal footfall while it has increased by 10% on the second day. Pleasant weather in early morning and evening hours helped a lot.” The association had earlier urged the authorities to extend the evening curfew timings. Randhawa sought more civil defence volunteers. Murali Mani, who heads the traders’ welfare association at Karol Bagh’s Ajmal Khan Road market, however, called the footfall low. “Only around 10% of the normal customer footfall has resumed. We remain closed on Monday, our weekly off.” Mani said they were facing problems in getting some workers vaccinated due to vaccine shortage. He also demanded a short-term rollback of pedestrianisation of the market road. In Old Delhi, Sanjay Bhargava, head of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that the number of actual buyers had reduced. “The roadside vendors have come back, increasing the crowd, but the mask compliance is over 95%.” In south Delhi, Nageshwar Singh of Anupam Complex market near Saket said the market was returning back to normalcy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unlock-day-2-heat-keeps-shoppers-away-again/articleshow/83558199.cms||---

This, said a government spokesperson, will help avoid unnecessary demolitions and cutting of trees for development projects. A government spokesperson said that Ayodhya Municipal Corporation had requested the centre to help with the mapping, which was carried out using the LiDAR technology. Roads were identified for widening and the report sent to the department concerned. “Work has been planned in such a way that there will be no need to unnecessarily cut trees and demolish houses. Only those trees and houses will be removed that have been marked,” said the spokesperson. He added that GIS and GPR technology-based surface and underground utility mapping is also being done by the centre for the development of Moradabad Smart City. Mapping of underground water supply, sewerage lines and other underground lines is also going to ensure smooth water supply in Moradabad. “The data and maps prepared will be given to the technical staff of the departments related to the Smart Cities project. This will help in quick rectification of technical faults in underground pipelines,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sensors-to-map-save-trees-from-chopping-for-ayodhya-projects/articleshow/83558182.cms||---

The announcement has caused worries over no e-passes being issued—as it happened earlier—leading to harassment at check posts. But an officer assured people out on roads for genuine reasons would not be stopped. “We are working on the e-pass software so that it can issue the travel document to all the newly exempted category employees of private offices, restaurants and malls as well as to sportspersons and film and TV technicians. People requiring passes have to apply on coronapass.kolkatapolice.org,” an officer said. A traffic officer said the new version of the e-pass application portal would be available by Wednesday morning. By Tuesday evening, 6,000 fresh applications were submitted and the number is likely to cross 15,000 the next day. “Processing such a large number of applications may take time,” said an officer. But senior officers at Lalbazar clarified e-passes would not be available to all and asked commuters to carry an authorization letter from employers in addition to ID cards. “There are certain criteria for which documents have to be furnished while applying. Those engaged in the private sector have to submit a document saying his services are required during the restrictions. Similarly, those working in restaurants have to provide vaccination proof. Without the documents, the application will be rejected,” said an officer. Those heading to bank are required to carry a passbook while those going to vaccination centres have to show their Co-Win registration. Similarly, those going to the airport and stations will have to produce tickets. Those who had applied but did not get a pass remained sceptical and feared cops would give another excuse to issue the travel document. “Unlike last year, e-passes have rarely been issued this time and complaints of rejections have been high. Some pointed at technical issues that made the application process cumbersome...” wrote a citizen, Luna Roy, on Facebook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-tweak-e-pass-portal-to-include-exempted-categories/articleshow/83555696.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops pass Day 1 test as flyover razing work starts||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) officially commenced the work of dismantling the Vivekananda Road flyover, also known as Posta flyover, from Tuesday. Officials performed a small puja ceremony before starting the work in the 115-metre stretch (Nawab Lane-Posta Crossing) of Strand Road (North). This is part of a total of 250-metre-long stretch of the flyover from near Old Mint to Posta Market on Strand Road, which will be pulled down in the first phase of work within a time frame of two months. The first day passed off without major challenges for both the KMDA and Kolkata traffic police. The first-day test of a traffic diversion around Strand Road (North) was passed by the Howrah Bridge traffic guard as it channeled vehicles onto Maharshi Debendra Road, which runs parallel to Strand Road. The vehicles then used Kali Krishna Tagore Street to move further north. “No vehicle had to be diverted to MG Road given that public transport was not plying,” said a senior officer. “We have planned a few minor changes on the ground when trucks begin to enter Posta at night. We have sought the help of Vidyasagar traffic guard and Shyambazar traffic guard to help us in the diversions from Hastings and BT Road respectively,” he added. Meanwhile, KMDA revealed its work plan for the next five days. “For the next few days, all the machines and equipment will be assembled and fixed at the spot to provide necessary support system. Once this is finalized — including ensuring necessary safety and other structural issues — the super structure will be slowly pulled down from June 20 onwards by breaking small portions one after another and bringing it down with the help of cranes. Advanced tools will be used to ensure only minimum sound and pollution during the dismantling work that will be conducted under the supervision of RITES and there would be round the clock monitoring ,” said a KMDA engineer. However, though there were no traffic jams, overall movement — especially when it rained — remained slow at certain crossings inside Posta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-pass-day-1-test-as-flyover-razing-work-starts/articleshow/83555663.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Madurai||Can’t reject claims if vehicle owners are not impleaded: Madras high court||MADURAI: Relying on a Supreme Court judgment, the Madras high court has held that motor accident claims tribunals cannot reject accident claims petitions if the claimants have not impleaded the owners or insurers of all the vehicles involved in the accident. The court also observed that the tribunals do not have power or authority to direct the claimants to implead owners and insurers. The court was hearing two civil revision petitions challenging the Virudhunagar motor accident claims tribunal’s order which had returned the claims petitions in two different cases. Since the claimants had only impleaded the owner and insurer of the alleged offending vehicle, the tribunal had returned the petitions by directing the claimants to implead the owner and insurer of the other vehicle, as per the order of a division bench of HC in 2019. Justice K Murali Shankar observed that as per a 2015 Supreme Court judgment, it is very clear that in case of joint tort-feasers, where liability is joint and several, it is the choice of the claimants to claim compensation from the owner and driver and insurer of both the vehicles or any one of them. The judge observed that since the judgment of the division bench in 2019, has not referred to the Supreme Court judgement in 2015, it can only be considered as per incuriam (a decision of a court is made per incuriam if it fails to apply a relevant statutory provision or ignores a binding precedent). Observing that the tribunal’s order returning the claim petitions is very much against the legal dictum laid down by Supreme Court, the judge said that set aside the same and directed the Virudhunagar tribunal to take the claim petitions on file. The judge further observed that it is brought to the notice of the court that several petitioners are being returned by tribunals in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry citing the above decision of the division bench. In order to clarify the position of law, thereby refrain the claimants from filing revisions and thereby save the time of the high court, this order may be circulated to all the tribunals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cant-reject-claims-if-vehicle-owners-are-not-impleaded-hc/articleshow/83555647.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Nine out of the 13 tehsils across the district now have single-digit hotspot villages, the zilla parishad said. Velhe is the only tehsil which doesn’t have a single hotspot in the district. As per the norms, a village that has 10 or more active Covid cases is designated as a hotspot village. On April 28, there were 465 such villages in the district. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of the zilla parishad, said this was a very positive sign. “The number of hotspot villages had become a worrisome factor. The reduction in the number indicates that the Covid situation is rapidly improving in rural Pune, which was badly affected by the virus.,” Prasad said. Baramati tehsil has the highest hotspot villages, 13, in the district. It is the worst affected tehsil in the district, officials said. Manoj Khomne, tehsil health officer of Baramati, said, “The Covid situation in Baramati has improved significantly in the past three weeks. We have had over 40 hotspot villages; now it has come down to 15. We are confident it will reduce further to a single digit this week. There is not a single village that has over 20 Covid active cases across the tehsil.” Three other tehsils have hotspot villages with cases in the double digits — Daund (12), Maval (11) and Haveli (11).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/number-of-hotspot-villages-in-rural-belt-goes-down-further-down-to-86-from-186/articleshow/83558191.cms||Sandip Dighe

The contraband was smuggled in from J&K and Rs 4.4 lakh was seized from the accused, raising suspicions of links to financing terrorism. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede carried out raids at five places, including two rooms attached to a shrine in Dadar. Two accused were staying there but no link has been established with the religious centre. Rajvinder Singh and Gurmit Singh rode on a bike from Kashmir to Punjab and then to the city and were carrying Rs 2.2 lakh of the seized money, suspected to be proceeds of sale. Their interrogation led to the arrest of Kamlesh Gupta and Amit Prakash Patel, from whom 2kg of hashish was recovered. Gupta’s disclosure led NCB to the house of Noor Mohmmad Jumman at Chunabhatti, where 3.3g charas was found. Later, Shabir Usman Shaikh and Nizamuddin Ahmad Taza were detained in Bhiwandi with 12kg charas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-terror-whiff-as-rs-9cr-jk-drugs-rs-4l-cash-seized-in-city-7-held/articleshow/83556258.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Mumbai||Final-year PG doctors write to PM Modi to call off exams||MUMBAI: Final-year postgraduate doctors who had moved the Supreme Court demanding cancellation of their final exams due to lack of preparation time have now written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi making the same request. The letter enlists several points on why exams must be waived. The letter stated that in India, it is the junior residents (JRs) who are “running hospitals”. “Since the pandemic started, it has been these JRs, and particularly JRs of this batch, who has constantly been working in Covid centres. This batch of JRs has been forced to work till the time a new batch of JRs don’t join, and that seems like a distant possibility in light of the upcoming third wave. This, combined with local laws, such as ESMA, make the JRs bonded labourers who have no other option but to work their days away,” said Dr. Shashidhar A, who is spearheading the movement. Resident doctors said many other professional exams were either cancelled or the pattern and requirement of such exams were altered in the wake of the pandemic. Hence, waiving exams for this batch of JRs will only be “an act of mercy to the people who have worked for the past year surrounded by death and human suffering”. Doctors said they have had no time to prepare for the exams. “The final postgraduate exams are a formality. It is the work done in the three-year training period that matters more, and many countries don’t even have exit exams. Also, the exams require at least a year of focussed preparation as these are not one-day exams,” said one of the doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-final-year-pg-docs-write-to-pm-modi-to-call-off-exams/articleshow/83562723.cms||---

The PMC standing committee has approved the proposal for the pay hike. Around 23,000 employees will benefit from the decision. “The civic employees have worked during tough times. Their work must be recognised. They should get the special pay hike,” said Ajit Darekar, a co-opted corporator, who put forth the proposal. The suggestion has come after special pay rise was given to the health department staff in the first week of June. It was suggested that the staff members’ work during the pandemic has helped control the spread of the virus in civic areas. According to the proposal, a similar type of hike was given to PMC staff after the Commonwealth Youth Games. The management of the event was done by PMC staff. Among other proposals, the standing committee has also approved the proposal to give an extension to contractual workers in the health department. Doctors recruited for Covid-19 mitigation were also given an extension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-staff-to-get-special-pay-hike-for-covid-work/articleshow/83558230.cms||---

We have asked for a pre-submission meeting and it is scheduled for this month,” the official added. He indicated that based on the first feedback that the company received from WHO, a nod may not be a long-drawn process as the cell line and a majority of Bharat Biotech’s facilities, including filling lines, have already been audited and approved by WHO for other vaccines like Typhoid, Polio and Rotavirus. “The good thing about us is that we already have several WHO prequalified vaccines. It’s not something brand new. It’s not like a new company going for WHO prequalification. It’s an existing company. All our QC, QA, everything is audited already for our other vaccines…so when they come, they make an assessment of everything, almost. They look at the quality management systems, they look at quality control, engineering, warehouse, everything,” he said. “The Vero Cell line that we are using for Covaxin is the same Vero Cell line that we use for the Rotavirus vaccine also. So WHO has already seen it and our QC labs, our water systems, everything, has been audited and approved by WHO (for the other vaccines),” he added. Bharat Biotech had earlier said that it has submitted the application for EUL and expects WHO's stamp of approval for Covaxin in the July-September quarter this year. According to the latest WHO guidance document on the ‘status of Covid-19 vaccines within the emergency use listing (EUL)/ pre-qualification process (PQ)’ dated June 3, 2021, Bharat Biotech submitted its expression of interest on April 19 this year, after which WHO sought more information and will be holding a pre-submission meeting in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bharat-bio-expects-who-review-of-covaxin-eul-to-begin-in-july/articleshow/83555702.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Lessons not learnt? Over Rs 3,000 fined for defying Covid norms||BHOPAL: There is far better compliance to Covid-19 norms particularly compulsory mask rule following the devastating second wave of Coronavirus pandemic, fervent appeal to people by the chief minister to wear masks and better enforcement of Covid protocol by the district administration, but there are still sizeable number of people not coming to terms with the pandemic and they are enough to put the city back in the risk zone of an anticipated third wave. Figures of Bhopal Municipal Corporation itself bear testimony to the fact that not everyone is heeding to appeal for Covid-appropriate behaviour or have learnt their lessons from extremely bitter experiences the city had during the second wave of Coronavirus. The penalty being imposed for flouting Covid-19 protocol has also not made a desirable impact. According to BMC figures, 369 persons were penalised on June 14 for not wearing masks and a spot fine of Rs 37,950 collected from them. Another 27 persons were fined Rs 11,300 for violation of other Covid-19 norms like not maintaining adequate physical distance and spitting at a public place. BMC has penalised 2,903 persons since June 1, when the lockdown was eased for not wearing masks and collected a fine of Rs 3,35,800 and another 478 persons have been fined for other violations of Covid-19 norms and Rs 1,49,450 collected from them. BMC is not the only agency keeping a tab on violation of Covid-19 norms, police and revenue officials also do it and penalise people on the spot, if anyone is found flouting the Covd-19 guidelines. The administration has also formed a Covid Safety Team (CST) comprising officials of police, BMC and revenue department to ensure compliance of Covid-19 guidelines, mainly in the markets. If persons fined for violation of Coronavirus guidelines by all the agencies are taken into account, it would be far more than reflected in the figures fetched by the BMC. On June 14, more than 900 persons were fined by all the agencies together for violation of Covid-19 guidelines. “People will have to be vocal themselves. It is a question of their safety also. If someone is not wearing a mask and standing by your side or someone is not being at a safe distance, you must yourself raise an objection. “Roko Toko” campaign of the district administration was aimed at motivating people to work for compliance of Coronavirus guidelines themselves. If a customer comes to a shop without wearing a mask, the shopkeeper should ask him to put on a mask and vice versa”, said an official of the district administration. Keeping a mask ready but not wearing it is another problem. “It was during lockdown, I was buying fruits from a vendor. I told him and the boy assisting him to put on a mask, telling them that I myself had fallen ill due to infection and everyone should essentially wear a mask. He showed me a few masks and said he was distributing them for free but he, himself, had tied the mask on his chin and the boy was without a mask. I fail to understand how one can distribute masks and not wear it himself”, said Sanjeev Pandey, a resident of Arera Colony. People further point out that wearing masks becomes difficult during the rainy season due to rain. “For two-wheeler riders it is difficult indeed but driving a four-wheeler with a mask on is not easy when it's raining and if you are wearing spectacles, it becomes more difficult”, said Vinod Shrivastava, a resident of Kolar. Meanwhile, the district collector has formed Covid Safety Teams (CSTs) in all the 83 wards of the city to keep a watch on violation of Covid-19 protocol at public places particularly market places in the hope that it would help in better compliance of the Covid protocol in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lessons-not-learnt-over-3k-fined-for-defying-covid-norms/articleshow/83555692.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Overall as per the census projections the estimated population of state in year 2021 is around 8.4 crore and of these if people aged below 18 years, those with chronic illnesses (ineligible for vaccination) or pregnant women are excluded then approximately around 5.7 crore people are to be vaccinated in the state, said sources. If conditions of the four major towns, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur is considered—these towns were also the hotspots of Covid-19 infection as more than half of cases were reported from here—Indore has nearly administered at least one dose of vaccine to more than 60% the eligible projected population of the city. After Indore it is state capital Bhopal where nearly 56% of the eligible population has been vaccinated. While Jabalpur has vaccinated 38% of its, eligible population with at least one dose, in Gwalior 36% of eligible population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Sources said that the coverage of vaccination is likely to increase in coming days as the availability of vaccine is also improving as well as several campaigns are also being planned out for ensuring massive vaccinations. “We are already executing several awareness drives and including people from sectors of life like teachers, students for awareness. If adequate vaccine is available and things go as we had planned, we are hopeful of vaccinating the entire eligible population, eligible population is around 39% of the total projected population as persons below 18 years, ante natal population is excluded, by December this year, both the dose of vaccine will be administered provided availability is there”, state vaccination officer, Dr Santosh Shukla told TOI. Among the 1.23 crore people, who have been administered with the first dose of vaccine, at least 20 lakh have also been administered with the second dose of the vaccine, thus around 5% of the total eligible population of the state has already been vaccinated completely, said sources. Apart from it, if seen otherwise close to 78 lakh people have been infected from the disease and half of them have been infected recently, thus there is great probability of developing antibodies in more than 30 lakh who have been recently infected, said sources. The conclusion is, now if adequate precautions are taken, vaccination is further intensified, there are chances that we will be able to avert, third peak, if any, of the infection in the near future, said sources. More than 34 lakh people of these four major towns which are densely populated and have less scope of social distancing compared to the sparsely populated districts have received their first doses, if the vaccination drive is intensified and even this much people are able to receive the second dose also, then things will be more favourable, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/more-than-half-of-population-vaccinated-in-indore-bhopal/articleshow/83562842.cms||---

The two trees outside the NIO are that of a mango tree while the other one is an Indian laburnum that blooms bunches of yellow flowers. The third tree is located opposite the Campal Clinic at Campal. “The mango tree outside the NIO is a local indigenous mango variant unlike the hybrid ones sold in the market today. This may be a very old tree which has seen the rise and fall of the Portuguese rule since it’s located on the road leading to the Cabo Raj Bhavan,” Dsouza said. He said that the root system of these trees is in place owing to which they are still able to receive nutrients from the soil. There were also a set of Ashoka trees at Campal which he said cannot be saved. “We should work as soon as possible to save these trees so that we can then move on to the next set of trees. If we can slowly salvage these trees, then we can slowly recover the city’s tree cover,” he said. The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) municipal commissioner, Agnelo Fernandes said, “If we get any trees that can be saved, we will definitely take it up.” TOI had reported that the century-old Copper Pod tree was replanted in its original spot after D’Souza discovered it to be living, and appealed to the CCP to help save it. There were a total of 132 big and small trees uprooted in Panaji due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/more-trees-in-panaji-set-to-be-replanted/articleshow/83558423.cms||Nida Sayed

The ATS had arrested the men in September 2012 for hatching a conspiracy to kill leaders, police officials, politicians and journalists across the country at the behest of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The ATS had recovered two revolvers and 14 rounds of ammunition. Special judge D E Kothalikar found Mohammed Muazmmil Gani, Mohammed Akram and Mohammed Sadiq guilty under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act relating to criminal conspiracy and being members and committing offences as part of a terror organisation. Gani was also convicted under the Arms Act. The acquiited men were Mohammed Irfan Gaus and Mohammed Ilyas Akbar. While the ATS initially investigated the case, the NIA took over the investigation in 2013. The trial was later expedited by the Bombay high court. In 2017, the accused had sought to plead guilty. The pleas were rejected by the court. Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty examined 73 prosecution witnesses. Among them were those who attended the conspiracy meetings. A politician, who had allegedly received threat calls, was also a witness and deposed in 2019. Following the pronouncement of judgement, the court issued a notice to a witness who turned hostile during his deposition. The prosecution moved a plea accusing him of perjury. The investigating agency had alleged that Akram went to Saudi Arabia under the guise of seeking employment as a driver with the help of a wanted accused, Hyderabad native Mohammed Abdul Majeed. Majeed is alleged to be in Saudi Arabia. It was alleged that in Saudi Arabia, Akram was introduced to various LeT members, also natives of Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The NIA alleged that conspiracy meetings were held by Akram and others in Riyadh and Dammam, Saudi Arabia, to carry out hits on targeted people in various parts of India “to create terror in society”. It was alleged that Akram returned to India in 2012 as part of the plan and took the help of his Nanded-based associates, Gani and Sadiq. The trio went to Hyderabad as part of the preparations. It was alleged that arms were procured for the conspiracy. In August 2012, based on secret information, the ATS arrested four accused. Arms were recovered from Gani and Sadiq. It was alleged that the arms were procured at Akram’s behest. Subsequently, Akram was arrested on August 31, 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-given-10-years-ri-2-let-off-in-2012-nanded-arms-case/articleshow/83556270.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The new cases and positivity rate have seen a slight increase from the previous day’s figures. The national capital had recorded 131 Covid-19 cases, the lowest since February 22, and 16 fatalities on Monday, while the positivity rate dropped to 0.22%, according to a health department bulletin. The total number of tests conducted in the last 24 hours stood at 71,291. The cumulative case tally stands at 14,31,498, while the total number of fatalities stand at 24,851. “New cases have declined significantly. But we are flooded with queries from recovered patients about new onset of diabetes, raised levels of cholesterol and extreme weakness among others,” a senior doctor at Max Saket said. At Lok Nayak hospital, one of the largest public hospitals designated for Covid management in Delhi, the officials said only about 195 out of 2000 beds were occupied. “Majority of the admitted patients are those with severe complications for weeks. Some of them are on ventilator support,” the official added. Dr A K Grover, chairperson of department of ophthalmology at Sir Ganga Ram hospital recently told TOI that mucormycosis, a serious type of fungal infection – is one the complications in Covid patients requiring prolonged stay in hospital. “Few such patients admitted at our hospital had mucormycosis in both eyes necessitating surgical resection,” he said. Dr Grover and his team are conducting a study to assess the spread of mucormycosis in the first and the second wave. “Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the fungal infection is affecting younger patients and early in the disease course this time as compared to the previous peak,” the eye specialist said. Many other hospitals are also struggling to manage Covid patients suffering from secondary infection, including mucormycosis. Delhi has 27,554 Covid beds of which, latest data shows, only 1,891 are still occupied. The occupancy of ICU beds, which were totally occupied at the peak of the wave witnessed in April-May, has also reduced. According to data shared by hospitals on the Delhi Corona App, out of 6,668 ICU beds (without ventilator) 936 (14%) are occupied presently. The occupancy of ICU beds with a ventilator stands at 25% which is still high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/post-covid-complications-keep-docs-on-their-toes/articleshow/83555750.cms||---

My grandfather and father were devotees of Ranchhodraiji Temple that hosts the Holy Trinity before Rath Yatra. My father tried for several years, but could not get a chance,” said Thakor, claiming that he might be the first from the Thakor community to play maternal relatives of the Lord. Would the grand procession be held this year? Thakor was hopeful. “The Covid scenario is improving in the city, and I am sure that Lord Jagannath would bless the citizens this year. We have anyways started preparations for the grand day,” said Thakor, a cable and internet service provider. The temple authorities have already approached the city police for permission as it’s not decided yet whether the procession would take place this year. Ranchhodraiji Temple in Saraspur, that decides who would host mameru, did away with the system of fixing the host sequentially from among a long list of aspirants. “For the past few years, we draw a lottery of a few names so that all get a good chance. This year’s host had to back out due to unavoidable circumstances, thus Thakor got a chance,” said a temple trustee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/waited-to-host-mameru-for-two-generations/articleshow/83558220.cms||---

---||Bhopal||More than half of population vaccinated in Bhopal; 20% get at least 1 dose in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: So far around 1.23 crore out of 5.7 crore eligible population for vaccination have been administered with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the state. Overall as per the census projections the estimated population of state in year 2021 is around 8.4 crore and of these if people aged below 18 years, those with chronic illnesses (ineligible for vaccination) or pregnant women are excluded then approximately around 5.7 crore people are to be vaccinated in the state, said sources. If conditions of the four major towns, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur is considered—these towns were also the hotspots of Covid-19 infection as more than half of cases were reported from here—Indore has nearly administered at least one dose of vaccine to more than 60% the eligible projected population of the city. After Indore it is state capital Bhopal where nearly 56% of the eligible population has been vaccinated. While Jabalpur has vaccinated 38% of its, eligible population with at least one dose, in Gwalior 36% of eligible population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Sources said that the coverage of vaccination is likely to increase in coming days as the availability of vaccine is also improving as well as several campaigns are also being planned out for ensuring massive vaccinations. “We are already executing several awareness drives and including people from sectors of life like teachers, students for awareness. If adequate vaccine is available and things go as we had planned, we are hopeful of vaccinating the entire eligible population, eligible population is around 39% of the total projected population as persons below 18 years, ante natal population is excluded, by December this year, both the dose of vaccine will be administered provided availability is there”, state vaccination officer, Dr Santosh Shukla told TOI. Among the 1.23 crore people, who have been administered with the first dose of vaccine, at least 20 lakh have also been administered with the second dose of the vaccine, thus around 5% of the total eligible population of the state has already been vaccinated completely, said sources. Apart from it, if seen otherwise close to 78 lakh people have been infected from the disease and half of them have been infected recently, thus there is great probability of developing antibodies in more than 30 lakh who have been recently infected, said sources. The conclusion is, now if adequate precautions are taken, vaccination is further intensified, there are chances that we will be able to avert, third peak, if any, of the infection in the near future, said sources. More than 34 lakh people of these four major towns which are densely populated and have less scope of social distancing compared to the sparsely populated districts have received their first doses, if the vaccination drive is intensified and even this much people are able to receive the second dose also, then things will be more favourable, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/more-than-half-of-population-vaccinated-in-indore-bhopal/articleshow/83555735.cms||---

Gujarat State Aviation Infrastructure Company Limited recently issued a request for proposals to operationalize five more routes for intra-state air connectivity. The process has been delayed since December last year, but with the state urban development department being active in improving road and other infrastructure connecting these routes, the proposal has been mooted again. Operationalising these proposed airports has been approved under the regional air connectivity scheme (RCS-UDAN). According to proposal, sectors that are open for bidding are Ahmedabad-Keshod-Porbandar-Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad-Bhuj-Rajkot-Ahmedabad, Surat-Bhavnagar-Surat, Surat- Ahmedabad-Surat and Surat-Amreli-Surat. The proposal has asked for preferred flight times of 4pm to 8pm for Ahmedabad-Keshod-Porbandar and Ahmedabad-Bhuj-Rajkot sectors. The smaller Surat-Bhavnagar and Surat-Ahmedabad and Surat-Amreli routes will see 9-seater aircraft. The airlines will be required to operate six days a week with one day reserved for maintenance. “The age of the aircraft shall not be more than 12 years,” says the proposal document. “It was in mid-May the proposals for more sectors to be opened had gathered steam. We are hopeful that that in the next two months there will be operators who will be interested in these routes, negotiations are on,” said a senior official in the state urban development department. Meanwhile, plans are afoot to install CCTV cameras on the Mehsana airstrip along the Palanpur-Mehsana highway. “The proposal was delayed for almost four months because of the pandemic.

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the photographs produced by the petitioner prima facie shows that sewage and drainage water is flowing over the street in the village. If sewage water is flowing in the street, then it would definitely cause health hazards, especially during the pandemic period. Hence, the judges disposed of the petition by directing the tahsildar of Tiruvenkadam taluk and block development officer of Kuruvikulam panchayat union to carryout a surprise inspection and take appropriate action against the people who are discharging sewage water in the street. The judges also directed the authorities to appropriate mitigating measures to clear the stagnated sewage water and sanitize the entire area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/act-against-people-discharging-sewage/articleshow/83555777.cms||---

Come June and most curbs were lifted. Since people started moving out, they began to feel the heat of the constantly increasing prices of fuel,” said Padmajay Rathod, an Ahmedabad-based petroleum dealer. Estimates by Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA) suggest that in June, there has been a marginal 5% recovery in sale against that in May. However, overall demand continues to remain muted say industry sources. In 2019, the average daily fuel sale was 1.6 crore litre diesel and 80 lakh litre petrol in Gujarat. However, the same has drastically reduced in the entire of 2020-21. “As people began moving out, the consumption has surely gone up but it is still much less as compared to 2019-20. This is because travel has been restricted and due to work from home people have also been moving much less. Moreover, schools and colleges too are closed so even that movement is fairly restricted. On the other hand, less demand for transport has also caused a decline in diesel demand,” said Dhimant Ghelani, general secretary, FGPDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pinching-reality-fuel-prices-up-7-in-43-days/articleshow/83558330.cms||Niyati Parikh

Central government had informed the court that around 600 suggestions were received by the administration and they have been conveyed to the government. During Tuesday’s hearing, a division bench asked Lakshadweep administration to respond to the plea seeking free distribution of ration to islanders in view of Covid-19 restrictions by Monday. While the court accepted the administration’s demand for more time, it said it won’t grant an extension of time after Monday. It was alleged by the petitioner that a representation filed to the administration to distribute ration as livelihood of the islanders are affected due to the Covid-19 restrictions did not evoke any response. However, a counsel representing the administration has submitted that rice was distributed to eligible persons and that nobody is facing starvation in Lakshadweep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-refuses-more-time-to-oppose-draft/articleshow/83555835.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Candidates who have taken Class 10 exams before 2020-2021 academic year, are required to fill details of the board exam marks as well. The state government had last month announced the cancellation of Class X board exams and mass promotion for 8.75 lakh regular students due to the Covid-19 situation in the state. As per the state government directive for mass promotion, not a single regular student is to be failed. The Class 10 exam results will take some time before they are prepared and handed out to the students, said sources. Out of 7.92 lakh regular students, 60.64% or about 4.80 lakh students cleared Class X board exams last year. As a result, there is likely to be a big rush in diploma courses as compared to last year. According to the GSHSEB’s marks tabulation policy, the Class 10 results will be prepared out of 100 marks for each subject. This includes 40% weightage to academic performance in the Class 9 school exams, and 40% marks from Class 10 internal school exams this year.

The International Sunni Centre in North Nagpur has also assured all required help to make people from Muslim community aware about the benefits of vaccination. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Study by our teams revealed vaccination hesitancy in some localities with majority Muslim populations — Mominpura, Tajbagh, couple of areas in North Nagpur. We held a meeting with maulanas and representatives of Muslim community at Mominpura a couple of days ago. A special vaccination camp was also organized at the Itwari masjid hall.” Joshi added, “Another meeting was organized with maulanas and imams of masjids at International Sunni Centre on Tuesday. From these meetings, we learnt some myths prevalent among people about vaccination. Some feel vaccination is harmful. Some do not have any fear about Covid-19. We explained in detail how vaccination was the only solution for an individual to protect themselves from Covid-19, and also entire city and nation. We urged the heads and representatives to circulate pictures of their vaccination in their groups to encourage unvaccinated people.” Joshi said similar meetings will be held in other localities too where there is vaccination hesitancy. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “Hesitancy can also be seen in some slums and among low income group. Awareness activities will be done here too.” Chairman of International Sunni Centre Maulana Syed Alamgir Ashraf told TOI, “There are rumours among some people of Muslim community, including that skin of swine is used in production of vaccine. There is no evidence to prove these rumours. To clear such confusion or any other issue, a meeting was organized with NMC officials. Imams of masjids and representatives of CSRE Groups were also present. A clear message was given to all that vaccination, that too at the earliest, was very necessary to protect ourselves and also entire city from the pandemic. Imams have agreed to announce this after prayers on jumma at their masjids.” Maulana also said, “NMC asked us to prepare a list of people ready for vaccination in different areas. We will facilitate halls for vaccination. NMC teams will come and vaccinate the people.” Secretary of Nagpur Tablighi Markaz Abdul Bari Patel said, “Vaccination certificate is becoming mandatory for travel and at working places. Apart from safety, vaccination has become important in life of all people. We are also spreading awareness about this among people in our community. Everyone should get vaccinated at the earliest for ourselves, our family and city.” As per state government data, the district’s population is around 52,72,665, with 30% (15,81,800) estimated to be in the 45+ age group. The state public health department has said 8,28,292 people of this age group have taken first dose as on June 14. Also, 1,98,673 healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers have taken first dose. As per officials, around 70% of these HCWs and FLWs are 45+. Thus, around 9.7 lakh people from 45+ group have taken the jab. Still, around 6.11 lakh people from this age group are waiting for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-officials-meet-community-heads-to-remove-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/83555795.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Hyderabad||‘Remdesivir’ enters the Oxford English Dictionary||HYDERABAD: While in April and July 2020, several new words linked to Covid-19 were added to Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the anti-viral injection Remdesivir is the new entry word in the June 2021 update. The word was added due to extensive use during the second wave of Covid-19 in India and elsewhere in the world. OED, in the release notes, said that 700 new word entries, senses and additions to existing words entered the dictionary. OED said in the update notes that the coronavirus pandemic continues to show an impact on language. For instance, the word ‘social distance’, first recorded in 2004, is widely used from 2020 with a meaning ‘physical distance maintained between individuals to avoid transmission of infection.’ ‘Stay-at-home’ is used in a new sense of adjective with stay-at-home orders. It was earlier used in 1893 during the cholera outbreak as a stay-at-home policy. The Oxford Language 2020 report on the words of an unprecedented year mentioned the word ‘unmute’. Due to video conferencing and work from home, ‘unmute’ has widely been used. Hyderabad-based English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) professor K Venkat Reddy said, “Extraordinary times result in extraordinary innovations and inventions. Language has always responded to such situations; be it world wars, social upheavals, revolutions, epidemics or the current apocalyptic Covid-19 pandemic. Language users invent and reinvent ways and means to use the language effectively to suit the needs of the hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/remdesivir-enters-the-oxford-english-dictionary/articleshow/83555797.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Commission also directed an expert committee to analyse infrastructure, faculty vis-a-vis proposal submitted by the IEC University regarding conversion of external and self-paced learning courses to regular courses to safeguard the interest of students. The matter regarding running of 30 external and self-paced learning courses by IEC University was brought into the notice of commission, after which detailed reply regarding enrolling the students as well as approval of different central and state regulatory bodies and government for running external and self-paced learning courses was sought. HPPIERC chairman Maj Gen Atul Kaushik (retd), in an order issued on June 10, said the committee to be constituted to analyse the infrastructure will visit the university and submit its detailed report to commission within a month from the date of issuance of order. Commission said the penalty should be paid within a month of issuance of orders, failing which penalty will be imposed specifically as per provisions contained in Himachal Pradesh Private Educational Institutions (Regulatory Commission) Act, 2010 and rules made there under. IEC University has termed the allegations and fines as “irrational”. A senior IEC University official said the commission itself had approved the introduction of external mode courses for the academic session 2020-21 as per the university act approved by Himachal Pradesh assembly. When admissions to these courses were done and classes started, the commission itself raised questions on the approval. The university said such action was uncalled for. IEC University registrar Vinod Kumar said the commission approved the courses in 2020. After this, the university sent the basic procedures of teaching and learning methodology to the regulatory commission from time to time and also shared all information of students enrolled in these courses. Therefore, Kumar said, the commission saying that courses were started without approval was wrong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hp-commission-fines-solan-varsity-rs-11-lakh-for-admission-rule-violations/articleshow/83551227.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Doctors fix rare ‘frozen eyes’ to help man see straight||PUNE: For 30 years, Junaid had walked with his head tilted towards his right shoulder. He had what’s known as ‘frozen eyes’ — an extremely rare birth defect, which according to estimates, affects one in every 2,30,000 individuals worldwide. The genetic condition had immobilised both eyes’ muscles, resulting in a gaze fixed in two different directions. And to look straight ahead, Junaid had to turn his head towards the right shoulder. The condition had severely impacted his neck and spine muscles. But a year ago, Junaid came into the care of a team of doctors led by Pune-based eye surgeon Jai Kelkar. The team carried out a complex corrective surgery to reposition both eyes. The procedure worked. For the first time in three decades, Junaid was able to see straight ahead without straining his body. The disorder is medically termed ‘Congenital Fibrosis of the Extraocular Muscles’ or CFEM. Affected individuals are born with eyes fixed in abnormal positions. They are unable to move them normally and often develop a compensatory chin-up position to see properly. “The main problem Junaid faced was the awkward head posture he had to adopt while walking due to the fixated eye muscles which is a congenital (at birth) defect. We were not expecting to restore normal eye movement through the surgery, which is completely out of the realm of medical science as of now. The aim was to help him get rid of the burdensome head posture he had been living with,” Kelkar told TOI. Kelkar is director of the National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO) — a dedicated tertiary care eye hospital in Pune. In his childhood and adolescent years, Junaid had visited several hospitals, but could not come across doctors with solutions. Before attempting the surgery, the team of doctors at the NIO carried out a battery of medical investigations to gauge the success of the delicate repositioning procedure. They first carried out a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to identify the position of Junaid’s eye muscles. Kelkar said, “Muscles of both eyes were plastered onto the eye globes. They (eye muscles) were very taut; completely lacking in contractility. There was not a trace of elasticity as seen in normal eye muscles. That's why he was unable to move his eyes in any direction and the gaze was fixed in two opposite directions.” The surgery lasted two hours. “We managed to restore alignment of the eyes by using special sutures (see box) to anchor the muscles to the eye globes. There were many challenges during surgery so the procedure was performed under general anesthesia,” Kelkar said. Junaid said the procedure has completely transformed his life. “After the surgery, I was able to see straight. More importantly, I was able to walk with a straight head, something I had never done since birth," he said. The operation also restored self-esteem. Junaid has been regularly following up with his treating doctor. “There is now a smile on his face whenever he walks in,” said Kelkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/docs-fix-rare-frozen-eyes-to-help-man-see-straight/articleshow/83558346.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Police also booked a shopkeeper for violating Covid guidelines. “We collected a fine of Rs7.40 lakh from the mask-rule violators,” deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Mitesh Ghatte said. He said levying fines was not a long-term solution. “People should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour when they step out of the house and visit a shopping complex or any other establishment,” Ghatte said. Ghatte said most of the mask-rule violators were caught on the outskirts of the city, while shopping hubs like Laxmi Road and Deccan Gymkhana had fewer violations. “Two teams from each police station are patrolling the shopping areas and public places under their jurisdictions. Police are also making announcements, people to wear masks and follow social distancing,” he said. The shopkeeper who was booked was pulled up for violating the deadline. Police have registered a case under Section 188 (disobedience) of the Indian Penal Code. From April 2020, the city police have fined over 4.35 lakh people for various Covid-19 violations and collected a total of Rs.21.2 crore in fines from the offenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1505-people-fined-for-violating-mask-rule/articleshow/83558353.cms||---
---||Pune||PMC plans to clean 9km of Bhairoba nullah in Cantt||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has submitted a proposal focussed on cleaning a nine-km stretch of Bhairoba nullah that passes through the Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) limits to avoid flooding in Wanowrie and Ghorpadi areas. Last year, the civic body had removed truckloads of debris and garbage accumulated in the nullah’s channel. PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar said, “We have referred the PMC’s proposal to the Dakshin Maharashtra and Goa Sub Area, which is the Local Military Authority (LMA), for a statutory sanction as the nullah stretch is located on an A-1 defence land. We hope to get the approval in the next two days. Thereafter, we will give permission to the PMC to carry out the proposed work.” Heavy rain in September 2019 had resulted in flooding of the nullah which caused heavy damage to properties around the waterway, including loss of lives. Sushmita Shirke, superintendent engineer of drainage cleaning section in the PMC, told TOI, “The PMC has made a budgetary provision for carrying out cleaning work of the entire Bhairoba nullah which originates from Katraj and flows through PMC and PCB areas before merging with the Mula-Mutha river at Koregaon Park. Under this programme, we will carry out cleaning work of a 9km stretch of the nullah that passes through the PCB limits. We are awaiting a sanction from the PCB authorities.” On why the PMC did not initiate the clean-up work before the monsoon, Shirke said they needed two weeks extra time to complete the tendering process. “However, the work will be done on a war footing. A huge quantity of garbage has been dumped in the nullah over the last few months. We will clean it by using earth movers to maintain the natural flow of the nullah. Otherwise, it will result in flooding in the nearby localities,” Shirke added. “The LMA authorities are also keen to clean the nullah as it had created issues for defence establishments located in Ghorpadi area in the past,” a senior official from the PCB, on condition of anonymity, said. Rampant encroachments and inadequate desilting measures had led to the flooding of Chimta vasti and its adjoining areas near Empress Garden on the banks of Bhairoba nullah following the heavy rain in September 2019. The authorities had to deploy Army personnel, who then evacuated over 300 people from the settlement at the rear end of St Patrick’s Cathedral. Chimta vasti is on the B-2 defence land along the Bhairoba nullah under the administration’s management. The land, however, comes under the administrative limits of the Pune Cantonment Board. The nullah’s waters left many stranded in the wooded area, and on two bridges connecting Empress Garden to BT Kawade Road. The civilians were rescued from houses under water, stranded on either side of the bridges and stuck on rooftops and trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-clean-9km-of-bhairoba-nullah-in-cantt/articleshow/83558363.cms||Sandip Dighe

In the video, S Mohammed Ali, 37, a resident of Mahaboopalayam, broke into tears while narrating the harassment saying they would be responsible for his death. He also went on to apologise to his wife, children and friends for resorting to the extreme step. He urged chief minister M K Stalin and Madurai city commissioner of police to protect his family from further harassment and called for action against the four. Following the incident, Ali’s wife Fathima lodged a police complaint saying Ali was running a hotel and borrowed money from the four people. About six months ago they closed the hotel and started a flour business at their house. On Monday, she stated that her husband came home upset saying one of the four, an advocate, had abused and threatened him. A few minutes later, her daughter found Ali hanging. S S Colony police registered a case against the four under section 306 of IPC (abetment of suicide) and under Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-37-hangs-after-recording-video-blaming-usurers/articleshow/83555822.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Is kiss in office with CCTVs a private act? Gujarat HC to decide||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court is to decide whether a couple kissing in office can be considered to be engaging in a private act. Another issue the court will decide is whether the couple can claim breach of privacy by expecting to not be observed by anyone when the office is under CCTV surveillance. Justice Nikhil Kariel framed the issues for determination in a case involving a Venezuelan engineer, who was working with Tamboli Castings Ltd in Bhavnagar. The woman has charged the company’s director Vaibhav Tamboli and his father Bipin Tamboli with watching and leaking the images and the clip of her allegedly kissing a colleague who is a Tamboli family member. This colleague and the rest of the Tamboli family had a fallout after he allegedly stabbed his brother Vaibhav during company’s board meeting last year. The Venezuelan engineer filed an FIR with Vartej police on January 19 against the Tambolis for leaking the footage. They were booked under Section 354-C of the IPC, for voyeurism and also booked under the provisions of the Information Technology Act for leaking the footage. The father-son duo approached the HC for quashing the FIR. Their advocates Mahesh Jethmalani and Ajay Choksi submitted that kissing does not fall in the definition of ‘private act’ as stated in Explanation-1 of Section 354-C of the IPC. A person cannot expect that he/she will not be observed in an office which is covered by CCTV cameras. Moreover, the lawyers claimed that the complaint by the Venezuelan engineer was a counterblast to the FIR against Mehul Tamboli for the alleged act of stabbing his brother. The engineer was on good terms with him and she has maliciously filed the FIR, the lawyers said. After a preliminary hearing, the HC issued a notice to the state CID (crime) seeking a reply by June 20. The court ordered cops not to take any coercive action against the accused till then. While staying the arrest, the HC framed questions for determination. One was whether the gesture of kissing in office was a ‘private act’ according to the IPC. Another was whether a person can expect not to be observed in his/her private act committed in an office space which is under CCTV surveillance. Yet another was whether the images captured in the camera and allegedly circulated contain material which has lascivious appeal or contain sexually explicit material. The court is to decide on whether watching a couple kissing in an office space, which is under CCTV cover, forms an offence of voyeurism. Court stays probe over rape charges: Justice Nikhil Kariel on Tuesday stayed the CID (crime) from probing the allegations of rape under Section 376 of the IPC against Vaibhav and his father Bipin Tamboli. It stayed an order passed in March by a sessions court in Bhavnagar on the Venezuelan engineer’s demand to add rape charges in the FIR for voyeurism. The Tambolis’ advocates submitted that the engineer had made a rape complaint much before the FIR for voyeurism was filed, but it was not registered. They also said that it was a false charge. The HC has admitted the petition and sought the government’s reply by July 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/is-kiss-in-office-with-cctvs-a-private-act-hc-to-decide/articleshow/83558380.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Virus risk and travel: Ahmedabad ranks 7th||AHMEDABAD: As authorities brace for the third Covid wave, in the background of the appearance of the new Delta-plus variant, a hazard map for Indian cities has been proposed. The map will be based on rail, road, and air travel and Covid infection spread. It has been mooted by researchers of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. For the first time, Covid spread from typical outbreak locations owing to travel within the state and between states has placed Ahmedabad seventh on the most vulnerable cities’ list. However, at the top are cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. What is even more interesting is that the hazard map can simulate a disease outbreak occurrence in any city and show the time it will take to reach other cities. For instance, if the disease outbreak occurs in Mumbai then it will take 26 days to reach Ahmedabad and Surat. Likewise, the map also provides the hazard rank for each of the Gujarat cities with respect to the outbreak location. For instance, if Ahmedabad is the site of an outbreak then Vadodara, Rajkot, and Surat are the most vulnerable cities within the state. Gandhinagar, though closer to Ahmedabad, has a hazard rank of 9. Also Amreli, Gangtok, Shimla, Kannur, Tezpur, Osmanabad, Jorhat, and Junagadh are among the cities shown as the least hazard-prone at the time of a Covid outbreak. The hazard map has compared them with the spread of Covid cases reported between March and July 2020. The researchers have argued that the hazard map framework can be extended to include multiple disease outbreak locations, and identify effective ways to selectively block transport to arrest the spread of the disease. “Firstly, once the severity of infection is known, hazard map can be used to estimate how many days it will take for infection to travel from its outbreak location to other cities and towns,” the study says. It says the map can serve as an early warning tool. “This can be used to selectively stop transport in some sectors instead of all over India so that the infection spread can be slowed down,” the study says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/virus-risk-and-travel-city-ranks-7th/articleshow/83556041.cms||Paul John

The scheme would benefit 10.31 lakh families in the district. A statement from the district administration said the staff members of ration shops had distributed tokens to the beneficiaries at their doorsteps around four days ago to ensure hassle-free distribution of the Covid-19 dole by adhering to all the standard operating procedures. The dole would be distributed to at least 200 beneficiaries at a ration shop a day. The shops would function on all the seven days in a week from 9am to 12.30pm and from 2pm to 5pm, the statement said. To ensure that the dole reaches the beneficiaries without any malpractices, a source said, an official in the rank of deputy collector was deployed in each block. The source said 10.09 lakh beneficiaries had received the first instalment of the dole in the district. “Those who haven’t collected the same could collect it along with their second instalment. Also, those who haven’t received the tokens to avail the second instalment can visit the ration shops next week and collect the dole.” In neighbouring Tirupur district, information and publicity minister M P Saminathan and adi dravidar welfare minister N Kalyalvizhi Selvaraj jointly inaugurated the dole distribution. In Tirupur, 7.56 lakh rice cardholders are eligible to receive the dole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/second-phase-of-dole-distribution-begins/articleshow/83555917.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Good response is seen in private vaccination centres as compared to government facilities, where people are not too keen other than Covid jab, say officials. At private hospitals and clinics, many people, who earlier neglected the annual vaccination despite being at high risk, are now queueing up. Apprehensive about a possible Covid third wave affecting the younger population more, citizens are also administering flu vaccines to their kids in a big way. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde said lot of people are getting vaccinated for different reasons. “Foreign-bound students need vaccination to meet the entry requirements in other countries. This time, people are coming forward with enquiries related to age-specific vaccinations to protect against vaccine-preventable diseases. This is due to awareness about vaccination, which otherwise used to be neglected by high-risk groups,” she said. Paediatrician Dr Anand Bhutada said there is increased interest among people regarding vaccination now. “From the second wave, people have understood the importance of getting vaccinated. They have seen how healthcare workers remained protected from Covid-19 despite working amid high viral load situations. The vaccine hesitancy has reduced in adults and now they are anxious to know when Covid vaccine for kids would be available and what can be expected. Safety concerns regarding vaccination too have subsided to a large extent,” he said. Dr Bhutada recommended that parents must get vaccinated at the earliest. “Until a vaccine is available for kids, everyone above 18 in the family should take Covid vaccine,” he said, adding annual flu vaccination is getting sound response. Paediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charde said lung-related infection like pneumococcal and influenza are seen in kids too. “Depending on the success of trials, we are still six months away from a Covid vaccine for kids. Influenza-like illness or swine flu cases increase if winter sets in early or monsoon withdraws late. If vaccine is given today, the body takes over a month to build immunity. Hence, people have started getting vaccinated to brace for possible surge in late August or September,” he said. Dr Charde added that a single shot of influenza vaccine given annually can prevent complications in children and therefore preferable. “The Indian Academy of Paediatrics too has recommend influenza vaccination,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pandemic-pushes-citizens-towards-non-covid-vax-too/articleshow/83555941.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Well, nothing short of magic! Yes, this is exactly what you feel when you look at some of the the bewitching installations that have been erected at various landmarks in Gwalior. These creative beauties compel the commuters to stop and soak in their beauty and marvel at the thought and creativity behind them, especially because their origin is the scrap dumps. An endeavour by Gwalior district administration and Smart City Gwalior, this ‘Scrap to art’ project focusses on the objects, places and artefacts that are an integral part of city’s ethos. “Under this project, 15 scrap art installations would make their presence felt across the city, out of those five are already complete and each one is enjoying a pride of place,” said Collector Gwalior, Kaushlendra Vikram Singh. The collector went on to add, “This is yet another step to make Gwalior a world-class city, which has all the right credentials to get UNESCO’s Music City tag. From nature to heritage and art, everything that matters to people and pleases the senses, has been incorporated in these scrap art icons.” “The USP of these installations is that they are all based on themes, which are very ethnic and a part of Gwalior’s evolution. Whether it is Sarod, which is the pride of Gwalior gharana or Soan Chiraiyya (The Great Indian Bustard) which was found in this belt or even Mrinu Art, everything has the fragrance, aura and soul of Gwalior,” explained the CEO of Gwalior Smart City, Jayati Singh. “The project, which started around March 2020, will be completed by end of 2021. Our team of interns is doing extensive research and working with the design team to think of more such local flavours that can be turned into pieces de resistance through scrap art,” added the CEO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/scrap-to-stunning-saga-of-gwaliors-ethnic-makeover/articleshow/83555919.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi

---||Pune||Talks on RT-PCR relief for flyers reaching state take off||Pune: Relief and rehabilitation department principal secretary Aseem Gupta on Tuesday told TOI that talks were on with senior decision makers of the state whether to exempt vaccinated travellers from showing a negative RT-PCR report while entering Maharashtra or not. Some states have recently removed the requirement of travellers needing RT-PCR tests for entry. Gupta told TOI, “We have already done away with the requirement of showing a negative RT-PCR report for travel within the state. However, the requirement of showing a negative RT-PCR test still holds if travellers are coming to Maharashtra from other states. A decision on exemption of vaccinated travellers from this rule cannot be taken in haste and will need due deliberations.” Gupta said that the issue is nevertheless being discussed, after it was proposed to the authorities by a few stakeholders. “Discussions are at a nascent phase,” he said. A senior bureaucrat in the state told TOI that the rule for negative RT-PCR tests to enter the state is a follow-up of the “sensitive origin order”. He said, “As per the order, passengers travelling to Maharashtra from Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and NCR region, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh need a negative RT-PCR report conducted within 48 hours of their train travel. Any exemption to the vaccinated travellers will also require modifications in the sensitive origin order.” After states such as Punjab and Chandigarh announced that travellers could reach there without an RT-PCR test if they have had one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, travel industry stakeholders have been lobying for a similar exemption in Maharashtra. Nikhil Thakurdas, owner of a tour and travel firm, told TOI, “The requirement for an RT-PCR test to enter Maharashtra is preventing thousands of business and emergency travellers from heading out, as they need the test to return. RT-PCR tests are costly and inconvenient. Since many travellers have now received at least the first jabs, the Maharashtra government should think on the lines as some other states in India.” Thakurdas said many citizens had received their first Covishield shots in the first half of April, and would be due for the second doses by July beginning. “By the middle of July, the state will have a large number of fully vaccinated people in the 45+ category. There should be some recognition of this fact by exempting such citizens from the RT-PCR requirement while entry,” he said. Arundhati Gupta, a city-based working professional whose family is in Chandigarh, said, “Reuniting with family members in other states has become difficult, as returning to Maharashtra will require a negative report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/talks-on-rt-pcr-relief-for-flyers-reaching-state-take-off/articleshow/83558399.cms||Neha Madaan

Prices of the flats ranged from Rs 80 lakhs to Rs 2.18 crore. A division bench comprising justices CT Ravikumar and K Haripal considered appeals filed by DLF Home Developers Ltd over the awards in favour of allottees of DLF Riverside project at Chilavannoor in Kochi. Five of the flats were promised to be handed over in 2010 while one was to be delivered in 2011. The arbitration claims were filed in 2015. Awards passed by the arbitrator were later upheld by an additional district judge and these decisions were challenged by DLF before the high court in the appeals. Total prices for the flats booked by the claimants were Rs 1.32 crore, including two car parking spaces; Rs 1.48 crore; Rs 2.18 crore, including two car parking spaces; Rs 80.19 lakh; Rs 2.19 crore, including two car parking spaces; and Rs 1.65 crore. For the flat of Rs 1.32 crore, the arbitrator had given an award of Rs 2.32 crore. An award of Rs 2.6 crore was ordered for the flat of Rs 1.48 crore. Flat worth Rs 2.18 crore secured an award of Rs 3.82 crore whereas the flat of Rs 80.19 lakh got an award of Rs 1.35 crore. For the flat of Rs 2.19 crore, the award was Rs 3.45 crore while Rs 2.87 crore was the award for the flat of Rs 1.65 crore. The division bench said it does not find any reason to hold that the awards are infected with patent illegality as alleged. In fact, there is no illegality at all in the awards, the court said. No compensation was awarded by the arbitrator and only a refund of the principal amount with interest was ordered, the high court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dlf-flats-hc-rules-in-favour-of-allottees/articleshow/83555922.cms||---
---||Goa||Tourism sector will open once positivity rate drops under 5%: Goa government to TTAG||PANAJI: The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa has said that the government has informed it that the state’s hospitality sector would open fully only after the positivity rate falls under 5%. “The government is positive about throwing open the tourism sector,” its president Nilesh Shah told TOI after a delegation met chief minister Pramod Sawant and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar. “Currently, hotels are not closed, but the government will permit full-fledged opening of the industry when the case positivity rate is below 5%.” Shah said that TTAG has insisted that tourism has to be started at the earliest with all protocols in place, and that tourists who are vaccinated must be allowed entry into the state freely. He said that others may be permitted entry on production of a Covid-19 negative certificate, and that kiosks be set up through private bodies to let those who wish to visit get tested at the entry point. “We told the government that the state should be projected as a safe destination. The key to opening is vaccination. We can’t keep the industry closed. The livelihoods of lakhs of people dependent on tourism are at stake,” Shah said. Over the past two weeks, the case positivity rate has ranged from 10-15%, and only on two days did it fall below 10%. The TTAG has also placed its various demands seeking help for the distressed industry. The body of hoteliers and tourist trade stakeholders again asked the government that hikes in license fees and registration charges that came into force a few months ago be kept in abeyance till the industry stabilises. “The garbage levy has to be paid even as hotels are closed,” he said. “Hotels have received notices from the electricity department for non-payment of bills. We requested a deferment in payment of bills for a few months without attracting late fees.” He said the government was sympathetic towards their demands, and that they are hopeful they would get some relief shortly. He also said that chief secretary Parimal Rai, who was also part of the meeting, told TTAG that the industry must ensure that its workforce gets vaccinated. A lot of hotels employ individuals from Nepal, but they will not able to get vaccinated here, he said. “This was brought to the notice of the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-sector-will-open-once-vity-rate-drops-under-5-govt-to-ttag/articleshow/83555878.cms||Bindiya Chari

The Maharashtra government issued a circular making it mandatory for 50% teachers of Classes I to IX to go to their schools. Though the circular did not specify what teachers are expected to do in schools, principals said they may ask teachers to take online lessons from classrooms. For Class XI, 100 per cent attendance of lecturers/professors has been made mandatory. The state even wants all Class X and XII teachers to be in their schools and colleges to carry out assessment work to declare the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School (HSC) results. For Class X, assessment work is in progress. Teachers have to complete tabulation of marks by June 20. The results committee in each school has time till June 30 to upload the tabulated marks. The results are expected in mid-July. For Class XII, the state is still to announce the marking process. All clerical staff of educational institutes have also been directed to report to schools. However, many teachers who have to travel long distances to get to work have expressed displeasure over not being allowed to take local trains. On Monday, teachers across MMR protested by travelling ticketless to schools and voluntarily paying fines. Teachers have threatened to intensify their agitation if their demand to board trains are not met. Rajesh Pandya, vice-president of Teachers Democratic Front, said that aided schools have not got government gra-nts since last year. “How will the teachers come to school and teach online. Schools do not have adequate net connectivity,” said Pandya. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad has assured teachers that a positive decision on train travel will come soon. Gaikwad, a teacher by profession, on Tuesday interacted with students online. She said no student would be denied online education over non-payment of fees. She said action will be taken against institutes denying education to students. She responded to students’ queries on physical schools reopening by saying that it will depend on Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-50-class-i-ix-teachers-to-attend-school-x-xii-100/articleshow/83559499.cms||Sandhya Nair

The fact is that two-wheeler market has witnessed a steady decline in sales during 15 months of pandemic, but the four-wheeler segment has consistently seen an upward trend. Seeking protection from Covid-19 infection has been one of the reasons for this upward trend. Market sources said that all the segments, especially the affordable SUVs, have been in demand during the pandemic. Sales of the entry level vehicles have also been in great demand as a large number of people are migrating from two-wheelers to cars. This trend is visible even in the second-hand vehicle market of the four-wheelers. Ashish Pande, president of Bhopal automobile dealers association (BADA) said, “There has been a rise of 16.8 per cent in the four-wheeler market between the first lock down to second lockdown.”  He said, easy finance is available for the four-wheelers and that has been one of the reasons for increase in sales. “ This is not the case with two-wheelers. Moreover, the two-wheeler finance rates are also higher”, he added. For two-wheelers the rate of interest is about 13 per cent, compared to 8-9 per cent for four-wheelers, a bank official said. Rupesh Awasthi, a government employee said, “ I have gone for a budget SUV. Earlier the SUVs would cost over Rs 15 lakh but now a range of SUVs is available for less than Rs 10 lakh.” He went on to add, “This would not only allow me to go to the office in my own vehicle but I can also travel longer distance comfortably avoiding the trains or bus, where there is greater risk of catching coronavirus infection”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-safety-easy-finance-fuel-four-wheelers-sales/articleshow/83555897.cms||Deshdeep Saxena
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘I’ve become a father sir, please send me sukhdi’||AHMEDABAD: Narendrasinh Zala, a head constable at Ranpur police station in Botad district, recently wrote an application to his police inspector boss, saying he had just had a son. “Following the birth of my son, I request you to please send sukhdi (a traditional Gujarati sweet made of wheat flour, ghee and jaggery)”. Once the application is received, the sukhdi is officially sanctioned and delivered along with gifts for the baby. In a society where the norm is parents distributing sweets to their family and friends, such an application may pique curiosity. It turns out that Ranpur is probably the only police station which has this tradition of taking the healthy sweet to the new parents as a gesture of love and care. The in-charge police inspector of Ranpur police station, N C Sagar, said that before 2014, the police station was in the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad rural police. “The tradition of police station personnel visiting the house of the colleague who has become a new parent is many decades old. The idea was that young cops who get transferred here do not have their parents staying with them. In such cases, senior colleagues take sukhdi for the new mother and gifts for the child. It gives a sense of family to the new parents,” said Sagar. He said that sukhdi is the sweet for which the new parent cop applies irrespective of whether the child is a boy or a girl. “It is a good tradition for young parents like us. My child was born on May 15 and I applied for sukhdi. It is our official way of informing the office about the child’s birth too,” said Zala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ive-become-a-father-sir-please-send-me-sukhdi/articleshow/83555957.cms||Ashish Chauhan

However, Covid treatment in both hospitals was free. Because of this, employees are being refused compensation,” he said.

---||Kochi||Enrica Lexie case: SC closes criminal case against Italian marines in India||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday brought the curtain down on nine-year-old criminal proceedings and diplomatic wrangle over trial of two Italian marines for the killing of two fishermen off the Kerala coast in lieu of Rs 10 crore additional compensation paid by Rome and chalked out modalities for handing over the money to the victims’ families. In view of the decision of the arbitral tribunal under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) already accepted by the India, a bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and M R Shah made arrangements for investment of the compensation amount — Rs 4 crore each to the families of the dead fishermen and Rs 2 crore to the owner of boat St Antony — so that the families did not fritter it away. Writing the order for the bench, Justice Shah said as per the award, Italy is mandated to begin criminal trial proceedings against the two Marines — Massimilano Latorre and Salvatore Girone — without any loss of time. “Now, the Republic of Italy shall resume its criminal investigation in the events of February 15, 2012, and it is further directed that the Union of India, Republic of Italy and the State of Kerala shall cooperate with each other in pursuit of that investigation,” it added. This means, the evidence and statements of witnesses gathered by both Kerala police and National Investigation Agency (NIA), which was entrusted with the case later, would be required to be handed over to the prosecution department of Rome for start of the trial against the two marines, who while on board ship Enrica Lexie had fired upon the boat St Antony killing two fishermen, allegedly suspecting them to be pirates. On the compensation of Rs 10 crore paid by Italy over and above the Rs 2.17 crore already paid by it to the families of victims, the bench said, “We are satisfied that the amount of compensation of Rs 10 crore over and above the ex-gratia amount of compensation already paid to the heirs of the deceased fishermen offered and deposited by the Republic of Italy, can be said to be a reasonable amount of compensation and can be said to be in the interest of heirs of the deceased. We are of the view that this is a fit case to close all proceedings in India including criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. Justices Banerjee and Shah said, “However, at the same time, while disbursing the amount of compensation to the heirs of the deceased fishermen, ie Rs 4 crore to the dependants/heirs of each deceased, their interest is also required to be protected so that the amount of compensation paid to them is not frittered away, by investing the amount in the name of the dependants/heirs of each deceased in a fixed deposit in a nationalised bank for some time and they will be paid the periodical interest accrued thereon.”” The bench transferred the amount of Rs 10 crore deposited in the SC registry by the Union of India to the Kerala High Court and requested the HC chief justice “to nominate a judge to pass appropriate order of disbursement/investment of the amount to be paid to the heirs of each deceased (Rs 4 crore each) so as to protect the interest of the heirs and ensure that the compensation is duly received by the heirs and not diverted/misappropriated”. “The order of disbursement/investment be passed after hearing the heirs of each deceased and appropriate order be passed, protecting the best interest of the heirs of each deceased. Remaining amount of Rs 2 crore will be paid to the boat owner by an account payee cheque,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/enrica-lexie-case-sc-closes-criminal-case-against-italian-marines-in-india/articleshow/83556037.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Ahmedabad||Avian migrants diverted flights from Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Nalsarovar is known for attracting flamingos, but this year few birds have flown in. Nalsarovar is the only Ramsar site in the state. Unesco’s Ramsar convention, named after the Iranian city where the convention was inked in 1971, seeks to protect wetlands of international importance. As for the avian visitors to Gujarat, Thol is another birding site. It lies on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. Thol has not drawn many birds either this year. But bird sightings have increased in village ponds in Sanand and Vadla compared to the previous years. Sources in the forest department said that bird activity has become more pronounced at Dasada and even in some areas of Bhavnagar city. The officials said that high water levels at Nalsarovar have deterred greater and lesser flamingos from flocking to the tourism zone. The officials said that this is the second consecutive year in which the lake has recorded high water levels. Because of heavy rain in Surendranagar last year, the lake’s water gauge was submerged. A senior forest department officer said that in September last year, the water level was about 7 feet. He said even the approach road to Nalsarovar lake near the interpretation zone was under water, which made it difficult for vehicles to move.  The officer said that by February this year, the water level had dipped to 5 feet. On June 15, when the bird season has ended, the state is preparing for the monsoon. But even today, both the lakes have 3 feet of water. “Good rain is predicted this year,” an officer said. “So the water level is likely to touch 7 feet again. That will not be hospitable for the birds.” This year, Nalsarovar offered a good opportunity for boating as there were very few birds in the tourism zone. For serious birdwatching, one had to go to the southernmost part of the lake which is shallow. This area had a significant congregation of birds; flamingos were spotted too. The birds’ return migration began by the first week of March and the water level was about 5 feet in the tourism zone. “A level below 3 feet is favourable for the birds,” the official said. The officials said that even in Thol, heavy rains in the catchment area had made water levels rise. With temperatures remaining low, evaporation was patchy and migratory birds, including flamingos, gave the lake a miss. Brijesh Chaudhary, the deputy conservator of forests, said: “This year both Thol and Nalsarovar had few birds in the tourism zone. During summers, temperatures were lower compared to the previous years.” He added: “Hence, evaporation of water from the lake was not as desired.” A senior officer in Gandhinagar said that heavy rain in Surendranagar and nearby areas and the release of water from Narmada dam have made Nalsarovar’s levels surge. None of the Narmada canal branches passes anywhere near Nalsarovar or its catchment areas. But a forest department study has found that Narmada water released into Bhogavo river and distributary canals of Narmada overflow into small rivulets which empty into Nalsarovar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/avian-migrants-diverted-flights-from-abad/articleshow/83558475.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The elephants, however, returned to the forest after a few hours without attacking anyone and damaging any properties. A forest officer said the tuskers had attempted to enter the human habitat on Monday night. “But we chased them back into the forest. They came out of the forest through the tribal village of Dhanikandi on Tuesday morning and entered the Muttathuvayal tank, which is located about 2km from the Boluvampatti forest range.” Within minutes after the tuskers were spotted in the tank, rumours started to spread that the they were trapped in the tank that was filled with fresh water. The villagers alerted the forest department, following which the frontline staff and senior officials reached the spot. “The tuskers were not trapped in the tank, as its bed was not too muddy. We formed three teams comprising officials from the Coimbatore and Madukkarai forest ranges to monitor the movement of the tuskers and prevent any untoward incidents, since the tank was located within the human habitat. A drone was also deployed for the purpose,” the officer said. Around 12.30pm, he said, the tuskers returned to the Boluvampatti reserve forest area. Meanwhile, all the 28 captive elephants in the Anamalai Tiger Reserve tested negative for Covid-19 on the day. The forest department had collected rectal swabs from the animals and sent them to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Izatnagar in Uttar Pradesh for testing on June 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tuskers-stray-into-human-habitat-return-quietly-after-bathing/articleshow/83555961.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The committee said that the deaths were not linked to the vaccine. In Telangana, a 52-year-old died on January 19 after receiving the Covishield vaccine. The committee termed the death as being due to “acute pneumonia with accelerated hypertension with left ventricle failure with underlying co-morbidities — kyphoscoliosis (abnormal curve of spine) — with restrictive lung disease.” While one death in AP, that of a 51-year-old on February 9, 2021, after taking the Covishield vaccine was termed by the AEFI committee as a “sudden cardiac death with underlying co-morbidities — hypertension...” , the other death, on February 13, 2021, that of a 47-year-old, also after taking Covishield vaccine was attribute by the AEFI committee to “Anaphylaxis to injection ceftriaxone”. The committee announced the causality assessment results of 31 reported serious adverse events of Covid-19 vaccination. “Till first week of April 2021, the reporting rate is 2.7 deaths per million vaccine doses administered and 4.8 hospitalisations per million vaccine doses administered. Deaths and hospitalisations as serious adverse events does not automatically imply that the events were caused due to vaccine. Of the 31 causally assessed cases, 18 were classified as having inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental - not linked to vaccination), 7 were classified as indeterminate, 3 cases were found to be vaccine product related, 1 was anxiety related reaction and 2 cases were found to be unclassifiable,” the committee revealed. Telangana director of public health (DPH), Dr G Srinivasa Rao, was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-deaths-post-vaccine-in-t-ap-coincidental-aefi-committee/articleshow/83555994.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

During the hearing of a suo motu PIL on Covid-19, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia refused to issue any direction to the government on various issues raised by different lawyers, and asserted that there is no emergency situation now. The bench said that the issues raised by the lawyers are perennial in nature and can be dealt with in future when the third wave of Covid-19 comes. The judges said, “Our concern is third wave…We will concentrate our energy on what is going to come. Let us focus on the main issue…” In response to demand of implementation of priority treatment in vaccination to staff and inmates of special homes, the judges said that these are very important issues. “The government has to be conscious on this and it will have to do the needful for special people and special children,” they said, adding, “We should focus on the main issue of triple T – testing, tracing and treatment – so that third wave can be avoided, if possible.” On the need of special kids in Covid wards, the judges expressed hope that new health secretary Manoj Aggarwal would be aware of the issue as he was also secretary to the department of social justice and empowerment. On children’s health and education requirements, the court said that it is a paramount issue, but would be taken care of at the micro-level and not at macro-level. Further hearing has been posted on July 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/focus-on-3t-to-prevent-third-wave/articleshow/83556004.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Hospitals hold or reduce Sputnik V purchases citing service charge cap||PUNE: A few private hospitals in the city, citing cold storage costs and the cap on perdose service charge, have now put on hold their Sputnik V purchases or reduced procurement volumes. The Centre has said private hospitals cannot charge more than Rs 780 for a shot of Covishield; Rs 1,410 for Covaxin; and Rs 1,145 for Sputnik V. The per dose prices include taxes and the capped service charge of Rs 150. “We have put Sputnik V purchase on hold. Cold storage requirements and other expenses exceed the service cap of Rs 150,” said Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati Hospital. Before the service charge cap, Bharati had planned to procure 5,000 doses. Noble Hospital in Hadapsar — one of Sputnik’s trial sites in India — has drastically cut procurement. “Before the service charge cap, we had ordered 50,000 Sputnik V doses. We have now decided to cut that order to 5,000 doses. The storage and logistical costs have rendered the exercise unviable, even if we try to provide the vaccine on no-profit, no-loss basis,” said H K Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital. Two more large hospitals in the city — Ruby Hall Clinic and Jehangir Hospital — are also not thinking of procuring Sputnik V. “A per-dose service charge of Rs 150 is not at all financially viable for us. Hospitals’ core responsibilities are medical care and not vaccination, which is the government’s responsibility. We have been helping out with the vaccination programme,” said Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic. Vinod Sawantwadkar, CEO of Jehangir Hospital said, “The Rs 150 cap is a setback in attempts to push the vaccine drive forward. We need to be conservative as economics matters for private players.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hospitals-stop-or-reduce-sputnik-v-purchases-citing-service-charge-cap/articleshow/83558426.cms||Umesh Isalkar

An Analysis of the accused in these cases reveal that majority of them to be either youths trying to make a quick buck or members of the medical fraternity including doctors, ward boys, and medical store employees sneaking out some stock and selling it for a premium price. The Gujarat police recorded 45 offences of profiteering, making spurious injections or hoarding of remdesivir injections in a matter of 35-40 days. Out of 149 accused, 129 were apprehended till June 5. “In a recent case in Surat, a ward boy was apprehended by police after a doctor complained that his signature had been forged to procure remdesivir stock,” said a senior state police official. “The incident came to light when his letter was sent back, saying that som e medicines had already been issued based on his prescription. Surprised, the doctor went to the centre and found they had a prescription on his letterhead — one he had never issued.” CCTV at the spot revealed that a ward boy known to the doctor had come to get the stock. “The letter has been sent to forensic science experts so that we can charge the accused for forgery. The vials have been seized from the accused,” said the official. Police caught fraudsters and blackmarketeers by sending decoys. “Out of 1,130 injections seized in 45 offences, 45% were genuine injections, which were sent back to respective centres or hospitals, whereas 55% of injections were found to be spurious. Some of the seized stock was very sophisticated with use of some antivirals or antibiotics found easily in market. However, in some cases, it was a mix of just basic ingredients sold off for thousands of rupees,” said an investigator from Ahmedabad city police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/remdesivir-con-med-staff-among-predators/articleshow/83556011.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Some relief for chemical makers||Ahmedabad: Even as many sectors such as real estate, textiles and engineering are reeling from high raw material costs, the chemical industry has heaved a sigh of relief with the reduction in prices of raw materials used by them. “As far as the chemical industry is concerned, prices of several raw material have begun easing. The prices of aniline oil, acetic, acetic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, phthalic acid have started falling,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Gujarat). According to industry players, the per kilogram price of aniline has dipped from Rs 200 to Rs 150, while that of acetic anhydride has decreased from Rs 200 to Rs 170-160. “The raw material prices have already reduced by10-15% and they are expected to decline further in days to come. This has come as a major relief for the industry,” Patel added. The price of several basic raw materials used in chemical industry had more than doubled in May and April. The surge was mainly caused by supply and distribution disruptions and hiccups in imports caused by the pandemic. The situation has now improved on both these fronts, said industry players. “The industry can plan for 2 to 4 months if standard prices of raw materials are maintained. Amid price volatility, a manufacturer may have to incur losses if he procures raw material at high cost, and then raw material prices drop suddenly.” Similarly, plastic processors have also seen prices of different type of polymers, a key raw material used for making plastic products, easing from their peak levels. “The prices of various polymers largely remained firm through the fiscal 2020-21 and had shot up in the range of 50-170%,” said a member of Gujarat State Plastic Manufacturers Association (GSPMA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/some-relief-for-chemical-makers/articleshow/83556007.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Second shot delay, CoWin glitches could have led to ‘duplicates’||Several healthcare and frontline workers in the state have said finding a second dose after March, when the drive was opened to other citizens, had become difficult because vaccination centres seemed confused by the new rules and addition of groups. “It’s difficult to say why so many had to re-register with different phone numbers to get the second shots. This could have happened in case of healthcare (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) who found themselves unable to get their second shots after the vaccine drive opened for citizens. These workers may have re-registered as citizens (with different phone numbers) under the 60-plus or 45-plus age groups,” said state immunisation officer D N Patil. A senior state health official said those with duplicate entries used two different phone numbers to get their first and second shots. “So in the records, both entries of the same beneficiary show him/her due for a second dose even though the person has been fully vaccinated. Before the data on duplicate entries was compiled, the state had over 2-2.5 lakh beneficiaries due for a second dose. That number is now down to 1-1.3 lakh approximately.” A final count of duplicate entries is expected in the next few days. Patil said early CoWin glitches may have also played a role. Some HCWs and FLWs may have re-registered with new mobile numbers when they found their original numbers were not being detected due to technical issues. “These double entries have caused an apparent increase in the number of healthcare and frontline workers in Maharashtra being shown as due for their second shot though they have received both jabs,” he added. A representative from a top city hospital, who has been involved in the vaccination drive for months now, said second-dose beneficiaries do not have to re-register when they visit a site. “The second shots are given based on the same CoWin registration (the same mobile number and ID) used for the first. Using these details, a vaccinator can see on CoWin that a first dose has been given. What could’ve happened is people may have re-registered with another phone number to get the second shot, which created two separate records of the same beneficiary,” the official explained. Such beneficiaries will also be unable to get a fully vaccinated certificate as both their accounts will show only first doses. In the district, more than 2,172 duplicate entries have been detected in rural Pune. In PMC limits, the number is nearly 2,570. District immunisation officer Dr Sachin Edake said officials have now been asked to correct duplicate entries, details of which have already been sent to the state. “Dummy sessions will be created on CoWin to update details of ‘duplicate’ beneficiaries where vaccination will be shown as ‘done’,” said Edake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2nd-shot-delay-cowin-glitches-could-have-led-to-duplicates/articleshow/83556178.cms||Neha Madaan

The funding for production will be given to Jhabua, Alirajpur, Barwani and Dhar districts where Kadaknath is predominantly found. Animal husbandry Minister Prem Singh Patel said the districts have already been shortlisted for Kadaknath production and self-help groups will be encouraged. This will create employment opportunities for the local tribal population, the minister said. Officials informed that the assistance would be to a thousand beneficiaries in Jhabua, Alirajpur, Barwani and Dhar districts. Each beneficiary would be provided 100 vaccinated chicks. A total of one lakh chicks would be given. Beneficiaries would also be given medicine, food, shelter and training to develop the chicks. The chicks would be provided from the government poultry farms in Jhabua, Indore, Bhopal, Sagar Gwalior and Chhindwara. The government would give the beneficiaries buyback option of the grown up bird or they can also sell it in the open markets, officials said, adding, that the project is an extension after the central government sanctioned a sum of Rs 3 crore for breeding of Kadaknath in MP last year. It would be done at a larger scale this time. Kadaknath famous for its delicious black meat is rich in protein value and less on calorie count when compared to other chicken breeds. It belongs to the MP. The Geographical Indications Registry issued a certificate to the state in July 2018. GI registered Jhabua Kadaknath black chicken meat to geographical area, MP. Kadaknath is found mainly in the tribal district of Jhabua. This poultry is reared mainly by the tribal community of Bhil & Bhilala in the districts of Jhabua and Dhar and is locally known as Kalamasi and is used for treatment of many diseases, besides being considered an aphrodisiac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/govt-to-privide-rs-10cr-aid-for-kadaknath-production/articleshow/83555983.cms||---

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also asked the MSME department to frame a policy to encourage rice mills and ethanol production in the state. Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, home minister Narottam Mishra said, “Council of ministers today approved the subsidy on tariff fixed by the Electricity Regulatory Commission. The subsidy is given to farmers for the 5 h p (horsepower) and 10 h p pumps. Annual tariff for a 5 h p pump is Rs 51,000 of which the farmer has to pay only Rs 3,500 while the government pays a subsidy of Rs 47,500.” The home minister said that subsidy for farmers with 10 h p pumps is close to Rs One lakh per year which is paid by the state while the farmer needs to pay a very nominal sum. “Added to this there are 98 lakh domestic consumers who get electricity at Rs 100 per month. The power subsidy burden on the state treasury is Rs 21,000 crores,” he specified. Cabinet also approved milling of the government acquired paddy at four different slabs from Rs 50 to Rs 200 per quintal. “The cabinet made two decisions in connection with paddy milling. One is to make a policy to encourage setting-up of rice processing mills in the state and two, to promote the ethanol manufacturing industry. Chief minister asked the MSME department to start work on the policy framing soon so the rice milling problem can be solved,” Narottam Mishra said. For government employees, the cabinet agreed to implement the Teohar Agrim Yojana to give cash benefits. The home minister claimed, “For Corona first wave, cabinet approved giving Rs 300 crore to government employees with cash payments between Rs 4,000 and Rs 2,000. Also, the cabinet approved giving Rs 1,000 grant to local cartpullers, vendors, puncture repairmen. There are six lakh such beneficiaries who the government has sanctioned payment of Rs 60 crore.” Before the cabinet meeting started, chief minister Chouhan told the council of ministers that he will hold one on one meetings with each of them. Ministers will be informed when they are scheduled to meet the CM for review meetings of their departments. Furthermore, the chief minister instructed that the committees formed under the ministers on Monday will hold its meeting within the next two to three days and submit their reports by June 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cabinet-approves-subsidy-in-power-tariff-for-farmers/articleshow/83556028.cms||---

At least 33 patients have recovered from the disease in the district. Despite black fungus being a notifiable disease, the health department officials say they do not have data on the number of deaths due to the fungus. However, doctors say that the mortality rate of the fungal disease in the district is on par with the national mortality rate of around 20%. The main challenges include toxicity of the conventional form of amphotericin and eradicating the fungus once it reaches the brain. Though the number of mucormycosis cases in the district has dropped to single-digit, the remaining active cases include many in intensive care units or on long term treatment of anti-fungal drugs. “Mucormycosis is a lot more difficult and complicated to treat compared to Covid-19, because patients need to be hospitalized for two to three weeks and given medication for even up to four months,” Covid-19 nodal officer at PSG Hospital Dr A Murali said. At present, the hospital has more than 20 black fungus patients under treatment. “We do see 20% of the patients succumbing to the disease,” he added. Other super speciality hospitals also report a death rate of 10% to 20%. The main issue with treating the disease seems to be the non-availability of lyposomal Amphotericin B. “Since we don’t get that drug easily, we procure and administer conventional Amphotericin which is the drug of choice. However, the drug’s toxicity is very high often leading to creatinine levels worsening,” dental surgeon at KMCH Hospital Dr Saravanan said. “The other issue is that we have to do a major surgery on the face to remove the infected parts leading to disfiguration including removing an eye if it had reached the eye-ball or orbit or cleaning out the sinus tissue,” ENT surgeon at Royal Care Hospital Dr Chockalingam said. Despite the choice of a drug and surgery, they say saving patients whose infection has reached the brain takes many months. “It is difficult to debride parts of the brain, and during surgery, we see that it has spread to many crucial nerves and blood vessels. So, the infection takes weeks to weed out,” Dr Murali said. Doctors say it is crucial that patients come at the earliest stage. “It is ideal that patients come when the fungus is still in their nasal cavity and has not reached their eye’s orbit or eyeball,” Dr Chockalingam said. “Many patients come to us unconscious because it has reached their brain or with eye swelling,” he said. “So far patients whose infection has moved downwards towards the palate have recovered well, but ideally patients should start treatment before it moves up towards the eye—because then we must remove the eyeball,” Dr Saravanan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mucormycosis-cases-rise-to-123-in-district/articleshow/83556048.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Few buses and fewer seats prolong wait for Aapli bus||NAGPUR: Aapli Bus commuters using the service after easing of the lockdown-like curbs are facing severe hardship in reaching their destination due to poor frequency of buses. The commuters have to wait for at least one to two hours for a ride as NMC’s transport department is plying only 126 buses. TOI visited Mor Bhavan, city’s central bus stand and Maharajbagh Road on Monday and Tuesday, and saw long queues of private sector employees at both the places waiting to board Aapli Buses. The Break The Chain rules, enforced due to Covid-19 pandemic, do not allow any standing passenger on the buses. These rules coupled with limited number of buses have increased the problems faced by the travellers. In many areas, passengers were seen jostling for the limited number of seats available. Naresh Kunte, who works in a private firm in Pardi, said he needs to change buses at Sitabuldi during his commute from Anant Nagar. The waiting time now has increased a lot. “At Anant Nagar, I had to wait for nearly an hour for a bus and another half an hour or more at Sitabuldi to board a bus for Pardi. It took nearly two-and-a-half hours to reach my office, which I otherwise used to commute in an hour,” he said. “The onus of maintaining Covid distancing lies on us, and commuters often fight with us when told to get down citing rules,” explained a conductor at Mor Bhavan. Passengers who couldn’t board from originating points have to wait even longer, as buses running with full permissible seating capacity do not stop unless a passenger wishes to get down. “They should just increase the number of buses if the passenger volume has gone up,” said Manjusha Ramteke, a government employee. TOI also spotted chaos and confusion at Akashwani Chowk as state government employees scrambled to get a seat in the bus. One employee said since the buses were for far-off areas like Nandanvan and Hudkeshwar, everyone tried to get in. Most buses reach the bus stop nearly half full, so many miss the bus and have to wait for second one. Most of the Aapli Buses are plying from originating point to the last destination only. Sources from the transport department too confirmed that the footfall on city buses has increased with the lifting of restrictions. Citing example, a source said on May 19, the earning per kilometre (EPK) was Rs11.99 and earning per bus was Rs27.47. Similarly, on June 9, EPK was Rs12.91 and EPB was Rs28.35 and now EPK has touched Rs18.30 and EPB crossed Rs40.45. NMC’s additional municipal commissioner Jalaj Sharma said the civic body will increase the number of Aapli Buses within a couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/few-buses-and-fewer-seats-prolong-wait-for-aapli-bus/articleshow/83556032.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

They thronged EB offices since TNEB personnel had not taken house-to-house reading due to Covid restrictions last month. In Villapuram, many came to the electricity office demanding to know how they could pay bill for consumption of power that had not been metered. “We have been trying to save on our power bill by cutting down the usage as I do not have a job now,’’ said K Thangapandian, a teacher. However, at the EB office, staff asked him to pay the amount he paid in June 2020. “I paid Rs 1,500 last year, but this year it would definitely be less. I was expecting a bill of less than Rs 1,000,’’ he said. Many people in Sellur, Avaniapuram and Chinthamani were told by TNEB staff to pay last month’s bill amount which irked many who had not come ready to pay. Gomathypuram-Thendral Nagar residents welfare association took it upon itself to contact the local EB office, which guided them on how to take their readings and send them by mail. Subsequently, they were informed about the amount to be paid. The association also employed a person to help elderly residents take the reading on their cellphones and send via mail. Tangedco senior assessment officer M Pandithurai said the method of asking people to take photographs of their meters and upload them through WhatsApp or mail had worked well during the lockdown. “Over 90% of the consumers sent them without any problem and it was assessed perfectly. The defaulters’ list is yet to be uploaded today and we do not know what action will be taken against those who failed to pay today,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/confusion-over-eb-bill-causes-difficulties-on-last-day-of-payment/articleshow/83556057.cms||---

---||Pune||In Maharashtra, CoWin shows 1 lakh duplicate signups for 2nd dose||PUNE: A massive data scrubbing exercise is under way on CoWin to find and remove names of people who registered twice on the system — under different phone numbers — to get their second vaccine dose. Public health officials said an early assessment has shown that Maharashtra has at least one lakh beneficiaries (mostly healthcare and frontline workers) with completed two-dose schedules still showing as due for their second doses. It's unclear how many such beneficiaries there are in other states. Officials said the problem started to emerge after calls were made to several phone numbers to confirm dosage. One state official confirmed that the number of duplicate entries — one person signed up with different phone numbers — is currently more than a lakh. The fact that two numbers were found against one person on CoWin proves some re-registered to get "two first shots", another official said. It's suspected that many healthcare and frontline workers, faced with delays, registered again under different phone numbers and IDs to get the much-needed second dose. These duplicate records are now being removed or merged, officials said. State immunization officer D N Patil said, “It’s difficult to say why so many had to re-register with different phone numbers to get the second shot. This could have happened in case of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) who found themselves unable to get the second shot after the vaccine drive opened for the general public. These workers may have re-registered as citizens (with different phone numbers) under the 60-plus or 45-plus age groups.”There was a scramble among HCWs and FLWs when drives opened for citizens after March. Many were worried about missing shots. Patil said early CoWin glitches may have also had a role. Some HCWs and FLWs likely re-registered with new mobile numbers when they found their original numbers were not being detected by the system. “These double entries have also caused a rise in the number of HCWs and FLWs in Maharashtra being shown as due for second shots, though they have received both jabs,” he said. A senior state health official said those with duplicate entries used different phone numbers to get their first and second shots. “So in the records, both entries of the same beneficiary show him/her due for a second dose even though the person has been fully vaccinated. Before the data on duplicate entries was compiled, the state had 2-2.5 lakh due for a second dose of both vaccines. That number is down to 1-1.25 lakh approximately,” he said. A representative from a city hospital said second-dose beneficiaries do not have to re-register when they visit a site. “The second shots are given based on the same CoWin signup (the same mobile number and ID) used for the first. Using these details, a vaccinator can see on CoWin that the first dose has been given. People may have re-registered with another phone number to get the second shot, which created two separate records of the same beneficiary.” In the district, more than 2,172 duplicate entries have been detected in rural Pune. In the PMC limits, the number is nearly 2,570. Such beneficiaries will also be unable to get a final vaccination certificate as both their accounts will show only first doses. District immunization officer Dr Sachin Edake said, “For the first dose, a beneficiary signs up with one mobile number and ID card. This beneficiary, for the second dose, may have given a different set of details, which led to a duplicate entry.” Edake said district officials have now been asked to find all duplicate entries. “In some cases, beneficiaries were given both doses, but their details were not uploaded by vaccinators on CoWin. Such beneficiaries are also showing up on the due list. Dummy CoWin sessions will be created to update details of such beneficiaries where vaccination will be shown as done,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-maha-cowin-shows-1-lakh-duplicate-signups-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/83558468.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||Matruchhaya ashram in Ponda begins boosting kids’ immunity ahead of third wave||MARGAO: Concerned by reports that children below 18 years of age could be more vulnerable during the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Matruchhaya, Dhavali, has already taken several measures to boost the immunity level of the children housed in their childcare ashrams. What’s significant is that help is steadily pouring in from members of the general public towards the cause. “Just the other day, a man who owns a medical store donated 45 containers of Chyawanprash to the ashram. People are joining hands with Matruchhaya in the interest of the children’s health, and we appreciate that gesture,” Dr Subhash Bhosale, pramukh, Matruchhaya Balika Kalyan Ashram, told TOI. Just as the second wave of the pandemic hit the state in March, 21 of its girls at the Balika Kalyan Ashram, Dhavali, had tested positive for Covid-19, following which the premises was declared as a micro-containment zone and inmates were home-quarantined. Matruchhaya has now focused on building the children’s immunity by providing them with a wholesome diet rich in vitamins and nutrients. While fruits are a regular item on the ashrams’ menu, the children are now being provided with kasai (herbal concoction) three times a day. “We have stopped giving them tea,” Bhosale said. “It has now been replaced with kasai. We have also stopped using sugar in their diet and have replaced it with jaggery. Regular consumption of kasai helps clear the respiratory tract and prevents throat infection. In the morning, milk is added to the kasai while at other times, it is plain kasai with jaggery. Children relish the herbal tea.” The health of the children of the ashrams is looked after by Dr Poornima Usgaokar, who has been offering her voluntary services to Matruchhaya for over 20 years. Bhosale said Usgaonkar visits Matruchhaya once every week for health check-ups. TOI had, in its Tuesday edition, pointed out Matruchhaya’s plans of throwing open its doors to children who have been orphaned by the pandemic. Following an appeal by Matruchhaya to the public to identify “pandemic orphans” so that they could be admitted at its child welfare ashrams, inquiries for admission have started pouring in. Matruchhaya has three child protection homes - Matruchhaya Balika Kalyan Ashram, Dhavali, Bal Kalyan Ashram, Talaulim and Balika Kalyan Ashram, Margao, which house altogether 110 children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/matruchhaya-begins-boosting-kids-immunity-ahead-of-third-wave/articleshow/83556045.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Instead, universities should the degrees to students’ homes by post, said Patel while addressing the VCs of Lucknow University and Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University. The governor said universities, along with colleges, should hand over the degrees to the students soon after convocation in a timely manner. She had earlier suggested preparing a database of names, phone numbers and addresses of the students for sending degrees by post. The governor also directed the two VCs to state criterion and detailed instructions in the advertisement for hiring faculty. This, she said, will ensure transparency in the appointment process. Stating that 33% of the newly elected gram pradhans are women, the governor suggested to the universities to hold webinar and training sessions to apprise them of the public welfare schemes. “Most of the women gram pradhans belong to self-help groups. Universities should make them aware of the malpractices in society like dowry, discrimination of male and female child, so that they can motivate women in their villages to not fall prey to such social evils,” Patel told the VCs. The governor asked the universities to arrange a visit to Nari Niketan hospitals for girls for a learning experience. She further directed universities to adopt children who have been orphaned after losing their parents to Covid-19. Universities should give a homely environment to such children, Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/send-degrees-to-students-by-post-guv-tells-universities/articleshow/83558516.cms||---

The low lying areas in Bicholim were inundated causing inconvenience to the people living in the vicinity. The rising level of Bicholim river and Valvanti river at Sakhali is being monitored closely by the Bichoilm taluka disaster management cell. Bicholim mamlatdar Pravinjay Pandit said they have kept pumps ready at Bicholim and Valvanti to pump out water to avoid flooding. On Monday, a shade opposite Bagayatdar Bazaar at Assonora was damaged after a tree fell on it, causing a loss of Rs 10,000 to the owner. In another incident on Tuesday, Radha Satudkar from Joshibhat, Surla, suffered an approximate loss of Rs 1 lakh as a tree came down on the wall of her house. Bicholim mamlatdar has directed talathi of Surla Saza Pramey Miringkar to conduct the site inspection of the house and submit a report to grant relief to Satudkar.

Technical education minister Subhash Garg gave the instructions on Tuesday while addressing a review meeting organised through video conferencing. This came as a sigh of relief for students who till now had confusion regarding the timing of the examinations. Garg said instructions had been issued to keep the model of examination of technical education students the same as last year. A proposal in this regard will be prepared and presented, the final call for which will be taken by the chief minister. He said the government’s endeavor was that the students should not be disappointed, they can complete their course on time and go for placements or for jobs. Garg has directed RTU and BTU to organise a meeting of BOM (Board of Management) in seven days. “In the budget announcement by CM Ashok Gehlot, colleges which are running as societies were to be made constituent colleges and the problems faced by their employees and teachers could be solved,” said Garg. The minister of state for technical education, while exhorting RTU and BTU universities to work as role models, said colleges should also be considered as a part of the university and their development should be done accordingly. He inspired the teachers of technical education during the corona period and said they should work on some such projects so that people can be helped through technology and their problems can be solved. For this, along with developing the app, technical equipment like robots and concentrators can be developed which can help the common man in fighting corona.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/final-yr-polytech-engg-exams-to-be-held-in-july-end/articleshow/83556052.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Health department team finds oxygen wastage in hospitals||KOLKATA: A health department team doing the rounds of government hospitals has come across glaring instances of oxygen management, poor monitoring of patients with respiratory distress and blatant flouting of its oxygen therapy protocol issued on May 12 to prevent wastage. Though oxygen demand has now dipped with the sharp drop in cases, the health department is keen to ensure that its protocol is followed to prevent a crisis in case cases shoot up again. “It has been observed that a patient was being given 50 litres of oxygen per minute through high nasal flow cannula even when the saturation level had reached 98%. Here, de-escalation or reduction in oxygen flow was needed but it was not being done,” reported the team of doctors that made the surprise visits to hospitals. In another instance, a patient with 90% oxygen saturation level was being given 8 litres of oxygen per minute with a face mask when the supply needed to be escalated to prevent a further drop in SpO2. In both instances, action was taken against the treating physician and nursing officer-in-charge. In the May 12 notification, the health department had called upon hospital superintendents to ensure prudent use of oxygen. It had also made an assistant superintendent in each government hospital responsible for overall management of supply and stock and to ensure its rational use. Besides, a ward sister was identified as nursing officer-in-charge of oxygen management. Floor sisters were empowered to regulate a patient’s oxygen flow to keep the saturation level at 92%-96% and at 88%-92% in case of patients with COPD, asthma or chronic lung disease. “There was an unprecedented surge in the demand for oxygen during the peak of the second wave. Non-judicious and excessive use of oxygen therapy without proper monitoring causes deleterious health effects and wastage of this precious resource leading to a shortage and waste of money,” said public health specialist Anirban Dalui. During the hospital visits, the health department team has also found laxity in documentation. The protocol required real-time data entry of Covid patients on the CPMS portal for monitoring and management of Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/health-dept-team-finds-o2-wastage-in-hospitals/articleshow/83556036.cms||---

The device, developed by Dr Naveen Ramagoni, is currently under trial by 75 dentists across the country. The idea was conceived in the wake of several dentists having to shut shop, fearing cross-infection due to the pandemic. “While there are measures like wearing a mask, gloves among others to prevent direct spread from person to person, there has been no such measure in place to prevent spread in clinical spaces. This is what triggered our innovation,” said the doctor, who is currently the scientific advisor to Legala Innovations, the company which will manufacture the device. The innovation not only seeks to mitigate risk of virus spread to healthcare workers who are exposed during procedures but also patients. The purpose of the device is to contain aerosols inside the box. The patient, doctor-friendly device is lightweight, has good visibility and is 84% effective in containment of helium, the lightest gas, delivered at six bars of pressure. The medical aerosol box with HEPA integrated suction system prevents the spread of aerosols out of the console unit in operation theatres, emergency rooms, procedure rooms, consultation rooms among others. The filters that collect the air, release it after filtering it. To prevent cross-infection in clinical spaces, the virus is isolated and run through a UV chamber to kill it before releasing air. “We are fine-tuning the device based on feedback from dentists using it, so that it can be used by other specialities as well. The innovation was developed with support of panel from the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) and Ankura Hospital for Women and Children among other organisations. We are currently being reviewed by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC),” the device’s innovator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-based-dentist-develops-aerosol-box-to-prevent-cross-infection-in-clinical-spaces/articleshow/83556072.cms||Amrita Didyala

Once the pandemic settles and international travel begins, the family will get together in this house which has a unique combined design of an aeroplane, train and a ship. The house belongs to T T Thomas who has been living in Bahrain for the last 30 years. When Thomas decided to spend his retired life in his native, the plan of this unique house struck his mind. Since he was involved in steel fabrication work in Bahrain, he put his expertise in the field to use for constructing his house of steel. “The house is a dedication to three main means of transport I have travelled in my life,” said Thomas. He said that the idea was his creation and during construction people mocked him. However, after the construction reached the final stages people started coming to see the wonder house. The 2200sq ft house has come up on 20 cents land near Mallappally town. Thomas planned to complete the construction within six months. However, the pandemic, shortage of workers and building material delayed it. “It took more than a year to complete. Building materials were purchased from Coimbatore and Pune,” said Thomas. The construction of the house was similar to the ones in the Middle East, says Thomas. The roof was made with sandwich panel and exteriors with side panel. V-board was used for interiors, says Thomas. The main material in the house is steel. Only 25 sacks of cement, sand and gravel was used for the construction, that too only for the basement, said Thomas, who owned a steel fabrication workshop in Bahrain. The house has three bedrooms, four wash rooms, one hall and kitchen. The balcony of one room is the cockpit of the plane. The train part is the entrance to the building, leading to the hall. All the doors are sliding ones. The sitout, hall and kitchen can be converted into a single big hall by sliding the partitions, said Thomas. Thomas is yet to calculate the total amount spent on the house. However, he is sure that it would be much lesser compared to concrete houses. He also says that the house is cool enough and there are no need for air conditioners. Thomas’s wife is working as a nurse in Bahrain and they have two sons, one of them studying in Kerala. Thomas is awaiting his wife and son’s arrival to start a new life in this wonder home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nri-builds-uniquely-shaped-home/articleshow/83556119.cms||---

The police said that the chargesheet was filed before the court on Monday. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba told TOI that the chargesheet includes names of Somya Gurjar, Ajay Singh, Paras Jain, Shankar Sharma and Prajapat. The sources in the city police informed TOI that cases were made out under chiefly under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty) of the IPC along with other relevant sections. “The investigation was conducted as per the norms. We had recorded statements of people involved in the case along with visits to the spots,” said a police official on condition of anonymity, adding that the police also spoke to the staffers present that day. The chargesheet was filed within 10 days after a case was registered at Jyoti Nagar police station following a high voltage drama on June 4. The Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater, commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh had alleged that he was attacked by BJP councillors inside mayor Somya Gurjar’s office. He claimed he had gone to meet the mayor to discuss the issue of making payment to the company collecting garbage as company worker was on the strike. Inside the mayor’s office, he alleged that he was pressured by councillors to give an order for an alternative arrangement to collect garbage. In the FIR subsequently filed at the police station, the commissioner alleged that when he was stepping out of the office to attend a meeting, some councillors mishandled him. Later on, a committee that was constituted by the state government to probe the incident at the JMC-Greater mayor’s office in its report also found allegations of manhandling to be true.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chargesheet-against-gurjar-4-others-in-officers-assault-case/articleshow/83556081.cms||---

Once located on the outskirts, the Aurangabad airport has now become part of the city due to rapid urbanization and acquisition of 182 acre of land needed for the proposed expansion may prove to be a stiff challenge for the authorities. The long-pending expansion involves extending the runway to 12,000 feet from the existing 9,300 feet, building a parallel taxiway, installation of solar panels and facilitating hangar for aircraft, among other infrastructure and facilities. Shaikh Arif, one of the competent authorities from the land records department, said the desired task of land measurement would be expedited. “There is no fixed time limit for accomplishing the task, but the same would be carried out as per the laid-down procedure at the earliest,” he said. The demand for expansion of Aurangabad airport received an official boost when former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had pledged Rs 200 crore for creating the necessary infrastructure, during a special cabinet meeting held in Aurangabad on October 4, 2016. The official surveys carried out in the past had identified certain residential properties from Chikalthana along with the land owned by farmers as well as Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, CIDCO and MHADA that are likely to come in way of the proposed expansion of Aurangabad airport. Ashish Garde, ex-president of Chamber of Marathawada Industries and Agriculture, said expansion of the airport was mooted since 2008. “The lack of official attention has been delaying the expansion which is essential considering upcoming Samridhhi Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Expressway, DMIC and Dry-Port projects. The government should facilitate desired flow of funds at the earliest for paying compensation towards land acquisition and other needs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-airport-faces-land-acquisition-challenge/articleshow/83548225.cms||---

In an affidavit filed in response to a PIL filed by the leader of opposition in the assembly Paresh Dhanani, the commissioner of food and drug control administration H G Koshia submitted that an inquiry is underway but cited the preliminary inquiry conducted by drug inspectors and the assistant commissioner in Surat. The report was submitted on June 12. The inquiry was commissioned in response to two representations by the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee alleging that a stock of 5,000 remdesivir vials was procured and distributed in violation of the law. The preliminary report said there does not appear to be any irregularity and violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, in the distribution of remdesivir injections from the Surat BJP The report also said that the distribution of remdesivir was made with a view to help relatives of Covid-19 patients. MLA Harsh Sanghavi, in his affidavit, said that the unprecedented situation required unprecedented action and they decided to help the people by procuring the injections in a large quantity. The preliminary inquiry, which was based on the statements of Sanghavi, procurement agencies and medical store owners, said that party workers procured injections on behalf of the relatives of patients from retail medical stores. On their request, the wholesaler, United Distributors, obtained it from the manufacturer and supplied the stock to Sanand-based Rimi Distributors. The stock was then supplied to two medical stores – New Piplod Medical Store in Surat and Shankar Medical Store in Navsari. The party workers got it from these two medical stores and with the help of doctors distributed the vials from the party office and Kiran Hospital in Surat after verifying prescriptions and Aadhaar cards of relatives of Covid-19 patients. During the inquiry, the authorities also collected receipts for payment made towards the procurement. Two receipts of Rs 6.47 lakh and Rs 3.23 lakh were supplied by Sanghavi with his affidavit.

Restrictions due to pandemic and skyrocketing fuel prices have driven the price of several items on the Jamai Shasthi spread through the roof. Himsagar and Langra, the two popular mango varieties preferred in Bengal, were selling at Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg respectively. Mutton was sold at Rs 750-800 per kg while Hilsa prices started at Rs 1,500. Sutanuka Bandyopadhyay has decided to deliver favourite food items of her son-in-law from the restaurant through a delivery app. “If I try to prepare them in the kitchen, I’ll end up spending more. I will offer puja for my daughter, son-in- law and granddaughter,” she said. Gopa Mitra from Dum Dum planned to invite her daughter and son-in-law but refrained from cooking on her own. Ananda Burman, a school teacher, found his generous budget had exceeded by Rs 700 at the end of the day. Nayeem Sheikh, a fruit trader at Lake Market, said: “We are burying fruits at a higher price from the wholesale market at Mechua. The growers are not getting the price, transport is taking away all the money,” he said. Amar Das, a fish vendor at Lake Market, said, “There is a high demand for Hilsa. But there is no fresh stock.” Mutton price was hovering around Rs 700 a kg even a week ago, and is now threatening to cross Rs 800 a kg. “The cost of transportation of goats from Bihar has gone up manifold. This is why price of mutton has also gone up steeply,” said Ershad Quereshi, a mutton shop owner at Gariahat. Chandana Maity, a school teacher, said, “There are some unscrupulous traders who tried to take advantage of the people’s compulsion before such occasions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/curbs-fuel-rates-send-veggie-fish-fruit-prices-soaring-on-jamai-shasthi-eve/articleshow/83556065.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Poor show in 2019, yet panel ayes road patcher hire||NAGPUR: Despite poor performance in repairing potholes on city roads earlier, the NMC’s standing committee on Tuesday gave nod to invite tenders for hiring Insta Road Patcher machine at a cost of Rs1.99 crore. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar told media persons that the civic body will first seek the machine’s performance report from the hotmix department before deciding on hiring the same. In 2019, the NMC had first hired the machine, which could be used even during rains, for Rs1.99 crore. The machine was supposed to help repair potholes faster and was hired for a year. However, it failed to give the desired results as repaired patchwork started peeling off within a fortnight. The hotmix department had submitted the proposal to hire the machine given the poor condition of tar roads in the city, Bhoyar said and added that it was not the right time to submit the proposal. “Actually, the process to repair potholes should be started early so that motorists do not suffer during monsoon,” he pointed out. “Hence, the civic body is converting city roads with concrete ones,” he said. With completion of cement roads, slowly the complaints of citizens pertaining to pothole riddled roads will be a thing of the past, said Bhoyar. The panel also okayed the civic administration’s Rs1.14 crore proposal to shortlist a firm for setting up 12 small sewage treatment plants in gardens alongside nullahs. According to Bhoyar, it will be the first time that NMC will treat sewage water and use it for non-potable purposes like maintaining gardens. With this, the NMC will add another feather in its cap by using treated sewage water for maintaining the city’s lungs (gardens). Already, the NMC is providing 220MLD treated sewage water to Koradi thermal power station. The standing committee also gave its nod to appoint a new agency for mobile phone networks. For this, the NMC will spend Rs50 lakh per annum, said Bhoyar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poor-show-in-2019-yet-panel-ayes-road-patcher-hire/articleshow/83556079.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Amika George, 21, daughter of Kishore and Nisha George, who became a torchbearer for young women battling the period issue in the UK has become the youngest recipient of the Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). At 17, Amika had started an online campaign that drew the attention of the British government to the matter. "I saw an article in the BBC on girls missing school every month as they found it difficult to afford pads," said Amika, who recollects being "shocked" and "angry". "So, I started the Free Periods petition calling on the government to take action." It caught on and she was encouraged by the positive response from young girls. She remembers getting an email from a 15-year-old, who "used to miss school every month because her mum wouldn't have money for food and heating. "She suffered in silence," recollects Amika. "But when the Free Periods scheme became available, she could go to school without any worries." Amika gets vocal about the taboo prevalent in society on the subject of menstruation. "We work to dismantle the taboo. It's so disappointing that in 2021 we still feel embarrassed to talk about periods," said Amika whose initiative 'Free Periods' is now a limited company "with an amazing team that works with schools to monitor the government scheme." "We hold the government to account," she says. The arrival of the pandemic posed another challenge. “Donations of pads to charities fell drastically as we were not able to leave our houses. The Covid crisis has shown us all the cracks in our communities and sadly it is women who have been hit the hardest,” Amika said. But the Cambridge University student is determined to fight on and she feels "thrilled to be able to represent young people who have felt unseen or forgotten, who have felt sidelined or misunderstood". Amika says that she wanted to accept the Honour to show that "as a young person of colour, who comes from an immigrant family, we hold so much power in our words and actions, and that we are being recognised as real political actors in spaces which were previously closed to us". "I know that my family and people in the Malayali community in Britain have suffered over the decades with racism and feeling like outsiders, and this award is for them," said Amika.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/uk-malayali-girl-gets-queens-honour/articleshow/83540897.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan reaches Delhi, to meet PM Narendra Modi & top BJP leaders||BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, on Wednesday. Chouhan's two-day visit to the national capital comes close on the heels of the party holding a series of review meetings in Bhopal, which had fueled speculation of an organisational reshuffle in the state. The meeting with the Prime Minister will mainly focus on Corona management in the state. The chief minister is also scheduled to meet BJP top brass to discuss party issues, said sources. Earlier in the day, Chouhan convened a meeting of his cabinet colleagues to discuss Covid management and threats.

Chouhan's visit to the national capital holds significance in view of the state's success in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. Prime Minister Modi has recently lauded the public participation model adopted by the Madhya Pradesh government for Corona management. Modi had also praised the formation of crisis management groups at the district, block and panchayat levels in the state where representatives of all political groups were involved to connect to the public. Madhya Pradesh has also succeeded in reducing the infection rate to 0.31% and increased the recovery rate to 98.4%.

---||Varanasi||Second Covid-19 wave hits export of veggies, mangoes from Varanasi||VARANASI: Ambitious plans to promote export of fresh green vegetables and fruits, especially mangos, from the farms of Varanasi and surrounding districts have been jolted in the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic that led to stopping of all international flight operations from the city. As procurement of goods including farm products is not proving possible in quantities up to 20 tonnes for export in one consignment, it has become difficult to operate cargo flights from LBS International Airport, Varanasi. The export of green vegetables and mangos from the orchards of district’s Rajatalab, Sevapuri and also from neighbouring districts has stopped. Contacted, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) assistant general manager CB Singh said, “The major reason green vegetables from Varanasi, Ghazipur and neighbouring districts of the region could not be exported is unavailability of international flights. Due to Covid-19 lockdown, direct flights for Sharjah and Dubai are not operating from the Varanasi airport.” Farm producer organisations of the region had explored markets in the Gulf countries for their fresh vegetables in April 2020 and had succeeded in sending three metric tonnes of green vegetables including gourd, cucumber and chilly to London amidst lockdown during the first wave of Covid. “However, this time no international flight is operating. The cargo flights for exporting goods and perishable items are available either from Lucknow or Delhi. If vegetable consignments are sent via Lucknow and Delhi, the cost of transportation will increase the price of produce,” said Singh explaining the reason why green vegetables could not be exported from the Varanasi region this time. “As procurement of 12-18 tonnes of green vegetables in one consignment has not been possible at Varanasi centre so far, direct cargo flights from here also could not be operated,” he added. Regarding mangos, Singh said, "The mango crop especially of Banarasi Langda variety has been badly hit by unfavourable weather conditions. The mangos in Varanasi and surrounding region could not be grown in their actual size, while preserving it for long was also not possible. Thus, FPOs and farmers declined exporting the produce to maintain goodwill in the newly explored international markets in Gulf and London." Despite lockdown, three MT fresh Banarasi Langda and Dussehri was exported to Dubai on May 28, 2020 while 1.5 MT fresh mango of Banarasi Langda, Dussehri, Chausa and Ramkeda had also been exported to London on June 14, 2020. Singh said that 8-10 consignments of green peas and other fresh green vegetables and five consignments of mangos had been sent through Varanasi airport. As APEDA had already done the branding of Banarasi Langda mangoes in Dubai and demands also rose, mangos of this variety were arranged from Azamgarh and a consignment was sent via Lucknow recently. “We have not lost all hope yet and are focusing on the Chausa mango crop of Varanasi and adjoining districts. If its quality is found as fit for export, it would be sent abroad,” he added. The region had not only made its presence felt in the fruit and green vegetable markets of Gulf and London, but a consignment of 80 metric tonnes of black rice produced by farmers of Chandauli was also exported to Australia on June 22, followed by another consignment being sent to Doha (Qatar). Incidentally, the export of black and other varieties of rice has not been hampered much as it is sent via road or sea route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/second-covid-19-wave-hits-export-of-veggies-mangoes-from-varanasi/articleshow/83556162.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Offices arrange for cars before reopening today||KOLKATA: All set to resume operations with physical attendance of 25% staff from Wednesday, some corporate offices are arranging for transport for their employees, while others are calling in only those who have their own vehicles.  The state on Monday issued a guideline, allowing offices to reopen with 25% staff at work. But as public transport—bus, train, Metro and ferry—has not resumed operations, commute could prove to be a challenge. Emami Ltd director Harsha V Agarwal pointed out only those who have their own vehicle could attend office. “We will abide by the government norms of maximum 25% staff attendance at office. Only employees with their own vehicles will be encouraged to attend office, but if they are hesitant about, we can allow them to work from home.” Merlin Group chairman Sushil Mohta said they had arranged for a car pooling system with seniors with own vehicles picking up others from nearby localities. “We are also arranging for car drop,” he added. But he felt the absence of public transport would be a problem. Echoing him, Kutchina MD Namit Bajoria said employees staying far away would face travel difficulty in the absence of public transport. “But we are ensuring that among those coming to work will be employees with their own transportation. We are also making arrangements for vehicles on important routes for others to join on rotation and need basis,” he said. Bajoria also plans to get all their staff vaccinated, at least the first dose. Haldia Petrochemicals director Subhasendu Chatterjee, is also the vice-chairman of CII West Bengal State Council, said after their office reopened on Wednesday, vaccination of the employees would be completed by June 21. “Our plant operate in three shifts,” he added. According to Berger MD and CEO Abhijit Roy, before restrictions, 50% of their staff worked from office, and now, the figure will be 25%, according to the reopening guidelines. “Only very important functions will operate from office for now. We hope the attendance figure will be raised to 50% later,” he said. Most offices in IT and ITes sector, however, will continue with their work-from-home system, keeping their employees’ well-being and health in mind. Currently, a bulk of the work force has been aligned to execute their responsibilities remotely. “But the present directive provides more options for the companies and it must be mentioned that the government has trusted the industry to adhere to the guidelines. We will reciprocate positively,” said Kalyan Kar, VP, Sector V Stakeholders’ Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/offices-arrange-for-cars-before-reopening-today/articleshow/83556077.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

An alumnus of Little Flower School, Reddy said his school friends and other alumna have always supported him in various causes over the last decade and especially during the pandemic. “This recently inaugurated facility is going to bring Covid-19 treatment closer to the people of Makthal and nearby areas,” said the 45-year-old. Reddy, with the help of 25 former students of the school, has helped around 8,500 people in the last year-and-a-half with rations and other essentials. “Apart from feeding Covid-19 patients, we were also helping villagers, especially those who lost their jobs or were facing a financial crisis by supplying ration,” said Reddy, who owns a software firm in Africa. Locals said they are happy that a Covid-19 facility has been established in the area. “Even if we want to buy concentrators or monitors, they are not readily available in market.

The study published in ‘European Journal of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Science’ in May monitored 3,831 people for the development of symptomatic Covid-19 between June 1, 2020 and October 15, 2020. The study period coincided with the peak of the first wave of pandemic in India. The drug uses the Mycobacterium w (Mw) and has been developed jointly by National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, Department of Biotechnology, government of India and Cadila Pharma. The study titled ‘Innate Immune Modulation and Resistance to Covid-19’ shows there is a reduction in incidence of symptomatic Covid-19 diagnoses and Covid-19 specific hospitalizations in the group receiving Mw inoculations. This means it is possible to increase resistance against development of Covid-19 by boosting the innate immune response. “The protective efficacy seen in the Mw-treated group of 70.3% for Covid-19 diagnosis meets the WHO guidelines for protective efficacy of 50%. It is also identical to the efficacy seen with Covishield and Covaxin vaccines,” according to the study. In the management of Covid-19 transmission, boosting of the innate immune response using approved products such as Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) inoculation or other vaccines containing pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (PAMPs) has been suggested to provide resistance to Covid-19 infection and associated morbidity and mortality. BCG inoculation is found to be associated with reduced upper and lower respiratory virus infections. Like BCG, a heat-killed preparation of Mycobacterium w (Mw) is an approved immunomodulator in India sold under the brand name of Sepsivac. Innate immunity is a fast, first-line defence against invading pathogens. Innate immune responses are responsible for initial defence against novel pathogens like Covid-19 and do not need the prior exposure required for adaptive immune responses. The conventional Covid-19 vaccines use adaptive immune responses where antigens are identified to generate vaccines. “This study suggests that modulation of innate immune responses using Sepsivac, an approved immunomodulator, is a promising strategy to reduce incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection and/or mitigate the development of Covid-19-associated morbidity until a vaccine can be administered,” according to Dr Bakulesh Khamar, who has co-authored the research paper. He is the executive director, research & development, Cadila Pharmaceuticals. The other co-authors for the study include Dr Sanjay V Malhotra, a professor of Cell, Developmental & Cancer Biology and director, Center for Experimental Therapeutics at Knight Cancer Institute, Alexander Honkala, researcher at Stanford Healthcare, Stanford, United States, and three other researchers. All the subjects for the study purpose were employees of Cadila Group of Companies. “Of the total subjects, 2,563 volunteered to take Mycobacterium w (Mw), while 1,268 subjects were not inoculated and formed the control group. A total of 132 (3.45%) subjects tested positive for COVID-19 over the course of the study,” it says. “Still, the incidence of the infection was 6.47% (82 out of 1,268) in the control group, compared with 1.95% (50 out of 2,563) in the Mw group,” according to Khamar. An extended Phase-3 trial is meanwhile underway in collaboration with Council of Scientific and Industrial Research to repurpose Sepsivac for treatment of ‘critically-ill’ Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sepsivac-has-70-efficacy-against-covid-19-study/articleshow/83556319.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Home isolation to be stopped as vacant beds increase in hospitals, care centres||COIMBATORE: The district recorded 1,563 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, even as 2,754 patients were discharged from various treatment centres, bringing the active cases down to 15,449. While the district has seen 2,06,833 people testing positive for the virus, 1,89,606 of them have recovered so far. The recovery rate has now improved to 91.6%, the highest in a little more than a month. The Covid-19 toll, meanwhile, increased to 1,778, with 16 more patients succumbing to the virus. All the victims were aged above 40 years on the day. Now that the active cases have fallen below the 15,500-mark, the health department and the city corporation are planning to scrap the option of home isolation for fresh cases. The district had 10,085 patients in home quarantine on Monday. At least 4,500 of them were in the city corporation limits. Availability of enough beds in government and private hospitals and Covid care centres seem to be the main reason behind the idea to stop the home isolation. An official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “Home isolation involves a lot of resources such as volunteers to check on them regularly and a medical officer to visit them and check their physical condition daily. Constant monitoring also required to ensure they stay indoors during the 14 days. The responsibility of ensuring timely supply of groceries, medicines and food is also on us. Moreover, chances of the infected transmitting the virus to other members in the family and neighbours are also high.” Officials are also planning to close many of the newly opened Covid care centres in the panchayat and block levels, again as lots of resources are involved. “Besides deploying staff nurses in three shifts at each centre, we have to ensure supply of food and medicine, among other things. Since the active cases have come down, we plan to reduce the number of Covid care centres to four or five large centres, which we can concentrate on and monitor more closely,” said a health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/home-isolation-to-be-stopped-as-vacant-beds-increase-in-hospitals-care-centres/articleshow/83556124.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Jetting machines for Walled City to clear clogged sewage lines||JAIPUR: JMC-Heritage on Tuesday deployed 20 sewer jetting machines in Walled City to clear clogged drains. Though it has been hailed as a positive step, it is not a permanent solution of the decades-old problem. The machine will help civic staff clean blocked drains without any human intervention just like Delhi and Hyderabad. The civic body purchased 20 machines of 1,500-litre capacity through Jaipur Smart City Limited. Each machine costs Rs 26,68,500 and the total investment has been Rs 5.38 crore. The sewer lines were laid 40 years ago and with passage of time, population has increased manifold due to which sewer choking has become the biggest problem in Walled City. The plan for change of sewerage lines was made but never implemented due to budget constraints. Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar said, “There is a need to find an alternative solution to this problem. We have purchased the sewer machines so that workers won’t have to go inside the drains. Many sanitation workers have lost their lives due to this. It is a good start.” Commenting on change of sewer line, the mayor said this is a long term plan for which a DPR will be made and the estimate cost will be calculated. It is said that the entire project will cost around Rs 150 crore, which will be difficult for the corporation, which is already cash-crunched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jetting-machines-for-walled-city-to-clear-clogged-sewage-lines/articleshow/83556143.cms||---

Acting mayor Sheel Dhabai on Tuesday said pink is the identity of the city and this should be represented by the workers who are the pillars of keeping it clean. “Very soon, pink color sarees will be distributed among women sanitation workers. We want tourists who visit the city to be impressed by the pink uniform of workers. Sanitation workers are the pillars of our community and so a uniform will give them a good identity,” said Dhabai. Sanitation workers used to wear pink sarees during the last tenure of Dhabai, but that fizzed out with time. Sanitation workers have been demanding to make a uniform for all the workers. Currently, the corporation pays Rs 1,700 to male workers and Rs 1,600 to female workers. While the dress code for women has been fixed, there’s demand to decide a uniform for male sanitation workers. Nagar Nigam Safai Karamachari Sangh president Nand Kishore Dabodiya said, “It is a welcome step that corporation female sanitation workers will be getting uniform, but what about male sanitation workers? They should be given a uniform as well. I think pink shirts and brown pants will be suitable for them.” Union workers also said instead of uniforms, corporation should focus on making sanitation workers permanent in their jobs. Although thousands of workers have been made permamnent, many are still fighting for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-pink-sarees-for-sanitation-workers/articleshow/83556113.cms||---

As the death of an accused had taken place close to the periphery wall of the police station, rural police also ensured the inquest was conducted in the presence of the sub-divisional magistrate. The post mortem would be conducted by a team of forensic experts at Government Medical College and Hospital in the presence of a magistrate. The autopsy would also be videographed. Apart from Kondhali police registering a case of accidental death, the state criminal investigation department (CID) officials too visited the spot to gather information after being informed by SP, rural, Rakesh Ola. “We have also asked the SDPO of a different division to conduct inquiry,” said the SP. The cops are also checking CCTV footage of Kondhali police station. It’s learnt Nagotra was engaged as a driver on a truck supposed to be ferrying soyabean oil from Saoner to Bhiwandi. After starting his journey on June 12, Nagotra reached a petrol pump at Bazargaon, where he fell asleep. After waking up, Nagotra was stunned to see 168 soyabean oil cans, worth more than Rs3.68 lakh, had been stolen. On Monday, the transporter, Rajendra Chauhan, lodged a complaint at Kondhali police station, following which Nagotra was booked for criminal breach of trust. As per the police, Nagotra was booked but not arrested. He was allowed to sleep in his truck, which was driven from Bazargaon to Kondhali police station.

Minister for Commercial Taxes, P Moorthy, inaugurated the distribution in Karupayoorani, Madurai, while saying that this government had fulfilled many of its promises within 30 days of coming to power. “Saying thank you to the people through deeds, is much more valuable than saying it with just words,” he said. In Trichy, minister for municipal administration KN Nehru and school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi distributed it to ration card holders of Trichy East, Thiruverumbur and Manapparai Taluk at the district collectorate. Sarathi who was given the token for the first day’s allotment in Madurai said the the money and the free grocery kit would go a long way in feeding her family and meeting immediate demands as her husband, a driver, had lost his job during the pandemic. The distribution was inaugurated at the PDS shop in Dhanappa Mudali street, Madurai city by the Minister of Finance, PTR Palanivel Thiagarajan. Minister for cooperatives I Periyasamy, who inaugurated distribution in Dindigul, said over 99% of the cardholders had got tokens distributed at their doorsteps.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP’s focus back on coordination between government, party organisation||LUCKNOW: A day after chief minister Yogi Adityanath and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh asked the council of ministers to start camping at the block level in their designated districts, political focus on Tuesday moved back on the BJP’s attempts to streamline the coordination between the state government machinery and the party organisation. The development comes against the backdrop of recent high-level meetings of the BJP top brass which stressed the need of establishing a better connect between the government and the organisation to step up implementation of schemes of the Modi and Yogi governments hit by the pandemic. Speaking to TOI, Swatantra Dev said the ministers will get first-hand feedback about problems faced by the people as well as party workers. “This will help the party in reaching out to the people more effectively and ensure that schemes of the Centre and the state are implemented properly,” Singh said. Cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh, who is in charge of Gonda district, said the ministers had an enhanced role as they were also required to work as party functionaries. “We need to act as a bridge between the government and the party workers for better coordination,” he said. Singh said that while CM Yogi was closely monitoring the implementation of government schemes, it was now the turn of the ministers to get feedback from ground level. Effective implementation of schemes is expected to consolidate the BJP’s position vis-a-vis an assertive Opposition which seeks to corner the ruling party on various fronts. A senior BJP leader said that sending ministers at the block level was also a pointer to the party’s bid to increasing its rural foothold ahead of the scheduled elections for zila panchayat chairpersons on July 3. According to government sources, the status of a minister in charge is that of the CM’s representative. Such a minister is entitled to get key protocols besides being armed to ramp up administrative machinery in the respective district. “This way, the minister is able to resolve the problems of the people and party workers at the ground level,” a government official said. He added that instructions from the government, mainly the CM’s office, have already been sent to various districts stressing that the block-level programmes need to be successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-focus-back-on-coordination-between-govt-party-organisation/articleshow/83558568.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra discussing ‘test’ relief for travellers who’ve taken the jab||PUNE: The relief and rehabilitation department’s principal secretary Aseem Gupta on Tuesday told TOI that talks were on with senior decision-makers in the state on whether to exempt vaccinated travellers from showing a negative RT-PCR report while entering Maharashtra. Some states have recently removed the requirement of travellers needing RT-PCR tests for entry. Gupta told TOI, “We have already done away with the requirement of showing a negative RT-PCR report for travel within the state. However, the requirement of showing a negative RT-PCR test still holds if travellers are coming to Maharashtra from other states. A decision on exemption of vaccinated travellers from this rule cannot be taken in haste and will need due deliberations.” Gupta said that the issue is nevertheless being discussed, after it was proposed to the authorities by a few stakeholders. “Discussions are at an early phase,” he said. A senior bureaucrat in the state told TOI that the rule for negative RT-PCR tests to enter the state is a follow-up of the “sensitive origin order”. He said, “As per the order, passengers travelling to Maharashtra from Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and NCR region, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh need a negative RT-PCR report conducted within 48 hours of their train travel. Any exemption to the vaccinated travellers will also require modifications in the ‘sensitive origin’ order.” After states such as Punjab and Chandigarh announced that travellers could reach there without an RT-PCR test if they had had one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, travel industry stakeholders have been pushing for a similar exemption in Maharashtra. Nikhil Thakurdas, owner of a tour and travel firm, told TOI, “The requirement for an RT-PCR test to enter Maharashtra is preventing thousands of business and emergency travellers from heading out, as they need the test to return. RT-PCR tests are costly and inconvenient. Since many travellers have now received at least the first jabs, the Maharashtra government should think on the lines as some other states in India.” Thakurdas said many citizens had received their first shots in the first half of April and would be due for the second doses by the start of July. “By the middle of July, the state will have a large number of fully vaccinated people in the 45+ category. There should be some recognition of this fact by exempting such citizens from the RT-PCR requirement,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-discussing-test-relief-for-travellers-whove-taken-the-jab/articleshow/83556244.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Delhi: How gang lured scores into sex trap for blackmail||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Crime Branch has busted a “sextortion racket” being run by Mewat-based criminals and arrested the mastermind from Gurgaon. The suspect has been identified as Mohammed Barkat Ali. Raids are being conducted in Mewat region to arrest other members of the racket. The racketeers used to lure people on social media platforms using fake IDs of girls and initiate a sex chat. After a few days of chatting, the accused would invite their target for video calls and tactfully show them a girl stripping her clothes. They would even invite the people to strip. “The gang would use screen recorder to record WhatsApp video calls. The accused then extorted money by threatening to upload the obscene video on social media platforms,” joint commissioner BK Singh said. The accused recorded the screen of their target using a specific app and used voice changers to befool them. They posed as YouTubers while threatening the target of making their video viral. The gang had extorted from more than 200 people in the past few months. The gang was earlier in the business of cheating people on the pretext of selling cars and bikes over WhatsApp by impersonating themselves as Indian Army personnel. In September 2020, Barkat Ali and his aides committed big loot of Rs 12.8 lakh cash by breaking open an ATM machine of HDFC Bank in Mysore, Karnataka. Of late, the gang turned to sextortion using Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Tinder app, etc. In the last few months, cops had received several complaints regarding sextortion and had mounted surveillance. It came to fore that the criminals used to demand only Rs 15,000 from their target so that the victim paid up without making an issue to save himself from the embarrassment. The accused was arrested after ASI Brijlal and constable Mintu received information that the mastermind of the racket would come to Kukrola Village in Gurgaon on June 13 evening. A trap was laid and the suspect was arrested. The accused, Barkat Ali, belongs to Palwal of Haryana and is a high school dropout. Victims of such types of incidents are being traced in all over India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-gang-lured-scores-into-sex-trap-for-blackmail/articleshow/83556234.cms||---

A survey, conducted by Ipsos Research for HelpAge India, revealed the data at their annual report — The Silent Tormentor: Covid-19 and the Elderly — which was released on Monday, marking the World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on June 15. The survey was conducted across Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Chennai — with a sample size of 3,526 senior citizens. In Kolkata, 587 persons were surveyed – half the sample size than what the company used to handle before. “The survey gives us an indication of the situation across India. In other years, we expand our surveys to tier-II and tier-III cities as well and work with a much larger database but for the pandemic, we shortened our scope this year,” said Dr Imtiaz Ahmed, Mission head, age care- HelpAge India. The report highlighted that elderly people are dealing with a deep sense of isolation and fear amidst the pandemic. Among the surveyed elderlies at home and at old-age homes, 61% of the participants consider the future to be bleak. The survey also pointed out that 77% of elders in Kolkata feel that due to the pandemic, the risk of them getting abused has increased. “Parents whose children live abroad can’t visit them any longer and secondly, the elderlies can’t visit doctor’s chambers in person any more. They can’t adapt to this system of telemedicine. Many elderlies are even complaining of new diseases, some of which are even proving fatal,” said geriatrician Dhires Chowdhury. Psychiatrist Siladitya Roy said: “I am seeing a number of anxious, fearful and depressed elderly patients who are finding it extremely difficult to get going.

It is in Digvijay’s statement on (Article) 370. Untruth is the only truth of Congress,” Puri tweeted. The exchange between Rahul and Yogi came in the backdrop of a video which went viral on social media, in which an elderly Muslim man, Abdul Samad, accused four men of beating him up, chopping his beard and asking him to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ in Loni area of Ghaziabad. “I am not ready to accept that such an act could be committed by Ram Bhakts,” Rahul tweeted. Meanwhile, the Ghaziabad police said investigations revealed that Samad had come to the Loni border from Bulandshahr from where he went to the house of the main accused, Parvesh Gurjar, in Loni, with another person. “After some time, a few youths reached Parvesh’s house and assaulted Samad. They said Samad used to make tabeez to ward off evil but the tabeez Samad gave to them had an adverse impact. They said Samad had given tabeez to many people in the village," the statement said. Police said an FIR was lodged and Parvesh Gurjar and two others, Kallu and Adil, had been arrested and efforts were on to nab the remaining culprits. Gurjar was reportedly arrested a few days after the incident for his role in another case but his involvement was also found in the case of assault. Senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad, Amit Pathak said Samad did not make any mention of being forced to chant “Jai Shri Ram” or chopping off his beard, in the FIR which was lodged on June 7. He expressed surprise over Samad’s fresh allegations on June 14 and said someone might have instigated him. Pathak said after Gurjar’s arrest, police repeatedly summoned Samad to join the investigation, but he did not turn up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-peddling-lies-despite-police-clarification-in-loni-case-yogi/articleshow/83558610.cms||---

The decision of whether to reopen the monuments to visitors will be taken only after curfew is lifted following the state guidelines, officials said. “If the state government allows, only then can we open the monuments. Since there are restrictions in Goa till June 21, we are going to strictly comply with the state government order,” Archaeological Survey of India (Goa Circle), superintending archaeologist, Amarnath Ramakrishna said. Further, he said the reopening of monuments will be based on the state government’s order and guidelines to do so. Shut since April 15, the two-month closure of heritage spaces has given ASI ample time to complete pre-monsoon maintenance works. “Routine works were attended to since these were permitted as per state government orders. All repair works were carried out. Only visitors were restricted from entering the premises in the past two months,” Ramakrishna said. Though the centuries-old monuments managed to withstand the fury of cyclonic storm Tauktae, the roof tiles of fort Aguada had fallen off. Ramakrishna said that this was a “minor damage” and these tiles will be replaced soon. “Nowhere else were the monuments affected,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/asi-to-wait-until-curfew-ends-to-reopen-monuments/articleshow/83556224.cms||Nida Sayed

If IT companies do hanky panky, the government will take steps to rectify it,” the minister said. On Monday evening, Thangaraj inspected the Elcot IT park at Gangaikondan in Tirunelveli district. The minister said that efforts are being taken to revitalise the IT park which was initiated by former chief minister M Karunanidhi, and had not witnessed any development during the last 10 years of the AIADMK rule. The minister said there are only two companies in the 500 acres SEZ. Chief minister M K Stalin had stressed on attracting more IT companies to the ELCOT IT park to provide jobs to educated youth in the southern region, he said. “We have taken efforts to attract IT companies here by simplifying the norms and providing them the necessary infrastructure. There are many educated rural youths in the region. These youths are employed in bigger cities due to lack of opportunities in the southern region,” he said. Priority would be given to employ youth from Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Tuticorin, Kanyakumari and Virudhunagar districts in the IT park, he said. The minister said that on the request of the Tamil Nadu government telecom companies have started playing the recorded Covid-19 awareness messages in Tamil in the Chennai region from Monday and in the rest of Tamil Nadu from Tuesday, to reach the grassroot level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-wont-remain-silent-spectator-to-layoffs-it-minister/articleshow/83556228.cms||---

They demanded that government provide universal vaccination for all stakeholders—students, faculty, among others, immediately disburse fellowships, and extend special packages for families of students from marginalised communities. “The past one year, education institutions have lost several students, teachers, and academic staff to the virus. As a country, we have lost eminent academicians, research scholars across the country, which is a huge loss to the academic community. Thus, we request the government to take up a universal vaccination program to ensure that every citizen receives vaccination as immediately as possible,” said RL Murthy, president, SFI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sfi-demands-universal-vaccination/articleshow/83556211.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A police officer, who didn’t want to be named, said they came across Ashwin Prakash, who behaved in a strange manner, during the night patrol. “When we questioned him and asked for his address, Prakash said he was feeding stray dogs. We accompanied him to his house and found the idol during the raid.” Since the idol appeared to be made of brass, police confiscated the same and kept that in the station. “Further probe revealed that Prakash was genuinely feeding the street dogs at RS Puram and that the idol was made of steel or iron with brass coating that he used to rent out to marriage halls,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/idol-seized-turns-out-to-be-decorative-piece/articleshow/83556195.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||T’s Rythu Bandhu budget balloons every crop season||Hyderabad: Even as disbursement of money into accounts of farmers eligible for Rythu Bandhu began on Tuesday, a quick analysis of the scheme shows that funds required for a season have gone up by Rs 1,584 crore in the last three years, with gradual increase in addition of eligible farmers and farm land. Two lakh eligible (new beneficiaries) farmers and around 66,000 acres have been added this time to the scheme in the latest tranche. Ever since Rythu Bandhu was launched in 2018-19, the government has been implementing the scheme in two crop seasons each year and the burden on the exchequer has been increasing substantially. In 2018-19 summer, the government had allocated Rs 5,925 crore. However, in the current crop season, the state would require Rs 7,508 crore to implement the scheme. An increase in the number of mutations of agricultural properties, claims of more parcels of land being cultivated and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao enhancing the Rythu Bandhu amount by Rs 1,000 per acre (Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000) have added to the burgeoning budget of the scheme. Except during the 2019–20 summer season, when there was a dip in the funds required, beneficiaries have been increasing with each cycle. During 2019-20 summer, the amount required for the scheme was Rs 5,100 crore, while in the previous season the state had spent Rs 6,900 crore. The government had at one point of time deliberated on introducing a cap, but subsequently dropped the idea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ts-rythu-bandhu-budget-balloons-every-crop-season/articleshow/83556298.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

According to police, the accused has been named in three FIRs. The accused is said to be acquainted with the survivor’s family. The family last year in July had accused him of allegedly abducting the girl. A final report (FR)was later submitted in the case closing the probe. Later in October, he was booked again, this time in the rape case. According to the Kardhani police, the accused had come out on a bail about a month ago and on Sunday called up the girl and threatened her to visit him near Shekhawat Marg at 4pm. According to Station House Officer, Rajesh Bafana, the accused threatened her and took him to a secluded room near the Bagru area where he allegedly raped the minor. The girl’s family members became worried when she did not return till late evening. Her mobile phone was also switched off after she had left the house on her scooter. The family members fretting about the minor’s whereabouts looked for her across several places. The girl sometime on Monday morning sent her location to the family. The accused had fled by the time she was recovered from the Bagru area. The Kardhani police said that they took her for the medical examination and recorded her statements. “We are looking for the accused identified by the girl. An FIR was already registered and every attempt is being made to track down the accused,” Bafana told TOI. The Jaipur police said that the girl was allegedly threatened by the accused of dire consequence if she did not meet him. “This is the third FIR that was registered against the accused. He has lived in different parts of the city as a tenant. We are searching for him,” an official said.

---||Lucknow||BSP rebel MLAs meet SP chief amid switch-over speculation||Lucknow: In what is being seen as a precursor to realignment of political affiliations before the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, at least five rebel MLAs from Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party met Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday. The meeting, which reportedly lasted about an hour, has triggered speculations of the MLAs formally joining the SP in the near future. The list comprised most of the seven MLAs suspended by BSP supremo Mayawati in October 2020 after the Rajya Sabha polls -- Aslam Ali, Hargovind Bhargav, Mohammad Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Mohammad Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel and Vandana Singh. Though senior SP leaders and the MLAs who met Akhilesh during the day, refused to reveal what transpired at the meeting, sources said initially six of suspended MLAs were scheduled to meet the former UP CM but one of them dropped out at the last moment as he was busy with the zila panchayat chairman polls where his wife is a candidate. Sources said all the six BSP MLAs would formally join the SP once the monsoon session of the assembly is over. “Party cadres have already been told about their joining the SP formally after the monsoon session,” said a member of team Akhilesh. Sources said some of these MLAs' kin have already joined the SP to prepare the ground and coordinate with the SP cadres ahead of the formal cross over. Wife of BSP MLA from a district bordering Delhi, who has been a zila panchayat chairman, has already switched over to SP. So has the father of another BSP MLA from a district close to Lucknow. Husband of another BSP MLA from eastern UP has also formally joined the SP. And so have son and brother of another BSP MLA. “They are already moving around in vehicles supporting SP flags,” said a senior SP leader. Suspended BSP MLA from Bhinga (Shravasti) Mohammed Aslam Raini, however, tried to play down the reports of his meeting with Akhilesh. "We can meet anyone," he said, adding that there was no proof of any such meeting. About his future political moves, Raini said 11 BSP MLAs were with him and all of them would get together and form a new party under the leadership of former BSP veteran Lalji Verma, who was recently sacked from the party. Verma, however, denied any such plans. Mayawati suspended the above-mentioned seven MLAs in October 2020 for not complying with the party line in the Rajya Sabha elections. Interestingly, sources in SP said the party has already made up its mind with regards to fielding these MLAs as SP candidates in the 2022 elections and the senior party leaders of the respective constituencies have also been informed about the decision in order to do away with possibilities of any discontent among the local leaders. “The picture is clear for the cadres at the ground level,” said the SP leader adding that these BSP MLAs have met Akhilesh on several occasions earlier as well. The rebel BSP MLAs are not the first lot to join the SP after snapping ties with Behenji. BSP founding member RK Chaudhary, who had joined SP earlier but left the party when Akhilesh and Mayawati entered into a poll pact in 2019, joined the SP again after the two parties parted ways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bsp-rebel-mlas-meet-sp-chief-amid-switch-over-speculation/articleshow/83558638.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Delhi||Delhi: Footage of two suspects in Israeli embassy blast released||NEW DELHI: The two suspects in the case relating to the minor explosion near the Israeli embassy here on January 29 had taken two rounds of the blast site that day, as evident from different sets of CCTV footage released by the NIA on Tuesday while seeking help from the public to identify them. The two suspects appear to have planted the bomb in the first round, though the CCTV footage released by the NIA does not capture the act, before walking away to a safe distance, possibly a nearby road, only to come back to the blast site around 15-20 minutes later after removing an outer layer of their clothing. The second visit to the blast site was possibly to remotely trigger the explosion, though sources said this was still a matter of investigation. It is also being probed as to why they removed their jacket/sweater before returning to the blast site, though it appears to be an attempt to look like different individuals and avoid suspicion. Sources told TOI that the two suspects purportedly left the blast site in an autorickshaw. The NIA has released video footage of the two suspects and declared a Rs 10 lakh cash reward for any person who shares information that leads to their identification and arrest. The NIA may be approached with the information on its email ID do.nia@gov.in or info.nia@gov.in, phone number 011-24368800 or mobile number 9654447345. The blast near the Israeli embassy on January 29 had not resulted in any injuries. A note was found from the site, which was addressed to the Israeli ambassador and mentioned Iranian military officer Qassem Soleimani and nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, both killed in attacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/footage-of-two-suspects-in-israeli-embassy-blast-released/articleshow/83556329.cms||---

Game also directed the NMC and Nashik Zilla Parishad (ZP) to remove water hyacinth in the river and near Saikheda towards Nandur Madhyameshwar in Niphad tehsil of the district. He also instructed the civic administration and the smart city company to provide trash skimmer machines to ZP Nashik to remove water hyacinth. The directives of the divisional commissioner came during the meeting of the high court appointed high-power committee on Godavari pollution held on Monday. The committee is chaired by the divisional commissioner. Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist and a petitioner in the Godavari pollution case in the Bombay high court, said that ozonation is used to treat sewage or wastewater. “Godavari river flows in the rainy season, but there is no rainwater between October and June. Otherwise, the water in Ramkund accumulates for many days as there is no flow of river water. NMC needs to ensure that water in the Ramkund is clean and it is possible through ozonation technology,” he said. Game also instructed all the sub-committees of NMC, MIDC, MPCB, ZP etc to give boost to the work for making the Godavari pollution free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ozonation-treatment-plant-at-ramkund/articleshow/83548522.cms||Tushar Pawar

The Parsi religious body from Surat is objecting to compulsory cremation of bodies after death from Covid of members of the Zoroastrian community, demanding that they be allowed to perform their last rite in accordance with their religious tradition, Dokhmenashini, by leaving the body at Tower of Silence. It claims that cremation of bodies hurts their religious sentiments. Arguing before the court, senior advocate Asim Pandya submitted that the authorities were reluctant to allow burial of bodies of Muslims who died of Covid-19 stating that it would spread the virus, but the Bombay high court ordered to allow them to bury the dead. By raising this issue, the lawyer claimed parity and asserted that nowhere has been scientifically proved that the coronavirus spreads through a dead body. Besides, advocate Pandya also argued that the central government did not take into consideration the religious sentiments of small religious minorities like the Parsis. The court has posted a further hearing on this issue for July 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parsis-cite-bombay-hc-nod-to-muslims/articleshow/83556250.cms||---

In a communiqué, deputy election officer Minal Kalaskar requested all these voters to cooperate with the administration by submitting their passport-size photographs with various government offices. The booth-level officers (BLOs) have been entrusted with the task of collecting the photographs from the voters. As per the BLOs, a majority of these 2.46 lakh voters are migrants and despite visits at the mentioned addresses many times, they weren’t located. A list of such persons has been prepared and published on the official website of the administration — www.nagpur.nic.in. Copies of the list are kept at public sanitation places, tehsil, voter registration and the collector's offices. The list of such migrant voters was also circulated among representatives of all the recognized political parties in respective talukas as well as in the city. “Citizens whose names were omitted from the voter list should make sure they are included by visiting the website or any of the BLO offices. If they come to know about any voter on the list, they can also submit his/her colour photo to the polling station officer concerned.

In a letter to chief minister M K Stalin on Tuesday, members of the Association of Job Working Powerloom Units in Coimbatore and Tirupur said there were five lakh workers dependent on the sector in both the districts and they were staring at uncertainty because of the closure of the units for the past several days. “There are about 2.5 lakh powerloom units in the two districts and several of them are small and micro units. The closure of these units has hit the livelihood of the workers,” the letter read. They said orders from textile manufacturers had dried up because of the lockdown and they were under duress, because of the commitments to repay bank loans. The association members said since several industries had been allowed to function, powerloom units too be permitted to overcome the financial constraints. They said the small units employ only two or three workers and they would strictly enforce the Covid norms like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. The association also urged the chief minister to allow them to pay electricity charges in three instalments without penalty, as they were short of funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/allow-us-to-resume-work-powerloom-units-tell-cm/articleshow/83556232.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He also questioned the ruling BJP over the difference in rates being offered to farmers of one village as compared to others for the land proposed to be acquired for the airport in Ayodhya. Responding to a question about the controversy over purchase of land for temple project, Akhilesh said the members of the Trust against whom the allegations have been levelled, should first resign from their post. “The work is being done in the name of Maryada Purshottam Ram and allegations of corruption have been levelled against people responsible for the work. Till the time the allegations remain, all the Trust members should resign," he said in an interview to a news channel. Targeting the BJP over difference in rates being offered to farmers for acquiring their land for the airport in Ayodhya, Akhilesh said farmers are ready to give up their land. But the government is offering lower rates to people of Dharampur village as compared to those of the adjoining village. He dismissed any scope of a merger of estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party – Lohia (PSP-L) with the SP ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. He said the party will not field any candidate from Jaswantnagar – the seat of Shivpal.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: High court raps lawyer for pleading without black coat in online hearing||NAGPUR: The proliferation of online systems has led to some complacency, particularly among youngsters, as they study or work from homes. A young lawyer had to face the music from the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday, when he appeared in an online hearing without a black coat and neckband. After sighting him without the formal attire, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor stopped the hearing and censured him for neglecting rules of the judiciary. The lawyer had engaged a senior counsel, who also reminded him to adhere to formal dress code before the hearing, after seeing him in a plain white shirt. The senior counsel told the judges that his junior couldn't get the time to wear the black coat, but that failed to cut the ice. “The senior advocate submits that he has already reprimanded his junior. But regrettably, the latter continues to appear on the screen without the uniform. He shall do well to follow the dress code, etiquette and manners and till he follows the same, the final hearing of this petition is deferred,” the judges tersely stated, before adjourning the hearing by two weeks. The lawyer suffered another setback when the judges charged his client, a student, of “bench hunting” and slapped a cost of Rs5,000 on her before rejecting her civil application. “We find that the application suppresses material facts relating to observations and findings recorded by this court in the March 24 order. All these facts and concealments give a prima facie impression that as there was a change of bench during summer vacation, the petitioner may have taken her chance before another court in spite of rejection of her similar prayer by us on March 24,” the judges said. Adding that such an attempt on the petitioner’s part was “improper”, they said she should have approached the Supreme Court or file a review petition challenging the March 24 order, if she was really aggrieved. “But, she didn’t do so and took her chance by making a similar prayer with concealment of material facts from another bench.

These people claimed that they decided to give wings to their passion which had remained dormant because of the hustle-bustle of daily lives.Pradip Bhatia, a 72-year-old insurance surveyor, took this one year of pandemic to start sketching and while working as a freelancer, he has done over 50 pencil sketches. “During my younger years, I used to sketch a bit, but then got involved with job and family life which left no time to pursue this interest of mine. Since last year, I started sketching again and while I have no plans to sell my work of art, it keeps stress as well as depression at bay. I continue to work as insurance surveyor as well and mostly I gift my sketches to my friends,” he said. Bhatia has sketched portraits, historical buildings etc and completing a single sketch usually takes him around four days.During this period, people also took up interests which they did not even realise that they were good at like Mohan Mertia, who is a general manager in a tour company, but has been working from home since the lockdown was implemented last year and took up growing vegetables in approximately 1,000 square metres of land. Mertia said, “I come from a family of landlords, but never got into farming or any similar activities. When the lockdown was imposed, the professional workload came down drastically as tourism industry was hit. I thought that instead of going for walks on road, I should develop a green space near my home itself. I started working on a patch of land and now various types of vegetables and flowers are grown on that.”.While people in private jobs worked from home, the men in uniform, including police, had no such option but still Suresh Yadav, posted as SHO in JDA, managed to find time to pen articles on international affairs and told TOI, “Lockdown in a way helped me realise my potential to write on topics which we usually discuss offhandedly. I thought that this was a good opportunity to pen my thoughts on these issues so that our voices as well as opinions can be read by future generations.”Similarly, Deveshi Sharma, at the age of 13, published her first novel, ‘Eternal Power & the Blessed Dream’. She is a student of Mayo College Girls’ School, Ajmer. Her journey as a writer started last year when due to sudden lockdown, her school got closed and she could not go back to Bangkok where her family was living. During these tough moments, she discovered that she can write and instead of letting her spirit dampen, she kept herself busy and started writing her first novel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/how-hobbies-helped-them-to-stay-positive-during-lockdown/articleshow/83556324.cms||---

The suspects had offered to provide a dealership of a branded apparel store at two locations in Aurangabad and one in Kharadi of Pune and accordingly collected Rs 15 lakh against each store. As per the complaint lodged by Pankaj Agrawal, he got in touch with Shaikh Akhef and Nitin Khanna — two proprietors of AN retail ventures private limited, sometime in 2018 and claimed to have obtained mass retail rights from the apparel brand. Agrawal, in his complaint, said the suspects offered him a lucrative deal including that the company will bear all the cost of retailers including rent of the shops and also pays considerable commission against the sale of products. Accordingly, Agrawal went to Mumbai and met the suspects who offered to pay Rs 90,000 as rent and other expenses or 16 per cent as commission, whichever is more, for each of the retail stores. This was followed by Agrawal obtaining franchise for three locations by depositing Rs 45 lakh. It was followed by a transaction of Rs 8.45 lakh as commission in the months of March, May and June of 2019. On June 29, 2019, Shaikh lodged a complaint against Agrawal and allegedly got the three franshices cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-trader-duped-of-over-rs-59l-5-booked/articleshow/83548670.cms||---

The accident took place at Deivaseyalpuram village near Vallanadu on the Tirunelveli to Tuticorin national highway late on Monday night. Police said that there was difficulty in identifying the male and female victims as their bodies were completely burnt. Preliminary investigations revealed that the bike was going towards Tuticorin direction. The van was coming on the wrong side and collided with the bike. The van dragged the bike for a short distance, leaving the bike and the two riders below the vehicle. The driver fled the spot and the fire was noticed by employees of a nearby hollow blocks manufacturing unit only a few minutes later. “We suspect that friction could have set the fuel tank of the bike on fire and the van too caught fire,” Tuticorin district fire officer S Kumar said. The Tuticorin district police registered a case and are on the lookout for the van driver. Government identity cards had the names Ganesh and Usha of Moolakaraipatti village. Efforts were underway to confirm their identity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/2-burn-to-death-as-bike-gets-stuck-under-van/articleshow/83556362.cms||---

Around 1.2 lakh students from 130 non-autonomous arts and science colleges affiliated to Bharathidasan University appeared for the examination on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the students were asked to send the answer scripts either by post or courier. But many colleges had asked the students to send the soft copies through mail as they have been facing issues in sending the hard copies to their respective colleges. “We are forced to spend at least Rs 50 to send the hardcopy of the answer scripts, which is an additional expense to the examination fee. “On an average, a student will have to appear for seven exams and many in rural areas are not in a position to bear the cost of sending the answer scripts,” said a staff from an arts and science college in Trichy. Also, as most branch and sub-post offices are operating up to 1 and 2pm, students have to search for courier services. While BDU had instructed the respective colleges to collect the scripts the same day, many colleges asked the students to send the scripts later and send the soft copy alone. “BDU could have asked the colleges to collect the hardcopy of the answer scripts at a later stage as instructed by Bharathiar University in Coimbatore,” said a teacher. “Covid care centres were set up at many colleges in the delta districts, which are among the 11 districts where relaxations are yet to be announced. Students will be in trouble if they come in person to hand over the answer scripts in case they could not post them,” said the teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/students-in-a-fix-as-bdu-asks-them-to-submit-hard-copies/articleshow/83556405.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Mumbai||Cops to pay 2 women Rs 5 lakh each for delay in sexual abuse plaints: Rights panel order||MUMBAI: In a recent order, the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission recommended that the police be made to pay compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to two women whose complaints of being allegedly sexually harassed were not registered for years—in one case for more than 12 years. The women alleged being harassed by the principal of two Mumbai colleges. The man, who was arrested in January and February 2020 in the two separate complaints by the women, died last September. After an accused is dead, the criminal cases against him stand abated. The MSHRC also asked Mumbai University to consider action against the “erring management of the educational institutes concerned” for discouraging the women from complaining. The MSHRC order by acting chairperson M A Sayeed said that what was pertinent to note was that “despite reports making of a cognizable case, police concerned took its own sweet time in registering offence against the culprit”. Unfortunately, in one case, it stretched to over 12 years and in the other to more than three years. “In one of the cases, it took over 100 complaints…intervention of the Prime Minister’s Office, for the police to register… in the other, National Commission for Women had to step in to help the complainant,” it added. The MSHRC directed the office of additional chief secretary (home) to forward the copy of its order to the Mumbai police commissioner for compliance. The compensation has to be paid by the “erring police officers” and to be recovered by their respective deputy police commissioners. It also directed that the supervisory and disciplinary authorities of the errant officers “may consider launching necessary department inquiry against them for blatant dereliction of duty”. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cops-to-pay-2-women-rs-5l-each-for-delay-in-sexual-abuse-plaints-in-mumbai-rights-panel-order/articleshow/83559544.cms||---
---||Patna||Chirag suspends ‘rebel’ MPs, Paras faction ‘ousts’ him as LJP president||PATNA: The Chacha-Bhatija battle in the Paswan family of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) was out in the open on Tuesday as a resilient Chirag Paswan suspended his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras and four other rebel MPs, including cousin Prince Raj, from the primary membership of the party. The decision was taken in an online meeting of the national executive of the party chaired by Chirag. He will also address a press briefing at New Delhi on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Chirag was removed from the post of LJP national president by the rebel group led by Paras, who claims to have blown the bugle of rebellion ‘to save the party from one-upmanship of Chirag’. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of the executive committee of the party (Paras group) held in Delhi. The group led by Hajipur MP Paras also appointed party’s vice-president and former MP Surajbhan Singh as the working president. The ‘Chacha-Bhatija’ face-off took place after Paras along with Prince (LJP’s Bihar unit president) and three other party MPs — Mehboob Ali Qaiser, Veena Devi and Chandan Singh — submitted a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Sunday to replace Chirag with Paras as the LJP parliamentary party leader in the Lower House. The Speaker accepted it on Monday. Meanwhile, Chirag made several personal attacks on uncle Paras. In a tweet, Chirag said he made all efforts to keep the party founded by his father and his family together, but failed. “The party is like mother and she should not be betrayed. People are supreme in a democracy,” he tweeted. Chirag also shared a letter he had written to Paras on March 29 after a failed attempt of having a conversation with him. He wrote that Paras was unhappy right after the demise of Prince’s father Ramchandra Paswan. Chirag said Paras was unhappy with the elevation of Prince as the LJP state president, a decision taken by the party’s founder and his father Ram Vilas Paswan. Chirag further claimed that Paras talked to Bihar CM Nitish Kumar for becoming a minister after the latter severed ties with RJD and overnight formed government with the support of BJP in 2017. Chirag also alleged that Paras never actively participated in the electioneering during the assembly polls held last year as he never wanted to contest the elections against Nitish. He said rather than acting as a guardian, Paras stopped talking to him after Ram Vilas’s demise. In another revelation, Chirag said Paras never gave any suggestion on an allegation of sexual exploitation and subsequent attempts of blackmailing made by a former female party worker against Prince, following which Chirag asked his cousin to approach the police. Meanwhile, in the Paras faction, Surajbhan, the elder brother of Nawada LJP MP Chandan Singh, has been asked to convene a meeting of the national council at Patna within five days to elect a new party president. Reliable sources in LJP said the meeting is likely to be held on June 17. When contacted, Surajbhan said the date would be announced in a day or two. Surajbhan also claimed that they will move the Election Commission of India (ECI) to stake claims over the party. “LJP is our party as we have strengthened its organisational structure. All MPs of the party, except Chirag, have faith in the leadership of Paras, who has been elected as the parliamentary party leader," Surajbhan told TOI. However, the Chirag faction claimed any action taken by the Paras group holds no legal sanctity. “As per the party’s constitution with the EC, only the national executive of the party can take important decisions, like suspension of members. The national executive comprises 75 members, including party president, vice-president, 16 secretaries, 16 general secretaries, presidents of state and union territory units, MPs and MLAs among others. A meeting of the national executive was called on Tuesday, which took a resolution to suspend five members from the primary membership of the party,” LJP’s national secretary general Abdul Khalik told TOI. With regard to the post of party’s national president, Khalik said: “For the election of someone as the party’s national president, minimum 10 members of the national executive should propose his or her name. If there is more than one claimant, then election will be held. Nevertheless, any action being taken by the rebel MPs holds no legal backing as per the party’s constitution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-suspends-rebel-mps-paras-faction-ousts-him-as-ljp-president/articleshow/83552930.cms||Ramashankar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath flags off distribution of Covid medicine kits for kids||LUCKNOW: Gearing up to blunt a possible third Covid wave that can impact children, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday flagged off a distribution drive of medicine kits to children below the age of 18. About 50 lakh kits have been assembled for distribution at the doorstep in the current round. Health workers will visit houses and provide medicines to children who display Covid symptoms. The government also released pamphlets for various age-groups, indicating medicines and dosage if infected. Talking about the state’s strategy to battle the pandemic, which has been flattened in at least 19 districts that reported zero cases on Tuesday, the CM said, a good preventive system is a crucial weapon. Work has begun in four steps to control the third wave, he said. Children under the age of 18 have been split into four categories — 0-1 years, 1-5 years, 5-12 years and 12-18 years — and different medicines have been prepared for each category. Additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad said, kits containing paracetamol tablets, ORS packets, multi-vitamins and Ivermectin tablets have been prepared on suggestions of medical experts and paediatricians. These medicines can also be used to treat seasonal fever,” he said. Children will also be tested for Covid, he added, and shifted to a health facility if required. Managing director, UP Medical Supplies Corporation Limited, Kanchan Verma, said, children up to 5 years of age will only be administered drops, syrups and liquid medicines. “The kits do not contain antibiotics, which will only be given at primary health centres on a doctor’s prescription,” she said. Also, the focus would be on sanitation, fogging and clean drinking water. With the government prioritising vaccination for parents whose children are below the age of 12, the CM said, vaccine trials were also taking place for younger children and vaccines would be available soon. As part of the fourth strategy, 100-bed paediatric ICUs were being set up in all medical colleges in the state and by end of June, all PICU and isolation facilities would be in place. “District hospitals will also have 25-30 bedded PICUs and isolation wards. Community health care centres in far-flung areas will also receive PICU facilities. Paediatricians, gynaecologist, health workers, paramedical, nursing and housekeeping staff are being trained to man these facilities,” he said. The CM has asked monitoring committees to visit villages and carry out door-to-door surveys to identify children and others with Covid symptoms. Pulse oxymeters which can be used for children should be procured and MSME units can collaborate to manufacture child pulse oxymeters, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-flags-off-distribution-of-covid-med-kits-for-kids/articleshow/83558719.cms||Neha Lalchandani

On Tuesday, over 3,000 ASHA workers, who are considered footsoldiers of health system, started their indefinite strike and not reported for Covid-related work. Due to this the drives launched by the district administration and Kolhapur Municipal Corporation got paralysed.

Members of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam and Communist party of India (CPI), who participated in the protest said the oil exploration will have more serious implications than Covid-19 in the region. The Union government on June 10 had invited bids for oil and gas fields in Vadatheru near Neduvasal. Stating that the project is against the declaration of Cauvery delta region as a protected special agriculture zone (PSAZ) by the state government, protestors urged the district administration to close the wells established by ONGC at Vadatheru. Sangam leader Madhavan who led the protest said oil exploration in the region will snatch the livelihood of lakhs of farmers. The Union government has been provoking the farming community to protest by making such an announcement. Requesting chief minister M K Stalin to return from the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 17 on a positive note, he called for steps to ensure that such projects are permanently shelved by future governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/protest-against-move-for-oil-and-gas-extraction-intensifies/articleshow/83556446.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh night curfew to be relaxed for 2 more hours||LUCKNOW: With daily cases in the state coming down to 340 and active cases a little more than 7,000, the state government has decided to ease the night curfew by two hours from next Monday. From the present 7 pm to 7 am curfew, the night curfew would now be implemented from 9 pm across the state. The government has also given malls and restaurants the permission to open from Monday but at only 50% capacity for the time being. There, however, is no clarity on cinemas and gymnasiums. "A detailed order to be issued in a day or two might cover everything," a government spokesperson said. “Recovery rate in the state has touched 98.3%. In view of the improving situation, the government has decided to give relief from the night curfew. It will be in place for 10 hours now, starting at 9 pm,” said the spokesperson. Restaurants and malls can open with 50% occupancy only as long as Covid protocols are in place. Parks can be given permission to open while street food stalls can also be set up,” said the spokesperson. "However, it will be necessary to set up Covid help desks at all such places,” said the spokesperson. On April 7, the government had authorised district administrations to implement night curfews, depending on the Covid situation in each area. However, as cases continued to rise, the government on April 15 decided to impose a more uniform night curfew across the state. In districts with 2,000 plus active cases, the curfew was from 8 pm to 7 am while in those which had 100 cases or more in a day or where the active cases were over 500, the night curfew was enforced from 9 pm to 6 am. However, while making these announcements, the government spokesperson also said that while the Covid situation is under control right now, positive cases were being reported from across the state. The infection has weakened, he said but any amount of carelessness could undo all the gains that had been made till now. “One needs to avoid crowds and leave home only when necessary. Other than this, it is compulsory to wear masks, maintain distance and sanitise,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-night-curfew-to-be-relaxed-for-2-more-hrs/articleshow/83558759.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Former CPM MLA CK Saseendran sought special tree felling order||KOZHIKODE: Former Kalpetta MLA and CPM leader CK Saseendran had written to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in Feb 2020 urging to favourably consider the demand to issue a special order that allows felling of reserved rosewood trees in assigned land in Wayanad. The chief minister had forwarded his letter on Feb 19, 2020 to principal secretary of revenue department and additional chief secretary of forest department with a remark to examine the matter. "I am attaching the memorandum received from Wayanad District Revenue Patta Land Protection Samiti president TM Baby. Request favourable consideration of demand to issue a special order for felling reserved rosewood trees in revenue patta land in Wayanad as a special package rather than as general file," reads the letter dated Feb 12, 2020. Environmentalists said that the letter raising the demand to issue a special order to fell reserved rosewood trees in assigned land shows that there was a concerted move to fell precious trees, which was government property. "For long, many people were eyeing the thousands of rosewood trees on assigned land. The demand for a special order to cut reserved rosewood trees as a special package and not as a general order seems to be a planned bid to axe trees which are protected by multiple laws of the land," said president of Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samiti N Badusha. Meanwhile, Saseendran said he had forwarded a petition from the organization which comprised people belonging to all political parties. Saseendran said that currently none of the laws in state allowed felling of reserved rosewood trees in assigned land and the request in the memorandum was to see if steps could be taken to help farmers. The Samiti had been campaigning for the right to fell rosewood trees on assigned land. It had said that as per Samiti’s estimate there were around 22,570 rosewood trees in 12,000 acres of revenue land which were assigned to farmers in Wayanad. They had said that of the lot, around thousands of trees (estimated to be worth Rs 400 crore) were damaged, dried up and going waste without any benefit to the government or farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/former-cpm-mla-sought-special-tree-felling-order/articleshow/83556513.cms||---

Bhatu’s orchard, 12 km from Junagadh city, was salvaged due to the success of high-density plantation (HDP), a scientific cultivation technology initiated by Junagadh Agricultural University (JAU) that has yielded results after years of efforts. He started cultivating the orchard using HDP under JAU experts’ guidance in 2005 and has been tasting success for the past two years. The technique has not only helped him counter the vagaries of climate but also seen the fruit yield increase multi-fold compared to conventional farming method. As HDP involves growing plants close to each other and limiting their height as compared to conventional farming, strong winds don’t inflict much damage and the yield obviously increases as the number of trees per hectare are more. “Many mango farmers are now approaching me to use the HDP method in their orchards,” Bhatu told TOI. JAU scientists this method of plantation also addresses the nagging issue of climate change which has resulted in drastic reduction in the yield over the years due to day-night fluctuation in temperature that causes flowering to wither away. In trees grown using HDP method, flowering and fruits come a fortnight early compared to conventional mango farming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/flattened-mango-farms-to-be-revived-with-new-tech/articleshow/83551732.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Coimbatore||Udhagamandalam: Forest dept to capture wounded tusker, put it in kraal||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The forest department has decided to capture a wounded tusker that has been roaming in a coffee plantation at Marthoma Nagar near Gudalur recently, as its health condition has deteriorated. Aged around 32 years, the elephant was first spotted with wounds three years ago in the Gudalur forest range. A senior forest officer, who requested anonymity, said the wound was spreading to the tusker’s back, limiting the animal’s movement. “We have decided to capture the pachyderm and keep it in a kraal for treatment. Four kumkis from the Theppakadu elephant camp in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) are kept ready for the capturing operation.” Ideally, the officer said, the tusker should be left alone in the forest. “But we cannot ignore the animal that is dying in front of our eyes. Hence, we are treating the tusker in all possible ways.” He said they were not certain about how the animal was injured. After sustaining the injury, the tusker hadn’t left the Gudalur forest range, where it has been roaming around Silver Cloud estate area and Eppakadu coffee plantation at Marthoma Nagar. G Ramakrishnan, Gudalur forest range officer, said the tusker’s movement was, of late, restricted to 3km radius. “We have been treating the elephant by feeding it fruits laced with medicines. A team of veterinarians is observing the elephant.” He said the chief wildlife warden in Chennai had issued an order to capture the elephant and keep it in a kraal for treatment. “The kraal will be ready in another two days. The work is going on at Abiyaranyam in the MTR. The tusker is now located in a difficult terrain surrounded by residential areas. We hope the animal would move to a plain area in another two days, when we could easily dart it with tranquilizer. The incessant rain is also likely to delay the capturing operation.” A 10-member team led by Rajendran is monitoring the tusker presently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/forest-dept-to-capture-wounded-tusker-put-it-in-kraal/articleshow/83556473.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: After many broken vows, 2-decade wait for rly underbridge may end||NEW DELHI: After several years of delay, the Kishanganj railway underbridge may finally become operational on December 15 this year. North Delhi Municipal Corporation took such a decision after a joint visit to the site by mayor Jai Prakash and commissioner Sanjay Goel on Tuesday. The fate of the project had been hanging in the balance for over two decades due to shortage of funds to complete it. In 2019, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs agreed to provide 80% of the amount required to complete the pending work, including payments to Northern Railway. With elections due in 2022, the completion of incomplete projects is important for the municipal corporations. “While Northern Railway has completed almost 90% of the work on the underbridge, we received Rs 10 crore from the urban affairs ministry recently and we will soon start the tendering process for the construction of roads on both sides of the facility,” said mayor Jai Prakash, who added that after the project is opened to use, commuters will get permanent relief from traffic problems in the area. The mayor disclosed that the task of installing four push boxes by Northern Railway has been completed and 20 more days are needed to construct the sidewalls, level and connect the boxes properly. He said, “A joint pump house and drainage/ sewerage lines have also been developed to prevent groundwater and rainwater accumulating. During Tuesday’s survey, we directed the engineering department to ensure that the drain was desilted to allow the pump to operate properly.” The project was proposed in 1998. Several revisions and re-revisions later, the north corporation was able to open only one push box instead of four. The underbridge is expected to decongest Sadar Bazar, Rohtak Road, areas in Walled City Extension and Azad Market. Of the four passes, two are meant for commuters wanting to avoid the main market/industrial area and the other two for locals visiting shops and residential areas. The civic body has decided to start the work of beautification of Azad Market Chowk very soon, including planting of vertical gardens on flyover pillars, installing mosaic tiles and giving new coats of paint. Jai Prakash said, “We have plans for fencing and plantation around the compacting station below the Rani Jhansi Flyover. The vertical gardens on some of the pillars near Azad Chowk are looking shabby now and I have asked officials to install fresh flowerpots there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-many-broken-vows-2-decade-wait-for-rly-underbridge-may-end/articleshow/83556466.cms||Vibha Sharma

The survey indicated that the second wave and lockdown rules and restrictions have forced majority of the senior citizens to live in critical conditions. Around 69% elderly respondents from the state said cases of abuse had increased during lockdown and after. Among them, 63% claimed that interpersonal relationships is the main factor responsible for fast increasing incidence of elder abuse in families. The survey was conducted during June and included 500 respondents Rajasthan out of the total 5,000 from across the country. Every third elderly (33%) claimed that they faced domestic violence (physical/verbal) in old age. Speaking about the initiative, Agewell Foundation chairman Himanshu Rath said, “Covid pandemic has emerged as a major cause of concern for every section of society. People are struggling to protect themselves from Covid and its consequences all over the world. Though Covid situation and related lockdown rules and restrictions have affected almost every human being, older persons are the most vulnerable. There is an urgent need to sensitise the entire community about the growing incidences of elder abuse. Older persons also need to be educated about support systems, legal provisions and non-formal support network, accessible and available to them.” In all, 79.5% of elderly respondents from Rajasthan claimed that their life had been affected adversely during current Covid situation. During the study it was found that 62% elderly respondents were facing neglect in their life. Approximately 59% elderly respondents said they were suffering abuse in their families and society. The survey concluded that that most elderly have to depend on family care, which makes them vulnerable. Incidences of elder abuse, mistreatment, and harassment of elderly occur primarily within their respective families are on rise due to vulnerability of older people. Elderly women are worst affected due to their poor financial status, increased level of dependency and even due to longer lifespan comparatively elderly men. Agewell Foundation has been working for the welfare and empowerment of old people across the country since 1999.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/69-raj-elders-faced-abuse-during-lockdown-says-survey/articleshow/83556478.cms||---

A loan restructuring, for which a meeting of lenders will be convened over the next few days, will provide relief to the promoters led by the Gaur family, which has lost Jaypee Infratech, its crown jewel that had a massive land bank, running from Noida to Agra along expressways. The proposal has been on the table for months but so far the lenders have failed to make much headway. Even as lenders deliberate are structuring, the company’s stock has been on fire in recent days, surging almost 70% from Rs 8.86 on May 31 to nearly Rs 15, when it again hit the upper circuit on the BSE. Volumes too have shot up, creating fresh surprise in the market. While the exchanges had sought an explanation for the recent rise, JAL said it had been making the requisite disclosures and was not aware of any reasons. While the buzz around a loan restructuring — which will need a clearance from RBI — is one of the triggers, a possible conversion of an FCCB is said to be the other reason for the rise. A higher price will again be beneficial to the promoters, who owned nearly 38.5% in the company. JAL was among the second batch of two dozen companies referred by the RBI for insolvency resolution in 2017. While several cases have been resolved, JAL has been slow off the blocks. Banking sources, however, said that pushing through a restructuring, despite backroom manoeuvres by at least one of the top lenders in the country, may not be easy.  To begin with, the restructuring attempts from lenders led by ICICI Bank comes despite Bank of Maharashtra seeking to declare the company, along with its promoters and directors, as wilful defaulters —a tag that will deny them access to fresh funding from the banking system. Besides, there has to be a rating from one of the agencies suggesting that the exercise will be sustainable for the account that turned into a non-performing asset several quarters ago. Further, the RBI will have to reverse its own position after having identified JAL as one of the cases where lenders were asked to push for bankruptcy action, including removal of the current management as the first step. Apart from being the majority owner of Jaiprakash Associates, a title that it has lost, JAL has assets in the cement and power sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jal-lenders-make-fresh-loan-recast-bid/articleshow/83560564.cms||Sidhartha
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Incessant rain throws normal life out of gear in Nilgiris||UDHAGAMANDALAM: Incessant rainfall on Monday affected normal life in Ooty and other parts of the district. Strong wind and wet weather paved the way for uprooting of at least 12 huge trees in the past two days. All the trees were cut and removed by the fire service personnel in association with the state highways. Ooty plunged into darkness as the town went without power for over 14 hours starting from Monday 10pm as a huge tree was uprooted on the Ooty-Coonoor main road near Aavin head office. “Even after the fallen trees at three locations in Ooty town were removed, it took time for us to locate the fault by checking each electric pole. The delay in resuming power was due to this reason,” an official of TNEB said. According to fire service personnel, at least seven fallen trees were cleared from various roads in Ooty, while in Coonoor three fallen trees were cut and removed. Kotagiri and Gudalur reported one tree each uprooted. While Upper Bhavani registered the highest rainfall of 109mm, Avalanchi and Devala received 83mm and 57mm respectively ending 24 hours at 7 am on Tuesday. Pandalur recorded 51 mm while Gudalur and Naduvattam received 24mm and 18.5mm respectively. Ooty registered 8mm of rainfall. Motorists found it difficult to navigate the roads due to the prevailing thick mist. As the southwest monsoon has become active in the Nilgiris, the district administration has taken all the measures to handle any eventuality. Nilgiris collector said J Innocent Divya said, “As many as 42 teams comprising inter-departments have been pre-positioned as part of a disaster management measure. Also, 456 relief camps are kept ready across the district.” People living near vulnerable areas such as low-line areas and landslide prone areas have been warned. In case of any contingency, people from these areas will be shifted to nearby relief camps, according to the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/incessant-rain-throws-normal-life-out-of-gear-in-nilgiris/articleshow/83556514.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Rajkot: e-classes spur learning disabilities||RAJKOT: With restricted movements, the Covid-19 induced pandemic has been extremely tough for children. Even as they are struggling to cope up with online education, a study conducted by Saurashtra University (SU) has found that students of class 1 to 7 are facing learning disabilities like dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia and also suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). SU had initiated the study after receiving complaints from parents over its helpline that their children were turning mischievous, intentionally writing wrong answers, making wrong pronunciation when they were asked to study online. The study found that children are facing learning difficulties in subjects like English, Mathematics and Science. “We have found that online study is resulting in learning difficulties among children because students cannot concentrate on study. They feel emptiness, headache, get bored. Children find it difficult to understand what teacher is speaking. There are several children who understand what teacher is speaking but find it difficult to write it down in their notebooks,” said Dhara Doshi. Doshi, assistant professor at SU’s Department of Psychology, conducted the study with her student Jayesh Vala on 990 students of Rajkot to understand their mental condition during online study in the last one and half years. The researchers arrived at the conclusion following talks with children and their observing their writings. The study found that 9.90 % children are suffering from dyslexia because of which their learning speed becomes slow. Such kids cannot understand difference between similar alphabets like ‘d’ and ‘b’ or ‘ta’, ‘tha’, ‘da’, ‘dha’ in Gujarati. Around 6.30 % are suffering from dyscalculia which is an abnormality to understand maths among children. Researchers noticed that a child of class six was not able to sum up four plus four. Another 18 % were found to be suffering from dysgraphia which made child’s handwriting very bad. “We found that 13.50 % children found it difficult to concentrate on studies because it is a new learning style. There are several children who are not acquainted with multi-tasking and find it difficult to understand, read and write at the same time,” she said. Some children were found to be facing ADHD which made them impulsive and hyperactive. Such kids cannot concentrate and sit peacefully at one place. “Parents need to understand these symptoms and identify them. The psychology has solutions which can control learning disabilities. Both children and parents need regular psychological guidance. Treat the child with love, motivate them and continue evaluation,” said Yogesh Jogsan, head of psychology department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/e-classes-spur-learning-disabilities/articleshow/83551778.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The sluices of the Mettur reservoir were opened for Kuruvai cultivation in the Delta districts by the chief minister M K Stalin on the customary date of June 12. Elated farmers in Trichy offered flowers to the irrigation water. By 12 pm, the outflow of water at Upper Anicut was 2,317 cusecs, said PWD officials adding that the water level stood at 94.86 feet at Mettur reservoir by Tuesday noon. The water flow to the Upper Anicut will stabilise after the steady discharge of water from Mettur reservoir. The reservoir discharged 10,000 cusecs of water, while the inflow to the dam was 961 cusecs. It took three days for the water to reach the Upper Anicut after it was released on Saturday given the absorption of water on the river bed. PWD officials said that water crossed Panayapuram by 3 pm raising a hope that water could reach Grand Anicut (Kallanai) by this evening or by Tuesday night. Water will be released from Grand Anicut on Wednesday morning to reach the tail end areas of the Delta districts. Kuruvai paddy is cultivated on 3.5 lakh acres in the delta comprising Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam districts and parts of Trichy, Ariyalur, Cuddalore and Pudukkottai. It may be noted that the construction of a new barrage across the Kollidam River in Mukkombu was expected to be completed in two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cauvery-water-reaches-mukkombu/articleshow/83556520.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The deceased was identified as Lalwati Devi, aged around 70 years. She was rushed to the Sadar hospital but died during treatment. No postmortem was conducted and police allowed her family members to take away the body for cremation. Manjhagarh police station SHO (in-charge) Ravikant Dubey on Tuesday said Lalwati’s son Gopichandra Sahni had submitted a written statement in connection with the incident, ruling out any foul play. Dubey, quoting Sahni, said his wife had kept a bowl of dye over a table in the house to colour her hair. “However, her child started crying and she went inside the bedroom to nurture him. In a hurry, she left the dye prepared in a bowl on the table which her partially blind mother-in-law consumed it thinking that drinking water was kept for her,” he said. The SHO said the family members took her to the hospital but didn’t inform the police. “She remained under treatment for several hours but later died. The family members took away the body back home after submitting a written statement at the Sadar hospital police post that they don’t want any postmortem conducted and there was no foul play in it,” he said. Dubey said they were yet to contact the family members of the deceased woman for detailed interrogation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/elderly-blind-woman-drinks-hair-dye-dies/articleshow/83548888.cms||---

Almost 75% of Tuesday’s recipients paid for the vaccine at private hospitals and other vaccine providers. “We are getting a small but steady supply of vaccines on a daily basis,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani told TOI. “We have hence decided to increase the number of daily beneficiaries from 100 in each centre to 200 this week. The next week, we will increase this number to 300,” he said. In May, due to a shortage of the Covid-19 vaccines, people queued up in large numbers at places where the vaccines were available. “But that rush seems to have ebbed. People are not queuing up unnecessarily and are following the rules,” said Kakani. The BMC wants to vaccinate a lakh people every day in order to cover the majority within the next three months. So far, 41.8 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in Mumbai. Of these, 8.3 lakh have taken both the vaccine shots so far. The state vaccinated close to three lakh people on Monday.

Initially, the department is plying only non-luxury buses which will be available from Sindhi Camp bus station in intervals of 30 minutes. However, the Volvo bus to Delhi will start from July 1 for which the online bookings have been started. After the state government eased the restrictions last week, the department had decided that in the initial phase, around 1,600 buses will ply within the state with 100% seating capacity as no passenger will be allowed to travel standing, though now all roadways buses will be operational. "While we were always willing to send buses to other states, we were awaiting lifting of restrictions. Now, that has been done, so non-luxury express buses will ply from Jaipur to Delhi as well as Haryana. The passengers will have to follow the Covid protocol and carry all necessary documents required by the other states," said an official of the Rajasthan roadways. There are total 3,875 buses owned by the state roadways. Before lockdown, they would cover a distance of around 12 lakh kilometres on a daily basis,which had been cut down to nearly half though it is expected to increase again as interstate bus travel has been restarted. The department's revenue had also gone down drastically due to the lockdown and every month the earnings were less than Rs 15 crore. Commuters can book tickets online at www.rsrtconline.rajasthan.gov.in and can avail 5% discount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/roadways-starts-services-to-delhi-and-haryana/articleshow/83556510.cms||---

As per the notification, nomination for ZP chairpersons will be filed on June 26, while polling and counting will be held on July 3. SEC Manoj Kumar said, district magistrates would have to announce the reservation status of zila panchayats by Wednesday and the poll will be conducted as per UP Zila Panchayat rules, 1994. The poll panel’s notification comes a day after the Panchayati Raj department issued a notification on behalf of the governor. Zila panchayat chairpersons for 75 districts will be elected by 3,050 members in various districts. Jaunpur has a maximum 83 wards, followed by Sitapur and Lakhimpur Kheri which have 79 and 72 wards respectively. Gorakhpur, the home turf of chief minister Yogi Adityanath has 68 wards. Elections to zila panchayat wards were conducted in four phases in May, while counting kicked off on May 2. Though not fought on election symbols, the rural local body polls had assumed a political dimension after BJP fielded its functionaries on 3,050 ZP wards to cement its rural footprint and take on an aggressive opposition. Even as panchayat polls were billed as a semi-final to the assembly elections, the saffron party faced a formidable challenge from the opposition, essentially Samajwadi Party. BJP has already activated its machinery to open back-channel negotiations with independents, who won zila panchayat ward seats. A senior BJP leader said, the party seeks to win a maximum number of ZP chairman seats to expedite implementation of schemes at the ground level and consolidate its position before the big poll battle next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/zp-chairpersons-to-be-elected-on-july-3-poll-panel/articleshow/83558801.cms||Pankaj Shah
