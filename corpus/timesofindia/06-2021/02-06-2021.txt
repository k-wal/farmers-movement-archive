The US is the worst-affected country with 594,568 deaths, followed by Brazil with 462,791, India with 331,895, Mexico with 223,568 and Britain with 127,782. Here are the latest Covid-related developments across the world:WHO gives authorization to Sinovac vaccineThe World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday approved China's second Covid-19 vaccine 'Sinovac' for emergency use listing. "WHO today validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities the assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing," the UN health agency said in a statement. The vaccine is produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac. On May 7, WHO granted conditional approval to China's Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, which helped Beijing to step up its vaccine diplomacy amid the virus surge. Moderna seeks full FDA approval for its vaccineAmerican pharmaceutical company Moderna on Tuesday said that it has begun a “rolling submission” to the Food and Drug Administration of data from its studies of the two-dose vaccine. The FDA will scrutinise the information to see if the vaccine meets stringent criteria for full licensure. Moderna is the second Covid-19 vaccine maker to seek full approval, following Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. UK reports zero daily Covid deaths for first time since JulyBritain on Tuesday reported zero daily deaths from Covid-19 for the first time since 30 July 2020. According to the latest official figures, 127,782 people have died within 28 days of a positive test since the start of the pandemic, which is the worst death toll of any European country. Canada panel says Covid-19 shots can be mixed, move could hit AstraZenecaAn official Canadian panel on Tuesday said people who received the first shot of AstraZeneca PLC's Covid-19 vaccine can choose to receive a different shot for their second dose, dealing another potential blow to the pharmaceutical giant. The non-binding recommendation from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) means Canadians can choose to get second doses from Moderna Inc or Pfizer Inc. UK's Heathrow Airport opens terminal for high-risk travelersLondon's busy Heathrow Airport opened a dedicated new terminal on Tuesday for arrivals from countries designated as "red list", such as India, for a higher risk of Covid-19 transmission. Travellers on direct flights from such destinations will now go through Terminal 3 and then move directly to a government-approved quarantine facility booked at the passengers' own expense. It comes after the London airport's staff had raised fears for their safety because of overcrowding, amid concerns that travellers arriving from red list countries – from where travel is effectively banned except for British and Irish nationals or limited exceptions – were mixing with those from green and amber. Covid-19 restrictions on indoor restaurants and bars are eased in Rome. (Reuters)Italy opens bars, restaurants for indoor serviceItaly on Tuesday opened bars and restaurants finally threw open their doors for indoor service for the first time in months as the country sped up efforts to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis after a 10-week lockdown. Earlier, businesses in Italy had to either offer outdoor seating, or serve coffee in takeaway cups to customers. Almost 32,000 Italians have died of Covid-19 since the outbreak came to light on February 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after the US and Britain. Guangzhou locks down 2 areas as cluster growsChinese city Guangzhou on Tuesday imposed lockdowns on two neighborhoods after an additional 11 cases of Covid-19 were detected in the city. The surrounding province of Guangdong has already required anyone wishing to travel to other parts of China produce a negative test for the virus taken within the previous 72 hours. Guangzhou has 15 million people but it wasn't immediately clear how many people were affected by the lockdowns announced on Tuesday. More than 30 cases of local transmission have been detected in the city over recent days.

The Centre suggested that for sustained opening of districts, drop in cases and testing need to be supplemented by three goals — average seven-day test positivity of less than 5%, over 70% vaccination coverage among elderly and above 45 with co-morbidities, and community ownership of care and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Read AlsoCovid-19: Most of country should remain locked down for 6-8 weeks, ICMR chief saysThe head of the main Indian health agency responding to the coronavirus has said districts reporting a high number of infections should remain locked down for another six to eight weeks to control the spread of the rampaging disease. Dr Balram Bhargava, head of ICMR, said lockdown restrictions“We are moving in the right direction because of testing and containment at the district level. However, this is not a sustainable solution. We have to find a mechanism for how to ease our containment and lockdown and that has to be done very gradually and very slowly,” Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) DG Dr Balram Bhargava said. Officials stressed India has adequate capacity to ramp up vaccination in the next few months. Measures such as testing, contact-tracing, creation of micro-containment zones and community response in terms of wearing masks, physical distancing and providing support for treatment needs to be maintained without any slacking, they said. “From whatever we know from possible scenarios presented by eminent people, we do know that this (Covid-19 cases) will decline. June will be much better, stabilised but concerns are when we open up how do we behave because the virus has not gone,” Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said. “The unlocking has to be done very patiently guided by the vaccination that has been done for the vulnerable groups... Have some patience. By mid-July or early August, we will have more than enough doses to vaccinate up to a crore people a day. Our objective is to cover the entire population by December and that we should be able to do,” Bhargava said. Read AlsoCovid-19: Centre targets 1 crore vaccinations per day by July-AugustNEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday said there will be enough Covid vaccines in India by mid-July or early August this year to inoculate up to 1 crore people every day.

This includes over 17 crore people receiving at least one dose of the vaccine, whereas 4.36 crore people have been covered with both the doses of anti-Covid jabs. With increased production of vaccine projected over the next few months, the government is planning a major ramping up of vaccination drive post-July. The government also issued caution that in the absence of adequate measures, the virus may again strike back with opening up and lifting of intense restrictions that were imposed in the wake of surge in Covid-19 cases during the second wave. “With great difficulty and sacrifices, we have managed to bring down the curve of the pandemic. This situation is like this because we have suppressed the virus. This has not happened automatic. To think that we will go back to the earlier phase and things will remain like this is not true,” Dr Paul said. The daily Covid-19 cases have dropped significantly after touching a high of over 4.14 lakh cases on May 6. On Monday, around 1.27 lakh new cases were registered from across the country, whereas the active caseload now stands at around 19 lakh cases.

In April, the US President Joe Biden announced to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by September 11 this year. Since the President's decision, the Department of Defense has retrograded the equivalent of approximately 300 C-17 loads of material out of Afghanistan and have turned nearly 13,000 pieces of equipment to the Defense Logistics Agency for disposition, CENTCOM said. Also, the US has officially handed over six facilities to the Afghan Ministry of Defense.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-withdrawal-of-troops-from-afghanistan-is-30-44-complete-us-central-command/articleshow/83156376.cms||---

Two bombs exploded in quick succession in separate locations of a west Kabul neighborhood, killing at least 10 people and wounding a dozen others, said deputy Interior Ministry spokesman Said Hamid Rushan. A third bomb heavily damaged an electrical grid station in north Kabul, said Sangar Niazai, a spokesman for the government power supply department. The initial two bombings, both targeting minivans, happened in a mostly ethnic Hazara area of the capital, said Rushan. The first exploded near the home of a prominent Hazara leader, Mohammad Mohaqiq, and in front of a Shiite mosque. Most Hazaras are Shiites. The second bomb also targeted a minivan but Rushan said details were still being collected. Police cordoned off the two areas and investigators were sifting through the rubble. No one claimed responsibility for the bombings but the Islamic State group affiliate operating in Afghanistan has previously declared war on minority Shiites, who make up roughly 20% of the majority Sunni Muslim nation of 36 million people. The IS affiliate previously took responsibility for several attacks in May on Afghanistan's power supply stations in Kabul and in several other provinces. On May 8, a car bomb and two roadside bombs exploded outside the Syed-al-Shahada girls school, also in a predominantly Hazara neighborhood, killing nearly 90 people, many of them students. No one has yet claimed that attack but the US blamed IS. The attacks come as the United States wraps up its longest war by withdrawing the last of its 2,500-3,500 troops along with 7,000 allied NATO forces. The last soldiers are to be gone by Sept. 11 at the latest generating fears of increased chaos in a country already deeply insecure. Violence has escalated in Afghanistan even as the United States struck a peace deal with the Taliban in February 2020 under the previous Trump administration. The agreement called for the last of the US and NATO troops to be out of the country by May 1. Instead, the withdrawal began on May 1 after US President Joe Biden announced in mid-April America was ending its ``forever war.'' At the time, he declared terrorist groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State had been sufficiently degraded and it was no longer necessary to keep thousands of troops deployed to Afghanistan. Stalemated peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are set to resume in the Middle Eastern country of Qatar, said a member of the Afghan government negotiation team, Nader Nadery. The two sides have been meeting off and on since Sept. 12 but progress has been slight. ``I do not see any sign yet of meaningful talks from the Taliban on key issues to end this senseless war,'' said Nadery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/bombs-in-afghan-capital-kabul-kill-at-least-10-wound-12/articleshow/83156167.cms||---

Two other states recorded deaths at more than double the national average — Punjab (2.8%) and Uttarakhand (2.7%) — in the deadliest month of the pandemic, during which 1,19,183 fatalities were officially reported across India. This was the highest monthly toll reported by any country since the Covid outbreak began. Live updates: Coronavirus pandemicThe capital reported 8,090 deaths and nearly 2.8 lakh cases in May, translating to a CFR of 2.92%. Only the Andaman & Nicobar Islands (4.2%) and Nagaland (3.4%) had a higher death rate during the month. Such was the spurt in fatalities that as many as nine states and UTs reported more deaths in May than their cumulative tolls in all previous months. These included Assam, which reported 61% of all Covid deaths in May, 2,058 out of a total of 3,365. Uttarakhand, the venue of this year's Mahakumbh, reported 59% of all deaths from the virus in May, followed by Goa at 56%, Himachal Pradesh at 53% and Bihar at just over 50%. In absolute terms, Delhi's toll in May was the fourth highest. Maharashtra reported by far the highest deaths during the month, 26,531, which was 28% of all Covid fatalities in the state till date.

---||Business||Covid-19: Economists see deeper impact of second wave than government||NEW DELHI: Within minutes of release of fourth quarter GDP numbers, chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian made a detailed presentation on the economic situation, reminiscent of the pre-budget Economic Survey. His message was simple: The impact of the second wave, which has caused significant devastation in terms of lives and livelihood, will not be large. He pointed to several indicators and the global experience to argue his case. RBI too seems to be on the same page, which also expects a muted impact of the second wave, that may be confined to the April-June quarter with a possibility of a spill over to July. But economists in the private sector as well as international agencies are less upbeat, with state-run SBI slashing its growth projection from 11% before the second wave hit India to 7.9% now — a three percentage point cut (or 28% lower than original projection). Similarly, Paris-based OECD has lowered its estimate from 12.6% to 9.9%. “India is projected to be the fastest-growing G20 economy in 2021 — but also the one, which is the furthest away from its pre-crisis GDP trend. Pent-up demand for consumer durables and exports of manufacturing goods and services will act favourably, but other components will be far less supportive,” the think tank said in its overall assessment. Read AlsoEconomic impact of 2nd wave won’t be significant: CEANEW DELHI: The overall economic impact of the second wave of the pandemic will not be very significant, the government’s chief economist Krishnamurthy Subramanian said on Monday, adding that he expected manufacturing activity to bounce back in the coming months, resulting in higher demand forIn the Economic Survey, the finance ministry’s economic division has pegged the GDP growth at 11% but unlike several private sector economists, who have cut down their estimates to single-digit level, the government is yet to come up with a fresh estimate and will only do so later when it gets a full picture. Although the government often accuses private agencies and think tanks of a “herd mentality”, being guided by the initial few projections, on their part, economists from these agencies suggest that the finance ministry has often under-estimated the impact. For instance, last year, in a presentation before the Finance Commission, Krishnamurthy and his team had estimated the impact of the national lockdown to be quite low, although the government’s latest estimate showed that the Indian economy shrank by 7.3% in 2020-21 — the first decline in over four decades.

Our growth forecasts indicate a shortfall in GDP compared with our pre-pandemic expectations of more than 10% in fiscal 2021-22,” ratings agency Moody’s Investor Service said in a report, referring to the medium and long-term growth prospects. It now estimates the economy to grow 9.3%. Some economists also said the rural economy may not support overall growth this year as was evident in last year, something that the government does not seem to have factored in fully.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-19-economists-see-deeper-impact-of-second-wave-than-govt/articleshow/83156675.cms||---
---||World||Colombian soldiers given mixed reception in protest center Cali||CALI: Inhabitants of Colombia's third largest city reacted with fear and suspicion to the sight of soldiers patrolling the streets of Cali, but others have been cheering them. Cali has been the epicenter of civil unrest since protests sprang up around the country on April 28, initially against a tax hike that would have mostly affected the middle classes, amid economic pain caused by the pandemic. According to the NGO Indepaz, at least 44 of 71 deaths recorded during the month-old protests were in Cali, where the mayor's office said there have been 550 people injured. Last Friday, before night fell, Cali's 2.2 million inhabitants -- accustomed to the trauma of violent drug cartels operating in their city -- faced a new nightmare scenario. Civilians wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying weapons fired at protesters as the police watched. That day Colombia was marking one month of protests, and 13 people in the city were killed. According to authorities, eight of those had been shot. President Ivan Duque announced that same day he would deploy the military in Cali to help police, who were widely criticized internationally for the repression of demonstrators. During a tour of the city, an AFP team found rubble, piles of rubbish, destroyed road signs, broken windows and even a bullet casing. Since then, soldiers have been deployed to protect government buildings and shops, many of which had already been looted. As they pass, drivers honk their horns in support of the troops. "Unfortunately the army didn't arrive in time. They totally vandalized the Torre Empresarial building, and many businesses that lost everything," said Angela Sguerra, a 42-year-old doctor from the exclusive Ciudad Jardin neighborhood. But she added that the soldiers "make us feel more protected." The mood is different in the working class Siloe neighborhood, which has been through some bloody days since the protests began. "So far we've had no problems," Juliana Bonilla, 28, told AFP. Siloe is one of several parts of the city where protesters are nervously waiting for the arrival of the soldiers. "There have been clashes and friction with police so we're more cautious than ever," said Bonilla. Siloe also shows the signs of violence, including a torched shop from which firefighters pulled the charred remains of a man. Elizabeth Serna, 40, says the government "militarized" the city without listening to young people left destitute by the coronavirus pandemic and weary of the lockdowns. They are the ones who have taken to the streets to demand solidarity from the government, as well as job and educational opportunities. Duque visited the city on Saturday and while he was applauded in some parts, others shouted: "Get out!" One youngster yelled in his face: "You're killing us. We don't forgive you." Despite the deployment of troops, neither they nor police have approached the road blocks set up around the city by some protesters. One such demonstrator stands guard on top of a communal bin, surveying with binoculars who was entering or leaving the neighborhood. Nearby a man comes out of a tent and fires a gun in the air. Julian Rojas, 23, with his face painted in the colors of Colombia's flag, ties himself to an electricity pole and says he's beginning a hunger strike to support demonstrators. "We haven't had a military presence" in the streets, he says, but adds that he's seen helicopters and planes circling over the barricades. Businesswoman Lilibeth Tejada, 41, says she's happy the military has arrived. She wants them to reestablish order so she won't have to "defend my business when they come to loot it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/colombian-soldiers-given-mixed-reception-in-protest-center-cali/articleshow/83157338.cms||---
---||India||Retired intel officers now need to take prior govt nod before publishing tell-all books||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday revised its pension rules to make it mandatory for any retired government servant who has worked in an intelligence or security-related organisation, to seek prior permission from the head of the organisation before making any publication pertaining to domain of the organisation, including any reference or information about any personnel and his designation, and expertise or knowledge gained by virtue of working in that organisation. Until now, retired officers had to seek this prior nod only for publication of sensitive information the disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty, integrity or security of India. This permission was to be sought from head of the departmental in the organisation, and not the head of the organisation. The amendment in Rule 8 of Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 – pertaining to grave misconduct on part of a pensioner and action against such misconduct – that expands the scope of the restraint on retired intelligence officers does not have a time bar in terms of post-retirement applicability. It appears to be clearly aimed at checking incidents of retired intelligence officials, including those who have headed the organisations like Intelligence Bureau or RAW, spilling the beans on working of these agencies or their former colleagues, in books that they may author post-retirement. Some of these books have ended up creating controversies. Any grave misconduct, if proven against the pensioner, can lead to his/her pension to be withheld or withdrawn, either in full or in part. The ministry of personnel, in a notification issued on Tuesday, said clause (a) in sub-rule 3A in Rule 8 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972 was being substituted with a clause that states that no government servant, who, having worked in any intelligence or security-related organisation included in the Second Schedule of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (22 of 2005), shall, without prior clearance from the head of the organisation, make any publication after retirement, of any material relating to and including domain of the organisation, including any reference or information about any personnel and his designation, and expertise or knowledge gained by virtue of working in that organisation. The condition also applies to publication of sensitive information, the disclosure of which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, or relation with a foreign State or which would lead to incitement of an offence. Clause 3B follows, stating the head of the organisation shall vest with the authority to decide as to whether the proposed material for publication is sensitive or non-sensitive, and whether it falls in the domain of the organization. The new rules also make changes in Form 26, requiring pensioners to make an undertaking that save with the prior approval of the competent authority, they shall not publish in any manner, while in service or after retirement, any information or material or knowledge which is related to the domain of the organisation and obtained by virtue of my working in the said organisation. The declaration also adds a line where the officer affirms that he is aware that his pension can be withheld or withdrawn, in full or part, if he goes back on the undertaking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/retired-intel-officers-now-need-to-take-prior-govt-nod-before-publishing-tell-all-books/articleshow/83157410.cms||Bharti Jain

The action reverses one of former President Donald Trump's signature efforts to expand fossil fuel and mineral development in the United States. During his campaign, Biden pledged to protect the 19.6 million-acre habitat for polar bears, caribou and migratory birds. “President Biden believes America’s national treasures are cultural and economic cornerstones of our country and he is grateful for the prompt action by the Department of the Interior to suspend all leasing pending a review of decisions made in the last administration’s final days that could have changed the character of this special place forever,” White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said in a statement. Alaska-based green groups, which had sued to stop the lease sale, cheered the move. The first sale of tracts in the refuge, held two weeks before Trump left office in January, received limited interest from the oil and gas industry and generated high bids of just $14.4 million. The entities that won the leases were not immediately available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-suspends-oil-and-gas-leases-in-alaska-refuge-pending-review/articleshow/83158255.cms||---

Government sources said the “offence” under Section 51(b) of the DM Act entails criminal action and provides for a maximum one-year jail term upon conviction. The move, which is likely to escalate tensions between the Centre and CM Mamata Banerjee, saw MHA seeking an explanation “in writing” from the ex-bureaucrat within three days, as to why action should not be taken against him for violating the DM Act. Sources indicated if his explanation is not found satisfactory, registration of a criminal case could be the next course of action. Pointing to Section 51 of the DM Act, 2005, which lays down penalties for those who refuse, without reasonable cause, to comply with a direction given on behalf of the Centre or national executive committee (apex body for disaster management), the notice said Bandyopadhyay had disobeyed binding directions. Read AlsoChief Secretary retires ‘hurt’, will be Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee's chief adviser for 3 yrsBengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Monday opted for superannuation instead of reporting to Delhi’s North Block as directed by last Friday’s central government order.

On reaching Kalaikunda Air Force station for the scheduled review with the chief minister and chief secretary, the PM waited for 15 minutes in the meeting room for officers of the state government to arrive. “In view of the absence, chief secretary was called by an official as to whether they wanted to participate in the review meeting or not… thereafter, chief secretary, government of West Bengal, arrived along with the chief minister inside the meeting room and left thereafter immediately,” the notice said. An offence under Section 51 may see maximum jail term extended to two years where the refusal to comply with directions has resulted in loss of lives or imminent danger thereof. Officials in Kolkata indicated that “a proper reply to this would be sent in due time”. The original meeting between the PM and the CM was not convened under the disaster management law, they added. The Bengal CM, in a five-page letter to PM Modi on Monday, had mentioned that any causal link between the “unconstitutional, unprecedented, vindictive” transfer and the Kalaikunda developments would be “sacrificing public interest at the altar of misplaced priorities”. Neither the Bengal government nor Bandyopadhyay reacted to the notice on Tuesday. Former state chief secretary Basudeb Banerjee said Bandyopadhyay would have to “take legal advice and reply to this himself”. “But this is not related to his service conditions and should be dealt with separately,” he added. Meanwhile, TOI has learnt that the department of personnel and training (DoPT), to whom Bandyopadhyay was directed to report first on Monday and then on Tuesday, may not initiate disciplinary action since he retired on Monday, making the order asking him to report to DoPT for placement of his services at the Centre, null and void.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-ex-cs-alapan-bandyopadhyay-gets-notice-from-mha-faces-up-to-1-yr-jail/articleshow/83158471.cms||Bharti Jain
---||World||Pelosi rules out having Biden create January 6 commission||WASHINGTON: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is ruling out a presidential commission to study the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, telling House Democrats on Tuesday that having President Joe Biden appoint a panel is unworkable even after the Senate blocked an independent probe last week. Pelosi laid out possible next steps after Friday's Senate vote, in which Senate Republicans blocked legislation to create an independent, bipartisan panel to investigate the siege by former President Donald Trump's supporters. She proposed four options for an investigation of the attack, according to a person on the private Democratic caucus call who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. The first option, Pelosi said, is to give the Senate another chance to vote on the commission. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to move forward with the bill, and a seventh missed the vote but said he would have backed it. That means Democrats would only need support from three additional Republicans to reach the 60 votes needed for passage. The commission would be modeled after a highly respected panel that investigated the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The other options involve the House investigating the attack, meaning the probes would be inherently partisan. Pelosi suggested that she could appoint a new select committee to investigate the siege or give the responsibility to a single committee, like the House Homeland Security panel, which wrote the original bipartisan bill to create the commission. Alternately, Pelosi said committees could simply push ahead with the investigations that are already underway. But the speaker said she believed a commission appointed by Biden _ an idea pitched by some in her caucus after Friday's Senate vote was ``not a workable idea in this circumstance.'' It is unclear why she holds that view. Pelosi's comments come as members of both parties have pushed for a deep dive into the insurrection, which was designed to interrupt the presidential electoral count and was the worst attack on Congress in two centuries. Four rioters died in the attack, including a woman who was shot by police as she tried to break into the House chamber while lawmakers were still inside. The rioters brutally beat police and broke in through windows and doors as they hunted for lawmakers and called for Trump's defeat to be overturned. The White House has not yet said whether Biden would appoint a commission without Congress, but some Democrats urged him to take that step. ``In light of the GOP's cowardly filibuster of a bipartisan January 6th commission, I urge President Biden to form and appoint a Presidential Commission to fully investigate the insurrection at the United States Capitol, to identify the individuals and organizations who plotted or were involved in those violent acts, and to make recommendations to prevent such an attack from ever recurring,'' said Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly in a statement. It's uncertain whether the Senate would hold another vote on the commission and whether any additional Republicans would support it. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, left open the possibility of a second attempt, saying after the vote that ``the events of Jan. 6 will be investigated.'' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., opposes the commission, saying he believes the panel would be partisan even though it would be divided evenly between the two parties. Trump opposes the commission as well, calling it a ``Democrat trap.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pelosi-rules-out-having-biden-create-january-6-commission/articleshow/83158535.cms||---

Tuesday's meeting of the first state reparations committee in the U.S. came as President Joe Biden commemorated the lives of hundreds of Black people killed by a white mob in what was then a thriving African-American community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a century ago. It also comes just over a year after George Floyd, a Black man, was murdered by a white police officer in Minnesota.  A federal slavery reparations bill passed out of the House Judiciary Committee in April, but it faces steep odds. The bill, commonly referred to as H.R. 40 was first introduced in Congress in 1989 and refers to the failed government effort to provide 40 acres (16 hectares) of land to newly freed slaves as the Civil War wound down.  Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who as a state assemblywoman authored the state legislation creating the task force, noted the solemnity of the occasion as well as the opportunity to right an historic wrong.  "Your task is to determine the depth of the harm, and the ways in which we are to repair that harm," said Weber, whose parents were sharecroppers forced to leave the South because of a lack of opportunity.  Critics have said that California did not have slaves and should not have to study reparations. But Weber said the state is an economic powerhouse that can point the way for a federal government that has been unable to address the issue.  The task force will craft an apology and identify policies that contribute to ongoing racial disparities in education, the criminal justice system, generational wealth and other areas. Black people make up just 6% of California's population yet constitute an overwhelming percentage of people in prison, the economically needy and those who are homeless.  The nine task force members, appointed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and leaders of the Legislature, include the descendants of slaves who are now lawyers, academics and politicians. Slavery may not have flourished in California, but African Americans were still treated harshly in the state. Their neighborhoods in San Francisco and Los Angeles were razed in the name of development.  "We have lost more than we have ever taken from this country. We have given more than has ever been given to us," said state Sen. Steven Bradford, who is on the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-task-force-launches-slave-reparations-task-force/articleshow/83158571.cms||---
---||Goa||Tarun Tejpal case judge ‘did not apply mind’: Goa govt in retrial plea||PANAJI: The Goa government, in its amended application before the high court of Bombay at Goa, has sought a retrial of the rape case against Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal, contending that the judge didn’t apply her mind while delivering the judgment that acquitted him. The state has asked the court to allow the application and grant leave to appeal. The application was filed on Monday and is likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday. “The court disbelieved the version of the prosecutrix (survivor) on the basis of a conception of how a victim is expected to behave while being sexually assaulted. It is most respectfully submitted that this finding by the trial court is unsustainable in law, and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy,” the application said. The application states that the additional sessions court did not consider a Supreme Court judgment (Aparna Bhat vs State of Madhya Pradesh), which held that courts should refrain from commenting on the conduct of the prosecutrix in rape trials based on habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and past sexual history, among other things. The application also says that the "apology" sent by the accused to the survivor after the incident, corroboration of survivors’ testimony by her colleagues who deposed as witnesses in court, and the various text messages exchanged between the accused and the prosecutrix soon after the incidents of alleged rape, were not considered by the trial court. "The said apologies sent merely a day after the complaint was made by the prosecutrix were an unequivocal admission of the incidents alleged by the prosecutrix, made without inducement, threat or promise," the application said, adding that the apologies are admissions under Section 21 of the Indian Evidence Act. It claimed that the trial court had completely ignored "the most telling piece of evidence in the case, which establishes the guilt of the accused beyond a shadow of doubt". The state government also said that the trial court had cast aspersions on the investigating officer with regard to the seizure of the DVRs on November 29, 2013, and has further suggested that the investigating officer had destroyed CCTV footage of the first floor of November 7, 2013. "The trial court has ignored the fact that the original DVRs are deposited before the court and have also been forensically examined by CFSL, Hyderabad, first at the request of the police, and then, subsequently, pursuant to the order of the apex court," the state said. Referring to the judgment that mentions "drunken banter" between the accused and the survivor, the application pointed out, "Merely because the prosecutrix chose to remain silent on the repeated attempts of the accused to create a defence for himself does not lead to the automatic inference that the prosecutrix had accepted his version". The state also said that the FIR was not registered at the behest of the prosecutrix but by the state of Goa, suo motu, upon being made aware of the alleged rape inside the lift. Consequently, there was no occasion for the prosecutrix to have any meaningful medical examination, and this fact cannot be held against her, the application said. "The trial court has drawn an adverse inference against the survivor for not looking sufficiently traumatised or appearing fearful after the two incidents and in the messages she exchanged after the incidents," the state said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tarun-tejpal-case-judge-did-not-apply-mind-goa-govt-in-retrial-plea/articleshow/83158127.cms||Murari Shetye
---||India||Monsoon likely to be at higher end of normal: IMD||NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday upgraded its monsoon forecast and said the country would receive “normal to above normal” rainfall with “well distributed” showers in the June-September period. “Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole is likely to be 101% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 4%,” IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said while releasing the second stage long range forecast. In the first stage forecast in mid-April, the IMD had predicted rainfall to be 98% of the LPA with a model error of ± 5%. The LPA of monsoon rainfall over the country for the period 1961-2010 is 88 cm. The 2021 monsoon will be the third consecutive year of good rainfall, and could lead to new record foodgrain output like in 2019 and 2020. However, certain pockets in the country, including small areas of north-west India, Bihar, Assam, northern West Bengal, Meghalaya, Ladakh and the western part of the south peninsula, may get “below normal” rainfall during the four-month season. In northwest India, parts of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, including areas in Delhi-NCR, may fall in this category. The prediction, however, showed that there would be no shortage of rains for farming operations as the entire “monsoon core zone”, which consists of the rain-fed agriculture regions of the country, is likely to get “above normal” rainfall. Monsoon onset over Kerala is expected around Thursday. Its gradual progress will kick off kharif (summer) sowing operations which are mostly dependent on rains. The IMD, for the first time, released maps of “monsoon core zone”, showing state-wise distribution of rainfall as probabilistic forecast, using the multi-model ensemble (MME) forecasting system. Under the new strategy, it issued monthly (June) and seasonal (June to September) operational forecasts for southwest monsoon rainfall over the country. “Climate models with the highest forecast skills over the Indian monsoon region including Monsoon Mission Climate Forecasting System (MMCFS) have been used to prepare the MME forecast,” Mohapatra said. Considered the most advanced and comprehensive system to arrive at monsoon forecast, the MME system makes it possible to forecast “spatial distribution” of seasonal rainfall with the probabilistic “regionally averaged rainfall forecasts” of “monsoon core zone” (covering most of central India) for better regional level planning of farming and other activities. Asked about the slight delay in monsoon beyond its normal date of June 1, Mohapatra said, “All the criteria, so far, have not been met. We are constantly monitoring the system. Conditions are gradually becoming favourable and we are expecting the onset around June 3."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/monsoon-likely-to-be-at-higher-end-of-normal-imd/articleshow/83158154.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Police informed them that the boy who they thought was their child born out of surrogacy had in fact been kidnapped from a Bengaluru hospital. Psychiatrist Dr Rashmi Shashikumar, who had allegedly abducted the boy and handed him over to the couple as part of a Rs 14.5-lakh surrogacy deal, is now in custody. “The house still had all the signs of the birthday celebrations. Balloons, colourful festoons and toys were all over the place. But we had a duty to do and we had come to take back the child,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/baby-not-yours-couple-told-as-they-mark-birthday/articleshow/83159355.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

It said immediate steps were required to ensure that 2021-22 does not go down as the previous year, which has been the “darkest year of the economy in four decades”. Addressing a press conference, former finance minister P Chidambaram said the government earlier sold a false story of economic recovery when there was no such evidence, and it has fallen flat in no time. He said it was time for the Centre to reverse its “disastrous policies”. Tweeting a graph of rising unemployment rate, Congress’ Rahul Gandhi remarked, “PM’s hall of shame — Minimum GDP. Maximum Unemployment.” “The current state of the economy is no doubt largely due to the impact of the pandemic, but it has been compounded by the ineptitude and incompetent economic management of the BJP-led NDA government… suggestions on fiscal expansion and cash transfers have been turned down. Hollow packages like Atmanirbhar have fallen flat,” he said. “Take steps now and try to prevent a disaster of a third wave,” he said. P Chidambaram said the government earlier sold a false story of economic recovery when there was no such evidence, and it has fallen flat in no time. He said it was time for the Centre to reverse its ‘disastrous policies’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/print-more-money-spend-liberally-p-chidambaram-advises-govt/articleshow/83159294.cms||---

The district administration on Tuesday announced that these many bereaved families will be given a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each. The deaths had begun on Friday last week with 14 reported cases first, but bodies started piling up at the district hospital almost by the hour after that, rising steadily to 25, 36, 55 and then 87. District magistrate CB Singh said, “Compensation will be given to the families of all the suspected hooch death victims whose viscera have been preserved and sent to the forensic science laboratory for analysis.” Chief medical officer (CMO) BP Kalyani said that post-mortem examinations on 87 people have been done so far. “Results of 35 have come," the CMO told TOI. The CMO added that another 29 people are in hospital undergoing treatment. “While 17 are admitted at Varuna Trauma hospital, 12 are in Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College,” he said. Unlike in many other hooch tragedies, this time the deadly concoction was being sold at government-sanctioned liquor vends. The administration has cancelled the registration of 16 liquor shops, said sub-divisional magistrate (Koil) Ranjeet Singh. Police have arrested 33 people, including main accused Vipin Yadav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-hooch-toll-hits-87-families-to-get-5-lakh-aid/articleshow/83159656.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The decision to convene the two-plus-two dialogue “at the earliest” was taken during a telephonic conversation between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his Australian counterpart Peter Dutton on Tuesday. The two ministers reviewed the progress of various defence cooperation initiatives between the two countries, in the backdrop of the current regional situation and expressed satisfaction at the growing bilateral military ties. “Both ministers acknowledged the momentum that defence cooperation between India and Australia has achieved following the upgrade of the partnership to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in June 2020. Australia’s participation in the Malabar exercise has been an important milestone in this enhanced partnership,” a defence ministry official said. The navies of the Quad, namely India, the US, Japan and Australia, had come together for the high-voltage Malabar exercise in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea in November 2020 after a gap of 13 years. In April, the Quad countries had also joined France in its ‘La Pérouse’ naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal, underlining the growing strategic congruence in ensuring a secure and stable Indo-Pacific region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-australia-to-hold-two-plus-two-dialogue-soon/articleshow/83159691.cms||---

These “start-ups” will be selected based on the innovative products and services they can provide across a wide range of sectors from health, housing, care centres, technology access linked to needs ranging from finances, food and wealth management to legal guidance. The MoSJE is planning to open the process for calling startups to apply to be a part of SAGE from June 5 through a dedicated portal. All proposals will be uploaded and selection will be based on blind review by an independent screening committee of experts. The first set of selected startups will be hosted on the portal in about two months’ time. The MoSJE will be providing a fund of Rs 1 crore fund as one - time equity to each selected start-up. According to the plan, the SAGE project aims to identify, evaluate, verify, aggregate, and deliver products, solutions, services directly to the stakeholders, giving them wide choice to select the products, solutions and services that would suit their requirements and help in improving their quality of life. The MoSJE will act as the facilitator in the entire process enabling the elderly to access the credible products through these identified start-ups. Speaking to TOI about the long term objective of this exercise, social justice secretary R Subrahmanyam said, “This project aims to give a boost to private participation in the elderly care sector by selecting and particularly promoting new startups with innovative ideas.” He added that with the rising elderly population and their daily care needs, it is evident that the government alone cannot respond to all the concerns and private players will need to be brought on board to further the idea of "silver economy" and the potential it holds. Data holds evidence of the emerging challenges. The number of older adults in India (people over the age of 60 years) stood at 104 million as of 2016, accounting for 8.6% of the total population. Unofficial estimates place the seniors at 120 million in 2020. Studies show that the population of older adults is expected to rise to 350 million by 2050. The SAGE project is shaped on the recommendations of the empowered expert committee report on startups for elderly. The report highlights that the business opportunities in this space could emerge from impact-focused enterprises (social enterprises, non-profits, informal networks), technology start-ups (fintech, adtech, foodtech, healthtech, wealthtech), legal and financial services (planning solutions, insurance, medico-legal) and infrastructure and managed care systems (senior housing, living facilities, care centres.). Research and data-driven organizations and incubators of social enterprises are also expected to come forward to be a part of SAGE. The empowered committee has recommended that during selection innovative ideas by young startups (with less than 3 years) put up by social incubators and independent startups which have worked on the elderly cause for 3 years should be considered and encouraged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/start-ups-for-elderly-care-to-get-a-big-push/articleshow/83159711.cms||Ambika Pandit

There is a target to procure 17,500 metric tonne (MT) wheat out of which 2575.9 MT has been procured till Monday. In view of the slow progress, district magistrate Abhishek Singh has issued show-cause notices to block cooperative officers of Bankebazar and Belaganj blocks. He also ordered to withhold their salary. The DM took this action against the officials at a meeting on Monday while reviewing the status of wheat procurement in the district, where he ordered the officials concerned to expedite the process for the same. District cooperative officer (DCO) Nikesh Kumar informed at the meeting that there is a target for procurement of 17,500 MT wheat in the district. So far, 2575.9 MT wheat from 494 farmers has been procured, which is only 14.72% of the target. Out of this, payment has been released to 406 farmers. The DM asked the DCO to ensure payment to remaining farmers within 48 hours. About 324 MT wheat has been made available to the State Food Corporation (SFC) at the rate of Rs 2029.76 per quintal. “In the district, 146 purchase centres have been identified for procurement of wheat, while 10 vyapar mandals and 84 PACS are active,” the DCO said at the meeting.

The NCLAT had earlier stayed an order by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) asking DHFL’s lenders to consider an offer made by Wadhawan. Wadhawan has petitioned the Supreme Court claiming that if the committee of creditors accept his offer, they will get much more than they would by selling the company to Piramal — the highest bidder chosen by lenders. Some 16 months after the lenders initiated a resolution process for DHFL in the NCLT, the tribunal asked them to consider an offer made by the jailed promoter. The letter from Wadhawan was submitted even as lenders were finalising sale of DHFL. According to lenders, the letter could not be considered as an offer for one-time settlement, nor could it have been considered as a resolution plan. Lenders had therefore gone ahead with the bidding process and approved the bid from Piramal Group after a bidding war, which included private equity fund Oaktree and Adani among the participants. After approval from the lenders, Piramal’s bid was cleared by the RBI and the Competition Commission of India. Wadhawan had offered to repay the entire outstanding Rs 91,158 crore to creditors with an upfront payment of Rs 9,000 crore and the balance over seven-eight years. According to lenders, there is no provision which allows Wadhawan to bid in the resolution process.

While two of these OTs were designated for general surgery, one was marked for orthopaedic and another for septic diseases like Hepatitis B and HIV. PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said being the largest government hospital of the state, a large number of surgical emergency cases, be it road accidents or injuries due to other reasons, is recorded in the Indira Gandhi central casualty of the hospital per day from across the state. “Most of these cases require immediate surgical interventions. The number of such cases, though, has registered a sharp drop these days due to the Covid-induced lockdown,” he added. “In cases associated with Hepatitis B and HIV, the OT has to be shut at least for a day after the surgery for fumigation and it sometimes creates temporary problems,” Dr Thakur said, adding two patients were taken to the operation tables in the new OTs minutes after they became functional on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a new surgical intensive care unit (ICU) attached to a 10-bed ward with centralised air-conditioning system, colour doppler, ECG and other modern equipment has also become functional at the PMCH. “In many serious cases, patients have to be kept in ICU after surgeries. The new facility will help such patients,” Dr Thakur added. A new clinical and surgical examination hall set up by MBBS and postgraduate students was also declared open by the PMCH. Meanwhile, the microbiology department began tests of fungal infections in its lab for confirmation of mucormycosis, which is on rise in some Covid and post-Covid patients, PMCH principal Dr V P Choudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmch-gets-four-new-ots-a-surgical-icu/articleshow/83153551.cms||VK Tripathi

At $2.5 billion from over 50 deals, investment in May also fell over 75% in value compared to $10.8 billion in the same month last year when at the peak of the first wave, RIL’s fundraising spree had helped prop up the market, as per data from Venture Intelligence. In a year characterised by a surge in liquidity from global markets especially the US, PE-VC firms made 351 deals totalling to $22.7 billion during the period January to May 2021. Despite a slowdown in overall deal activity owing to the disruption caused by rising cases, the digitisation of healthcare and fintech were the focus of investors this year compared to last year when edtech was the flavor of the season. Investment deals in the healthcare and life sciences sector helped lift the month’s PE-VC activity at $728 million making up almost 30% of total deal value. Zydus AHL’s $398 million fundraising form the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and other investors, Goldman Sachs’ $329 million bet in Aragen Life Sciences, and Lenskart’s $300 million raise from Falcon Edge Capital and others were the top deals. Payments startup Pine Labs also closed a $285 million round from Temasek and others. Arun Natarajan, MD of Venture Intelligence said the PE-VC activity in May was only a carry over of April’s momentum when a surge in liquidity led to an outlier quarter. There was a clear slant towards core healthcare, e-commerce and fintech in the month, he said. “It is not an unexpected outcome given that the rising cases affected a large majority personally in the second wave. But this is just a pause and the liquidity and bullishness is intact,” he added. Growth stage deals in high ticket sizes made up the majority of the investment activity in the month with the mega deals –deals over $100 million- made up $2.1 billion out of the total $2.5 billion. Early stage investments (seed and Series A,B) dipped marginally from 32 deals in April to 24 in May. May also saw two startups enter the unicorn club- fintech startup Zeta after a $250 million fundraise from Softbank Vision Fund, and B2B industrial commerce startup Moglix after raising $120 million from Falcon Edge and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-investment-drops-75-year-on-year-in-may/articleshow/83154645.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Patna||Healthcare should be made accessible in villages: Docs||PATNA: With the state witnessing the worst of human sufferings during the second wave of Covid and black fungus that followed it, the medical fraternity has now called for reshaping of the healthcare facilities from district headquarters to blocks for facing any such challenges in future. National president-elect of the Indian Medical Association, Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh, said panchayat representatives and mukhiyas, who are familiar with most villagers, would have to play an important role in screening diarrhoea, flu and fungal diseases and report the same to the nearest healthcare facility. “The government must provide at least two oximeters in every village to be regularly used by trained heath staff under the supervision of panchayat people. It will help monitor oxygen saturation level, the sudden decline of which led to happy hypoxia condition,” he said. Dr Singh added the second wave of Covid pandemic reminded lawmakers and authorities concerned not to keep the healthcare facilities confined to big urban hospitals, but to extend it down to villages. “Though there is no evidence of any new disease, there are strong chances of new strains to appear in the days to come,” said Dr B P Singh, head of cardiology at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna. He said viruses tend to get stronger for their survival by undergoing mutations and becoming more fatal. “Taking a lesson from Covid which demanded reinforcement of medicines and equipment, there is now an urgent need of a micro-level preparation to strengthen the health facilities down to villages. Environmental changes, lifestyle and injudicious use of drugs too could lead to many severe conditions,” he said. Former superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said lack of selective or specific anti-viral drugs was the main reason for the rise in complications due to viral infections, including Covid. “Most pathogenic microbes are identified and their drugs developed. Their mutation, transmission ability and effect on human organs remain uncertain till leading to diseases,” he said. Dr Prasad said the Covid spread rejuvenated the health system with rush of oxygen and other medicines and underlined the need for enhancing the strength of medical workers and doctors. “Basic healthcare facilities, trained persons and simple diagnostic appliances to test blood pressure, blood sugar and oxygen saturation should be provided to every village,” he added. Dr Satyajeet Singh, managing director of Ruban Memorial Hospital, said the preventive and social medicine branch of medical science could play a vital role in creating a healthy environment by making people aware on personal hygiene, proper lifestyle and immunity boosting food habits which could help lower the incidents of dozens of diseases which, if neglected, could prove fatal. “There always stands possibility of new biological agents like bacteria and virus, sometimes adapted forms of insects, causing disease of intense effects. We have faced cholera, plague and tuberculosis and are now exposed to Covid,” Dr Satyajeet said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/healthcare-should-be-made-accessible-in-villages-docs/articleshow/83153513.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Patna HC seeks to know Bihar govt’s plans to face third wave of pandemic||PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday sought to know from the state government its contingency plan for the impending third wave of Covid-19. The court also rapped the state government for failing to create storage facilities for liquid oxygen and procure sufficient cryogenic tankers for oxygen transportation. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar, while hearing a batch of PILs, asked the chief secretary to file a counter affidavit detailing the steps taken by the state government to address these issues. The PILs were filed by Shivani Kaushik, Rohit Kumar and Gaurav Kumar Singh on the second wave of Covid pandemic which left several people dead due to scarcity of oxygen and lack of proper treatment. The court also asked the state government to apprise it about its plans to vaccinate children. Advocate general Lalit Kishore, who appeared for the state government, informed the court that vaccine trial on children has already begun in the state. The court, however, asked him to furnish details about the ongoing statewide vaccination drive. Senior lawyer P K Shahi, who appeared for the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), submitted that the oxygen generation plant which was supposed to become functional at the hospital on May 10, is now being installed at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) by the state government. “All works related to the setting up of the plant at the PMCH were completed,” Shahi told the court. The bench slammed the state government for failing to create storage facilities for liquid oxygen after lifting them from industrial gas manufacturing plants outside the state. “Even tankers to carry liquid oxygen are unavailable,” it said. Meanwhile, the high court disposed of two interlocutory applications regarding pollution in the Ganga due to dumping of bodies of Covid victims. The court asked the state government to upload details about Covid tests and vaccination at block level to the government website. The high court will hear the PILs regarding lack of infrastructure at ESIC hospital at Bihta on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-hc-seeks-to-know-bihar-govts-plans-to-face-third-wave-of-pandemic/articleshow/83153419.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Court rejects bail plea of JAP chief||PATNA: The Madhepura district and sessions court on Tuesday rejected the regular bail petition of former MP-cum-Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) chief Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav in a 32-year-old kidnapping case lodged against him. The court of district judge Ramesh Chand Malviya rejected the bail petition on the ground that Yadav had intentionally misused the privilege of the bail granted to him earlier by not appearing before it for hearing that led to delay in disposal of the case on time. The court also observed that Yadav may move bail petition again if commitment of the case is not done within six months. It was on December 16, 1993 that an ACJM court in Madhepura had cancelled the bail bond of Yadav in the case after he failed to appear before it for hearing on 26 occasions. A battery of lawyers, including Manan Kumar Mishra, Manoj Kumar Ambashth and Sanjeev Kumar appeared for Yadav and argued that summons or notices were never served to their client for appearance in the case. They also submitted that the lawyer responsible for representing Yadav had stopped appearing due to which bond was cancelled and he could not know about it. The court was also apprised that Yadav remained in judicial custody from 1999 to 2013 in a CBI case and he was never remanded in the kidnapping case. The court, however, was not satisfied with the response. Public prosecutor Indra Kant Chaudhary, opposing all pleas, informed the court that cases against other accused has already been disposed of after commitment, but it could not be done in the case Yadav due to his non-appearance. The Madhepura ACJM court had issued a non-bailable warrant against Yadav in September last year for not appearing before it for hearing in the kidnapping case registered against him and 10 others with Murliganj police station in 1989. Yadav was arrested from Patna on March 11. He was initially charged with lockdown violation by Patna police. The JAP chief was set free on personal bond in the case. The police, however, kept him detained on the request of Madhepura police as a non-bailable warrant was pending against him. He was then taken to Madhepura and forwarded to judicial custody after production in a local court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/court-rejects-bail-plea-of-jap-chief/articleshow/83153478.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||Covid made tech adoption faster||By M MuneerThe second wave of Covid is wreaking havoc across the country, and the ever-mutating virus is driving the scientific community crazy. The intermittent lockdowns and SMS (sanitation, masks and social distancing), as a result, are likely to continue for years to come. How will it pan out for our work culture? Here are some predictions after talking to global experts and CEOs — not mere crystal-gazing. The new normal possibly could be transformational and it is better to brace up to enjoy the ride: No more power dressing for work Whether people call it hybrid models or work-from-home (WFH), for many of us work from remote locations will be a way of life. Like that old clothing brand ad, Friday dressing is for everyday — at least on the upper part of the body. ‘Casual professional’ will be the norm and, as Anand Mahindra said, lungi and jacket protocol for board meetings. Creating appropriate areas for different family members and using better technology for trouble-free work will be the priorities. People will no more tolerate crying babies and barking pets in the background or crawling across the screen during serious meetings. However, be ready to accept un-showered subordinates, disheveled looks and crumpled T-shirts as the norm for morning meetings. Increased empathy & social support As bosses see team members in their home grounds (if without background screens), they get to know a bit more about them. Just as the world is extending additional social support to citizens, more and more CEOs will be warming up with increased empathy. They will bring in a culture of social support, partly driven by the conditions of homes of many employees in the metropolises. This would mean better choices in perks & packages, healthcare, flexible work hours, expanded leaves and so on. Employees will support each other like it used to be decades ago. Top CEOs will articulate the need for culture shift. The current finding that 75% of us don’t have a reliable friend at work will change. Work teams will be like communities and the performance will increase as they bond more. Those embracing the culture shift will see better results. The flipside of this could be increased workload, growing unemployment, and vicious debt cycles for some. Sleeker employer branding More employers will want to intensify the efforts to attract and retain talent that can straddle the old and the new normal in the short term. When the demand for the rare high-quality talent increases among employers, the frenzy to build better branding will peak. With technology and social media tools, there will be more customised and sleeker branding for segmented targeting. As employees, we will have to live up to the employer brand promise that gets displayed more creatively and innovatively across online channels. Advent of virtual reality Imagine your CEO addressing multiple groups simultaneously with hologram technology. His avatar can be with you in your work area across the desk if both of you have the same tech setup. This could evolve into a cheaper tech solution, and virtual reality (VR) might be the way forward. The gaming industry can provide some real solutions. With hi-tech headsets strapped onto our faces, we won’t even need a computer for our meetings. However, this proliferation of VR will happen only if the costs come drastically down. Only top companies will probably see reason to arrange for the equipment today. Imagine future meetings where you will be joining as your avatar via VR. The chances of VR technology evolving to become affordable with promised features are pretty high. Visualise this: Boardroom avatars with VR versions of attendees actually sitting together around a virtual board table. The chair really gets to sit at the head of the table, the CEO at her side, and so on. Your computer cams, instead of just broadcasting your image, will capture your movements and facial language and process them into your avatar. Large corporations might take up VR first for board meetings, given the cost savings every quarter when they cancel the face-to-face meetings. Life will revolve around home, not office There is no doubt our lives will be confined to homes for a while longer than imagined. So, start thinking of innovations around it. Just as mobile phones made us forget phone numbers and TV remotes made us couch potatoes, continued comforts from within the home for every need will make us reluctant to leave it. Work, play, love, pray, social bonding — all will be around home. Two years ago, most CEOs I spoke to were reluctant to use video as a way for training needs. But today, they all do that. Early this year, I saw an alumni body conducting a cultural festival over a video meet with participants for over 5 hours, and the audience was from around the world. Innovation will move to deliver better quality of video interaction and with possibilities for more entertainment and other engagements. Remote weddings and Family get-togethers will be more enjoyable and evolving with tech like 5G. Will all of our life revolve around video and VR is a moot question. Only time can answer.

The truck and bus major announced this in a stock market filing on Monday. The production impact is on account of the second wave lockdown. “In continuation to our communication dated May 3, 2021 wherein we had intimated about the closure of our plants in the month of May 2021 due to Covid-19, our plants are still not fully operational due to lock down that is ongoing in the states where our plants are located,” said the notification. “We expect the opening up announcements by the respective state governments in a phased manner, resulting in impact of our operations in the month of June 2021 also.”, Apart from the lockdown the demand situation is also not good enough to warrant full production the company said in its statement. “The demand scenario is still to pick up due to lock down,” said the notification. Both these factors have impacted production schedules.

Later in the evening, BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh tweeted: “In five weeks, @myogiadityanath's Uttar Pradesh reduced the new daily case count by 93% ... Remember it’s a state with 20+ Cr population . When municipality CMs could not manage a city of 1.5Cr population , Yogiji managed quite effectively.” Santhosh and Singh on Tuesday interacted individually with the UP ministers, in a development which was seen as party’s concerted bid to lend its feedback to the state government machinery to ramp effort to tackle the pandemic in the run-up to the high stake UP assembly elections due next year. Interacting with news persons, Singh said that the work of Yogi government in dealing with pandemic had been “unparalleled” and better than other states. The remarks came against the backdrop of persistent speculation about possibility of changes in the government and the organization and are, therefore, seen as significant. He also hailed the BJP state unit in putting up a good show in the recently concluded panchayat elections. “The BJP is always in poll mode. Unlike the opposition which starts preparing only when elections approach,” Radha Mohan told reporters after the meeting. A senior BJP leader said that Santhosh and Singh met all key ministers, including both the deputy CMs -- Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma --in the capacity of party leaders and suggested them measures which were needed to be taken for consolidating people’s support and counter an aggressive opposition, especially in the wake of the pandemic. Maurya said that it was an organisational meeting with a focus on the next assembly elections. “Our party aims to get 300-plus seats in the next assembly elections,” Maurya said. “Both the leaders stressed on ground level implementation of government schemes which could help the party firm up its foothold in the grass-roots and dispel the possible anti-incumbency,” said a senior cabinet minister. “It is a regular feedback exercise which the party leadership undertakes in states where assembly elections are due within a year,” he said. As a matter of fact, Santhosh has already camped in Uttarakhand which would also go to polls next year. Santhosh happens to be from the RSS which has its ear to the ground and plays a crucial role as ideological fountainhead of the BJP. “The inputs he gathered here are expected to be discussed at the party’s top level before further strategies are devised,” a senior BJP leader said. The visit of Santhosh comes more than four months after Nadda held a similar interaction with the party ranks and file.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/santhosh-radha-mohan-praise-yogi-govts-covid-measures/articleshow/83158141.cms||Pankaj Shah

President, Senior Resident Doctor Association, Andhra Pradesh, Dr Ravi Banoth, said senior residents, who are actively involved in Covid-19 and non-Covid medical care, are paid a monthly stipend of Rs 45,000. “The stipend hike is pending for the last two years. The senior residents in our neighbouring state Telangana are getting Rs 80,500, while the senior residents at central institutes like AIIMS are drawing more than one lakh. Prior notice was given to the hospital authorities in advance to prepare alternatives to continue ongoing patient care. We have postponed our fight for several months, just to avoid a duty boycott. Our motive is not to cause suffering to the common man,” said Dr Ravi. The senior residents are also demanding authorities abolish tax deduction at source (TDS) for them as there is no formal employee-employer relationship with the government. “According to the definition by Section 10 (16) of Income Tax Act, we cannot be considered as employees,” they claimed.

Seven missing cylinders are yet to be recovered. The recovery of the missing cylinders were made after the JLNMCH administration threatened to lodge an FIR with the Barari police and also constituted a three-member probe committee for making an internal investigation with the help of close circuit television (CCTV) camera footage and also one-to-one inquiry from paramedical staff, nurses and security guards. Medical superintendent at JLNMCH Dr Asim Kumar Das said: “We recovered 28 missing oxygen cylinders dumped at an isolated place on the JLNMCH premises. Remaining missing oxygen cylinders will also be recovered soon. We do not rule out the hands of some insiders and hence we have initiated an in-depth probe." The 35 portable oxygen cylinders were found missing last week from JLNMCH, a dedicated Covid-19 hospital of the region. A three-member probe committee comprising of Dr P B Mishra, Dr Arjun Singh and Dr Kumar Gaurav was formed on May 28 to investigate the issue. Apprehending the involvement of paramedical staff, nurses, security guards at the hospital gates as well as attendants of patients, the JLNMCH administration circulated a note of warning about lodging an FIR regarding the same. Dr Das said an FIR is yet to be lodged as an internal probe is on. “Appropriate legal action will be taken if someone from the staff members is found to be involved,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/missing-o2-cylinders-found-at-bpur-hosp/articleshow/83153664.cms||Kumar Rajesh

A migrant, he had returned to his native place in March after the hosiery factory he worked at was shut amid the Covid-induced lockdown. “I used to earn anywhere between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 per month in Jaipur. Since I did not get a suitable job in Bihar, I decided to leave,” Shubham told this reporter. The 26-year-old was part of a 15-member group of migrant workers waiting for the train at the Muzaffarpur Junction since morning. “Bihar mein kaam milta kahan hai? Paisa kamaane ke liye to bahar jana hi padega (Work is not available in Bihar. We have to go to other states to earn money,” claimed Pappu Kumar Yadav, another migrant worker. Santosh Kumar, a resident of Ambara village in Muzaffarpur district, also narrated his woes. The 32-year-old, who used to work as a painter in Ludhiana, said, “After I lost my father, I had to ask for money from others to perform his last rites. Now, I need a job to repay the loan.” The Muzaffarpur Junction has been witnessing a huge rush of passengers during the last few days. The chief public relations officer of the East Central Railway, Rajesh Kumar, admitted that the waiting list in long-distance trains was getting longer. The sudden rush at the Patna Junction and the Danapur station in the state capital is also a testimony to the fact that migrant workers are leaving for different states in search of jobs. Majority of them are in the age group of 20 to 40 years. Meanwhile, labour resources minister Jibesh Kumar claimed that the rural works and other departments had been directed to create more and more job opportunities for the migrant workers in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jobs-in-other-states-beckon-migrant-workers/articleshow/83153608.cms||Ramashankar

In another positive sign, more beds, including oxygen, ICU and ventilator, in government and private hospitals are now available across the state. From the second week of April to the third week of May, the non-availability of beds, especially oxygen and ventilator beds, saw patients line up outside government and private hospitals. A situation of panic prevailed in this time while cases surged across the state. But with fresh infections on the decline, “most of the Covid-19 patients are now preferring home isolation. Because of these conditions and also the gradual decrease in positive cases, the availability of beds in various hospitals has increased,” Visakhapatnam district collector V Vinay Chand said. The state government has extended services through 576 special Covid-19 hospitals, at which 6,147 ICU beds, 23,199 oxygen beds, 16,757 general beds and 2,320 ventilators have been arranged. Of this, a majority of the oxygen beds are available in districts such as Chittoor (780), Guntur (1,140), Krishna (540), Nellore (568), Srikakulam (645) and Visakhapatnam (1,082). ICU beds are also available in Chittoor (108), Guntur (383), Krishna (101), Visakhapatnam (146) and Kurnool (105).

But in two days, his oxygen levels recovered to about 50%. While he was still critical, the slight improvement gave the doctors a chance to apply proning. Raipur block chief medical health officer Dr Bhawani Singh said, “A slight recovery helped us to put him in the prone position to improve breathing and for better oxygenation in the lungs. In another two days’ time, his oxygen levels improved to 62% and then gradually rose to 85 to 90% over the course of four days.” Talking to TOI over phone from Raipur, Pathan said earlier he had no idea about its benefits. “It’s very helpful and might have played a key role in my recovery from critical condition. I still continue to practice it at home.” As large numbers of Covid patients having lower oxygen levels are flooding the hospitals, district administrations have been prodding the medical personnel to use the technique more and more. “Proning require very little equipment. It’s a simple technique, but the benefits are huge. In every video conferencing with the doctors I encourage them to use the therapy. We have trained our medical personnel on this. Videos of prone position therapy made by the government have been given to them,” said Bhilwara district collector Shiv Prasad M Nakate. The Lancet magazine, several studies, medical experts and the government have found that prone position or lying down on stomach significantly improves breathing. The state government has not only included it in the treatment protocol of Covid-19 patients, but also has been encouraging doctors and hospitals through various promotions to increase its practice. Siddharth Mahajan, secretary, medical health and family welfare, said, “All districts like Bhilwara, Jodhpur, Rajsamand etc have trained the medical personnel to treat Covid-19 patients with prone position therapy. Also, hospitals are increasingly using spirometer to improve breathing power of the patients.” According to medical experts, when a patient is laid on the stomach, the position increases the distribution and volume of air in the lungs. Mahajan said the technique is scientifically proven and people with even mild infection should do it to maintain healthy levels of ventilation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-hosps-using-prone-therapy-to-improve-o2-levels/articleshow/83156398.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The bonds, which carry an AA rating, offer a coupon of 8.01% payable quarterly. KIAFL is part of the KKR Group and specialises in providing secured lending to real estate projects in India. The company focuses on under-development and near-complete real estate projects, primarily in the residential space. It also evaluates early stage development projects where key consideration includes partner quality and project location. The focus is mainly on mid-market residential projects. KIAF (KKR India Asset Finance) is an NBFC focused on providing loans to real estate developers in India. According to rating agency Crisil, KIAFL is KKR’s real estate credit vehicle in India and is aligned with the parent’s global strategies for scaling up the realty business globally and in Asia. “While KKR holds only 9.7% in KIAFL, it has complete management and board control over the latter. Importantly, KKR’s equity contribution of $23.2 million (Rs 165.9 crore) in KIAFL has been infused directly from KKR’s balance sheet, and not from funds managed by it. The remaining equity stake is held by leading global limited partners (LPs, or partner investors in KKR’s funds), and an Indian high net worth individual, who have collectively infused equity worth $221.9 million (around Rs 1,584.6 crore) in KIAFL,” Crisil said. According to Crisil, the shared brand implies a strong moral obligation on KKR to support KIAFL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lic-invests-rs-225cr-in-kkr-firm/articleshow/83156089.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Vijayawada||Eight cops fall prey to virus, 470 infected in second wave in Vijayawada||VIJAYAWADA: Around 470 cops working under Vijayawada commissionerate limits have contracted Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic. Speaking to TOI, city police commissioner Bathini Sreenivasulu said that 97% of the police force under his jurisdiction has been vaccinated for at least the first dose and exceptions have been made only for staff who are pregnant and those who are on medication for other ailments. During the second wave, eight police personnel have died within the commissionerate, as compared to six during the first wave. Senior officials said that personnel who are above the age of 55 have been kept away from field duties except for extenuating circumstances. Police explained that some of the reasons behind the increasing cases among the police personnel is the direct exposure to Covid-19 patients during vehicle checks. “We have seen many of our personnel affected by Covid-19. We are ensuring that the best treatment is being provided to them. The important appeal here is for the public to continue their cooperation and ensure that they stick to the curfew,” Sreenivasulu said. Another major reason behind the surge in Covid-19 cases among cops is infection through family members. Across Andhra Pradesh, 70 personnel have died of the disease during the second wave while around 5,400 personnel have tested positive for the virus, accounting for 8.6% of the total workforce. Till date, 180 personnel have succumbed to the disease in the first and second waves. Of the areas where Covid-19 cases are prevalent among cops is the Rayalaseema region, which can be attributed to the Tirupati Lok Sabha bypoll that took place in the first week of April.  There are around 2,300 active cases among police personnel across the state. On the bright side, cops say the recovery rate among the force continues to stay strong and the number of personnel requiring hospitalisation is less than 20%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/8-cops-fall-prey-to-virus-470-infected-in-second-wave-in-vij/articleshow/83152919.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

But Covid-19 second wave has affected the fortunes of mango jelly makers. With many villagers down with Covid-19, there is a shortage of manpower, affecting the production of mango jelly products. Many are struggling to make ends meet in Bheemali, Alamanda and a few other villages that fall under L Kota mandal. Like Banginapalli mangoes of Vizianagaram, Bheemali’s mango jelly was very popular for its traditional sweet taste and aroma. As the jellymakers do not use any artificial flavours, Bheemali’s mango jelly gained popularity. More than 4,000 people of Bheemali, Alamanda, L Kota, Bhimasingi and other villages in Vizianagaram district are engaged in preparing mango jelly from April to June. But this year, the makers of mango jelly are yet to see sweet returns on the famed product. As the pandemic hits rural areas after affecting Vizianagaram city in April and May, the production of jelly has come down drastically as many workers tested positive for the virus. Further, arranging mangoes has proved a tough task. G Ramunaidu, a jelly maker in Bheemali, said they used to make at least 350 to 400 tonnes of mango jelly in summer. Now, production has fallen to just 100 tonnes. “We used to send jelly to Telangana, Odisha and Karnataka. This year the demand is less due to curfew in many parts. We have lost business for two consecutive years as the virus was at its peak in the summer,” he said. Mango jelly makers normally buy high quality fruit such as Collector, Kolam Gova and Thotapuri varieties from parts of Krishna and East Godavari districts. Preparation involves glueing the pulp mixed with sugar on mats till the jelly reaches a three-inch thickness and is then dried for at least four weeks. “From the second week of April, we have faced labour shortage due to Covid-19. This has affected production,” said P Krishna, another jelly maker. “We have been making mango jelly for decades but it is difficult to continue the trade as we are incurring losses with increase in input costs,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/hit-by-two-years-of-covid-mango-jelly-makers-in-bheemali-struggle-for-survival/articleshow/83153242.cms||Nalla.Babu

Of the 15 kids who voluntarily turned up for the vaccine trial, three became the first to be administered the initial shots after a thorough medical examination. All the volunteers had gone through the screening process, such as RT-PCR, antibody test and general check-up prior to receiving their shots. AIIMS-P superintendent Dr C M Singh, who is also the principal investigator of the trial, said have they set the target to involve at least 100 kids in the age group of two to 18 years in the vaccine trial. “So far, 108 kids have registered for trial and they will get the vaccine only after the screening process. After being administered 0.5ml dose of intramuscular injection, the children were monitored for two hours,” he said. Dr Singh said none of the kids showed any side effect after taking the jab. “The hospital has given a diary to the parents of the three kids and asked them to monitor their health. In case of noticing any complication, they have been asked to contact the AIIMS-P doctors,” Dr Singh added. The three kids will be given the second dose after an interval of 28 days. Once their schedule is complete, the volunteers will be examined thoroughly for any aftereffects of the vaccine. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal incharge for Covid at AIIMS- P, said the three kids who received their first shot on Tuesday are in the age group of 12 to 18 years and residents of Patna. “The hospital will do the follow-ups on kids on days 28, 42, 104 and 194 to check the immunogenicity (amount of antibody produced in a healthy body to fight against the SARS CoV-2 virus). The next and final phase of the trial will begin once we get approval from Indian Council of Medical Research,” Dr Sanjeev added. AIIMS-P has divided the children into three groups for trial based on their age.

It will also provide employment opportunities to many people,” Nitish said while reviewing the works of the RWD through videoconferencing from ‘Sankalp’ hall of his residence. The CM asked the RWD engineers to keep continuous vigil on the roads which had already been awarded to contractors on the terms of five-year maintenance guarantee. He said the department’s senior officers and engineers should inspect such roads on a regular basis so that there would not be any negligence in maintenance of the roads by the contractors concerned. RWD minister Jayant Raj, department’s secretary Pankaj Kumar Pal, other senior officers and engineers were connected to the meeting through videoconferencing. Nitish said the prestige of the RWD engineers would increase manifold in the society if they execute the road maintenance works in a committed way. “We all will be happy and would have a sense of self-satisfaction if the roads in rural areas are properly maintained,” he said. He asked the RWD officials and engineers to complete as early as possible all the remaining works under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the Mukhya Mantri Gram Sampark Yojana and the Grameen Tola Sampark Nischay Yojana. The CM also asked the engineers to repair the approach roads of all the new bridges which were built under the Mukhya Mantri Setu Nirman Yojana. He also called for regular inspection, monitoring and maintenance of the old roads built under the MMSNY. Giving emphasis on maintenance of quality in the construction of roads, the CM asked the RWD engineers to work in a planned manner for development and widening of the rural roads. Earlier, Pal made a detailed presentation on the current status of maintenance work of the rural roads and works done under different schemes of the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/let-engineers-maintain-rural-roads-cm/articleshow/83153431.cms||Madan Kumar

Many patients who have recovered from Covid-19 are again falling sick with various complications and treatment is becoming more expensive. Many of the recovered patients are suddenly getting infected with black fungus and there are also instances of cardiac failure. “My father got treatment for Covid-19 at GGH and recovered. He was discharged and we started taking care of him at home. Suddenly he felt sick and died of cardiac arrest. Government should have focused on post-Covid care, “ said Bhargavi Dasari, a BTech student. Meanwhile, treatments for post-Covid complications have become very costly. “I recovered from Covid-19 a month ago. But weakness and improper heartbeat have become major concerns. I got admitted to a private hospital and spent around Rs 2 lakh for treatment,” said K Ramana, a mason worker. Left parties have alleged that the government has failed to provide proper medical care to patients who have recovered from Covid-19. “Government functionaries have limited the treatment for Covid-19 patients. But they are ignoring patients who are in home isolation. Many patients died due to post-Covid complications. Government never enquired about the health of patients who were discharged from hospitals. This is having severe impact on patients from lower middle-class and poor families,” said CPI(M) state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao. “Post-Covid clinics are the need of the hour and the government should set these up at multiple locations. The government should also include post-Covid complications under YSR Aarogyasri and provide cashless treatment,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-urged-to-set-up-post-covid-clinics/articleshow/83153126.cms||Venu Lanka

Against this figure, the number of mucormycosis patients was 385 — or 38% more! It’s a role reversal for the two diseases in a matter of 20 days. In the second week of May, the hospital had its 1,200-bed Covid facility almost full; one ward with 22 beds was earmarked for the fungal infection seen in Covid-recovered patients. Dr J P Modi, the medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that 12 wards have been closed down at the 1,200-bed hospital with a gradual decrease in Covid patients. At Manjushree Mill compound facility, only 11 patients who are on ventilators, BiPAP machines, or other forms of assistive breathing remain. Once those patients recover, the hospital is likely to be handed over to IKDRC, said sources. “On the other hand, in the past two months, 852 patients were treated for mucormycosis of whom 456 were operated upon,” said Dr Modi. “The daily cases are, however, going down. On Monday, seven new patients were admitted. The number was 18 to 20 last week.” Dr Modi added: “On Monday, 26 surgeries were performed, or more than one surgery per hour.” Among the Covid patients, majority need critical care. In all, 121 were on assistive breathing (with support from such devices as ventilators and BiPAP). And 131 had high oxygen dependency, said sources at Civil Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/at-civil-mm-patients-outnumber-those-with-corona/articleshow/83156390.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Business||Insider trade: Sebi charges two Infosys executives||MUMBAI/BENGALURU: Markets regulator Sebi has banned from the stock market two senior executives at software services major Infosys, for allegedly helping six entities trade with insider information. Sebi has also banned those six outside entities and asked all the entities to together disgorge nearly Rs 3.1-crore illegal trading profits. Sebi said that although the outside entities had traded in several stocks through the year, their trading activities were concentrated in Infosys only during the weeks adjacent/close to when the company announced its financial results. This was observed for the quarters ended December 2019, March 2020, June 2020 and September 2020, the order by the Sebi’s whole-time member Madhabi Puri Buch noted. The bank accounts of all the six outside entities have been impounded. A spokesperson for Infosys said that the company was cooperating with Sebi in its investigation in this case and has also started an internal probe. In the 55-page order, Sebi noted that in July 2020 the regulator’s internal surveillance system gave an alert about possible insider trading in the company’s stocks, following which it started an investigation. It found out that Pranshu Bhutra, senior corporate counsel, and Venkata Subramaniam V V, senior principal (corporate accounting group), had insider information about the company’s financial results and were also in regular communication with each other. Sebi’s probe further showed that Pranshu was in constant contact with Amit Bhutra, an outsider who in turn was in touch with Bharath C Jain. The two were partners at investment firm Capital One Partners. It was also found that Amit, Ankush Bhutra and Manish Champalal Jain were working partners of Tesora Capital. Sebi investigations revealed that Pranshu of Infosys, who had inside information, had transferred funds to Amit. It also found that both Capital One Partners and Tesora Capital liquidated their positions in Infosys soon after the results. Those trading activities brought in a combined gain of Rs 3.1 crore. The probe did not find Subramaniam to be directly in touch with any of the six outside entities. However, he was found to be in possession of insider information and in touch with Pranshu in his professional capacity, and hence has been charged by the regulator. When contacted by TOI, a spokesperson for Infosys said that on June 1, the company was informed of an interim ex parte Sebi order in which “two of its employees, amongst other third parties, have been named in an ongoing insider trading investigation”. “Infosys has a well-defined Code of Conduct covering all its employees and an Insider Trading Policy that governs dealing with unpublished price sensitive information.” Infosys also said it will extend full cooperation to the regulator in this matter. “Additionally, as a result of the order, an internal investigation is being initiated and appropriate action will be taken on the conclusion of such investigation,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insider-trade-sebi-charges-infy-execs/articleshow/83156914.cms||Partha Sinha

Shops selling essential commodities are allowed to open on all days and those dealing with other items thrice a week from 6am to 2pm. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh had issued an order on Monday, putting shops in three categories and allowing them to open on alternate days, except those dealing with essential commodities. The decision has come as a relief to small businesses and traders as the state has been under complete lockdown since May 5 owing to massive surge in Covid cases. Business owners and retailers in the city have welcomed the relaxations. Trade and commerce bodies have also put forth their suggestions with regard to the new regulations. Ram Lal Khaitan, president of Bihar Industries Association (BIA), said, “Manufactured products can now go directly to the market, which is a positive step. However, the traders should follow Covid norms.. The government should also set up vaccination camps at industrial units, especially in the rural areas." Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) has demanded reopening of construction company offices with 25% staff occupancy and few days of relaxation in repayment of bank loans and GST payments for infrastructure companies. N K Thakur, vice-president of BCCI, said, “Each department should be authorised to generate e-passes for the employees concerned. When contractors request for extension of deadlines due to lockdown, we refuse to do so telling them that construction works have already been exempted from restrictions. However, the fact is that offices are closed movement of employees is restricted.” Shops dealing in electrical and electronic goods, salons, parlour, automobile workshop and service centres will be the first to open on Wednesday. Ajay Kumar, wholesaler of computer peripherals at Hari Niwas Complex, said, “This is a beginning and I welcome the government’s step to allow shops to open in a phased manner. Lockdown was a good step and it has yielded visible results. At the end, it’s up to us to take precautions if we want to win the battle against Covid.” Rajesh Kumar, owner of a unisex salon at Kankarbagh, said, “Lockdowns have vastly affected our businesses. I welcome the relaxations, but the government should have allowed us to remain open on weekends.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/shops-to-reopen-with-curbs-today/articleshow/83153449.cms||---
---||Chennai||Safety policies in schools and state need a review||By R S RaveendhrenThe recent complaint of sexual harassment against a teacher of Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan School, KK Nagar in Chennai has opened a can of worms as many others are coming forward with their accounts of harassment in their institutions. The situation has raised several questions about the attitude of the schools in handling this issue and of the government for neglecting its responsibility of enforcing statutory obligations to prevent sexual harassment.A 2007 study by the Union ministry of women and child development on the issue of child abuse states that nearly 53% of children aged between 5 and 18 years regularly face some form of sexual abuse. India’s first major legislation to curb sexual harassment of children came late, in the year 2012, in the form of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. This is also in consonance with the duty cast upon the state under Article 34 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child that requires protecting children against all forms of sexual abuse.Under Section 44 of the Pocso Act, the power to monitor its implementation has been conferred on the state commission for protection of child rights that is constituted under Section 17 of the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005. In Tamil Nadu, the state commission was constituted in 2012 and started to function only from 2013. What is more baffling than the state’s laidback attitude, is that the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Right Rules, 2012 appears to be drafted in a casual manner, not once referring to the obligations that are cast on it by the Pocso Act, 2012.A study conducted by a research scholar attached with the Centre for Development Studies in Kerala reveals that the reason for a victim not lodging an official complaint is that 56.1% of the students from his sample demographics feared character assassination. Another 36.8% feared backlash from their institution and 33.3% of them said there was an absence of any committee or a dropbox to be able to lodge their complaint.As per the R K Raghavan committee report in 2007, every government and private school is supposed to institute a committee for the prevention of sexual harassment. An additional requirement is to set up a complaint box, but institutions have not taken this recommendation seriously.The recent proposal by stakeholders to lay down guidelines to address issues of online learning must begin with an overhaul of the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Right Rules and framing of separate comprehensive guidelines to encourage school children to lodge a complaint without hesitation or fear.Schools also need to set up mentoring cells to educate students and teachers/staff about sexual harassment, the difference between friendly-teasing and bullying, flirting and harassment. They should set up an online complaint platform on the same lines of sexual harassment electronic-box (SHebox), an online complaint platform for all women workers launched by the Union ministry of women and child development. Safety commissioners need to be appointed to inspect institutions to verify compliance of rules and review the complaints received at the school. Students should be equipped to deal with harassment instead of ignoring it or holding it back.It is the responsibility of the school that every student is afforded a safe environment within its precincts. Sexual harassment must never be taught to be tolerated, young people need to be taught how to confront and stop it.(The writer is a Madras high court advocate)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/safety-policies-in-schools-and-state-need-a-review/articleshow/83159714.cms||---

Justice Biren Vaishnav has sought reply by June 15 and ordered the case to be heard with the suo motu PIL on the surge of Covid-19 cases. Petitioners Maitree Muzumdar and Khush Vachhrajani made various suggestions and sought HC directions to the government for proper and timely treatment, and to make the process of distribution of medicines more transparent — an issue which the high court flagged in its order on Wednesday in the suo motu PIL on Covid-19. The petitioners have submitted that the treatment for mucormycosis is very costly and demanded a scheme to treat the poor in private hospitals under the Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY scheme. The PIL also sought transparency in the process of treatment and distribution of medicines with proper updation of details on public domain. Besides appointment of nodal officers to smoothen the process for poor patients and capping the price of injections, CT scan and other requirement in private hospitals have been requested for. The petitioners have sought directions to the authorities for the correct number of cases and public availability of information of mucormycosis cases, recoveries and deaths in the entire state from government and public hospitals both in rural and urban areas as mandated under the Epidemic Diseases Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-to-govt-over-pil-for-black-fungus-treatment/articleshow/83156435.cms||---

The state thus achieved the daily target of at least 3.4 lakh jabs necessary to meet the goal of 1 crore vaccinations in June. Launching the campaign at KD Singh Babu Stadium, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stressed on the importance of vaccine besides emphasising on Covid-appropriate behaviour. “People must shun apprehensions and get vaccinated against Covid-19 as it is the only tool that can save people from complications. Considering that vaccination is the only protective shield against Covid-19, the state is providing it free of cost to the people,” the CM said. Yogi urged people to make Covid-appropriate behaviour their best friend as it saves from a host of other diseases, besides Covid-19. Officials said the overwhelming response of the public is due to the repeated appeals made by CM Yogi Adityanath and added that over 1.86 crore doses have been administered in the state so far. At least 1.5 crore people have taken the first dose while 35 lakh have been fully vaccinated. Officials said people started thronging the centres since early morning but maximum vaccinations took place between 12 noon and 2 pm. While the enthusiasm was taken positively, teams carrying out vaccination said crowd management should be streamlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3-4-lakh-people-take-jabs-on-day-1-of-mission-june-in-up/articleshow/83158159.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan ranks 29th in rural piped water scheme out of 33 states||JAIPUR: Rajasthan ranks a lowly 29th among 33 states and Union Territories in tap water connections in rural areas under the Centre’s flagship Jal Jeevan Mission – Har Ghar Jal scheme as of May 31. The country’s most water distressed state has added just 8.11 lakh tap water connections against 4.22 crore connections under the scheme since August 2019. For every 100 tap connections in villages, 0.6 were achieved in the state. Ideally, the figure has to be 5%. Since the beginning, the scheme has been embroiled in Centre-state trouble. Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat blamed the Gehlot government’s lack of cooperation for the poor show. Shekhawat on Tuesday tweeted, “Rajasthan definitely deserves better. What Gehlot sarkar has done to the state is unpardonable - from the slow pace of #JalJeevanMission to criminal wastage of vaccine.” On the other hand, the state is blaming the Centre for not increasing its share for being a desert state from 50% to 90%, which was a norm during the UPA governments. The Centre has been adamant about not moving an inch from its share while it has given relaxation to only hilly states. PHED minister BD Kalla had on March 21 with Shekhawat urged the Centre to increase its share up to 90% for putting the scheme on fast pace. A senior PHED official said, “Unless 90% funding is done, the state would not able to achieve its target of 100% taps in over 1.19 crore households. During the UPA regime, the state was getting up to 90% funding for water projects. The NDA government has changed the rules.” A senior officer with the public health engineering and groundwater department said they were working to fulfill the target of providing 30 tap connections in its action plan 2021-22. The Centre has allocated Rs 2,522 crore to the state under the scheme in 2020-21 while it is expected to give Rs 5, 500 crore under the head. Reacting to the slow pace of work, Shekhawat said since major part of Rajasthan is drought-prone and desert, priority should be given to drinking water. “Unfortunately, the state government is not giving priority to the water supply work to ensure tap water in rural homes. After the launch of the Jal Jeevan Mission, the state government changed four principal secretaries in a year. Water is a state subject and the central government is providing such huge funds, which they are not utilising,” said Shekhawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-ranks-29th-in-rural-piped-water-scheme-out-of-33-states/articleshow/83156406.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Kolhapur||Soybean seed prices double ahead of sowing||Kolhapur: The prices of soybean seeds have almost doubled this kharif season, mainly due to rise in the demand and stocking by companies for producing cooking oil. Last year, private companies were selling 1kg of soybean seeds at around Rs 60 to Rs 65. The rates have jumped to Rs 125 to Rs 135 now. Mahabeej, the government seed-making undertaking, has however kept price around Rs 80 per kg. Over 1.45 lakh hectares of soybean crop is harvested every year in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts. Due to rise in the prices of soya oil in domestic as well as international markets, the farmers are leaning towards soybean crop this time. However the actual rise in the cultivation will be judged only after the sowing is completed. Right now, the farmers are preparing the land and expecting the pre-moonsoon showers arrive in a day or two to start the sowing. Kolhapur district agriculture superintendent Dyandeo Wakure said, “The market price of soybean has reached a high. The farmers have benefited from the rising prices of the oil extracted from the soybean seeds. Anticipating the likely rise in seed prices, we ran a campaign of making farmers to prepare their own seeds out of the crop harvested last year. Most of the seeds developed by farmers are of good quality. They are tending towards buying seeds from other farmers and less relying on the seeds prepared by private companies. Therefore, the rise in the seed prices will not affect most of the farmers.” The agriculture department has appointed rapid action teams to check the quality of the seeds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/soybean-seed-prices-double-ahead-of-sowing/articleshow/83158833.cms||---

In order to strengthen the party across the state, NTK has asked its functionaries to enroll at least 500 members per assembly segment.In a statement, NTK said the party’s chief coordinator Seeman’s clarion call for the spirits of Tamil nationalism has evoked strong response from the people of Tamil Nadu. The party, despite fighting against odds like strong political alliances and money power, garnered over 30 lakh votes in the recent assembly election in Tamil Nadu.But the increasing impact of Covid’s second wave has prevented the party from further reaching out to the people and engaging them with NTK’s ideals and policies. The assembly election has proved that the party has found support even in villages, where it does not have an organizational base.Hence, the party has asked its IT Wing to undertake a month-long membership enrolment drive and enrol at least one lakh new members to the party. The new members who are enrolled should work towards expanding the reach of the party throughout the state, a statement from NTK said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ntk-to-enrol-one-lakh-members-in-one-month/articleshow/83159754.cms||---

Traders commenced their mobile sales on Tuesday. A corporation official said, “The state government has issued an order stating that the grocery items could be sold through vehicles or pushcarts at doorsteps from 7am to 6pm after obtaining permission from local bodies. Grocery shops are also allowed to accept orders via online or telephone and deliver it at the customers’ houses. Based on the order, the corporation had granted permission to the traders to sell grocery through vehicles following Covid-19 guidelines.” For over a week since complete lockdown was imposed, vegetables and fruits were sold through pushcarts by the corporation along with horticulture department in corporation-owned vehicles and independent private traders. Welcoming the move to continue the mobile sale, G Irudhayaraja, district president of Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu said people were in need of grocery items as many of them would have exhausted their stock by now. “Earlier, the corporation had permitted only 53 shops to deliver groceries at doorsteps after receving orders through calls. Now, they have asked us to reopen the wholesale grocery shops after obtaining permission from the corporation. Other traders can now purchase the items from here and sell it in residential areas or deliver them,” he said. Explaining that 42 wholesale shops have acquired permission from the corporation and been functioning since Monday, he said they have decided to get permission for 50 more shops and function on a rotational basis. Meanwhile, the corporation on Tuesday permitted poultry stall owners to door deliver chicken and eggs after receiving orders through calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-allows-mobile-delivery-of-grocery/articleshow/83156456.cms||Nivedha Selvam

The dole distribution is likely to commence on June 5.An official said, “Ration shop workers will distribute the tokens that are imprinted with dates to the beneficiaries for the second and final instalment of Rs 2,000. To receive the dole and the kit, beneficiaries have to visit the ration shops on the date allocated to them. We have decided to distribute the dole to at least 200 beneficiaries from each shop a day.”Pointing out that there were 1,419 ration shops in the district with each having anywhere between 350 and 1,000 rice cardholders, he said the distribution could be completed within four to five days. “As on Tuesday, about 98% of the beneficiaries have collected the first instalment of Rs 2,000 in the district. People who have not collected the same, could collect it together with their second instalment.” G Rajendran, state president, Tamil Nadu Ration Shop Employees’ Union, however, questioned the move to distribute the tokens at the of beneficiaries’ doorsteps. “At a time when many ration shop workers are down with Covid, how safe is it for them to visit the houses of beneficiaries? The government should instead message the date and time to collect the dole and kit to the mobile number of beneficiaries. Another option is to close all the ration shops during the lockdown and distribute the aid after the lockdown.” The ration kit comprises 14 grocery items – 1kg wheat flour, 1kg iodized salt, 1kg rava, 500g sugar, 500g urad dal, 250g tamarind, 250g Bengal gram, 200g tea powder, 100g mustard seed, 100g cumin seed, 100g turmeric powder, 100g chili powder, 1 bathing soap and 1 washing soap. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tokens-for-covid-19-dole-to-be-distributed-at-beneficiaries-doorstep/articleshow/83156421.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In Dungarpur, Udaipur, Rajsamand and Sikar, the positivity rate has been more than 10%. The highest number of positivity rate was reported in Dungarpur at 22% followed by Udaipur at 14.7%. As against 77 tests held on Tuesday, 17 had turned out to be positive in Dungarpur. Sikar and Rajsamand reported 12% and 11.7%, respectively. The positivity rate is calculated based on number of tests conducted on a given day with the number of positive cases in the same day in a district. But it must be noted that the number of tests in the state have also been drastically reduced. Only 20,040 samples were collected on Tuesday. According to the guidelines of modified lockdown, relaxation for various activities can be given only where the positivity rate is less than 10 per cent or the use of oxygen, ICU and ventilator bed will be less than 60 per cent. The state government had allowed 25% attendance in government and private offices from Wednesday as part of a limited relaxation in lockdown. Traffic within the district in the state (intra-district) will be allowed only from 5am to 12 noon from Tuesday to Friday and after June 8, all traffic in the state will be allowed from Tuesday to Friday from 5am to 12 noon. Shops or commercial establishments located in markets where there are only large complexes, but not air-conditioned, will be opened as per the building floor. For example, on Tuesday and Thursday, shops in the basement and first floor and on Wednesday and Friday, shops located on the ground floor and second floor, can be opened alternately. According to the situation of the markets, joint enforcement teams in consultation with the Public Discipline Committee of traders will monitor the crowd daily after opening the markets. The Public Discipline Committee will be responsible for adoption of Covid protocol. If there is widespread violation of the protocol, then the said market will be completely closed for seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/most-districts-eligible-for-modified-lockdown/articleshow/83156445.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC, govt end global tenders, little hope of vaccine despite bidders||MUMBAI: The deadline for the BMC’s global Expression of Interest (EOI) to supply 1 crore vaccine doses ended on Tuesday after no more extensions were given. The civic body is now scrutinising proposals from nine bidders. Seven of them have offered the Russian-made Sputnik V, one has offered to sell Sputnik Light, and one bidder has said the company will supply any approved vaccine that becomes available. Times ViewThe BMC’s desperate attempt to procure vaccines seems to be going nowhere. The credentials of the firms which have bid for the BMC’s tender are so far unknown and there is a question mark if any of them officially represents the vaccine manufacturers. The BMC is now faced with the tough task of verifying and authenticating the offers of the nine bidders, since many of them are foreign entities. It must ensure that the bidders are authentic and will supply genuine vaccines.The Maharashtra government, which too had floated global bids seeking 5 crore doses, has decided not to pursue it after receiving 8 bids, but all from intermediaries. “We will not pursue this as none of the manufacturers has shown interest,” said an official. The state had written to the Centre, seeking clarification on whether to engage with these bidders. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the Centre should come out with a national policy on vaccine import as none of the states that floated tenders has received any favourable response. The government had received bids from companies claiming to have tie-ups with the manufacturers of the Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik and AstraZeneca vaccines. But some of the manufacturers denied it or refused to back the bids. Senior civic officials said a detailed scrutiny is underway and will take around 2-3 days. Two extensions had been granted and the BMC had received 10 bids. One bidder who had offered to supply the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines backed out (see box). With the Russian Development Investment Fund (RDIF) and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories clarifying that they have not entered into partnership with any firm to supply Sputnik V or Sputnik Light vaccines in India, the BMC said if it isn’t able to establish any direct connection between the suppliers and manufacturers, they would stop processing the offers. In a joint statement last week, the RDIF and Dr Reddy’s had said Dr Reddy’s has sole distribution rights for the first 250 million doses of the Sputnik vaccine in India. Three companies have offered the Russian-made Sputnik at around $18-20 per vaccine, which is around Rs 1,500 for both the doses. But the prime concern is if the firms can supply the vaccines in three weeks as stated in the EOI. Shiv Sena MP Rahul Shewale also urged the Centre to issue draft rules for all states to float vaccine tenders. Since the Centre has not given clearances to vaccine makers like Pfizer and Moderna, they did not take part in the EOI, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-govt-end-global-tenders-little-hope-of-vaccine-despite-bidders/articleshow/83156462.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh’s Covid death rate lower than US & Europe, says CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Emphasising that UP government had managed to not just bring the second Covid wave under control but had shown the best results in Covid management since 2020, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state’s coronavirus death rate was 47 per million, as opposed to countries like the US and European nations which, despite their better medical infrastructure, had a death rate of 1,800 and 2,100 per million, respectively. Speaking at the launch of a book on Covid-19 by the UP State Legal Services Authority on Tuesday, Yogi said the higher death rate in other states and countries was a result of carelessness whereas his government had focussed on planning, testing and early treatment. As compared to India, health infrastructure in the United States and Europe is much better. However, these countries have been in the grip of the pandemic and their death rate has been much higher. The US has a population of 33 crore but more than 6 lakh deaths. With a population of 135 crore, India has 3.25 lakh deaths. Even one death is sad and attempts to save lives should take place at every level, but even with a weaker health infrastructure India performed much better than other countries,” he said. The CM said that in both waves concern was expressed about UP’s performance and both times he has proved sceptics wrong. Saying that he did not know there would be a lockdown in the first phase and that it would stretch to two months finally, the CM said that the government had already started containing cases. “On March 22, 2020, when the lockdown was announced, I got a call from the President and Vice President of the country who said they were worried about UP. I told them that I would do everything in my power to ensure things did not go out of hand. UP was the most successful state in the country in containing the first wave,” he said. The second wave, Yogi added, was different in some ways. If treatment was not started within the first two days, the patients were heading to a critical condition and there were also several post-Covid complications, he said. The CM said the government had set up an advisory committee of 14 health experts who have been guiding the government’s policies. He also hailed the system of monitoring committees for having kept the spread of Covid-19 under control in rural areas. Focussing on the need to educate people about the pandemic, the CM Yogi said that there were several cases when people did not have correct information, especially in villages; they visualised Covid as a ‘Goddess’ and started praying to it. “These are their sentiments but it also means that they do not have correct information about the pandemic. Prevention is better than cure in this disease but if despite all efforts someone falls ill, they should get timely treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-covid-death-rate-lower-than-us-europe-says-cm/articleshow/83158165.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The plot which housed BIT (Bombay Improvement Trust) chawls was taken up for redevelopment nearly five years ago. “We were to get new homes in eight years but so far our homes have been demolished and we are out without rent for two years,” said Savio D’Souza, a resident. The 682 residents have been promised 405 sq feet carpet area residences. Times ViewThis is another tragic case of perils of redevelopment in Mumbai. Lack of accountability and developer unable to stick to timeline has led to a major humanitarian crisis for thousands of stranded families. Errant builders get away as government has not cracked down on them. BIT chawl residents accused BMC of being hand-in-glove with the builder. Unless penalties are imposed and such builders prosecuted, tenants will continue to get shortchanged.Two years ago the developer, Valencia and Mishal Ventures Pvt Ltd, stopped paying rent to the residents. “We paid the tenants advance rent when the letter of intent was issued by BMC. In all we have paid Rs 90 crore in rent. The society committee needs to sign a tripartite agreement but committee members are making unreasonable demands,” said Shoaib Atik, the proprietor. The matter is now before Bombay high court. In the petition, tenants accused BMC of being in cohorts with the developer forcing them to accept the transit accommodation. Atik said the development agreement requires alternate accommodation to be provided and they have made it available in Kandivli. Chetan Gosia, chief promoter for Chandan Arc society, said they never agreed to alternate accommodation. “We were to be paid rent of Rs32,000 per month which the developer initially provided,” he said. “For the tripartite agreement to be signed the developer needs to provide the committee with the registered individual agreements, receipts of stamp duty paid, Rs 4.2 lakh paid to the registrar’s office and architect’s letter,” said Gosia. Sanjeev Jaiswal, additional municipal commissioner, said the civic body would soon call a meeting of tenants along with local representatives to decide if the residents want to continue with the developer or want BMC to appoint another one. TIMES VIEW: This is another tragic case of perils of redevelopment in Mumbai. Lack of accountability and developer unable to stick to timeline has led to a major humanitarian crisis for thousands of stranded families. Errant builders get away as government has not cracked down on them. BIT chawl residents accused BMC of being hand-in-glove with the builder. Unless penalties are imposed and such builders prosecuted, tenants will continue to get shortchanged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chawls-redevpt-stuck-for-2-years/articleshow/83154050.cms||Clara Lewis

She has created snack packets keeping in mind the calorie intake required by the healthcare workers. The packet includes a juice box for hydration, a dessert to instantly boost the energy levels and a savoury snack for times when one might have to skip a meal. Garg started the initiative alone, with the help of her mother. She prepares food packets at home and can be seen carrying packets of food in her car to hospitals and distributing them among doctors, nurses and frontline workers. In this pursuit, she has carefully curated all of these food packets keeping in mind staffers’ preferences, delivery timing, weather conditions etc. For instance, if packets were to be given early in the morning, they consist of breakfast dishes. If it were for people who were busy procuring oxygen cylinders and other medical equipment which requires them to be constantly on the road, then it would have food items that wouldn’t easily perish in the scorching heat. “It gives me a feeling of fulfilment and contentment, the fact that we could show our appreciation and gratitude towards all these diligent workers was in itself a self-rewarding act. They are working long hours, staying in isolation away from their families. These stressful times could take a toll on their mental well-being and through this initiative, I aim to show my support towards their immense dedication and appreciate their relentless efforts to fight against this pandemic,” said Garg, the 24-year-old chef, who worked with a restaurant in Florida for one year before the pandemic. Later, her friend Anusha Shaktawat joined her. “When I came to know about my friend distributing food packets expressing her support to healthcare workers and frontline workers, I decided to actively volunteer in order to raise funds, spread awareness about the cause, get in touch with hospital authorities, along with managing all the logistics to ensure overall smooth functioning every step of the way,” said Shaktawat, who is 23 years old. She further said, “This initiative made me realise that you don’t always have to be a part of big organisations, even as an individual you can make a difference in someone’s life. No matter how big or small your cause might be, if you do it with utmost dedication, it’ll still be impactful.” They together now distribute food packets to at least 10 Covid hospitals in the city. They distribute food packets on pre-decided days depending on which hospital is being covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chef-returns-from-us-distributes-food-packets-to-health-workers/articleshow/83156498.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC criticises outsourcing of fire inspection||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday expressed its disapproval of the state government’s policy of outsourcing the work of fire inspection of buildings for the renewal of fire NOCs. The judges insisted that the civic bodies should have internal mechanisms to carry out this task. A hearing was being held on a PIL filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal for the implementation of fire safety norms in hospitals and other buildings after the Shrey Hospital fire. A division bench commented on the lean staff strength of the AMC’s fire department and the lack of infrastructure for the continuous monitoring of the renewal of fire NOCs of buildings. The AMC asserted that it has enough staff and the task of renewal of fire NOCs has been outsourced following huge establishment costs, as it requires the employment of a large number of people. “You are placing responsibility on a third party. You have to recover fire inspection cost from the people to who you are rendering the service,” the judges said. “Primary obligation will lie with owner and occupant of the building.” The judges said a “separate in-house mechanism” must be created by the AMC. The judges further said, “Cost is not an issue when fire safety of people is at stake…Occupants have to pay for their benefit only, not for others.” The judges went on to say: “It is for their safety. You cannot throw burden on third party. They will sit in office and issue renewal certificate. That is a hard reality.” The HC questioned the AMC about how it would deal with lapses if fire inspection is outsourced. It also said that people are ignorant about law and depend on authorities. The AMC informed the court that a new computer system will now flag buildings that are due for renewal of fire NOCs. This data was unavailable earlier, but now can be managed. The state government, in its affidavit, said that it has trained 100 fire officers for inspection and 300 more persons are undergoing training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-criticises-outsourcing-of-fire-inspection/articleshow/83156532.cms||---

On May 3, the city had 64,500 cases which was the highest number of active cases in the second wave. On Monday, the city saw 256 new cases, eight less than those recorded on Monday. It also witnessed 825 patients being discharged on Tuesday. The officials said that the cases began to increase from March 5 and were at the peak on April 25 with 5,790 cases . The officials said that the number of cases crossed 500 in a day on April 1. The officials said that since May 20, the city has registered a decline in cases. This was evident from the drop in RT-PCR tests being conducted at private laboratories. After 67 days, it was on May 27 that the city’s daily Covid case tally fell below 400. The city had reported 375 cases — the lowest after March 20. The officials said that 6,175 vacant beds in hospitals indicated that Covid cases were on the decline. Meanwhile, west Ahmedabad continues to record 65% of the 260-odd Covid-positive cases while the eastern part of the city reports only 35%. Majority of the cases in eastern part are being reported from areas like Maninagar, Danilimda, Behrampura, Vatva and Isanpur which is in the South Zone. In the western parts of the city, Thaltej, Gota, Bodakdev, and Chandkheda in North West Zone as well as Jodhpur, Vejalpur and Bopal in South West Zone account for the highest number of cases. In West Zone, areas like Navrangpura, Paldi, Vasna, Naranpura, Ranip, and Vadaj still have high number of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/active-cases-fall-below-5k-mark-in-city/articleshow/83156529.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Unlock: Thin traffic, less crowd in markets on Day 1 in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Roads and markets were not as crowded as anticipated on the first day of unlocking in the city after one-and-a-half months of lockdown. There was more crowd in the old city than in the new Bhopal. However, traders in the old city, too, stuck to Covid-19 guidelines, putting a rope across the shop and circles on the floor outside so as to avoid crowding. The barricades put up across the city by the police during lockdown had been dragged away to the corner to facilitate smooth flow of traffic but the traffic flow didn’t pick up even as the evening descended on the city after a hot & humid day. “Sales were good and more importantly, customers were handled well. Only persons wearing masks were sold goods, customers came one after another. They waited in the circles outside the shop for their turn. Retails shopkeepers, families who have marriage in their family and customers buying grocery for household use, they were all there and we gave them the desired goods and by 7.00 pm, we closed the shops though the closure time was 8.00 pm”, said general secretary of Bhopal Kirana Mahasangh, Anupam Agrawal. Grocery, stationary, electrical and hardware apart from medical shops are the major segments, who have been allowed to open the shops in the first phase. Cloth and garment merchants and jewellers from Chowk Bazaar in old city raised slogans demanding that they too should be allowed to open shops and later handed over a memorandum addressed to district collector to police chowki in-charge at Sarafa. “It seems as if clothes are spreading corona. Clothes and jewellery shops never have the kind of crowd which a grocery shop has or an electrical shop can have. Besides, why should they allow all the shops to open in the grocery market and no shop in the jewellery market or clothes market”, said one of the protesters. Different closure times for two sets of shops — hardware, auto parts and repairing and electrical shops at 6.00 pm and the rest at 8.00 pm not only created confusion among customers and traders alike but the staff responsible to ensure timely closure of shops also faced problems as they went around a market asking traders to put the shutters down twice - at 5.30 pm and then 7.30 pm. Traffic in new Bhopal was thin compared to normal days, only a little more than the lockdown days despite the fact that private offices with 50% attendance have been allowed to open and government offices also started opening with half the attendance. Restaurants and hotels where food is served have also been given the facility of furnishing “take home” orders but there was not much crowd there as well except one or two restaurants, where some people could be seen waiting for delivery of their order. However, online order and delivery may also be one reason for people not turning up at the hotel counter to get their food or snacks packed. New Market, too, had a thin crowd. The usual hustle & bustle was missing. Yet, three shops were sealed by the district administration in the market for violation of Covid-19 guidelines. “People are scared. The kind of mayhem we have seen over the past one-and-a-half month not only in Bhopal but all over the country has shaken the faith of people. You won’t find too many young people making fun of somebody wearing a mask or maintaining a distance while having tea with his friends at a tea stall, which was the situation till March. It will take some time before people can get normal and start living normally”, said Jai Prakash Sharma, a young man, who had himself contracted Covid-19 infection. He appeared to be right as most of the people were seen wearing masks, percentage of people wearing masks for the sake of it (putting the mask on the chin or below their nose) was far less and those without masks could only be described as “incorrigible” persons, who refuse to learn lessons from what even the worst that they have seen happening around them recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/thin-traffic-less-crowd-in-markets-on-day-1/articleshow/83154040.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Mumbai||‘Non-essential’ shops, longer hours beckon Mumbaikars||Mumbai: The BMC’s relaxation in shop timings till 2pm amid Covid-19 restrictions brought relief to small traders and consumers alike on Tuesday. Stores selling “non-essential” items reopened after a two-month closure since April 5. However, the new guidelines about shops on either side of the road being operational on alternate days by rotation each week evoked confusion. Several localities buzzed with activity as people headed out to make purchases such as stationery, books, shoes, clothes and umbrellas, which were held up for weeks. Traders in Matunga, Andheri Lokhandwala, Borivli West and Mulund West rolled up their shutters on both sides of the road. A garment retailer in Lokhandwala said, “We pay a rent of Rs 1.8 lakh to Rs 2 lakh per month, bills, taxes and wages, and are getting no rebate although business has been zero since 2020. Now that non-essentials can operate, let us earn some income—until the third Covid wave arrives.” Matunga market was open on both sides of the road. “My phone has been working erratically since two weeks but since electronics shops were closed, I could neither buy a new one nor give it for repair. I finally got it repaired on Tuesday,” said local resident Vijay Sitlani. Vegetable vendors were pleased at the extension. “Our stock does not stay fresh till the next day and we were not able to sell everything in just four hours. In fact, leafy greens had to be thrown away,” said green grocer Radheshyam Tiwari. Borivli West market association member Ankit Jain said all businesses began functioning on Tuesday morning. He said, “The police helped clear the confusion about odd-even and left-right. The government should plan properly. Otherwise only retailers are bearing the pain. Hawkers are better off.” Mitesh Mody, president of the All India Electronics Association, said, “There were no customers at Lamington Road or Grant Road since D Ward’s order to reopen arrived only at noon. So we could function only for two hours between noon and 2pm. It will take some days to understand the working pattern.” His association made maps and circulated them so members know when to open. Every civic ward office issued rules for its own area. G North Ward specified schedules for Dadar. It said malls, shopping centres, salons and gymnasia would stay shut. D Ward barred alternate day arrangements in containment zones. Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said shops were open everywhere. “Traders are fed up by the loss of livelihood,” he said. Matunga corporator Nehal Shah said, “Who steps out to buy non-essentials at 7am? People simply order online.” Viren Shah of traders’ federation FRTWA has requested politicians and the BMC to extend shop timings for a level playing field with e-commerce. In Navi Mumbai and Thane shops will be shut on weekends.(Inputs by Nishikant Karlikar, George Mendonca & Bella Jaisinghani)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/non-essential-shops-longer-hours-beckon-mumbaikars/articleshow/83152844.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Premature baby tests positive though mother is Corona-free||MUMBAI: A premature baby born in Palghar on Monday tested positive for Covid 12 hours after birth while the mother tested negative. This could be the first case of a newborn testing positive for the virus in the extended Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) outside the metropolis. In Mumbai, there have been several instances of newborns testing positive hours after birth. But in most of those cases, the mother too had tested positive. In this case, the mother was detected with hepatitis B. A 32-year-old resident of Darsheth village in Palghar, she went into labour on Monday eight months pregnant. She was taken to a private hospital where she delivered a girl weighing 1.5 kg at 7.09 am. The doctors carried out a rapid antigen test of the newborn and the mother. The baby tested positive, but the mother’s test returned negative. The hospital informed officials and shifted the baby to Government Cottage hospital in Jawhar. Medical Superintendent Dr Ramdas Marad said the baby was admitted to the neo-natal ICU and is stable. The father’s samples have also been taken for testing. Doctors said the possibility of vertical transmission—in utero transmission from mother to child—is still being researched; studies report instances around the world. The World Health Organisation had said in February that while most neonates born to infected women test negative, one review had found that 1.9% of neonates tested positive at 24 hours or less. At BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, a facility for Covid-positive pregnant women, over 1,000 deliveries had taken place since last year. In 2020, there were 761 births of which 37 babies were found positive. While in 2021, of 202 births, nine babies were found positive. The hospital does an Rt-PCR of the child after birth. “We don’t know how they get infected exactly since vertical transmission from mother to child is still being studied. Babies can contract the infection after birth through contamination,” said Dr Sushma Malik, head of neonatology at Nair. A senior doctor said babies can get infected through contamination in the labour room or while being handled. Nair is a part of a study with the National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health to understand infection in newborns. A scientist said there is evidence of vertical transmission, but it doesn’t happen frequently. About the Palghar case, Dr Malik said there was a possibility that the mother was ‘false negative’. "Important to note is most babies have mild symptoms and recover soon," she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-premature-baby-tests-positive-though-mother-is-corona-free/articleshow/83156581.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Jaipur||Covid unlikely to affect kids in case 3rd wave hits in Rajasthan: Doctors||JAIPUR: Covid has claimed the lives of 21 children below the age of 15 in the state so far. Though the second wave claimed more lives, deaths among children remained at just five (from Jan 1 to May 11) in the state. In the first wave 15,104 children were infected while the number shot up to 22,009 in the second. According to health experts, children are safer than adults as far as Covid is concerned. “In children angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors are much less than in adults. Coronavirus binds to ACE receptors and cause severity of the disease. Since children do not have much ACE receptors, it is one of the causes children do not develop severe symptoms which could lead to death,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member of state’s advisory committee for Covid. Singh said parents of children should not get worried about the third wave but should remain alert and follow appropriate Covid behavior. “In some countries, which have reported the third wave, children weren’t affected in large numbers. So, parents should not get worried but remain alert,” said Dr Singh. According to the state’s figures, the mortality rate of children remained 0.11% in the first wave, while it the second wave, it went further down to 0.02% as only five deaths of children were reported below 15 years. Even JK Lon Hospital doctors have witnessed that majority of the children do not develop severe symptoms. “We have seen that Covid symptoms in most of the children remain mild and they usually recover from the virus,”said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. Even majority of the newborns do not develop severe symptoms, say the experts. “Positive newborns remain asymptomatic. It has also been suggested that kids lack ednucleocapsid-specific antibodies, which suggests that they aren’t experiencing widespread infection in Covid,” said Dr Shalini Rathore, in-charge for Covid treatment at Mahila Chikitsalaya. She added that children’s immune responses seem to be able to eliminate the virus before it replicates in large numbers. “It could be because children are not vaccinated against Covid and people above 18 and elderlies are not getting vaccination, there are fears of third wave would affect more children. But, in the first and second wave, it is seen that children remained the safest lot,”said Dr Rathore. However, as a precautionary measure, the health department has started preparation for the third wave and scaling up facilities for Covid treatment in children’s hospitals across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-unlikely-to-affect-kids-in-case-3rd-wave-hits-docs/articleshow/83156575.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: NGO's take essentials to Covid-hit villages||NAINITAL: Even as Covid-19 cases are on a decline overall in the country and in Uttarakhand, the hill districts, where cases and deaths started surging in April this year, are still grappling with the virus. NGOs as well as common people from the state are reaching out to the residents of remote hill villages and helping them with consultations with doctors, medical kits, food and other essential items. In Rudraprayag, members of JOY – a Doon-based NGO – travelled to 26 villages which have been declared containment zones and provided consultation with doctors as well as medical kits and sanitary pads. Jai Sharma, founding president of JOY, said that volunteers found that after cases started rising, entire villages were declared containment zones, leaving patients with no option to go out and seek help. A teacher couple in Baida village had reached out for help to the DM’s office as their ration was running out. When JOY volunteers reached them, the couple received ration after 10 days. Volunteers said many of these villages are dozens of kilometers away from motorable roads and in one instance, a man had died of Covid-19 as he did not receive any help. Hundreds in these remote hill villages were treated for common cold and fever, as TOI had reported earlier, because Covid tests couldn’t be done. They had suffered in silence. “After these villages became containment zones, people just stayed cooped up in their homes, waiting for help. We decided to provide some basic items like food, medicines and sanitary pads,” Sharma said. He added that the team has distributed several thousand kilos of ration, 200 medical kits and 300 sanitation kits in the villages. “We will travel to places like Ukhimath, Joshimath and several other remote hill areas in a few days and help the villagers there as well,” Sharma said. In Haldwani, locals have joined hands to help villagers from Kumaon. Shweta Mashiwal of Vatsal Foundation said that her team has helped over 50 villages across Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Champawat with oxygen concentrators, medical kits and medical counselling. Mashiwal and several other volunteers said they also helped patients who couldn’t afford treatment in private hospitals to get admitted there. “We know people who lost their jobs and were forced to migrate back to their villages. In the second wave, they had almost nothing left to spend on hospitals. Therefore, we connected them with doctors we knew for advice. Also, we helped 300 patients who couldn’t afford treatment get admission in private hospitals,” she said. Mashiwal added that her teams have also been educating people about the symptoms, testing as well as treatment of Covid. “There have been cases where people refused to believe they or their family members had Covid-19 because the RT-PCR test reports were negative even though the CT scan reports suggested otherwise. We explained to them that at times the RT-PCR test shows false negatives. Educating people about the virus has been a major task this year. We have been getting in touch with gram pradhans, sending them awareness material and training our volunteers so they can provide much-needed help to affected people,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/good-samaritans-take-relief-material-to-covid-hit-villages-in-remote-hills/articleshow/83152845.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Ahmedabad||Court directs firemen to file affidavit on inspection||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday sought to know the version of two firemen about their inspection visit to Patel Welfare Hospital in Bharuch before a fire killed 18 persons in its Covid-19 ward on April 30 night.The state government informed the high court that the leading fire officer of Bharuch municipality, Shailesh Sasiya, has been suspended pending an inquiry into the fire incident. Besides, there appeared to be contradiction in the Bombay Patel Welfare Society, the municipality, and the state government’s versions about concerned fire officials’ knowledge regarding existence of Covid-19 facility in the new building. The hospital administrator even claimed that Sasiya had instructed the fire inspection team not to visit the Covid facility. This has led the HC to direct the two persons to file affidavit and state about their inspection visit whether they were directed to the new building by the hospital management.Meanwhile, the HC also questioned the trust about lack of fire NOC in the new building where Covid facility was started twice. It questioned why the trust did not bother to install fire prevention equipment and did not even bother to mention this before the authorities when the trust entered into an MoU with the authorities to set up Covid ward during the recent surge in April.The court has sought reply before June 11, when further hearing has been posted on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-directs-firemen-to-file-affidavit-on-inspection/articleshow/83156608.cms||---

The cabinet had, on Monday, gave its nod to the decision to change rules under which the family of an employee becomes eligible for ex-gratia payment. In consultation with the Election Commission of India and SGPGI, the government said if a personnel on duty died due to Covid or post-Covid complications within a month of the date of their duty, their family would get the ex-gratia payment. Earlier, one was eligible for payment only if the employee died on the day of election duty or on way to and from duty. Under this, 40 personnel were found to have died due to Covid and 34 for non-Covid reasons. This also included sector magistrates who were on duty for a month and not polling personnel who were on duty for a maximum of two days. With the change in rules, many more government employees are likely to become eligible for ex-gratia payment of Rs 30 lakh. The family members of a deceased employee or the head of the department in which they were posted can apply on the portal with test reports of the deceased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-sets-june-15-deadline-for-ex-gratia-claims-for-covid-deaths-on-poll-duty/articleshow/83158169.cms||---
---||Goa||State seeks retrial, says Tejpal judge didn’t apply her mind||Panaji: The state government, in its amended application before the high court of Bombay at Goa, has sought a retrial of the alleged rape case against Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal, and contended that the judge didn’t apply her mind while delivering the judgment that acquitted him. “The impugned judgment needs to be set aside ordering retrial, owing to non-application of mind and manifest errors of law and fact,” the state government said. The state has prayed to allow the application and grant leave to appeal against the judgment passed by trial court acquitting Tejpal. The application was filed on Monday and the case is likely to come up for hearing on Wednesday. “The court disbelieved the version of the prosecutrix (survivor) on the basis of a conception of how a victim is expected to behave while being sexually assaulted. It is most respectfully submitted that this finding by the trial court is unsustainable in law, and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy,” the application said. The application states that the additional sessions court did not consider a Supreme Court judgment (Aparna Bhat vs State of Madhya Pradesh), which held that that courts should refrain from commenting on the conduct of the prosecutrix in rape trials based on habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and past sexual history, among other things. The application also says that the ‘apology’ sent by the accused to the survivor after the incident, corroboration of survivors’ testimony by her colleagues who deposed as witnesses in the court, and the various text messages exchanged between the accused and the prosecutrix soon after the incidents of alleged rape, were not considered by the trial court. “The said apologies sent merely a day after the complaint was made by the prosecutrix were an unequivocal admission of the incidents alleged by prosecutrix, made without inducement, threat or promise,” the application said, adding that the apologies are admissions under Section 21 of the Indian Evidence Act. It said that the trial court has completely ignored “the most telling piece of evidence in the case, which establishes the guilt of the accused beyond a shadow of doubt”. The state government also said that the trial court has cast aspersions on the investigating officer with regards to the seizure of the DVRs on November 29, 2013, and has further suggested that the investigating officer has destroyed the CCTV footage of the first floor of November 7, 2013. “The trial court has ignored the fact that the original DVRs are deposited before the court and have also been forensically examined by CFSL, Hyderabad, first at the request of the police, and then, subsequently, pursuant to the order of the apex court,” the state said. Referring to the judgment that mentions “drunken banter” between the accused and the survivor, the application pointed out, “Merely because the prosecutrix chose to remain silent on the repeated attempts of the accused to create a defence for himself does not lead to the automatic inference that the prosecutrix had accepted his version”. The state also said that the FIR was not registered at the behest of the prosecutrix, but was registered by the state of Goa, suo motu, upon being made aware of the incidents of alleged rape that took place inside the lift. Consequently, there was no occasion for the prosecutrix to have any meaningful medical examination, and this fact cannot be held against her, the application said. “The trial court has drawn an adverse inference against the survivor for not looking sufficiently traumatised or appearing fearful after the two incidents and in the messages she exchanged after the incidents,” the state said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-seeks-retrial-says-tejpal-judge-didnt-apply-her-mind/articleshow/83156528.cms||Murari Shetye

They wanted the court to direct the university to remove M Gowthaman, who was appointed as the assistant technical officer to Arignar Anna Central Library in the university.According to the petitioners, Gowthaman did not possess the required qualification – a degree in any subject along with a degree in library science. While an inquiry was conducted by a university committee based on the representation made by the petitioner, Gowthaman was promoted as technical officer. Concluding the hearing, the court stated that Gowthaman, being unqualified, was not entitled to be appointed as assistant technical officer. Rejecting the contention that the issue has become infructuous on the superannuation of Gowthaman, Justice Mahadevan said: “This court does not think so, because any illegality cannot be given a seal of authenticity just due to lapse of time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/videograph-interviews-revoke-illegal-postings-madras-hc-tells-universities/articleshow/83159787.cms||---
---||Puducherry||Pondy lawyer associations not covered under AWFA||Puducherry: The Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Tuesday declared that it has not recognised the advocates’ associations in the Union territory of Puducherry, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Madras high court. The council made its declaration clear while replying to an RTI query filed by a Puducherry-based advocate C Elangovan.Elangovan questioned why members of advocates associations in Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam were not covered under the Advocates' welfare fund act (AWFA), 2001, while their counterparts in Tamil Nadu enjoy all welfare measures. The AWFA ensures a slew of benefits for the advocates, who were members of the fund for a period of not less than five years. Though the Union government passed the AWFA in 2001 and the Puducherry government passed a notification in 2008, the Bar Council maintained that it has not received any communication from Puducherry government on the implementation of AWFA. The Bar Council commenced printing and selling the Advocates’ Welfare Fund Stamps for Rs 30. Every advocate appearing before Tamil Nadu courts must affix a stamp on Vakalatnama and memo of appearance filed by him. The fund thus raised will be used for the welfare measures of the advocates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/pondy-lawyer-associations-not-covered-under-awfa/articleshow/83159789.cms||Bosco Dominique

While the number of prisoners who were vaccinated is not encouraging, we have decided to encourage them to take the shots. He said many Covid patients in the government hospitals were accompanied by relatives, and it must be discouraged. Many of them refuse to move out, making them vulnerable to the infection. They will be sent out after Covid tests in the coming days. On the examinations to be conducted at the law colleges, he said a decision will be taken once the Covid-19 cases are settled down. While water from the Mettur dam is expected to be released in the second week of June, he said tender has been given for Rs 2 crore to desilt canals to ensure that water reaches the fag end.

---||Kolkata||Relief for retail business: Six hours for groceries, three hours for other shops||Kolkata: The first day retail shops—those selling goods other than groceries, sweet, fish and vegetables, saris and jewellery—were allowed to open their shutters in the past 15 days, the establishments recorded a decent footfall. All these shops had been shut since May 16, following restrictions imposed by the government to tackle the quick spread of the novel coronavirus. After the break, when these shops again opened on Tuesday, during the prescribed three hours between noon and 3pm, people made a beeline to buy essential items, such electrical fittings, sanitary wares and electronic gadgets. In Burrabazar and on Canning Street, shops selling household items also recorded a decent number of customers on the reopening day. Market committees said they expected more establishments to open from Wednesday, as a lot of traders were quite aware of the new relaxation in the restrictions rules. Traders, who had been worried about losses after the government extended the restrictions from may 31 to mid-June, heaved a sigh of relief to get the three-hour daily breather. “Business has been suffering losses for the past 14 months. But we are happy that the government relaxed the rules a little so that we can open our shops for a few hours every day. Food is definitely the most essential item but people need a lot of other things, especially when they are working from home. So it’s good that the administration reviewed the situation and allowed us to open,” said Sadiqque Hussain, a mobile shop owner at Khairu Place in Bowbazar. The market of electrical goods on Ezra Street too came to life in the afternoon. People visited to buy light bulbs, chargers and different electrical appliances. “The light in my room was not working, but I could not replace it as the shops were shut. Now that the shops have opened, I bought a spare one so that I don’t have to again go to a shop if another light stops working,” said Bapi Das, a resident of Surya Sen Street. Grocery shops across the city, which had been open from 7am to 10am, can now again operate between noon and 3pm. “This is good for trade as the morning three-hour slot was too short for both businessmen and consumers,” said Sushil Poddar, president, Confederation of West Bengal Traders’ Associations. Other retail shops will, however, function in the single afternoon slot. Market committees have again reminded traders to follow Covid-safety rules if they did not want the administration to take strict measures. “We have got the opening permission because Covid cases have come down and the burden on health infrastructure has decreased. But if we don’t wear masks and practise social distancing, cases will rise again, and we will not be able to blame anybody for the losses,” said the secretary of a market committee in central Kolkata.

---||Goa||NGT directs state govt to hold fresh hearings for coastal plan||Panaji: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered Goa to conduct fresh public hearings for preparation of the state’s coastal zone management plan (CZMP). The earlier deadline for the state to finalise and notify the plan has been extended by seven months, upto August 31. The NGT has said that, if need be, the hearings should be carried out for more than one day, but all persons should be given sufficient opportunity to make their presentations. In its judgment dated May 31, the NGT directed the Goa government to issue a notice, including in newspapers, within one week, and to fix a date for the CZMP public hearing within one month from the date of notice. Two venues with adequate capacity should be specified for the conduct of the hearing, and there should be no change in the venue once announced, the NGT said. “The modalities of conducting public hearing may be specified in the notice,” the order stated. “Written objections may also be allowed to be filed, to be supplemented by a public hearing of specified duration.” “Representations of all sections of affected people may be ensured without rendering the situation unviable. If necessary, the public hearing may be continued for more than one day, but we do not fix any particular number of days. The idea is reasonable opportunity (is provided) to all concerned sections.” Goa Foundation had filed an application before the NGT, pointing to deficiencies in the conduct of the public hearing for preparation of the CZMP for Goa. Agreeing with Goa Foundation that there had been procedural lapses in conducting the hearing, the NGT said, “While it is true that there is urgency in the matter of finalization of CZMP, which process is pending for the last seven years, at the same time, the salutary mandate of public hearing has to be followed in letter and spirit. A last minute change in venue certainly caused prejudice in the conduct of the public hearing”. It may be recalled that there was an uproar earlier this year when the venue of the public hearing was changed at the eleventh hour from the Taleigao community hall to Kala Academy, Panaji. Goa Foundation told the NGT that there were other changes in the notice for public hearing, including requirement of prior registration, registration at the venue, reduction of time for hearing, and a time limit of only five minutes for each participant. “The new notice allowed oral presentation without visuals, without a facility for virtual participation. On account of the pandemic, physical participation was limited to 100 people. In such a situation, if participants were more than 100, a staggered public hearing should have been held,” Goa Foundation told NGT. The organisation also told the NGT that the earlier CZMP prepared in 1996 continued to be in force till 2016. “The new CZMP will be valid for two decades. It is, therefore, to be ensured that there are no errors. 80% of the population will be affected by the CZMP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-directs-state-govt-to-hold-fresh-hearings-for-coastal-plan/articleshow/83156560.cms||---

---||Visakhapatnam||Pakistan releases Andhra Pradesh techie after 4-year jail||VISAKHAPATNAM: Hyderabad-based IT professional Vaindam Prasanth, who had illegally crossed over into Pakistan four years ago while trying to go to Switzerland on ‘foot’, returned home on Tuesday. Prasanth, who hails from Visakhapatnam, spent four years in jail in Pakistan after he was arrested in 2017 on the suspicion that he was an Indian spy. On Monday, Pakistan rangers handed over the 32-year-old techie to Border Security Force officials at Attari border, ending his ordeal of four years. Prasanth, who landed in Hyderabad on Tuesday will leave for Visakhapatnam later this week. In April 2017, Prasanth was arrested at Yazaman mandi in Bahawalpur in Pakistan’s Punjab province while trying to pass the neighbouring country on his way to Switzerland without any visa or valid documents. The reason behind the misadventure was to meet a woman named Swapnika Pandey in Switzerland, who he met and fell in love on a social networking platform. Pakistani military suspected him to be an Indian spy and took him into custody. Before leaving Hyderabad, Prasanth also reportedly met Swapnika’s parents in Madhya Pradesh proposing to marry her, but the proposal was rejected by them. He then decided to go to Switzerland. “I left home without listening to my mother’s advice. I made some online research and found that one can walk to Switzerland via Pakistan in 61 days and attempted to do that,” Prasanth told reporters in Hyderabad on Tuesday. Prasanth, who did his BTech from Chaitanya College in Vizag, went missing on April 11, 2017 from Hyderabad while working with an information technology firm in Madhapur. His father Babu Rao filed a missing complaint on April 29 at Madhapur police station. In 2019, his video message in Telugu to his parents from a Pakistan jail went viral on social media, following which diplomatic channels were activated to secure his release. His 69-year-old father, a retired private company employee, told TOI that god has finally answered their prayers. “I can’t wait to see him. I am told he has already reached Hyderabad and would reach Vizag in the next one-two days,” he said. Prasanth is the youngest of Babu Rao’s three children. The family hails from Kancharam village in Rajam mandal of Srikakulam district, and have been staying in Madhurawada area since moving to Vizag in 2002. The techie is likely to be questioned by various security agencies in Hyderabad. “There are some procedures to be followed in such cases as he was in the custody of Pakistan security forces for four years,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pakistan-releases-ap-techie-after-4-yr-jail/articleshow/83158231.cms||Siva G

Deepak Goradia, president, CREDAI-MCHI, said real estate sales in the last few months have seen a steep downward trend. “Enquiries and sales are down, and it is imperative that the government continues the stamp duty rebate. Even state government collections have taken a massive hit,” he said. Manju Yagnik, senior vice-president, NAREDCO, said April and May have witnessed moderate sales after government decided to reinstate 5% stamp duty on property registrations. “The government must reduce stamp duty to bring back the momentum and help the sector tide over the crisis,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-real-estate-industry-for-cut-in-stamp-duty/articleshow/83154070.cms||---

They blame the city corporation for not providing ward-level helplines to get their basic needs.Although the corporation has provided permission for 547 vehicles to sell grocery at the doorstep, the residents even in arterial streets complained of not seeing these vehicles. Vegetable sale through mini trucks have also failed to reach many parts. Since the essentials bought before the lockdown have run out of stock, residents say they are forced to step out. “You can’t ask people to stay indoors and not provide helplines to address their needs,” N Sayeed, a resident of Vayalur road said. People hailing from populated localities such as Thiruverumbur, Kattur, Wireless road and Ponmalai say vegetable vehicles are skipping interior streets. Since they do not have speakers to announce their arrival, elderly residents in the remote streets are deprived of vegetables.In commercial streets such as Big Bazaar street and Palakkarai, vendors who were given permission to do sales are stationing their vehicles at a road corner. Although the contact numbers of vegetable and grocery sellers were shared with the public on the official website of the local body, many residents are yet to get the list. “The bill collectors in wards can be contacted to resolve the grievances. We have even permitted grocery sales on two-wheeler,” a senior official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/veggie-grocery-vehicles-confined-to-junctions/articleshow/83156637.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Mumbai||80:20 bed scheme in private hospitals revised, extended till August 31||MUMBAI: The state government has extended till August 31, the 80:20 scheme that allows local authorities to reserve 80% of the beds for Covid treatment in private hospitals. The scheme, however, has been revised to introduce graded bed rates for different cities. It will also be mandatory to pre-audit bills before it is issued to the patient as per the new norms. In a notification released on Tuesday, the state public health department said that rates for isolation and ICU beds have been classified into three grades—for Class A, B and C cities. A routine Covid isolation bed will cost Rs 4,000 in a Class A city, Rs 3,000 in a Class B city and Rs 2,400 in a Class C city of Maharashtra. Similarly, an ICU bed with a ventilator will cost Rs 9,000 in a Class A city, Rs 6,700 in Class B and Rs 5,400 in Class C city; and the rates for ICU without ventilator is Rs 7,500, Rs 5,500 and 4,500, respectively. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region, including nine corporations, Pune and Nagpur have been classified under Class A cities. Bhiwandi-Nizampur and Vasai-Virar civic corporations from MMR though have been included in the category of Class B cities. Among others in Class B are Nashik, Amravati, Aurangabad, Solapur, Malegaon, Nanded and Sangli. Areas outside of A and B class cities have been put in the Class C basket. A state official said that previously the capped rates were uniform across Maharashtra. “So, people in Mumbai and Amravati were paying the same rates. For some rural places, the capped rates were actually higher than what they were actually charging patients, so we have revised it,” he added. The state official further said that the pre-auditing of bills has been made mandatory. “In cities like Mumbai, auditors are checking bills before they are handed to patients. But that’s not the practice in the rest of the state,” he said, adding that patients continue to be charged arbitrarily despite the capping. “We hope it will be implemented better now,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-8020-bed-scheme-in-pvt-hosps-revised-extended-till-aug-31/articleshow/83158236.cms||---

For this, he teamed up with a friend, Dr Biman Saikia of the department of immunopathology, PGI and made a comic remix of an old song. Their gig caught the fancy of netizens around the world and they are even getting calls from Alaska and parts of Europe. The duo have been singing duets since their specialisation days in PGI. During the lockdown, they took to the online platform. “We have recorded over 200 songs during the lockdown. But this one which we recorded on a karaoke application was picked by someone and shared on a microblogging site. It went viral within no time,” said Dr Raman. This is a welcome turn of events for Dr Raman, who was critical due to Covid in February and was admitted in the ICU of PGI. “I experienced that staying cheerful made me bounce back. I used to hum songs in the hospital as well. When I was discharged, I thought to pass on my experience to all. Humor and friendship are essential that makes one get going and this is conveyed in our duet,” said Dr Raman. Dr Biman, who worked on mechanisms of immunity in pathogens like Covid, has produced many song albums. “We have been seeing a lot of misery. Music is therapeutic for us,” said Dr Biman. The duo sang the track “Aaja panchhi akela hai” from the film, “Nau Do Gyarah” sung by Mohammad Rafi and Asha Bhonsle. The two friends have tweaked the lyrics, adding an element of humour in the song. In between the original song, Dr Biman says that if his friend’s wife is not at home, they have the liberty to sit over drinks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-docs-win-hearts-with-online-gig/articleshow/83154052.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Trichy||Cops get into act as more motorists venture out under cover of vax drive||Trichy: City roads were abuzz with movement of vehicles including two-wheelers and four-wheelers for the past two days in Trichy city. The motorists cited vaccination drive as the reason though it was put on hold on Tuesday. Unlike the past week when complete lockdown came into effect, bikes and cars were seen moving around the city from Sunday and it continued on Tuesday too. A traffic police officer posted near Puthur four road junction said many motorists claimed they were going for vaccination. The public health department did not organise vaccination camp for 18-44 years age group in any of the centres in the city due to shortage of both Covishield and Covaxin vaccines. “When we grill them further, they say they are going to primary health centres in rural areas like Kulumani bordering the city to take vaccination,” said the traffic police. Unfortunately, the vaccines ran dry in almost all places except Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) where Covaxin was available for those taking the second dose. Going by the public health department’s data, a total of 1,835 people were vaccinated for both first and second dose in government and private centres on Tuesday. The district has covered 226,430 people under the drive including for first and second dose. With the movement of vehicles looked high, police started quizzing the motorists and seized their vehicles if they were found stating false reasons. Central zone police comprising nine districts witnessed a huge crowd on the road on Sunday. Police in Trichy rural, Pudukottai, Karur, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagappattinam and Mayiladuthurai seized 1,634 vehicles including nine four-wheelers and three tri-wheelers on Sunday.

As usual, liquor shops were the first to up the shutters in the morning and would be last to put down the shutter. There were comments on social media sites and traders were also verbally referring to permission to liquor shops to remain open till 11.30 pm while the rest of the shops allowed to operate from Tuesday in the first phase of unlocking will close down at 6.00 pm and 8.00 pm respectively. Spokesperson for district administration, Arun Rathore, when asked about timings of the liquor shops, said “It will be according to excise rules”. When asked whether the liquor shops according to excise rules can remain open till 11.30 pm, he said “Yes”. On Monday, excise commissioner, Rajiv Dubey, had said that the excise department has no role in deciding whether the liquor shops would open or not and the matter has to be decided by the district collector. Later, district collector, Avnash Lavania, in his order on the unlock said “Liquor shops will be operated according to directions received from the excise department”. Assistant commissioner, excise, issued an order referring to the order of the district collector, Bhopal saying that the liquor shops in the district have been leased for operation from June 1, 2021 and spelled out the conditions under which the liquor shops are being allowed to operate and clarified that if any action is taken against owner or staff of the shops for violation of SOPs, they themselves would be responsible for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/liquor-shops-first-to-open-last-to-shut/articleshow/83154055.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Till date, Rajasthan has administered 1.7 crore doses to eligible beneficiaries and wastage rate was well within permissible limit set by the Centre, Sharma added. “Since beginning, Rajasthan has been the front runner in vaccinating beneficiaries. We have always placed a special emphasis on quality of vaccination processes. I have again directed my department to do a thorough quality check of the vaccination being carried out,” Sharma wrote to Union health minister. He further added that wastage rate of the state was well within the limit. Sharma said vaccine wastage in the 18-44 years category was zero while it is 2% for people above 45 years. The permissible limit is 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vax-wastage-in-raj-within-permissible-limits-govt/articleshow/83156628.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Soon, a drone may be able to do your coconut-plucking||PANAJI: Soon, Goans will not have to wait for the much sought-after padeli (coconut plucker) to visit their homes for manual harvesting of coconuts. A ‘fly cocobot’ will do the task just fine at a reasonable cost. Not just that, it will also reduce the risk for human climbers. Conceptualised by experts at the Old Goa-based ICAR-CCARI and the Goa University, this drone-like device flies to the top of the tree and gets attached to the trunk with its ‘grabbing arms’. Its ‘cutting arm’ then opens up to cut the desired bunch of coconuts which can be chosen through a live video displayed on the screen of the remote-controlled module. The innovation has already received national accolades and is now in the process of getting patented. “With this device, coconut-plucking can be done from a safe distance without risking human life, by a trained person, and without any gender bias. The machine is conceptualised to have operational efficiency of 12-15 palms per hour,” Goa University professor, Rajendra Gad, said. The uniqueness of the fly cocobot lies in its suitability for use in mixed cropping plantation of coconut and black pepper, thereby leading to higher returns. “Padelis generally avoid harvesting coconuts in coconut-black pepper systems due to difficulties in climbing the coconut trees on which the pepper plants climb. Also, manned and unmanned devices presently being used for harvesting coconuts are not compatible with the dual cropping system. Fly cocobot, on the other hand, is an excellent solution,” Gad said. The prototype design of the novel device — which is remotely controlled and ensures safe harvesting of coconuts — could even be used to harvest other palms like areca nut, palmyra palm, oil palm and date palm worldwide. It could also be modified for other farm operations like spraying and pruning. ICAR-CCARI and Goa University will jointly file an application seeking a patent for the novel design of the machine to protect their intellectual property rights (IPR). A national level ‘Kritagya Agtech Hackathon’ (Krishi Takaniki Gyan) was launched by ICAR’s National Agricultural Higher Education Project in 2020 to promote farm mechanisation. A total of 784 teams across India registered. Cutting across stiff competition at the multilevel screening — first at zonal level among 89 teams and then at the national level among 25 teams — the fly cocobot was presented by Gad along with ICAR-CCARI principal scientist (horticulture) Adavi Rao Desai, and their students, Abhiraj Pednekar and Arman Shaikh. The technology bagged first place for its novelty, innovative concept and cost-effective technical solutions and practical feasibility. In the national level virtual event on May 31, the fly cocobot team received an award certificate and prize money of Rs five lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flying-padeli-soon-a-drone-may-be-able-to-do-your-coconut-plucking/articleshow/83156631.cms||Nida Sayed

Already serving as the RLD vice-president, Jayant's name was proposed and backed by the party’s national general secretaries Triloki Tyagi and Munshiram Pal, following which the national executive gave its approval. Addressing the executive meeting, Jayant pledged to follow the path shown by his grandfather and former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh and his father. He said farmers and rural issues would be his party’s top priority. “I am honoured & mindful of the challenges ahead. Will try my best to strengthen our organisation & will value inputs as we collectively take our core issues forward. Am drafting an open letter to express my condolences & solidarity with all #Covid impacted families as a first step,” Jayant tweeted after taking over the reins of the RLD. Jayant is replacing his father as RLD president at a time when the party faces a political crisis as the BJP is ramping up its organisational machinery ahead of the UP assembly elections due next year. Party loyalists feel that while addressing the core issues of the party, Jayant will have to keep an eye on the forthcoming UP assembly elections in 2022, which will be his first litmus test as the party chief. Gaining the lost grounds in western UP by effectively mobilising party workers should be his foremost concern, they said. In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Jayant had successfully contested the Mathura parliamentary seat, which he lost to BJP’s Hema Malini in 2014. Having tasted successive defeats in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Jayant’s aggressive posture during the farmers’ agitation against the newly-passed farm laws was well received in the recently-concluded UP panchayat elections with his party winning 10 zila panchayat seats in Aligarh, nine in Baghpat, eight each in Meerut and Mathura, six in Shamli and four in Muzaffarnagar. His party is most likely to join hands with the Samajwadi Party for the upcoming assembly polls in UP. Interacting with TOI earlier, Jayant had made it clear that the RLD would steer it in western UP if allied with the SP. The RLD chief, meanwhile, attacked the ruling BJP for not making enough efforts to stem the second wave of the pandemic which reached alarming proportions. “The government should step up vaccination drive, especially in rural areas,” he said. He also announced RLD’s support of the ‘black day’ proposed by the agitating farmers on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmers-rural-issues-to-be-rlds-top-priority-says-jayant-after-taking-over-reins-of-party/articleshow/82952064.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh: Mother seeks mercy killing, boy dies in her arms||TIRUPATI: In a tragic turn of events, a nine-year-old boy suffering from prolonged illness breathed his last while returning home from Punganur court where his mother went to file a mercy killing petition on Tuesday. The boy, Harsha Vardhan from Beerjepalli village under Chowdepalli mandal in Chittoor district, developed complications while they were coming back from the court and breathed his last in the auto. He was the only child of the family. Harsha had met with a near-fatal accident about four years ago and was bedridden since then. “Following the accident he used to suffer bleeding from the nose frequently. His brain and spine bore the brunt of the impact and he was confined to his bed since then. We approached many doctors and hospitals, but all of them said the bleeding disorder he suffered due to the accident has no cure,” said G Aruna, his mother. Despite their limited resources, the family tried their best to provide the best possible treatment to Harsha. His farmer father G Mani even sold off some land and took his son to hospitals in Tirupati, Vellore and some other cities. “We spent over Rs 4 lakh and approached several doctors and hospitals over the last four years, but there was no improvement in his condition,” he added. Having run out of money and hope, Aruna was advised by one of her relatives to move the local court seeking help for treatment of her son or accord the necessary permission for his mercy killing as she could not bear to see the pain and agony of her only child. For the past two days, the helpless mother had been doing the rounds of Punganur court to file the mercy killing petition. On Tuesday, Aruna again came to the court with her son and after failing to file the petition, was returning home in an autorickshaw when he started bleeding all of a sudden and died in her arms. “I thought I could save my son by approaching the court. But before the judiciary could help us out, he died in my arms,” the inconsolable mother said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mom-seeks-mercy-killing-boy-dies-in-her-arms/articleshow/83158248.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Bhopal||10x more active cases, 6x more deaths than last year||BHOPAL: Exactly a year ago on June 1, 2020 when for the first time state went into unlock from lockdown. There were only 2,922 active Covid-19 cases in the state. Now, one year down the line, the state has again gone into lockdown but now there are nearly 10 times the number of active cases. As per the official sources on June 1, 2020 there were 2,922 active Covid-19 patients in the state when the state had gone into unlock and restrictions of lockdown were removed. Now, when lockdown is once again being removed, and state has again moved towards unlock, there are a whopping 23,390 active cases in the state. And this is not the only difference, source say that the time when the first unlock was implemented, there were less casualties due to the Covid-19, now it has turned out to be more fatal in the recent times. On June 1, 2020 only 8 deaths were reported due to Covid-19, but on May 31, 2021, 48 deaths were reported. Given to this scenario, this unlock should be taken seriously by the people and under no circumstances, guards be let down, added sources. Dr Manish Mishra, former CMHO of Jabalpur where the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the state on March 21, 2020, says, “I have said in past also and now it has become more relevant because we are not in a condition to afford economic lockdown and at the same time still there are lot of active cases. There is no other way out than to impose or follow a ‘facial lockdown’, this means that one should always wear appropriate masks, then cover the face with face shields while working or going out in public”. “People who could be super spreader like people involved in work where they have to interact with lot of other people should be identified and they should follow this facial lockdown mandatorily”, he said. “Economic lockdown in a country like ours where there is large proportion of marginalised population is difficult and is troublesome for a lot of people”, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/10x-more-active-cases-6x-more-deaths-than-last-year/articleshow/83154118.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Retail prices in the city are up 11% this year and reached Rs 100.4 rupees a litre on Monday, Indian Oil Corporation data shows. The equivalent price in the US financial center is $0.79 (around Rs 57), according to calculations based on figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. Indian fuel prices have soared in the past year as PM Modi’s administration has repeatedly raised sales taxes to cushion worsening public finances. Levies now make up around 60% of the retail price and federal taxes on petrol and diesel have surged nearly six-fold since 2013. The steep increase in taxes on the two fuels, which account for more than half of India’s oil consumption, comes as the Covid-19 pandemic pummels demand in the world’s third-biggest crude importer. Sales of the two fuels in May are about a third lower than pre-virus levels in 2019 as large parts of the nation remained under local lockdown to battle the world’s worst coronavirus wave. “I pray for the prices to soften or the government to reduce the taxes,” said N Vijayagopal, finance director at Bharat Petroleum Corporation. Unless that happens, “we have no choice but to increase the retail selling prices,” he said.

The state government had earlier announced to organise these camps from October 2 to redress and dispose of land related issues of the public. As time is approaching for the camps, the government has started an exercise to prepare Request For Proposal (RFP) documents to appoint an information technology company. An official said, “For the same, a committee has been constituted. The draft proposal of the RFP document will be submitted to UDH principal secretary.” An official said proposals would be sought from information technology companies to develop online service provider. “This application will also be available on mobile app so that people can have the facility of submitting applications from mobile as well,” said an official. A new concept of nagar mitra has also been mooted for the first time. Technical consultants for aiding public will be hired under the system. “On many occasions, problem occurs during the camps when applicants are not aware procedure and documents required during applying. Due to these shortcomings, civic bodies give notice to the applicant to rectify or complete these documents. This takes unnecessary time and the number of pending cases also increases. With the help consultants, the process will be expedited,” said an official. The nagar mitra will ensure that there is no shortage of documents in the submitted application. The state government aims to distribute 10 lakh lease deeds to plot owners living in unregularised colonies. Official sources said the state government might allow the local bodies to regularise colonies developed between 1999 and 2005. Earlier, to regularise the colonies developed before 1999, the JDA had prepared a list. However, as matter is still pending in the court, the JDA might not regularise these colonies. “As per the JDA records, there are 1,722 housing schemes developed before 1999. Other than that, between 1999 and 2002, around 614 housing colonies were developed by housing societies.” At present, there are approximately 800 colonies in the JDA periphery which are yet to be regularised. “Out of these colonies, regularisation of around 400 colonies can be done easily, whereas it will be difficult for the JDA to regularise other colonies due to various reasons. Relaxations will be provided by the state government to regularise these colonies during the camp,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-begins-exercise-to-develop-software/articleshow/83156713.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Off-shop liquor sale resumes after 2 weeks of home delivery||Kolkata: Liquor off-shops in the city restarted over-the-counter sale on Tuesday after a hiatus of over two weeks, bringing back long queues of buyers, who had to depend on home delivery of their favourite spirits these past couple of weeks. A retailer told TOI that on the reopening day, shops in residential areas in south and north Kolkata as well as Behala, witnessed good business though sales were muted in the office districts of Esplanade and Dalhousie. “Most offices in these areas are still closed, as a result of which footfall was less,” he said. Another retailer said, “Sales on the first day were average and we hope business would pick up from the second day. We expect sale to rise to at least 70%-75% of our average daily business in normal times,” he added. Bars (liquor on-shops) in Bengal had shut down since May 1. To check the surge in Covid cases in the second wave of the pandemic, the state imposed strict restrictions from May 16, under which all liquor shops were closed and the rules were extended till June 15. But the government issued relaxation order on Monday evening, allowing all retail outlets to open for three hours from noon to 3pm. Subsequently, the excise department clarified that off-shops, too, could open in the afternoon slot. Since May 16, only home delivery of liquor was allowed. A businessman, who has multiple liquor off-shops in the city, pointed out home delivery had not been a very lucrative option for them as logistics was a major problem if individual establishments had to reach the goods home. “Most leading apps have withdrawn themselves from home delivery of liquor. The only major player who is doing e-commerce of liquor is Swiggy and another one. Sale from home delivery is not even 20% of our counter sale on a normal day,” he said. Echoing him, another retailer pointed out that average daily business in an off-shop was Rs 2 lakh-Rs 2.5 lakh, which even rose to Rs 4 lakh a day in some neighbourhoods but home delivery meant only 15%-20% of that amount. There are 350 bars, along with over 1,500 off-shops and country spirit shops (CS shops too now allowed to sell IMFL) in Kolkata only. The total figure in Bengal is be more than 7,000, taking both bars and off-shops together. Officials of Bevco, the state beverages corporation, said they had adequate stocks in most of their warehouses as liquor sales had been down for the past two weeks. “We have enough warehouse stock for 14-15 days,” an official said. There are 21 Bevco warehouses in Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/off-shop-liquor-sale-resumes-after-2-weeks-of-home-delivery/articleshow/83154115.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Users claim browser plugins cracking CoWin, govt says impossible||There are many web browser plugins or extensions now that claim to “automate” slot bookings on CoWin. Cybersecurity experts said these programmes have an obvious and unfair advantage over humans trying to book slots “the normal way”. The health ministry has rejected the possibility of automated bookings, insisting that CoWin OTP and Captcha cannot be bypassed. But many users who’ve tried these plugins are now claiming in social media posts that they helped get vaccine slots — even filling the Captcha code before booking. The Captcha code was introduced by the Centre to ensure a human, and not an automated programme, is booking slots. Sumit Kar, a Kolkata-based software developer, said newly circulated browser extensions by some developers are decoding the Captcha code on CoWin, without any human intervention. “On CoWin, the Captcha is generated with SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) which has the information of the actual Captcha that needs to be entered. This is how developers have been able to decode it. A bot would take less than a microsecond to decode and enter the correct Captcha. For a human, it would take at least 20 seconds,” said Kar. In Pune, a user said a browser extension let him book a slot without human intervention. “It automated everything, even entering the Captcha code. It booked a slot for me,” the user said. Hospitals in Pune said these extensions or programmes may be the reason why their slots are being booked within seconds. “It seems there are users who have automated bulk bookings. There’s no other way to explain how 300 slots are getting booked within seconds,” said Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic. Bhote said the state should allow walk-ins for the 18-44 group with appointment slots every two hours. “We have high demand from corporates, but they are not getting slots,” he said. An official from the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management to combat Covid-19 said reports of apps automating vaccination bookings are “anecdotal and bogus”. “We have been monitoring IP addresses from where bookings are being done. We can say with confidence that such things are not happening. When you have high demand and short supply of vaccines, slots are bound to go within microseconds. There are numerous people trying to book slots simultaneously, with the CoWin portal recording 45,000 concurrent hits per second. If there are 10 slots open at a time, how many microseconds would it take to be booked?” he asked. RS Sharma, head of the CoWin platform, had earlier said (in a PIB statement) the system has undergone meticulous security testing. “No scripts can bypass OTP verification and Captcha to automatically register an individual,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/users-claim-browser-plugins-cracking-cowin-govt-says-impossible/articleshow/83156740.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Pandemic stalls bus rollout plan in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Early last year, before Covid-19 made its presence felt in Delhi, the city’s public transport system silently reached a milestone. After a decade of a constant dip in strength, the number of public transport buses breached the 6,000-mark and, in fact, went beyond the highest recorded in 2010. Delhi has 6,752 buses at present, including 3,762 in the Delhi Transport Corporation’s fleet and 2,990 in the Cluster Scheme. Delhi needs 11,000 buses to meet the public demand and Delhi government has been trying to boost the numbers to that. The exponential growth of Covid cases compelled Delhi government to impose a lockdown from April 19, which continues with some relaxations made from Monday. This has also put a brake on the steady move towards the target of 11,000 buses. “Due to the second Covid wave, not only in Delhi but everywhere across the country, many services linked to the delivery of buses were affected,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “During the lockdown, the delivery of buses and all other work related to infrastructure development like bus depots was affected. We will now try to restore the pace as early as possible.” This summer was expected to be slightly more comfortable for bus commuters in Delhi with the first lot of DTC’s 1,000 air-conditioned and low-floor buses expected to hit the streets by May. But the delivery of these buses will have to wait for some time now. Gahlot said the first lot of 40 CNG-run buses that DTC was scheduled to receive on May 7 also did not make the deadline due to the resurgent pandemic and the resultant lockdown. The current lockdown is also going to affect the delivery of electric buses for the DTC fleet, along with the creation of supporting infrastructure such as charging stations at designated bus depots. On March 26, the Delhi cabinet had approved the procurement of 300 low-floor electric AC buses by DTC. As per the schedule, 118 buses were to arrive in October, 100 by November and 60 buses were planned to be inducted by December this year. The remaining 20 buses were likely to arrive by January 2022. The new vehicles were to be parked at depots in Subhash Place, Mayapuri, Rohini, Rajghat and Mundela Kalan. “Now, the delivery of electric buses for DTC and the supporting infrastructure will also get delayed by around one to one and a half months,” Gahlot said. The plan to induct 2,000 more buses in the Cluster Scheme fleet has also been hit by the rising infections. Out of a total of 1,000 low-floor, air-conditioned buses being bought under the scheme, only 311 are operational and 89 more buses that were expected to arrive by March will now arrive in the next two months, sources said. There are plans to induct 1,000 electric buses under the cluster model by September and sources said the bidding process for their procurement was currently on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pandemic-stalls-bus-rollout-plan/articleshow/83187308.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Dehradun||One report, many patients: Forged Covid reports in Uttarakhand’s hospital||DEHRADUN: For at least two months coinciding with the second wave, several fake Covid-19 test reports have been emerging from Uttarakhand’s largest government hospital, the Government Doon Medical College (GDMC). Those creating the reports appear to be fishing out legitimate Covid-19 test results from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) test portal, changing names of patients and then passing them off. On May 25, Binaya Kumar Prusti’s report said he had tested positive for Covid-19. But something was off, Dr KC Pant, chief medical superintendent at GDMC observed. The report said the test was for “SARD-CoV-2”, not “SARS-CoV-2”. The QR code, mandated by the ICMR in every test report, was missing. When he sent the report for verification, it turned out the sample for the original test report belonged to a man, 21, who got tested at Bandarwadi in Maharashtra. Many more inconsistencies were flagged. “It is clear that the report in question of one Mr Binaya Kumar Prusti … is fake/forged,” the report from the department of microbiology at GDMC said. A limited number of people at every testing lab and hospital have access to the ICMR website where Covid-19 test results are updated. Each report has three IDs — ICMR ID, SRF (Specimen Referral Form) ID and patient ID. These can’t be manipulated on the portal, nor can the test result. “But it is possible to change the name, age and gender after a report is uploaded,” a senior doctor at GDMC told TOI. Prusti’s case turned out to be one among many. TOI accessed several such reports which had replicated original ones and just changed the name. Like one issued to Chandramohan Paliwal, 57, which was actually one that belonged to Vipin Raturi, 27. It was exactly the same with a report for Deepak Singh, 41, which was created by manipulating the report based on samples from Kamal Singh, 53. Another fake report, for Vidhi Tiwari, 25, had changed the name of the person whose test report it was, Sulexana Singh, 42, but retained her phone number. There are two possible ways this could be working. People might be asking for fake reports. A fake negative Covid-19 report could allow someone to travel, appear for exams or resume work. Likewise, a fake positive Covid-19 report could be used to file medical claims or leave applications. The other possibility is that private labs are collecting samples, charging money, sending them over to GDMC where a fake report is being generated without conducting the test. The hospital’s senior doctors admitted to “irregularities” and added that an internal investigation has been conducted. “The complicity of hospital staff is being suspected because several fake reports had forged signatures of lab staff members,” one of them said. “Besides, access to the ICMR portal is restricted to a few.” Another senior doctor at GDMC told TOI that the lab authorities and a committee set up for the investigation of illegally collected Covid-19 samples have sent “three letters” to the principal, Dr Ashutosh Sayana, but no action has been taken. Sayana said, “I am aware of the matter … We just want to be doubly sure from our side. Also, as the staff of the hospital are government employees, we need to speak to the government before taking any step.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/one-report-many-patients-forged-covid-certs-in-top-ukhand-hosp-scam/articleshow/83152981.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Goa||Scheme for Class X assessment fixed by Board, results on Jul 13||Panaji: The Goa Board has announced its final scheme for tabulation of Class X results — based on internal assessment marks — after the public exam for 2021 was cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic. The Board has given schools time up to June 6 to form the institute’s ‘result committee’, and the results will be declared by the Board on July 13. As reported by TOI on May 31, the assessment will be carried out giving weightage to the students’ performance at the first and second formative exams conducted by the schools during the academic year 2020-21. Some weightage will also go to preliminary or any other term-end test conducted by the school, besides weightage given to the students’ performance in Class IX. The Board has said that if a student was absent for any of these internal assessments, the schools can conduct an online, offline or telephonic assessment one-on-one. Webinars to help school teachers understand the marking scheme for Class X will be conducted taluka-wise on Wednesday and Thursday. The Board has said that all schools should seal the records of the candidates and keep them under the safe custody of the school headmaster. It has said it may depute a team to verify the documents and the process of allocation of marks. As reported earlier by TOI, the schools will compare the marks allotted to students with the institute’s historical performance to ensure moderation. Over the past three years, the year the overall average marks scored by candidates in a school were the highest will serve as reference. The Board has said that marks allotted to Class X 2021 students should not deviate by plus or minus four marks from this reference year. The Board said that once results are declared, each school will conduct either an objective-type online or offline supplementary exam, based on the sample question papers provided by the Board The six teachers who will be part of the institute result committee should be well aware of the academic performance of the candidates, and one external teacher can be co-opted on the committee, the Board has said. “While co-opting teachers, the following should be strictly ensured for the fairness of the result: Teachers should be teaching Class X in another school recognised by the Board. No interchange of teachers as committee members between two schools. Any other relationship which may influence the result of the school/candidate. Close relative of committee member(s) should not be appearing from the same school,” the Board said. The facility of ATKT (allowed to keep terms) will be given to unsuccessful candidates in Class X for the academic year 2021-22. Also, any candidate not satisfied with the marks allotted will be given an opportunity to appear for an exam to be held by the Board or the school when “conditions are conducive”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scheme-for-class-x-assessment-fixed-by-board-results-on-jul-13/articleshow/83156712.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Dehradun||YouTube comments led to biggest raids for wildlife trafficking in a year||Dehradun: The trail that led to wildlife traffickers in several successful operations this year had an unusual origin — YouTube comments. In at least five operations, pangolins and tiger skins were seized over the past one year by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network India by following tip-offs received from YouTube. TRAFFIC India, the wildlife trade monitoring network that works in collaboration with WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), has also been on the trail of these offenders.Videos of “pangolins for sale” have long been shared on YouTube. A YouTube video posted shows a pangolin being led around by a string. The camera closes in on a piece of paper showing a date. Then the pangolin is stuffed in a bag and weighed. A comment below says “interested”. Another video from an active YouTube channel ‘DF Bhoot’, with 3.5k subscribers, shows someone doing an “electricity test” on a pangolin – a power tester is used to nudge a pangolin and it lights up. It is a common gimmick to draw customers. The subject reads “tester wala Bajar kit, call me at xxxx”. Videos alone don’t lead to much. So, WCCB volunteers go over the comments for clues that may lead to the identity of potential buyers. Sometimes, it doesn’t take much — buyers and sellers leave their numbers in comments. “One comment led us to a group of traffickers in Tinsukia (Assam). On February 18, we seized seven Chinese pangolin skins and one live Chinese pangolin from a hotel,” said HV Girisha, joint director, WCCB. Girisha said a team worked for weeks trying to get in touch with those who commented, tracked down the kingpin and then on February 18, a joint enforcement team of the WCCB and the Assam forest department caught two people, seven Chinese pangolin skins and one live Chinese pangolin from their possession in a hotel. It was the biggest recovery of this year. However, animal trafficking on platforms like YouTube and Facebook is not new and perpetrators have learnt to remove all traces of the crime on the ground. To counter this, the WCCB has launched “WILD NET”, a program designed to track and check illegal animal trading online. Any suspicious activity online would send alerts to enforcement agencies in the country. Girisha said that they also spread awareness among e-commerce platforms on how to detect online animal trafficking. Pangolins remain one of the most sought-after mammals in the international wildlife body parts trade. Pangolin meat is consumed for its high protein content and the scales are used to prepare medicinal pastes or as ornaments or gift items. Also, the demand for live pangolins has increased over the years. “It is an increasing trend. Pangolins caught live are used for sacrificial or occult purposes. Out of every 10 pangolins related seizures, at least two to three are found to involve live animals,” said Saket Badola, head of TRAFFIC India. From the fact that the business has shifted largely online, it can be said that mostly youths, who tend to be tech savvy, are involved, Badola said, adding easy transfer of money had made it easy for traffickers. Earlier, simply following the cash would lead to a culprit, but that is not the case anymore. “With so many channels to transfer money, it has become difficult to follow the network of traffickers,” said Badola. In 2019, TRAFFIC in collaboration with MOEFCC organised a meeting with online platforms like Google, Facebook, YouTube and e-commerce sites like IndiaMart and Flipkart to ensure that their platforms are not used for trading protected species. “Another meeting of various stakeholders is scheduled for early July,” said Badola. YouTube, in an official statement, said, “We take the safety of our online community very seriously. YouTube’s policies prohibit graphic violence and animal abuse and we will quickly remove flagged content and terminate channels of repeat offenders.” Found across Asia and Africa, the eight various species of pangolin are tagged under the “vulnerable” to “critically endangered” species under the IUCN. Meanwhile, scientists at Wildlife Institute of India (WII) suggested that a population estimation of the pangolins be done to enable better monitoring of the species. “All eight species of pangolins are vulnerable to poaching and with a surge in online trading of pangolins there, there is an increased need to protect this small mammal. In India, at present, most of the trade is concentrated in central and southern India,” said Dr Sandeep Gupta, senior scientist, Wildlife Institute of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/youtube-comments-led-to-biggest-raids-for-wildlife-trafficking-in-a-year/articleshow/83153013.cms||Ishita Mishra

For the 18-44 age group, Delhi has received 8,17,000 doses of the vaccine, out of which 8,15,000 have already been used up. For 45+, 30,000 Covaxin doses for the second dose and 3,82,000 doses of Covishield are available, which would last for the next 18 days, Atishi stated in a press conference. “On June 1, a total of 53,382 vaccine doses were administered in Delhi. Out of this, 33,488 were first doses and 16,894 second doses. In Delhi, a total of 54,60,010 doses of vaccine have been administered. There are more than 42 lakh such people who have been administered the first dose of the vaccine and 12,41,000 people have received both the doses,” Atishi said. “Even now, the youngsters are being administered the vaccines only in the private hospitals and this is a matter of concern. All those who got vaccinated in May will soon have to take the second dose. But because of the unavailability of vaccines, this has become a matter of concern as to how they will be administered the second dose of the vaccine,” Atishi stated. She urged the central government to provide the vaccines at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/only-2000-vaccines-left-for-18-44-age-group-aap/articleshow/83187326.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Petitioner may contest SSC scoring: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Tuesday granted a petitioner the liberty to amend his PIL to challenge the new evaluation formula for SSC exams. HC also asked the petitioner who has challenged the Maharashtra government’s decision to cancel Class X board exams whether he wants it to pass orders contrary to the state’s and permit the exams, given the apprehension that children could get infected with Covid-19 in the “third wave”. The bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni asked the petitioner: “You want exams to be held. Do you think the Covid situation this year is better than last year? The state has said that the current environment is not conducive for conducting examinations. Can we substitute the decision saying that the situation is fine and say that it is conducive to hold exams?” The state had announced an evaluation formula for Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exams for Class X. HC asked the petitioner, Pune-based retired professor Dhananjay Kulkarni, to present substantial grounds against the state’s decisions at the next hearing on June 3. Kulkarni’s advocate Uday Warunjikar said five affidavits were filed so far and a compilation would be made and submitted before HC on the next date. On May 28, the state government announced nearly 16 lakh students will be evaluated through an internal assessment formula for the academic year 2020-21. The state said admissions to Class XI will be conducted physically via CET. Those unwilling to appear for it will be admitted on the basis of Class X marks. An additional affidavit stated there was the “threat of a third wave” in July or August, which, according to medical experts, may affect children between 10 and 18 years of age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-petitioner-may-contest-ssc-scoring-in-mumbai/articleshow/83153026.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu government gives ‘all pass’ for students of Classes I to VIII||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu government has decided to grant ‘all pass’ to students of Classes I to VIII for the current academic year. The state had earlier issued orders to promote students of Classes IX to XI, citing the Covid-19 pandemic. In a circular issued to chief educational officers on Monday, director of elementary education M Palanisamy said headmasters should enter ‘all pass’ in registers based on Right to Education (RTE) Act. “As per Section 16 of the RTE Act, no child shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till the completion of elementary education. Based on the act, all students studying in all types of schools should be declared pass. The chief education officers should give the necessary directions through email and phone to headmasters,” the circular said. The directive said the date for reopening of schools would be announced after the end of the lockdown. The announcement on distributing books and welfare schemes, too, would be announced later. Chief minister M K Stalin and school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi held a meeting on Tuesday on Class XII exams. Meanwhile, principals wanted the school education department to come out with modalities for awarding marks for Class X students. After cancelling the Class X boards, the school education department is yet to come out with modalities for awarding marks. “Last year, marks were awarded based on quarterly and half-yearly exams. But due to the pandemic, half-yearly and quarterly exams could not be conducted for the current batch. But class tests have been conducted. The state government may award marks to Class X students based on the performance of students in half-yearly and quarterly exams of Class IX and annual exam of Class VIII and can give some weightage to class tests,” said G J Manohar, principal, MCC Higher Secondary School, Chetpet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-govt-gives-all-pass-for-students-of-classes-i-to-viii/articleshow/83154120.cms||---
---||Delhi||Home delivery of alcohol: Delhi can’t wait, but more clarity needed||NEW DELHI: The L13 and 13F licences for home delivery of alcohol were incorporated in Delhi Excise Rules in 2010. Yet they were never ‘actioned’ by the authorities and remained forgotten to the extent that the excise department’s website, in its list of licences, leaps from licence 12 to 14 without a mention of 13. But with Delhi Excise (Amendment) Rules 2021 notified in the gazette on Tuesday, the provisions for home delivery of alcohol through apps or websites became hot topics through the day. TimesViewThis is a win-win decision. At a time when the economy has shrunk due to the outbreak, this Covid-appropriate and gender-friendly move will certainly help boost the economy and shore up revenues of the Delhi government.Drink lovers started browsing the net on how soon they would be able to order their brews and spirits with their groceries. Restaurateur Rahul Singh asked people not to expect home delivery straight away, saying the excise department had to now issue terms and conditions for these licences and invite fresh bids from retailers. It will be some time, said Singh, before the tech aspects and licensing processes were finalised. The consumers are excited yet confused about the rules. Communications professional Sahir Seth said he would like some clarity on where and how to buy bottles, while Neha Bahl said ordering in alcohol was a better option than lining up outside the vend. Most consumers hope the new policy is implemented quickly because the local liquor vends are still not the most consumer friendly spots and there is still a stigma attached to alcohol shopping. Suresh Menon, secretary general, ISWAI, a representative body of multinational alcoholic beverage companies, commended Delhi government for its “foresight”. He said if implemented, this measure would allow a consumer to choose from an array of products and have them home delivered. He cited Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as examples of good implementation of the delivery system. Menon also allayed fear that a big company might swamp the smaller retailers. He pointed out that alcohol brands carry state specific licences and registrations and can be only delivered by locals within a state. Supply will remain in the hands of local retailers, only delivery can be outsourced, he said. What really enthused restaurateurs about the amended excise policy was not the home-delivery possibility but the permissions to serve bottles on table, use open areas on their premises, set up more than one alcohol counter and pay the licence fee based on space rather than number of covers. Takeaway of draught beer from microbreweries is another positive news for many. Dinesh Arora of Unplugged Courtyard expressed happiness that he would now be able to use his restaurant’s open spaces for events without needing separate daily licences. Restaurants can operate without fear and the policy will transform Delhi’s food and nightlife, he said, adding that the industry was eagerly awaiting the official announcements on reduction of drinking age to 21 from 25 and the extension of operating hours till 3am. Hotelier Ankur Bhatia said the amendment, if implemented well, would make Delhi a benchmark state for food and beverage policies. Hoteliers need multiple licences for various aspects of alcohol selling in restaurants, he said, and many concepts frequently become non-starters due to licensing issues. Some restaurateurs expressed concerns as well. They said that if home delivery of alcohol was allowed, people wouldn’t step out to have drinks in a club or restaurant because of the higher rates there. One restaurateur also wondered how the fee based on area rather than number of covers was beneficial since the licence rate would go up for every restaurant by a few lakh. He wished Delhi government had waived off the fee for this quarter to ease the burden on Covid-hit restaurant owners. National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) that had been involved in deliberations proceeding the policy amendment, termed the new excise rules as path breaking and expressed confidence that these measures will revolutionise the liquor trade in Delhi."This new excise policy notified by the Delhi Govt will significantly unshackle the F&B business and also help improve the consumer sentiments in the post-pandemic era. This policy will become a benchmark for other states to follow in coming days," NRAI said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/happy-high-at-home-city-cant-wait-but-more-clarity-needed/articleshow/83156766.cms||Amin Ali
---||Kolkata||Students, online aggregators make beeline for College Street||Kolkata: Boipara flickered back to life on Tuesday, albeit from noon to 3pm, leaving both sellers and buyers happy. Though not too many people visited College Street on the reopening day, students were relieved as many were yet to get their new text and reference books and stationery. E-commerce aggregators, who had taken online orders but were unable to deliver books as shops and godowns had been shut, picked up their consignments, pushing up sales to 40% of normal business. After the state allowed all retail stores, including of books and stationery, to function for three hours in the afternoon, owners started making arrangements to bring back a skeletal percentage of employees, who will now stay inside shops and godowns till June 15. In some cases, staff members have offered to down from their homes as far as Barrackpore and Sonarpur, when their employers offered to pay them a daily allowance. Katha O Kahini, which has five shops on College Street, ferried back 40 out of 300 employees in cars. “We have space, where we have arranged for their stay. We will provide for food. We are happy to be able to open shutters again,” said Debraj Patra, spokesperson for the brand. Dey’s Publishing has brought back 10 employees and housed them in the shop, as has Patra Bharati. “We have space in our press. We ferried some employees from as far as Mograhat. Some are pooling in to come to work,” said Tridib Chatterjee, who heads Patra Bharati. Rahul Roy, who lives in Sheoraphuli, will travel by toto to Bally, from where his colleague, Manas Chakraborty, will bring him to College Street on his bike. “We are happy and relieved to be back to work,” Rahul said. Some, like Yoges Tanna, who runs Mansi Publishing, was relieved his workers had reached on cycle, opened the shop to clean and re-stack. Some others, like Ashoke Burman, picked up two of his employees on his way to Family Book Shop on Park Street. Most stores spent a long time cleaning. They tied up with agencies that arrived at noon to sanitise the stores. Many wet books were brought out to dry in the sun on pavements of College Street, College Row and Bankim Chatterjee Street. The shops, however, did not get too many buyers the first day. Most were parents and students who went for reference books. One such was Anushka Koner, a Class XI student at La Martiniere for Girls. “Text books were delivered home. I had to buy reference books,” she said. Many owners of small stores across the city reached College Street to pick up stocks. “The ordering and procuring pattern has changed in the pandemic and there is a huge shift to online platform. The three-hour relaxation will help us meet the demand through aggregators,” Patra Bharati’s Chatterjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-online-aggregators-make-beeline-for-college-street/articleshow/83154123.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Ward 71 councillor Methi alleged that Khandelwal used political influence to stop construction of a drain near her house. Methi alleged that Khandelwal was opposing because a small ramp near her house had to be broken. “The drain of my ward is completely broken. I took up the matter and started construction of the three-feet covered drain that will be beneficial for the public. But Khandelwal stopped work using her political influence just because ramp of her house has to be broken.” Khandelwal refuted the allegations saying she asked them to manage the work properly instead of digging up roads in the middle of the pandemic. She said, “There is no need to do any work in my lane as during monsoon, our area is not flooded. But there is an urgent need to construct proper drains in Khajane Walon ka Raasta that gets flooded every year. I just told them to do their work systematically. My lane does not need any such development. Just before monsoon, road will be dug and will cause more inconvenience to the public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-councillor-former-mayor-clash-over-constructing-drain/articleshow/83156746.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Woman & lover kill husband, bury his body in Dahisar chawl kitchen||MUMBAI: A 27-year-old woman was detained on Tuesday for allegedly conspiring with her boyfriend and killing her husband, stuffing his body in a gunny bag and burying it in the kitchen of her Dahisar chawl. A fresh layer of cement on the kitchen tiles alerted police to the crime. At the time of filing the report, the police were digging up the kitchen floor to retrieve the body. Married for nine years, Shahida and Raees Shaikh (28) lived at Khan compound in Rawalpada with their two kids. On May 25, Shahida approached Dahisar police and complained that Raees, who was employed in a garment shop, had not returned from work. But, when police started making enquiries in Khan compound, a different picture emerged. They learned that Shahida was having an affair with one Amit Vishwakarma from the neighbourhood. Husband strangled as children sleptDahisar police on Tuesday detained Shahida Shaikh (27) for allegedly conspiring with her boyfriend, Amit Vishwakarma, and killing her husband Raees (28) and burying the body in the kitchen of her house in a Dahisar chawl. She filed a missing person’s complaint on May 25. Vishwakarma, a security guard, had vanished on the same day. When the police questioned Shahida, she gave evasive responses. “On Tuesday, a police team carried out an inspection of Shahida’s house and found it odd that some tiles of the kitchen were covered in a fresh layer of cement. When asked about it, Shahida stayed mum. The team then decided to pull out the tiles and examine the spot,” said additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant. After the initial digging, police found a huge hole in the ground. Shahida then allegedly admitted to the crime. “On May 22, after Raees reached home from work, Vishwakarma strangled him with a nylon rope with Shahida’s help. Her children were asleep at the time. The duo packed the body in a gunny bag, removed tiles in the kitchen, dug a hole and buried the body. They then replaced the tiles with cement,” said an officer. Shahida claims she had distracted her two children when they woke up due to the digging noise by plonking them in front of the TV and turning up the volume. But the police believe the children might be aware of the crime and could have been threatened into silence. The police are hunting for Vishwakarma. Shahida allegedly told investigators that the two were keen to live together and therefore plotted to eliminate her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/woman-lover-kill-husband-bury-his-body-in-dahisar-chawl-kitchen/articleshow/83158305.cms||Nitasha Natu

Civic officials blamed a shortage of doses and said the drive could be trimmed further on Wednesday. For the third day in a row, private vaccinations (37,934) exceeded doses administered in the public centres (8,999). A civic official said they are hoping to get some stocks on Wednesday. “In the past two instances, we have got doses in the range of 20,000 to 30,000, which is miniscule for over 200 centres,” the official said. “It is unfortunate people relying on free vaccine are not getting doses, but those willing to pay are able to get it.” Across Maharashtra, 2.6 lakh people took the vaccine on Monday, taking the overall doses administered to 2.4 crore. The state is hoping to get over 40 lakh doses this month, partly from the Centre and partly procured by itself. On the second day of the drive for students flying abroad, as many as 888 got vaccinated in the city. In the past two days, 1,875 students have taken the vaccine at the three dedicated centres of Cooper, Kasturba and Rajawadi hospitals. The BMC estimated around 2,000 students would be foreign-bound. On Tuesday, 244 lactating mothers also took the vaccine. In all, nearly 1,300 new mothers have taken the vaccine since it was allowed by the BMC last week after the Centre’s nod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaccination-down-44-pvt-jabs-almost-4-times-bmc-nos/articleshow/83156827.cms||---

Senior citizens can register themselves on the E-sathi App of UT police with their ID proof and RC. Police will deliver the stickers at their homes. Palak Goel, DSP Traffic (Admin) said the purpose of relaunching the stickers for senior citizens is to make other motorists aware that a senior citizen is driving so that they become all the more cautious. He said another purpose of the stickers is to protect them from incidents of road rage. Police will provide two stickers, to be pasted on the front and rear windscreen of the vehicles. Chandigarh has around 60,000 senior citizen drivers. Ram Murti, a senior citizen from Sector 32 welcomed the move of the traffic police and said, “We hope that on seeing these stickers on vehicles, motorists will be cautious while overtaking them or honking unnecessarily at them.” Chandigarh Traffic Police launched the special stickers for senior citizens in July 2009. The stickers would have the hologram of traffic police. Help for accident victims:A Mohali-based NGO, along with the traffic police, will provide assistance to accident victims and women, besides offering any kind of help needed by people in the tricity alongwith Chandigarh traffic police in and around the city. DSP traffic flagged off 100 drivers of the NGO on Tuesday. Luv Taneja, president of the NGO, I AM Zodian, said they have tied up with 100 cab drivers and would provide all kinds of assistance to the road users of any age group in Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula.

---||Delhi||BJP-led civic bodies in financial mess due to corruption: Sisodia||NEW DELHI: Ahead of the 2022 municipal elections, deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Wednesday slammed the BJP for mismanagement in civic bodies. All three municipal corporations of the capital are managed by the BJP and AAP is the main opposition party in all of them. Sisodia said that the corporations were in deep waters and blamed the BJP for it. “The municipal corporations are facing a big challenge. People have, for the last 20 years, voted for the BJP on the premise that they will improve school education, hospitals and other welfare facilities. Instead, the BJP has completely failed in its management. Their failure and mismanagement are incomparable. The corporations are facing one of the biggest challenges in their basic functioning,” Sisodia stated in a press conference. “This situation would not have arisen if the BJP had made dedicated efforts in managing the corporations,”he said. Sisodia stressed that the AAP government has continuously aided and supported the corporations beyond what was needed. “Since the AAP government came to power in Delhi, we have not even adjusted the loan or interest, loans were adjusted earlier. Despite this, the corporations are in a mess. No public establishment has ever been asked by the court to sell its property to pay employees, but under the BJP, this is what our municipal corporations have been asked to do. No local body has ever been asked to sell its property, its assets to pay its own employees,” Sisodia said. North and East Corporations are in deep financial mess. Sisodia said the financial mess was because of corruption. “In the last 20 years, BJP cannot point towards even a single ward in Delhi and claim that they have turned it into a ‘model ward’. Nobody knows where the money earmarked for corporations and their employees is going,” Sisodia stated. He further said that the funds given by Delhi government to the corporations were missing. “It is time for the BJP to take full responsibility for the sheer mess it has put the corporations into. It needs to accept that it has completely failed in managing the municipal corporations and the only solution is for the citizens of Delhi to vote the BJP out of the corporations. The BJP should accept that it has, in the last 20 years, driven the corporations to a level where now they may have to sell their property to pay salaries. It is absolutely condemnable,” Sisodia stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-led-civic-bodies-in-financial-mess-due-to-corruption-sisodia/articleshow/83187338.cms||AlokKNMishra

Due to increasing corona cases, the government cut short the strength of employees in the state level offices twice in the month of April. The strength of employees in government offices may further go up after June 15, if the corona remains in control. Officials said the strength of employees can be increased this month itself. As per the current orders, the offices will run with 50% capacity till June 15- the date when the government would review the situation after unlock from Tuesday and may announce more relaxations, if the corona cases continue to remain low. The government on April 11 ordered that only 25% of its class three and class four employees will attend the state-level offices during the corona curfew period on a rotation basis. The General Administration Department in its order also said that class 1 and class 2 officials will attend the offices in full strength. Cutting down the strength of employees further, the government on April 20 stated offices can operate with only 10% strength, barring the ones coming in most important services. Under the most important services, the state government kept the district collectorate, police, disaster management, fire, heath and medical education, jail, revenue, potable water distribution, urban administration, rural development, power supply, public transport and treasury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/govt-offices-open-with-50-staff-strength-may-go-up-by-june-15/articleshow/83154125.cms||---
---||Chennai||Alas, men have no domestic violence law: Madras high court||CHENNAI: Reinstating a suspended officer who had suffered cruelty and voluntary desertion by his wife, the Madras high court on Tuesday bemoaned the lack of legal provisions akin to the Domestic Violence Act for a husband to proceed against his wife. “The present generation must understand that marriage is not a contract, but a sacramental one. Of course, the word ‘sacrament’ has no meaning after coming into effect of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, that approves live-in-relationship,” observed Justice S Vaidyanathan on Monday. The case related to the suspension of Dr P Sasikumar by the director of animal husbandry and veterinary services in Chennai on the ground that he was “involved in a domestic issue” and on the basis of a complaint lodged by his estranged wife. However, Justice Vaidyanathan, pointing out that the domestic violence complaint was lodged by his wife just before the ruling in a long-drawn divorce case, said: “It appears that only to harass the petitioner, the present complaint has been lodged by his wife, based on which police initiated action and the department placed him under suspension.” The complaint was given four days prior to grant of divorce by the family court which clearly shows that the wife has anticipated divorce order and created unnecessary trouble to the petitioner, said the judge in his ruling. The divorce proceedings, initiated before a Salem court in 2015, ended with the divorce order in February 2020. Justice Vaidyanathan said there was no need for the department to place the petitioner under suspension, and ordered his reinstatement within 15 days. “As the case on hand is an exceptional one, this court interferes with the impugned order of suspension passed by the director of the department, and directs him to reinstate the petitioner in service within 15 days,” the judge said. Justice Vaidyathan then observed: “Husband and wife must realize that, ‘ego’ and ‘intolerance’ are like footwear and should be left out of their house, when they enter the home, else, the child/children will have to face a miserable life.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/alas-men-have-no-domestic-violence-law-hc/articleshow/83154184.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Jaipur||Lockdown relaxations mere eyewash: Traders||Jaipur: Traders are not happy with the new modified guidelines of the lockdown in which shops in market places have been allowed to open from 5am to 11am. According to the traders, this was just an eyewash as neither their staff nor customers will come so early. Thw state government has issued new guidelines for the lockdown in which the cities where the positivity rate is less than 10% can open shops from 5am to 11am. Groceries and vegetable shops have already been allowed to open, but this time other shopkeepers will be able to do some business. Kundan Lal Pathani, a shopkeeper in Walled City said, “Our staff will not be able to come so early in the morning. What kind of customer gets out to shop at 5am in the morning?” President of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal Subhash Goyal said the move will serve no purpose. “If the government really wants to help the businessmen who have suffered enough in the lockdown and pandemic, then timing should be made suitable. We have already asked to make open shops from noon to 5pm so that customers can visit the market.” Pandemic has broken the backbone of business in the city. With all the weddings and ceremonies cancelled just before the season, traders faced huge loses. Businessmen have been demanding to give them a window amidst lockdown to open their shops. Jaipur collector Antar Singh Nehra confirmed that shops will be opened from June 2, but changing the time will be a policy decision. “The positivity rate of Jaipur is lower than 10% from last week and so it will not be an issue to open the market, but changing the time will depend on the government. If the government approves, then we will definitely implement it,” said Nehra. President of Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh Chandra Mohan Khatri also supported the idea of opening the shops after 11 am.

---||Kolkata||Music video to raise funds for Cov||Kolkata: A city-based psychiatrist and a few musicians have come together to create a song and music video ‘Asha-Help India’ in collaboration with Grammy nominated Barbadian musician Shontelle and Sarkar Muzic from the US, to raise funds for oxygen concentrators and Covid vaccination for the underprivileged and poor in Kolkata. The music has already hit the top slot of a popular charity site. “I was completely rattled by the Covid deaths in the second wave and the gaps in our health infrastructure. There was severe crisis for beds. Deaths of people in Delhi and Mumbai because of lack of oxygen were heart-wrenching. I strongly felt that international community has a role to play here. That is when the idea of music came to my mind. Music transcends geographical boundaries and sends across the message,” said Dr Ranjan Ghosh, a psychiatrist, who used to run his clinic in the US. Ghosh coordinated with Vh1-Soundnation Award winner rapper Feyago, who is from Kolkata, Indian origin award winning rapper, producer, music director and songwriter Sarkar Muzic who lives in Detroit, Grammy nominated singer-songwriter Shontelle from Barbados and Joesjoint, a Bengali rapper from Kolkata. Together they produced ‘Asha-Help India’, a fundraising campaign dedicated to providing free vaccines, oxygen and healthcare support to the underprivileged in Kolkata. Feyago, who wrote the songs, says they were instantly liked by Shontelle and Sarak Muzic. “I was thrilled to collaborate with Shontelle, who is a legend. I was equally thrilled that they loved my lyrics,” said Feyago, who is writing two more songs for this charity campaign. The entire music was produced by Dr Ghosh’s Good Karma Foundation. Every artiste agreed to do it without charging a penny. Even a music video was done through a series of web conferences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/music-video-to-raise-funds-for-cov/articleshow/83154200.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Chandigarh||Online traffic goes up, so does online crime||Chandigarh: On an average, the cyber cell of UT Police received 16 complaints every day in the last 56 days of lockdown and night curfew during the second Covid wave in April and May this year. In 2020, there were around 6,300 complaints and 80 FIRs. Cyber cell data shows that 938 complaints related to monetary fraud, sending vulgar messages on phone, e-mail hacking and online cheating on the pretext of selling/buying goods through websites were received in April-May. The cell registered two FIRs and three persons were arrested for cheating between April 1 and May 26. This year, 2,327 complaints have been received and 9 FIRs have been registered. In the two months of lockdown this year, as many as 255 people were duped while making online transactions, through ATM/credit card cloning and after sharing PIN and other card details. Data shows that 167 persons lodged complaints alleging harassment, threats, abusive calls and messages on cellphone and social media accounts. With online shopping, cheating cases are also on the rise. A total of 153 cases of cheating, wherein complainants were conned while buying and selling products through OLX , Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were reported. Also, there were 142 complaints of hacking, fake accounts on social media and Gmail. Data shows that 73 residents were cheated on the pretext of providing jobs, winning online lotteries and providing online loans. According to cyber experts and cops, most of those who were duped after sharing OTP were inexperienced in using online wallets. “People should know that if they have not conducted any online transaction through their PayTM account, they cannot get an OTP. Those getting OTPs on cell phones should not share these with unknown callers,” said police. The cyber crime investigation cell arrested two brothers for duping a city resident of Rs 12 lakh from Jamtara, Jharkhand on April 11, 2021. In her complaint, Sunita Dewan, a resident of Sector 23 said she was not getting an SMS alert after withdrawing the money from her account. She searched the customer care number of her bank on Google and after some time, she received multiple calls from a mobile number. The caller claimed to be calling from the customer care of PNB. Dewan shared details of her ATM card number, PIN number and OTP with the caller. Later, Rs 11,93,699 was fraudulently withdrawn from her bank account. Recently , Haryana chief secretary Vijai Vardhan also filed a complaint with the cyber cell saying that some unknown person sent several vulgar and threatening messages on his WhatsApp number. The cyber cell is investigating the matter and no arrest has been made in the case so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/online-traffic-goes-up-so-does-online-crime/articleshow/83154156.cms||Pawan Tiwari

Ward 71 councillor Methi alleged that Khandelwal used political influence to stop construction of a drain near her house. Methi alleged that Khandelwal was opposing because a small ramp near her house had to be broken. “The drain of my ward is completely broken. I took up the matter and started construction of the three-feet covered drain that will be beneficial for the public. But Khandelwal stopped work using her political influence just because ramp of her house has to be broken.” Khandelwal refuted the allegations saying she asked them to manage the work properly instead of digging up roads in the middle of the pandemic. She said, “There is no need to do any work in my lane as during monsoon, our area is not flooded. But there is an urgent need to construct proper drains in Khajane Walon ka Raasta that gets flooded every year. I just told them to do their work systematically. My lane does not need any such development. Just before monsoon, road will be dug and will cause more inconvenience to the public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-heritages-congress-councillor-former-mayor-in-verbal-duel-over-constructing-drain/articleshow/83156824.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Held on November 10, 2015, the Sarbat Khalsa had appointed Jagtar Singh Hawara as its own jathedar of Akal Takht. As he was in prison, Dhian Singh Mand was made the officiating jathedar. On Tuesday, Hawara’s followers read out his message with regards to the 37th anniversary of Operation Bluestar in front of Akal Takht, while Mand’s followers announced that the officiating jathedar would deliver his message on June 6. Bhog of the akhand path was performed by members of the Hawara Committee (HC) at Gurdwara Baba Atal Rai Sahib, where on June 1, 1984, CRPF had first armed confrontation with Babbar Khalsa militants who were holed up in the gurdwara. “Jagtar Singh Hawara is the jathedar of Akal Takht and his message was read out by his father, Gurcharan Singh. Mand is an officiating jathedar, so the former’s message carries more weight and meaning,” said a member of Hawara Committee, Prof Baljinder Singh, while talking to TOI after the ceremony. He added only a handful of people were spreading the news of the announcement of delivery of the message by Mand. On the other hand, Jarnail Singh Sakhira, who claims to be the chief organiser of the Sarbat Khalsa, denied having any knowledge of Hawara’s message being read out. Hawara is lodged in Tihar jail at the moment. “I don’t know about their function, but the officiating jathedar of Akal Takht, Dhian Singh Mand, will deliver his message on June 6,” said Sakhira. Baljnder said he had asked the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to raise a healthcare centre dedicated to Babbar Khalsa militant Mehanga Singh and others who were killed by armed forces at Gurdwara Atal Rai Sahib. He said the expenses would be borne by the HC.

The man also flung the girl out of the train when she shouted for help but she was fortunate to suffer only a leg fracture and some other injuries. The incident took place between Satara and Lonand railway stations around 1.30am. The train had left from Vasco in Goa for Nizamuddin station in New Delhi. Pune railway police superintendent Sadanand Wayse-Patil said the girl’s father is a retired Navy man. The family comprising the girl, her parents and two sisters had boarded the train at Vasco for New Delhi. “Around 1.30 am, the accused, who is stationed at the army unit in Jhansi, picked up the girl while she was asleep and took her to the toilet. The girl shouted for help when the armyman tried to sexually assault her. He brought her out of the toilet and threw her out of the train. Fortunately, the train was proceeding at a slow speed since it was the ghat section and the girl survived,” Wayse-Patil said. Villagers found the girl and took her to a hospital, where she told the police about the incident. “After discussing with seniors, we stopped the train. The police got into the train and did not allow anyone to get down. By the time the train reached Jalgaon, we had identified the suspect who admitted to the crime,” Wayse-Patil said.

---||Delhi||BJP accuses AAP govt of financially crippling corpns||New Delhi: Delhi BJP members blamed the AAP government for “financially crippling the municipal corporations and defaming them by not providing their dues and outstanding funds”. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta, Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi on Wednesday alleged that Delhi government was not providing funds so that the civic employees remained unpaid and then resorted to strikes, which would eventually cripple the civic work. “Since 2015, AAP has been giving a step-motherly treatment to the municipal corporations, which continued even during the pandemic. According to the 3rd Delhi Finance Commission report, state was giving 16.5% share of taxes to the corporations, but the 5th commission has slashed it to 12.5%,” Gupta said, adding that even the mayors were forced to sit on protests outside the CM residence for funds, following which the matter reached the courts. Bidhuri said the government did not even help the civic body hospitals and its employees during the pandemic. “Of the eight corporation hospitals, six were engaged in Covid duty. The corporations were not even allowed to start various Covid services. Timely permission could have saved many lives,” claimed Bidhuri. Lekhi said even pensions to senior citizens or widows were not released, despite getting records from the corporations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-accuses-aap-govt-of-financially-crippling-corpns/articleshow/83187374.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Unlock hesistancy: Delhi opens, but can’t shut out fear||NEW DELHI: Abhishek Gulati, a 26-year-old engineer from Rohini, has been working from home for the best part of over a year. He initially found it tough to adjust to a home environment, but now hasn’t even stepped out for a month. Having lost his aunt and a cousin to Covid-19 in the resurgent wave of infections, Gulati craves the safety of home as he awaits his second vaccine dose. And though the lockdown is being relaxed, quite evidently, Gulati isn’t quite so enthusiastic about stepping out. This ‘unlock hesitancy’ also marks the reaction of a lot of Delhi’s citizens. “It’s better to get fully vaccinated before going out rather than risk being infected in the potential third wave,” philosophised Gulati. “While I do intend to go out eventually, my visits will be essential and restricted.” Swati Joneja, co-founder of Twirls and Thumkas, a concept choreography firm, shares a similar state of mind. The 30-year-old wasn’t inhibited by the risk in 2020, but her threat perception changed in the current round of infections after she contracted Covid in mid-March after returning from a wedding in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. To her relief, projects for weddings and other events got postponed after the lockdown. But despite restrictions being lifted gradually, she is hesitant about going out, especially travelling out of Delhi. “As far as travel goes, it’s scary because there are people I know and some in my family who lost their loved ones in the current wave. I got Covid in March despite all the precautions and self-imposed distancing, whether at work or during travel, so one can’t be certain,” Joneja said. “I have not been vaccinated either, so that has added to my worries, even if temporarily.” Counsellors and psychologists told TOI that many people had approached them with questions about survival, anxiety and fear of death after witnessing relatives and close friends dying in the second wave. Psychologist Tanya Anthwal said, “Many of us are facing challenges that can be stressful and cause strong negative emotions. People are getting caught up in anxieties related to perceived risks to loved ones and their health. After the second wave, with the rise in infection and mortality rate, the fear has triggered a lot of angst. Due to this, people are unable to think rationally.” Although social activities have been restricted in most states and almost all non-essential individual movements came to an end after the lockdown, the announcement of the reopening of the economy has led to a rising apprehension of this latent threat to life through the third wave swamping the city when recovery from the second wave itself hasn’t been completed. “People are, therefore, dreading a rapid escalation of new cases that will overwhelm the medical infrastructure,” said Anthwal. “This negative spiral is associated with feelings of hopelessness and they start asking themselves, ‘Will I be able to survive this?’" Raj Kumar Tarani, president of residents’ welfare association at the Janakpuri Block C-2, confirmed that people were not leaving their homes as they used to. He attributed their hesitancy to the fear from seeing their loved ones suffering after being infected or actually losing them during the coronavirus’s unbridled recent run. “Personally, I lost a dear friend, who had actually recovered from Covid but suffered a heart attack after coming home from the hospital,” said Tarani. “People in the colony have seen death from close quarters this time. This round of infections also showed up the lacunae in our healthcare system in the form of shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines. The outbreak of fungus infection is an added worry. With a fresh Covid wave a distinct possibility, people are being extra careful now.” In Dwarka, Sudha Sinha, general secretary of the Federation of Cooperative Group Housing Societies in Dwarka, felt that people were learning from the mistakes of last year. They will clearly not feel at ease or freed of mental stress until they and their family members are fully vaccinated. “Last year, as the infection started diminishing, people became overconfident and lax,” Sinha said. “We have learnt lessons from that experience and people are now more cautious, having lost many in the second wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unlock-hesistancy-city-opens-but-cant-shut-out-fear/articleshow/83154210.cms||Sakshi Chand

---||Delhi||Israel: Covid stands between Promised Land and 40 Manipuris||NEW DELHI: For over a hundred Bnei Menashe Jews from Manipur going to Israel, Covid-19 proved a damper. On Monday, hours before checking out from their Karol Bagh hotel for Indira Gandhi International Airport, 40 of them tested positive for Covid. They are currently at Guru Tegh Bahadur Covid Care Centre, managed by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. Officials at the Covid centre said the 40 comprised mostly mild cases. However, five were deemed to have severe infection, and Delhi government transferred them to Lok Nayak Hospital. Bhupinder Singh Bhullar, who is in charge of the Covid care centre, said the whole contingent comprised around 125 individuals, including nine children under 12 years. The Bnei Menashe, numbering nearly 10,000 members, live mostly in Manipur and Mizoram. The Bnei Menashe believe themselves to have descended from the Menasseh tribe, one of Israel’s protohistoric 12 tribes. In the past two decades, members of the Jewish community in India have gradually emigrated to Israel. “Being of Jewish descent, the group was planning to go to Israel to settle there. Under Israeli law, they are eligible for citizenship,” said Bhullar. “But when undergoing the compulsory test before taking an international flight, 40 of them had positive test results, and they were subsequently sent to our centre.” The group took their tests on May 28, but the results, including the positive ones, were received on May 30, the day of their flight. At the Covid care centre, Bhullar said the Manipuri Jews were keeping themselves entertained and were in high spirits, despite the disappointing turn their plans took. Those who tested negative did not leave India but stayed back and are quarantining in a hotel. Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president, DSGMC, said only three of the travellers spoke Hindi.

The union has decided to use 30% of the corpus meant for fest and entertainment on scholarships to assist these students. The university authorities have also agreed to the union’s demand on waiver of semester fees for students in financial distress. In addition, around 40% funds will be donated to the Institute of Child Health for the Covid treatment of children, so that it can augment its facilities for the next wave that some scientists predict will hit the children, said Debnil Paul, a post-graduate student of the university. “After the odd semester started last November, we had demanded that the university should consider refunding the semester fee to those students who are facing a severe financial crunch. The authorities had then accepted our demand and had initiated a process of refund. However, it was stalled because the campus had shut down. That refund process has been restarted. We had placed a similar request for the current semester. The university has accepted to extend the same facility of fee-waiver for even-semester students who meet the criteria,” informed Paul. University registrar Debajyoti Konar said, the concern of the students’ council has been discussed at a meeting of Students Welfare Board and three recommendations were made. These were approved by the competent authorities for implementation. Earlier in April, the Presidency University students had come together in the hour of crisis and had opened a page on social media where the real-time update of available hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, medicines, oxygen equipment was uploaded after after being verified by the students. Students involved with the project said the initiative was taken to reduce the hassle that patients and their families were facing at the time by offering all relevant information on a single window. “We understood that it is the need of the hour and patients together with their family members were running pillar to post to find beds and other relevant information. Thus, we started the initiative so that the page would help them as we were personally verifying the information before being updated,” a student pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-a-first-presidency-fest-money-goes-for-cov-relief/articleshow/83154289.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Chandigarh||Justice for sacrilege or stir: SAD (A) to Pb govt||pix —members of panthic organisation Bathinda: The Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) has given the Punjab government a month to deliver justice in cases of sacrilege and associated deaths in police firing or face an Insaf Morcha protest of the Panthic organisations from July 1. The last Insaf Morcha was by Sarbat-Khalsa-appointed jathedar Dhian Singh Mand on June 1, 2018, at Bargari, site of a sacrilege incident. It was lifted after two ministers from the cabinet of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh went over to the protesters and promised to fulfil their demands. The Panthics accused the previous Akali-BJP and present Congress government of failing to catch those behind sacrilege and the killing of two protesters in Behbal Kalan police firing. The Panthics assembled at the gurdwaras of Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala on Tuesday to observe a repentance day six years after the theft of a Bir of Guru Granth Sahib (reported on June 1, 2015). SAD (A) president Simranjit Singh Mann, Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) president Baljit Singh Daduwal, United Akali Dal president Gurdeep Singh Bathinda, and farmer agitation supporter Deep Sidhu assembled at Bargari, while the SAD (Sanyukt) team of Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and Ranjit Singh Brahmpura gathered at Gurdwara Burj Jawahar Singh. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) held prayers at Burj Jawahar Singh. At Bargari, the Panthics called for Khalistan once again. SAD (A) president Simranjit Singh Mann said: "We are ready for a morcha for justice from July 1, if justice doesn’t come by then. The SIT (special investigation team) has the statements of witnesses already and there is no need to get these again. If the government is willing, it can arrest all the accused and file a charge sheet in a few days." HSGMC president Baljit Singh Daduwal: "Sikhs can’t wait endlessly for justice. They trusted the pledge taken by Amarinder Singh but his government acted like the SAD. Arrest whoever is guilty and we’ll support the SIT." UAD’s Gurdeep Singh regretted how the SAD (A) had blamed his party for fate of the last morcha led by Mand. The parties had heated arguments in the sanctum sanctorum of the Bargari gurdwara in the presence of Guru Granth Sahib until Deep Sidhu intervened. Gurdeep Singh made just a short address, later, in protest. Deep Sidhu said: "We don’t know who our enemy is. The Sikh leadership, except Mann, has lost its clear vision of the 18th century." SAD (Sanyukt) president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa said: "The Congress will pay a heavy price for deceiving us." Ex-MPs Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and Balwant Singh Ramoowalia had similar views.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/justice-for-sacrilege-or-stir-sad-a-to-pb-govt/articleshow/83158285.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||After fighting terrorists, Cheetah fights Covid-19||NEW DELHI: Chetan Kumar Cheetah, a CRPF commandant who sustained multiple bullet injuries in a gun battle with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017 and survived, is battling for life after testing Covid-positive. Dr Sushma Bhatnagar, chairperson of Covid services at National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jhajjar, Haryana, which is run by AIIMS, told TOI that the next 48 hours were critical. “He is currently on ventilator. In addition to anti-viral therapy, we are administering antibiotics to treat the secondary bacterial infection. Also, he requires medicines to maintain the blood pressure,” she said. Cheetah was commanding officer (CO) of CRPF’s 45th battalion in Kashmir Valley in February 2017 when he suffered multiple bullet injuries in the brain, right eye, abdomen, both arms, left hand and in the buttock region, while fighting the terrorists. The doctors at AIIMS Trauma Centre performed multiple surgeries to save him then. They first stabilised him and then different teams operated separately — ophthalmologists took care of the wound in the left eye, but the right one couldn’t be repaired, orthopaedics worked on the fracture in the limbs, while critical care experts planned antibiotic therapy to prevent infection. He was discharged in April 2017, and in 2018 he went back to duty. The Government of India awarded him with the Kirti Chakra — the second highest peacetime gallantry medal. “He is a fighter. We are hopeful he will bounce back to recuperate from the critical stage again,” said a doctor posted at NCI Jhajjar. Cheetah was rushed to AIIMS on May 9 with complaints of low oxygen saturation after testing positive. Initially, he was kept in the ICU on oxygen support. The doctors said his condition had improved with anti-viral therapy, but there was a sudden deterioration on Sunday. “We are doing everything possible, but he remains critical,” one of the doctors said. “We have a group of doctors and nurses. It is heartening to see them talk about saving the life of the CRPF commandant, who fought for the country,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-fighting-terrorists-cheetah-fights-covid-19/articleshow/83187407.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Delhi||The resurrection: Uprooted tree can be saved if it is replanted at same location||NEW DELHI: A beautiful mango tree (Mangifera indica) on Barda Ukil Marg separating Pandara Road and Shah Jahan Road in central Delhi was among the several casualties after Monday night’s squall. Within a few hours New Delhi Municipal Council officials, with NGO Greencircle of Delhi, went to work, pruning the top half of the fallen tree, pulling it upright and replanting the tree at the same spot. Uprooted trees can be saved even a week after falling down if they are re-erected at the same spot and provided adequate care, according to experts. Armed with this information, NGOs are taking the lead in replanting such trees given the red tape over jurisdiction and responsibility that civic agencies usually indulge in. Suhas Borker, founding member of Greencircle of Delhi, which assists NDMC in resurrecting fallen trees, revealed that 30-40 fallen trees at Lodhi Gardens have been reinstated and show a high survival rate. “The early hours are crucial, but the staff now knows what to do when a tree falls down. Once you pull the tree upright, it just needs support to stay like that for a good period along with care and watering,” said Borker. Verhaen Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society, recalled how his organisation was able to successfully give new life to a fallen pilkhan tree in New Friends Colony last year. “An early window is important, but with the right care, a tree can resume growth even after some days after falling down. In most cases, however, people are unsure or unaware that a fallen tree can still Jbe saved if it is replanted at the same spot,” said Khanna. However, the fallen tree will not grow at a foreign location if transplanted. New Delhi Nature Society recently published the standard operating procedures on how to save fallen trees. The process starts with pruning the higher branches to reduce the weight, removing the concrete around the tree, which weakens the roots, and using fresh soil, manure and termite repellent before an earthmover or crane lifts the tree upright back in its place. Temporary support in the form of pillars or a small wall may be required for a month or two. The tree then needs to be watered regularly. People often have problems dealing with fallen trees due to an unhelpful forest department or because they don’t know the land-owning agency. “If the tree is on a PWD road, then we have to approach PWD. If there are electric wires involved, then BSES or Tata Power may have to be called. In several cases, the municipal corporation has helped us, though the forest department doesn’t usually help with replanting of trees,” said Khanna. Among the trees that have been successfully saved in the last five years include a peepal and sheesham tree in New Friends Colony and a goolar and pilkhan tree in Maharani Bagh. With agencies often passing the buck, it took nearly two weeks for residents of Dwarka’s sector-6 to re-erect a fallen Banyan Tree, stating while they did call the forest helpline, they received no assistance. Finding private cranes and earthmovers also took several days, owing to limited construction activity taking place. The tree had fallen after the storm of May 19. “The tree weighs over 20 tonnes alone and so it was difficult to get labour to tie the tree and pull it back up. We had been watering the tree daily so it could stay alive and finally we were able to get two cranes and an earthmover on Tuesday morning to put it back in its place. Fresh soil was brought in too and now it is stable,” says Gaurav Sharma, a Dwarka resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-resurrection-uprooted-tree-can-be-saved-if-it-is-replanted-at-same-location/articleshow/83154472.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Bhopal||Covid curfew extended in Damoh till June 7, traders stage protest||Bhopal: Traders in Damoh are protesting against the administration, which extended the corona curfew till June 7. They said, shops have been closed down for more than 40 days and lockdown was delayed in Damoh due to elections held on April 17, leading to greater spread of the virus. They said why should they continue to suffer when a large part of the state has already been opened up. After the district crisis committee meeting decided to extend the curfew till June 7, Damoh traders raised strong objections to this decision. Led by the MLA Ajay Tondon, they met district collector SK Chaitanya on Monday to voice their anguish. In Hata tehesil of Damoh, over 200 traders took out a rally shouting slogans against the administration and the state government. They urged the administration to allow them to open the shops and submitted a memorandum to sub divisional magistrate of Hata . “ We are under tremendous financial stress as there has been no business for the last 40 days”, they said. Traders said, the monsoon is fast approaching and there would be a decline in business activities during the rainy season. Traders also said that if the markets are opened sooner, they could at least get some business related to weddings. But the administration refused to open the markets earlier, saying the coronavirus positivity rate is above the desired level in the district. Traders lamented, when the entire state was in lockdown in April, Damoh was witnessing the bypoll procedure. “At that time we demanded a lockdown, but the government was more interested in elections leading to a rise in corona cases,” traders said. According to the government record, over160 people have died of coronavirus in Damoh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-curfew-extended-in-damoh-till-june-7-traders-stage-protest/articleshow/83154288.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

The complaint was filed on Monday evening following instructions from senior police officers. The funeral procession of cleric Rifat Ahmed, who died of a heart attack on Monday, was attended by over 1,500 people from his residence at Paharganj to Maulana Ziauddin Shrine in Char Darwaja. Khan was also present at the funeral despite strict restrictions in place. “Other than Khan, two family members of the deceased and eight others have named in the FIR. They have violated the Covid protocol and investigation will be held as per the epidemic Act,” ACP Ajay Pal Lamba said. Being an elected representative, Khan’s presence had only encouraged people to attend the funeral, said a local police officer, who believed that the MLA could have convinced people to not attend the procession. Two family members of the deceased have been booked for not preventing the gathering. “Police are studying the videos of the procession and are likely to adda few more names in the complaint,” said police. Khan was not called by police for recording his statement till last reports came.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/fir-against-mla-rafeek-khan/articleshow/83156953.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Video of dogs feeding on body parts viral||UTTARKASHI: Local residents said after rainfall over the past few days, water level in Bhagirathi had risen and some human corpses and body parts, half burnt, had come floating to Kader Ghat. A video showing stray dogs feeding on the remains is doing the rounds on social media. Lokendar Bisht, state convener of the Ganga Vichar Manch, a platform that aims to conserve the river, met with the officials concerned and demanded proper disposal of bodies. Bisht said, “This is not the first time when stray dogs have been found feeding on human corpses. Many people leave the cremation site before cremating their dead properly.” He said, “Besides robbing the dead of a proper cremation, such incidents are a threat to public health, particularly during the pandemic. The administration should have ensured proper disposal of bodies -- both of Covid patients and otherwise.” Following the incident, Ramesh Semwal, chairman of Uttarkashi municipal corporation, has appointed an employee at Kedar Ghat cremation site to ensure cleanliness and proper disposal of bodies. Semwal said, “There is no authenticity of the viral video and I urge people to not believe in rumours. Moreover, all the employees on Covid duties are doing their best. However, we can't afford any kind of mistake at this time. Therefore, we have deputed a worker at the cremation site to maintain cleanliness and proper disposal of bodies.” Watch Uttarakhand: Dogs feed on half-burnt human corpses, video goes viral||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/body-parts-turn-up-at-riverbank-in-uttarkashi-video-of-dogs-feeding-on-them-viral/articleshow/83153177.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Another academic year begins, again in digital mode||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala logged into yet another digital academic year on Tuesday amid heightened vigil against the Covid-19 pandemic. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the school reopening at the state-level Pravesanolsavam at Cotton Hill Higher Secondary School here with a virtual address. The programme was telecast live on the KITE Victers television channel. The digital classes for classes 1-9 also began through the channel on the day. Vijayan said in his address that students and parents should scale up their vigil to pre-empt the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic. He expressed hope that students would soon be able to go to schools. "The time is not far when students will go to schools wearing new clothes and carrying their schoolbags. Even though students are studying from home due to the pandemic situation, we can jointly move forward to create a new world," he said. The chief minister said the government was making efforts to provide the full complement of online education to students in a phased manner. "Provisions are being made for interaction between students and teachers. The online academic transactions planned for the year will have provisions for students to improve their artistic talents and co-curricular skills also," he said, adding that classes will be provided in music, drawing and physical education on the YouTube channel of the education department. Education minister V Sivankutty said the government would strive to address the challenges of the online education system. "We will try to address the shortcomings based on a comprehensive study. The problems faced by students, including special kids, will be addressed to the maximum extent possible," he said. Meanwhile, replying to a submission by opposition leader V D Satheesan in the assembly, Sivankutty hinted that the government will not recruit new teachers in schools until they are opened physically. "In the government sector, appointment orders have been given to 2,513 candidates. The PSC has given advice memos to 788 candidates. As many as 4,800 appointment proposals in aided schools are also pending with the government. Any follow-up action on government and aided school appointments can be taken only after the schools reopen," he said. According to him, the government's stand in this regard is in accordance with the advocate general’s advice on 18/11/2020. Teachers’ organisations and selected candidates have been putting pressure on the government to make the appointments at the earliest. Though the government cites rules to insist physical reopening of schools and assessment of student strength as prerequisites for appointment, the pressure from aided school managements to grant clearance to a large number of teaching posts is said to be the real reason behind the slow pedalling in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/another-academic-year-begins-again-in-digital-mode/articleshow/83154342.cms||---
---||Delhi||Drive to plant 33L saplings to begin on June 5, says Rai||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said that on the occasion of World Environment Day, Delhi government will launch a mega plantation drive of around 33 lakh saplings of trees and shrubs. Rai said the government will plant a large number of roadside shrubs to combat air pollution and bring down PM10 levels. “This time, the Centre has set a goal of planting 18 lakh trees but Delhi government has kept a goal of planting 33 lakh trees, which we will symbolically initiate on June 5, given the city is under partial lockdown. In the coming days, this programme will be operational on a larger scale,”Rai said. The minister said in 2017, Delhi’s green area covered 299 km, which increased to 325 km, and they are hopeful that this year’s tree plantation drive will further increase this to an area of about 350 km. Every year, the central government provides an afforestation target to states. “During elections, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised to achieve the goal of planting 2 crore plants in the next five years to improve the environment. Keeping that goal in mind, we had surpassed the Centre’s goal and set a target of planting 31 lakh trees last year. However, we are happy to report that we surpassed our own target and planted 32 lakh trees in the last year against the target of 15 lakhs given by the Centre,” he said. Rai added, “ We will plant immunity-boosting and medicinal plants beginning June 5. It is my appeal to Delhiites to take these plants from governmental nurseries and plant them at their homes and increase their immunity levels by consuming them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drive-to-plant-33l-saplings-to-begin-on-june-5-says-rai/articleshow/83187429.cms||---

The operation was led by the newly- joined SP, Lalit Sakhyawar. “We had specific inputs about transportation of ganja inside a truck registered in Rajasthan; we deployed our team, which intercepted the truck before it could cross our borders,” Shakyawar told TOI. He said the truck was heading towards Dholpur in Rajasthan, the district that shares borders with Morena and was coming via Gwalior. “We found 1350kg of ganja that was concealed behind the packets of stationery material. Value of the seized ganja is around Rs 3 Crore,” SP said. He said two persons were arrested from the truck and they are being interrogated for more details. “They were coming from Odisha. We would try to get to the roots of the process, including the place from where it was smuggled and the place where it was destined to,” said the cop. On Monday, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) sleuths had confiscated 3092 kg of cannabis (ganja) worth nearly Rs 6 cr in the grey market of Sagar. All the three occupants of the vehicle confessed their respective roles in possession and transportation of ganja.

It was inaugurated by mayor Amarjit Singh Jeeti Sidhu and is expected to be completed in the next two months. “Laying the sewerage line was important because Mohali residents were facing problems. Now, as reconstruction work has started, the road will be opened to the public in the next two months,” said the mayor. He said the Mohali Municipal Corporation was making all out efforts to complete the road before the onset of the monsoon. According to the mayor, the project of sewerage line was passed under the Amrut scheme, in which 20% cost will be borne by Mohali MC, 30% by the state government and 50% by the Centre. Earlier, he said, due to the small size of the sewerage pipe and accumulation of silt, there was often a problem of sewerage jam which would now be completely eradicated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/reconstruction-of-ph-11-road-starts/articleshow/83154316.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: In 3 weeks, five of family fall to Covid, one to cancer||NEW DELHI: Vivek Mittal (30) has not cried since his father, Rajeev Kumar Mittal (51), succumbed to Covid-19.  He lost four other family members to the virus and his aunt to cancer within just three weeks. His mother, Rekha, had also tested positive, but she fought the virus and survived. His cousins and relatives are in a state of shock, unable to comprehend that the joint family of 15 has been reduced to nine members. The five family members who lost the battle to Covid-19 include Satyawati Mittal (80), her two sons Rajeev and Amit (45), Amit’s wife Alka (43) and Satyawati’s son-in-law Satish Kumar. Babli (54), Satyawati’s eldest son’s wife, died due to cancer. The harrowing period for the Mittal family, who reside in Deoli in south Delhi, began on April 20 when Satish fell sick. Satish and Manju (Rajeev’s sister) lived in the same area and would meet the family often. Three days later, most people in the family started falling sick. While Satish started being treated at home and was put on oxygen due to non-availability of beds in hospitals, the condition of the others too gradually started worsening. Speaking to TOI, Rajeev’s son, Vivek, said, “My grandmother’s oxygen level started dropping and on April 27 it was 58. We knew she couldn’t be treated at home, so we took her to several hospitals looking for a bed but to no avail. We finally reached AIIMS, Jhajjar where a bed was available. By the time we got her admitted, Amit uncle called me and told me that Alka aunty’s condition was also deteriorating.” “When we rushed back to Delhi, we found my father’s condition had also worsened. I thought it was better to get them admitted to a hospital. We arranged for an ambulance and moved the remaining family members to a hospital, apart from Satish uncle who was recovering at home,” added Vivek. As everyone was now in hospital, Vivek presumed they would be well taken care of. “On May 1, my cousin fell ill. While we were checking on him, I was informed that Amit uncle had sustained a cardiac arrest. After 20 minutes, he passed away. I received his body around 2am on May 2 and left for Garh Ganga to cremate him. Around 4.30am, I came to know that my grandmother (Satyawati) had also passed away. Since I was already at the cremation ground, an ambulance was sent to get her body there too,” Vivek said. Tragedy struck again on May 4 morning when Alka passed away. The next day, Rajeev was moved to the ICU in a critical condition, but by then the family had decided to move him to Yashoda Hospital in Ghaziabad. His CT scan value was 25/25. Rekha returned home on May 13 after recovering and Satish was moved to the hospital on May 14. “On May 21 morning, first Satish uncle suffered a cardiac arrest and then my father. Both of them passed away. Babli aunty passed away due to cancer-related ailments. We can’t even comprehend what has happened to our family. It feels like a wave came and washed away our family members,” added Vivek. Satyawati’s husband, Brahm Prakash Mittal (83), who is also a cancer patient, is in a state of shock. The family concluded the terahvi (the 13th-day mourning ceremony) of a few family members on Monday and Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-3-weeks-five-of-family-fall-to-covid-one-to-cancer/articleshow/83154334.cms||---
---||Delhi||Licence of 12 chemist shops cancelled||New Delhi: The licences of 12 chemist shops have been suspended by Delhi government’s drugs control department for selling Covid-management drugs without a doctor’s prescription, an official said on Wednesday. Last week, the department had suspended the licences of 25 chemist shops for selling medicines without prescriptions. Show-cause notices were issued to 12 chemist shops and the formalities to suspend their licences were completed on Wednesday, an official said. The action is being taken in the wake of a rising number of mucormycosis or black fungus cases in the capital. Experts have blamed an indiscriminate use of steroids among Covid patients for the spike in such cases. “The drugs control department has been sending decoy customers to chemist shops and action is being initiated against those chemists who hand over drugs without a prescription,” said Atul Kumar Nasa, the head of the Delhi Drugs Control office. The 12 shops were found selling steroids, such as budesonide and dexamethasone, without a prescription of a registered medical practitioner, according to officials. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/licence-of-12-chemist-shops-cancelled/articleshow/83187435.cms||---

The court held that the act amounted to cruelty and granted a divorce.The couple, who got married in June 2008, had gone to different places for studies after staying together for a week. They then stayed together for two years when the husband began practising at a hospital in Kochi in 2010. The husband had taken the woman to a psychiatrist after noticing her taking medications and she was diagnosed with delusional disorder.A family court had declined to grant divorce on the husband’s plea claiming cruelty due to the wife’s mental illness while the woman had sought divorce by alleging impotence of the husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wrong-charge-of-impotence-in-divorce-case-cruelty-hc/articleshow/83154398.cms||---

Then contact this number and you can get the report immediately.’ Over last two months, a Barodian had been marketing and openly selling bogus RT-PCR reports to the needy. Rakesh Mirchandani used to prepare the reports and sell them for a paltry amount. The crime branch sleuths received a tip-off about his activities following which they set a trap for him. The cops sent a decoy customer who contacted him and asked for a RT-PCR report. Police even transferred him money after which he gave the report. “We immediately arrested him for selling bogus RT-PCR reports. He admitted to have sold many such bogus reports,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). Mirchandani began charging Rs 300 for negative report and Rs 800 for positive report.  People travelling outside the state used to buy RT-PCR negative reports while those wanting insurance claims or leave from work sought positive reports. He used to make the test reports on online software. Mirchandani has sold such test reports to about 50 to 60 persons over last two months. The cops have seized his laptop.  Investigations reveal that Mirchandani, a resident of Kishanwadi, had been preparing such reports for the past one year. “He has a transport business and owns two vehicles. After the rule of RT-PCR negative report was made mandatory for entering some neighbouring states, Mirchandani began preparing such reports for his drivers as they had to visit Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan frequently,” Jadeja told TOI.  He realised that such reports are accepted easily at the state borders and its veracity is seldom checked. “So, he decided to sell RT-PCR reports to the needy. He began messaging people in his contact that he can provide them RTPCR report as per their need,” Jadeja added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/transporter-running-rt-pcr-racket-caught/articleshow/83151217.cms||---

---||Surat||14 quacks targeting labourers held||Surat/Bharuch: As many as 14 quacks who were practising in various parts of Bharuch district for several years were nabbed in a series of raids on Monday. Teams of the special operations group (SOG) and local police stations simultaneously raided clinics of these fake doctors and found them practising without any medical degree, license or certificate. A majority of them are from West Bengal, said police. Police said all of them have worked as compounders in the past in their home towns, so they had some knowledge of medicines and primary treatment. Six quacks were nabbed from Dahej, three from Ankleshwar town, four from Ankleshwar rural area and one from Umalla village. Sarweshwar Tiwari, 63, had been practising for around 18 years while all others were practising for around two to three years. Police said that they were totally unfazed when the raids happened and answered all questions. “Only one of the quacks is graduate as he has completed BCom otherwise all others have only completed HSC. Most of them are from West Bengal and one is from Bihar and they used to work as compounders at a real doctors’ clinics back home,” said inspector K D Mandora of SOG. They used to target the labourers working in this industrial belt and had their clinics in such areas so that no one become suspicious, a senior police official said. Cops have seized allopathic medicines, injections and medical equipment worth over Rs 2 lakh from the quacks. Besides Tiwari, police arrested Bitan Poddar, Rudrarai Rai, Sarweshwar Tiwari, Bratish Poddar, Anita Biswa, Namoranjan Biswas, Madhumangal Biswas, Biswajit Biswas, Sukumar Pal, Swapankumar Mallik, Nibas Biswas, Animesh Biswas, Rabin Rai and Bikaskumar Biswas. Police suspect that these quacks may have even treated Covid patients as they never asked anyone to get Covid tests done even if they had any symptoms. “They would give paracetamol or any other medicine which would suppress the symptom,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/14-quacks-targeting-labourers-held/articleshow/83152622.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: NCP task force to oppose RBI move to regulate coop banks||MUMBAI: The NCP will set up a high-level task force headed by cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil to draft an action plan to oppose what it sees as the NDA government’s move to gain control over district central cooperation and urban banks. Alarmed at alleged large-scale irregularities in cooperative banks, the NDA government had amended the banking regulation bill to empower the Reserve Bank of India to regulate district central cooperative and urban banks. Other than Patil, nominees of Congress and Shiv Sena and experts in the field of banking will be members of the task force too. NCP took the view that it was an attempt to gain control over cooperative and urban banks that have a massive network in the state; it was an attempt to gain control over the entire cooperative sector, the stronghold of the NCP. Most cooperative banks and societies in the state are directly controlled by the NCP. The decision to set up the task force was taken at a meeting presided over by NCP president Sharad Pawar, who had a marathon meeting with party ministers on the steps taken by the state government to tackle the pandemic situation, the vaccination plan, the political situation arising after the Supreme Court quashing of the Maratha quota and the recent decision of the state government to end reservation in promotions. Pawar took the view that all-out efforts should be made to ensure no injustice is meted out to the community for providing reservations. Meanwhile, senior party leaders requested Pawar to take up the issue of providing an adequate number of vaccines with Serum Institute of India managing director Adar Poonawalla. “The general view was that Pawar should use his good books and make an attempt to secure vaccines for Maharashtra,” said a senior NCP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-task-force-to-oppose-rbi-move-to-regulate-coop-banks/articleshow/83153279.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Jaipur||Govt orders define civic bodies’ post structures||Jaipur: The state government on Tuesday issued orders regarding public representatives’ posts in municipalities that were formed after they were upgraded from gram panchayats. The order states that the sarpanch and up-sarpanch (of upgraded gram panchayat) will now be the president and vice-chairman of the municipality, respectively. On the other hand, in municipalities with more than one gram panchayat, a new formula has been put in place for public representatives. An official explained, “In municipalities that are formed by combining one or more gram panchayats, the chairman of the municipality will be from the gram panchayat with maximum population. The sarpanch of that gram panchayat will be the president of the new municipality, while the vice-chairman will be from gram panchayat which is second in terms of population.” The official added, “Sarpanch, upsarpanch and ward panch of the remaining gram panchayats will be considered councillors of the municipality. The order was issued as there was a dispute in more than one gram panchayat.” Recently, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had announced the formation of six new municipalities in the Budget speech. In the Budget session of 2020-21, the government had announced formation of 17 new municipalities. Some of the 17 municipalities included more than one gram panchayat. “This led to dispute and confusion among the sarpanchs as to which gram panchayat’s sarpanch should be the chairman of the municipality. To avoid this confusion, the government has issued these orders,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-orders-define-civic-bodies-post-structures/articleshow/83156981.cms||---
---||Patna||Delay in Bihar rural polls: Panel to oversee development works||PATNA: The state cabinet on Tuesday approved the proposal of the panchayati raj department to issue an ordinance for formation of panchayat advisory committee (PAC) in all the panchayats to oversee developmental activities at the village level as elections to the three-tier panchayati raj bodies are not likely to be held before June 15. The government has already sent the draft of the proposed ordinance to governor Phagu Chauhan for his assent. “Once the governor gives his assent, the ordinance will be immediately notified after which its implementation will begin,” a source in the panchayati raj department said. “The issuance of the ordinance became necessary because panchayat elections would be delayed in the state. The entire process of the elections had to be completed by or before June 15, which is not possible under the present circumstances,” the source added. An official in the state cabinet secretariat department said the details of the proposal cannot be revealed at this stage. “They will be known only after the governor gives his assent to the proposal,” the official added. It is learned that the advisory committees will be broad-based and comprise MLAs as well as elected representatives of the outgoing panchayats, panchayat samitis and zila parishads. The state has over 8,000 panchayats and 38 zila parishads. The elections to the three-tier panchayati raj institutions could not be held this year as the State Election Commission wanted it to be done through the EVMs, but the Election Commission of India (ECI) remained non-committal on supply of EVMs. The matter also went to the court. Further, some political parties wanted the panchayat elections to be held on the party lines. Ever since the institution of the panchayats came into being, the respective state governments avoided holding the elections on party lines. Incidentally, since the 1978 panchayat elections that was marred by large scale violence, the elections could be held only in 2001. However, under the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government, the panchayat elections were held in 2006, 2011 and 2016. Meanwhile, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi has thanked CM Nitish Kumar for the decision of the government to set up PACs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/delay-in-rural-polls-panel-to-oversee-development-works/articleshow/83153783.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Ludhiana||‘There is nothing like coronavirus’: Villages make light of disease, disregard guidelines||Ludhiana: The district administration has formed village-level committees to educate people about Covid-19, its precautions and guidelines. But the efforts, it seems, are lost on the villagers making light of the virus. The TOI visited Libra, Gaggu Majra, Barmalipur and Kishangarh villages in Khanna and Doraha and found their residents roaming around without a mask. From youngsters playing at parks to the get-togethers of elderly people, nowhere social distancing and mask rules were followed. When asked the reason for not complying with the guidelines, most of them denied the existence of Covid-19 and some gave unfounded reasons for its spread.In Libra, about 50 youngsters were present at a playground at the entrance of the village. Some of them were playing cricket, some football and others were spectators. On they not following the pandemic rules, a youth said, “Covid affects only those who are physically unfit. We play here for three hours every day and this keeps us fit.”At Gaggu Majra village, none of the women in a group was wearing a mask. One of them said, “There is nothing like coronavirus.” When it was pointed out that many had died of the disease, she said, “The government can tell why people are dying. Nobody has coronavirus in our village and so, we never wear a mask.”Kishangunj village was no different. Elderly people were sitting at roadsides without a mask and a distance. When a 70-year-old man was asked if he was vaccinated against Covid-19, he said, “I do not need vaccine. Even at this age I do not have any disease, unlike others in cities.”On the villagers disregarding mask, another elderly man said, “We wear a mask when going out of the village. In our village, nobody is affected with coronavirus and, therefore, it is not required here.”In Barmalipur village, one of the three women sitting in a field said, “Covid affects only city people as they stay in air-conditioned rooms all day. We won’t contract the virus as we work in fields, cook at home and sweat a lot.” Another woman said, “I do not believe coronavirus is contagious. A woman in our village died recently as she had Covid. Her son took care of her, but he is fine. We do not understand what the government is saying.”Another resident of Barmalipur village said on the government directions, they have started “Thikri Pehra” at night and do not allow outsiders to enter the village.Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “Through Information Education Communication (IEC) activities, the administration is making people aware. Village-level committees have also been constituted to educate village residents. Doctors, the commissioner of police, the senior superintendent of police and I along with other senior officers often visit villages to educate the residents. Testing has been stepped up in rural areas. As a result of the efforts, positivity rate in rural belts has decreased drastically.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/there-is-nothing-like-coronavirus-villages-make-light-of-disease-disregard-guidelines/articleshow/83153256.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Jaipur||5 more districts can grant citizenship to Pak Hindu migrants||Jaipur: Bindi-Ki-Dhani, a small village with 150 houses along the international border in Barmer, is rejoicing the Union government’s decision to extend the special powers to the DM to grant citizenship to Pakistani migrants. The village has seen a migration of Hindu families from nearby villages across the border in the aftermath of the 1965 Indo-Pak war in 1966-68.Several elderlies in the seventies and eighties not holding Indian passport have been living with their children and grandchildren who are Indian since they are born here. The decision would mean that they can apply for Indian citizenship from their district headquarters rather than heading to Jaipur or Jodhpur. Ganesh Bijani, a son of refugee parents who crossed over from Sindh after 1971 said, “Other than the elders, this provision would help many migrants struggling for citizenship status for years. I hope it will expedite the process.” Hundreds of Hindu migrants from Pakistan living in a dismal state in Udaipur, Pali, Barmer and Sirohi are rejoicing the Union ministry of home affairs’ decision of granting special powers to the districts to grant citizenship under the citizenship Act 1955. The state now has eight districts where the DMs have special powers to process the citizenship application of religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh seeking citizenship. Earlier in 2016, the same powers were delegated to DMs of Jaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer. Hindu Singh Sodha, president of Seemant Lok Sangathan, said the decision will certainly provide relief to the migrants residing in five more districts. “Ideally, every district in Rajasthan should be given the same powers. It would be great if citizenship should be granted in a time-bound manner. The DMs of Jaipur, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer have been able to provide citizenship to only 25% of the eligible applications. If it is not expedited, the new measure would remain ineffective,” said Sodha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/5-more-districts-can-grant-citizenship-to-pak-hindu-migrants/articleshow/83157020.cms||---

Come what may, I won’t disclose the real names,” Sharma had told TOI six years ago, before being detained by the state’s special task force (STF) in connection with the medical entrance and recruitment scam involving a nexus of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. On Tuesday, Congress demanded that the “circumstances” leading to Sharma’s death be made part of the CBI’s Vyapam scam probe. The agency had been preparing to file a chargesheet later this week against the ex-minister in the sixth case pertaining to the scam, sources said. “His death is not normal. Why did he say he was only a pawn in the scam and that there is a threat to his life? This is a mysterious death,” Congress spokesperson KK Mishra tweeted. Congress’s Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Tankha tweeted: “He saved the party by putting himself into trouble”. Sharma had been hospitalised on May 12. He was cremated with state honours on Tuesday. The whistleblowers of the Vyapam scam said they were surprised by the government’s decision to cremate Sharma with state honours, given the way he was treated by BJP since being arrested for his alleged role in the scam. “There should be an inquiry...He was holding on to the secrets of the Vyapam scam,” said Ashish Chaturvedi, the Gwalior-based activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vyapam-linked-ex-mantri-dies-of-covid-congress-demands-probe/articleshow/83160058.cms||P Naveen

These are among the solutions being prepared by Kolkata Police in response to KMDA’s proposal to lift the ban on cycles from certain roads so that the agency could go ahead with its cycle track project. Cops hinted some relaxations were likely after the enhanced restrictions got over, provided local train services did not resume. KMDA had submitted a proposal to police on cycle lanes covering 15 major roads and 120 km. “We submitted the proposal to cops and mentioned the possible cycling zones in Kolkata. But that can be done once cops withdraw no-cycling zones.

Reluctant to share information about the incident, the forest department officials in Lansdowne said that the man, identified as Shivdutt Joshi, had gone to bring firewood from the forest when the incident occurred. Barely ten days ago on May 22, 65-year-old Dhum Singh and 45-year-old Afsari Begam were also crushed to death by an elephant in the Laaldhang village of the same forest division, according to the forest staff. The incident has once again raised questions on the inadequate patrolling by the forest officials in and around the forest and village borders to avert mishaps. The increased movement of elephants and other wild animals directly indicates the need to monitor the area and spread awareness among the villagers to stop venturing into the forests. “The man had entered the forest to collect wood with others when the incident occurred. His postmortem has been conducted,” said Pradeep Uniyal, range officer of Lansdowne. The forest department data states that three lives have been lost due to elephant attacks till May 25 this year. One each in Rajaji Tiger Reserve forest division, Terai East forest division and Lansdowne forest division. This year so far has witnessed four human deaths due to man-animal conflict in Lansdowne forest division alone. Meanwhile, in the same forest division, two elephants died this year due to accident and electrocution. The human wildlife conflict (HWC) data of forest department indicates that over 15 people have lost their lives till now in various incidents related to human-wildlife conflict across the state despite a month-long lockdown this year. Last year, 13 people lost their lives in the same duration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/man-killed-by-elephant-third-death-in-10-days/articleshow/83153272.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Banjarawala to get new water pipelines and STP||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand urban sector development agency (UUSDA) is coming up with a new water supply and sewerage system in Banjarawala and Mothrowala areas of Dehradun. Water scarcity has been a persisting problem in these newly-added wards of the city and this new system will address it. According to a detailed document issued by the UUSDA, the project will lay down 130 kilometers of water supply networks, including 65 km of aging pipeline which will be replaced. The plant will introduce a system of collecting stormwater generated during the rainy season and discharging it to the nearest water body. Officials said that the proposed project aims to ensure 24x7 quality water supply, sanitation and septage management system for the people in the area with a population of 62,000 and 11,000 households. Under this project a sewage treatment plant, with capacity of treating up to 29 million litres of waste per day, will also be established and will replace the existing septic tanks. Unlike existing water supply networks in the city, this new system will use supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) technology and GIS to collect data in real time. This will reduce the time spent in detecting faults in pipelines and responding to supply issues faster. Otherwise, it takes days to manually find where a pipeline is damaged and leaking. The UUSDA will be assisted by the PWD and the Dehradun Municipal Corporation in this project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/banjarawala-to-get-new-water-pipelines-and-stp/articleshow/83153260.cms||Abhijeet Singh

He said that the people of West Bengal will thrash Mamata with shoes and throw her out of the state. The remark came when BJP and RSS workers, led by Thukral, burnt the effigy of Mamata Banerjee over the alleged atrocities against their party workers in West Bengal. President of the State Bengali Mahasabha, Chandra Shekhar Ganguly said that this statement from Thukral reflects his attitude towards women. Former Congress minister Tilak Raj Behar said, “It appears that Thukral has lost mental balance. Such remarks are reflective of lack of moral fibre in BJP and its cadre.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-bjp-mla-sparks-row-with-his-remarks-against-wb-cm/articleshow/83153287.cms||Aakash Ahuja

The housing societies have already started planning on how to make some preparations if such a phase strikes again down a few months where there is a spike in critical cases and people require immediate hospitalization or oxygen support. Second wave in April took everybody by surprise with people scrambling for oxygen cylinders, anti-virals and hospital beds. Residents welfare associations, a group of elected members in a high-rise or a gated community who are responsible for maintaining the common facilities, worked closely with the administration and healthcare workers, want to utilize their learning in preparing themselves for such phases in future, if there are any. “Nobody expected that there would be so many critical cases and people would require oxygen support in such manner. But last few weeks have given us some idea how we should be prepared. All residents’ committees should take some steps so that we are all prepared to tackle another phase and save lives,” said Samaresh Das, chairman of New Town Forum and News, an umbrella body of RWAs in New Town. From pursuing vaccination aggressively to keeping life-saving equipment procured in the last few weeks in working condition to enforcing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour strictly, RWAs are planning on several fronts. “We have organised two vaccination camps trying to vaccinate as many people as possible including support staff and security personnel. We will try to organise more camps depending on the availability of the vaccines. Vaccination is crucial in minimising infections,” said Indranil Chowdhury, general secretary of the residents’ association at Silver Spring off the EM Bypass. Several big societies procured their own oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators to manage critical cases among their residents. “We already have the assets which we might require again. We must find proper ways to store them and keep them in working condition so that next time there is no scramble to purchase these,” said Das of NFTN. Many societies have also decided to enforce proper Covid appropriate behaviour so that the spread of the virus is curbed. “Sometimes people get complacent and stop following the safety guidelines. But we must keep wearing masks, avoid crowded places and maintain proper social distancing so that the virus doesn’t spread again and start mutating. We will sensitise our residents about this,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the residents’ association in Sukhobrishti in New Town’s Action Area 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-wave-lesson-for-rwas-to-fight-future-crisis/articleshow/83154588.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Mumbai||‘Non-essential’ shops, longer hours beckon Mumbaikars||MUMBAI: The BMC’s relaxation in shop timings till 2pm amid Covid-19 restrictions brought relief to small traders and consumers alike on Tuesday. Stores selling “non-essential” items reopened after a two-month closure since April 5. However, the new guidelines about shops on either side of the road being operational on alternate days by rotation each week evoked confusion. Several localities buzzed with activity as people headed out to make purchases such as stationery, books, shoes, clothes and umbrellas, which were held up for weeks. Traders in Matunga, Andheri Lokhandwala, Borivli West and Mulund West rolled up their shutters on both sides of the road. A garment retailer in Lokhandwala said, “We pay a rent of Rs 1.8 lakh to Rs 2 lakh per month, bills, taxes and wages, and are getting no rebate although business has been zero since 2020. Now that non-essentials can operate, let us earn some income—until the third Covid wave arrives.” Matunga market was open on both sides of the road. “My phone has been working erratically since two weeks but since electronics shops were closed, I could neither buy a new one nor give it for repair. I finally got it repaired on Tuesday,” said local resident Vijay Sitlani. Vegetable vendors were pleased at the extension. “Our stock does not stay fresh till the next day and we were not able to sell everything in just four hours. In fact, leafy greens had to be thrown away,” said green grocer Radheshyam Tiwari. Borivli West market association member Ankit Jain said all businesses began functioning on Tuesday morning. He said, “The police helped clear the confusion about odd-even and left-right. The government should plan properly. Otherwise only retailers are bearing the pain. Hawkers are better off.” Mitesh Mody, president of the All India Electronics Association, said, “There were no customers at Lamington Road or Grant Road since D Ward’s order to reopen arrived only at noon. So we could function only for two hours between noon and 2pm. It will take some days to understand the working pattern.” His association made maps and circulated them so members know when to open. Every civic ward office issued rules for its own area. G North Ward specified schedules for Dadar. It said malls, shopping centres, salons and gymnasia would stay shut. D Ward barred alternate day arrangements in containment zones. Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said shops were open everywhere. Matunga corporator Nehal Shah said, “Who steps out to buy non-essentials at 7am? People simply order online.” Viren Shah of traders’ federation FRTWA has requested politicians and the BMC to extend shop timings for a level playing field with e-commerce. In Navi Mumbai and Thane, shops will be shut on the weekends.

He never got back into the cabinet and was always believed to have harboured deep secrets of the scam. “I know who the big players are. Come what may, I won't disclose the real names,” Sharma had told TOI in an interview six years ago, before being detained by the state’s special task force (STF) in connection with the scam. Sharma had kept the secrets close to his chest till his last breath on Monday. But his death gave fresh ammo to Congress, which demanded that the “circumstances leading to his death” be made part of CBI’s Vyapam probe. According to sources, the central investigation agency was preparing to file a chargesheet against Sharma in the sixth case later this week. “His death is not normal. Why had he said that he was only a pawn in the scam and there was a threat to his life? This is a mysterious death which should be included in the CBI probe,” Congress spokesperson K K Mishra tweeted. Mishra said Sharma and two other members of his family got infected with Covid-19 after attending a wedding. “The two family members recovered. He died,” said the Congress leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/sharma-held-vyapam-scam-secrets-death-must-be-probed-says-cong/articleshow/83154604.cms||P Naveen
---||Ahmedabad||Fuel prices shoot up 5% in less than a month||AHMEDABAD: Adding another factor to the inflation in essential commodities people are already dealing with, petrol and diesel prices have increased by 5% in 28 days. While petrol prices rose from Rs 87.71 per litre on May 4 to Rs 91.48 per litre on June 1; diesel went from Rs 87.15 to Rs 91.93 per litre in the same period. Petrol prices have increased by 4.3% and diesel prices by 5.4% in this period. Fuel prices touched record highs on June 1 for both petrol and diesel. The rising price of petrol is hurting consumer budgets at a time when the economic situation is uncertain due to the pandemic. “Petrol and diesel sales have not declined due to the increase rise in fuel prices. In fact, sales have gone up because curbs imposed on industry have eased,” said Padmajay Rathod, a city-based petroleum dealer. The higher price of diesel has begun affecting the transport sector, adding to their cost of operation. “Diesel costs account for 50% of operating costs in the transport business. The 5% increase in diesel prices has pushed up operating costs up by 2.5%. We cannot renegotiate contracts with changing fuel prices and therefore are compelled to absorb the extra cost in the jobs we’ve taken up in advance,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association (AGTTA). Transporters say their margins are wafer-thin at this point because of low demand due to lower industrial output. “If our margins are hit by 2.5%, our profits are completely eroded,” said Dave. Industries are anticipating an increase in cost of operations as freight and logistics costs will rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fuel-prices-shoot-up-5-in-less-than-a-month/articleshow/83158335.cms||Niyati Parikh

On May 31, TOI had reported that the inoculation drive for 18-plus age group has seen a major setback within 20 days of its launch in Uttarakhand as most of the vaccination centers in state, especially in rural and hill areas, were shut for the past one week. With barely 2,000 vaccine doses left till 10am on Monday, the health department was mulling to administer the vaccines allotted for 45-plus category to the 18-plus category since the shots allotted for the 18-44 group are not expected to arrive any time before June 10. Confirming this, director National Health Mission (NHM), Dr Saroj Naithani said that the state will only take loan of vaccines from the Centre. “As soon we receive vaccine for the state from the Serum Institute, we will return the Center’s quota,” added Naithani. A total of 2,75,622 people in the 18- 44 group have been vaccinated so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-to-use-centres-quota-of-vax/articleshow/83153315.cms||Ishita Mishra

The administration had sent Sanwlaram Devasi (55) to Jodhpur for the second time on Sunday.Devasi initially had burning sensation in his eyes and later fell ill. He was taken to a hospital in Balotra where it was found he had black fungus symptoms. Devasi was referred to Jodhpur. AIIMS doctors told Devasi that he had lost vision in both the eyes and the fungus had spread till his jaws. They suggested orbital exenteration (surgery to remove eyeball and surrounding tissues) and surgery to remove the affected part of the jaw. But his family took him back to the village.A survey team on getting information about Devasi’s disappearance from the hospital went to his house. The tehsildar and block officer persuaded the family members and sent them back to AIIMS-Jodhpur on May 30. The doctors again told them that surgery to remove the affected areas was the only way out, on which they took back Devasi back to the village. When the villagers protested, Devasi was taken to a hamlet and was treated by a tantrik. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/admin-sends-black-fungus-patient-to-hosp-family-takes-him-to-tantrik/articleshow/83157168.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Blame game begins as panel records statement on oil spill||MUMBAI: Two days after master Agnelo Socorro Rebello of barge Gal Constructor gave video statement to the High-Level Committee (HLC) blaming AFCONS for the tragedy, officials from AFCONS, which chartered the barge, told the HLC in a video recording that Rebello did not follow their instruction. A source from the DG Shipping confirmed that the HLC, set-up by the ONGC, has video recorded the statement of AFCONS official who has held Rebello responsible for the barge that ran aground near Wadrai coast. AFCONS blamed Gal Constructor master saying the DG Shipping had served notices to clear the barge after the oil spillage. However, Rebello refuted the allegations and told TOI, “If I hadn’t removed the anchorage from Alibaug Revadanda location, we too would have faced the same fate as barge Papaa (P-305). I repeatedly communicated with AFCONS officials, but they asked me to stay back at Bombay High, which is around 90 nautical miles off Mumbai. I have never seen such a huge cyclone in my 36 years career.” Rebello said he knew it was going to happen and repeatedly communicated with the AFCONS, but “they were more interested in earning money and did not care about the lives onboard”. “Even my company supported me and gave the same statement to the HLC. I dropped the anchorage, and the barge was towed with tugboat Varaprada, but we did not get entry inside Bombay Port Trust on May 16 because the AFCONS had not made payment. The AFCONS officials then asked me to sail the barge towards Alibaug. I noted that the wind speed was at 120 knots and the tide waves at around 7 feet. I was shivering and removed the anchorage but the barge drifted towards Palghar where it ran aground. Meanwhile, SS-3 workstation vessel master communicated with me and they too removed the anchorage and they got adrift towards Pipavov in Gujarat,” he alleged. When contacted, an AFCONS spokesperson agreed to give a statement but TOI did not receive the same when a questionnaire was sent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-blame-game-begins-as-panel-records-statement-on-oil-spill/articleshow/83158375.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

A day after meeting state party organisational leaders, BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and Singh interacted on Tuesday individually with the UP ministers, a development seen as a concerted bid by the party to give feedback to the state government machinery to ramp up efforts to tackle the pandemic in the run-up to the high-stakes UP assembly elections due next year. Singh’s praise of the Yogi government’s work in dealing with the pandemic came against the backdrop of persistent speculation about the possibility of changes in the government and the organisation and are, therefore, seen as significant. He also praised the BJP state unit for putting up a good show in the recently concluded panchayat elections. “BJP is always in poll mode. Unlike the opposition, which starts preparing only when elections approach,” Radha Mohan said. A BJP politician said Santhosh and Singh met all key ministers, including both the deputy CMs — Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma — and suggested measures that were needed to consolidate people’s support and counter an aggressive opposition. Maurya said it was an organisational meeting that focused on the next assembly elections. “Our party aims to get 300-plus seats in the next assembly elections,” Maurya said. Santhosh is from the RSS, which plays a crucial role as the ideological fountainhead of BJP. Party sources said the feedback given to him could come in handy for the Sangh’s various organisational arms which work in various social areas. Santhosh is also learnt to be regularly in touch with the top BJP politicians, including PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and party national president JP Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-national-leaders-meet-up-mantris-to-give-feedback-before-high-stakes-polls/articleshow/83160057.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||Eye on future while saving lives, says HC||New Delhi: Noting that despite best efforts there is a 66% shortage of the key drug required to treat black fungus, Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to frame a policy prioritising patients who can be saved or who have a better chance of survival. The court said the government must focus on “saving our future” and in a crisis like this “choose the younger ones” over an 80-year-old who has lived his life and no one is dependent on him, while framing its policy on distribution of Liposomal Amphotericin B drug to treat black fungus. The court remarked that in the vaccination drive, the focus should have been to vaccinate the younger generation first to protect them and such young patients of black fungus should be given preference in giving the drug in face of acute shortage. “We have to secure our future and we need to vaccinate our younger generation and here we are giving priority to 60+ people who have lived their lives. It is the younger lot which is the future, we are on our way out,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh pointed out, indicating that at least in treating black fungus the focus must now be on younger patients, if not during vaccination. “Ideally, we should be able to save everyone but if we have to choose, we have to save younger people,” the court said while hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra on shortage of medicines to treat black fungus disease. Justice Sanghi lamented that so many young people lost their lives to Covid-19 because they were not vaccinated on priority. The bench was, however, quick to clarify that its comments don’t mean lives of older people are not important as the emotional support which the elderly people provide to a family cannot be discounted, but added that “in times of crisis difficult choices have to and should be made by the state.” The only exception that can be “carved out” in the new policy is those “serving the nation in high positions” whose safety and security is necessary because of the “pivotal roles that they play” in administration of the country, it added. “If data before us today is anything to go by, there is a shortage of 66% even today as per requirement while cases of black fungus are showing an upward trend. Delhi saw an increase of 39 cases in the last 24 hours from 753 to 791,” the bench observed while giving the direction to frame a policy. “Administration of the said drug to patients having better chances of survival may have to be prioritised,” it noted. When the Centre argued that there are other drugs such as plain Amphotericin-B and Posaconazole, which can be also used to treat fungus patients, the court said it is high time the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) lay down guidelines on which other drugs can be used apart from Liposomal Amphotericin-B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eye-on-future-while-saving-lives-says-hc/articleshow/83154710.cms||Abhinav Garg

On Monday, 734 patients were under treatment, while 118 had recovered. The maximum 242 cases are from Gurgaon district, followed by 214 from Rohtak and 211 from Hisar. Haryana government bounced back to stem the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the second wave but now it is expected to do the same for Mucor. The government and private hospitals remain under pressure. In the early stages of this post-Covid disease, the Manohar Lal Khattar government already has increased the reserved beds from 20 to 75 and planned for quick patient referral to the nearest medical college. Private and civil hospitals work on early treatment, while the state government has started arranging for 7,000 Amphotericin-B injections. The CM said: "As soon as the cases of black, yellow, and white fungus started appearing in the state, we took steps for timely treatment. The cases of Mucor have increased in the last few days, so the medical colleges have orders to keep the medicines ready. Medicine supply was a challenge in this fight but out CMOs found a way to get 7,000 injections, while we stepped in to curb black-marketing." The state government declared Mucor a notified disease and made an expert committee for the distribution of Amphotericin-B. The committee has approved 975 shots for 515 patients. This dosage is based on per kilogram body weight (5mg/kg, for instance).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/plan-in-action-yet-haryanas-mucormycosis-toll-hits-75/articleshow/83168546.cms||---
---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: Man suffers renal failure after police force him to run 3km||UDAIPUR: A dairy owner allegedly suffered renal problems after a cop forced him to do 100 sit-ups and run three kilometres on empty stomach. The man, who could not pass urine, was admitted to a hospital and put on dialysis. But after his condition deteriorated, he was referred to Nadiad in Gujarat. His father and brother met the SP and gave a written complaint. “We have received the complaint. The constable has been suspended and an inquiry is being conducted by the CO, East,” SP Rajiv Pachar said. Complainant Kishore Prajapat said his brother Meethalal, who runs a dairy in Shabri colony in Ayad, was winding up the shop on May 25 after permitted hours, when some policemen arrived and forcibly took him to a quarantine centre. Meethalal told the cops that he was about to close the shop and was keeping the utensils inside, but they didnt heed to him. Next day, they got his RTPCR test and asked him and the other people to do 100 situps. Constable Guru Dayal misbehaved and abused Meethalal when he expressed inability in physical exertion and requested to pay penalty instead of being made to run. But the cop forced him to run 3km. Later in the evening, the test report came negative and Meethalal was released. After he came home, Meethalal had problem in urination and was taken to hospital. “The doctors said my brother's kidneys were not functioning as the muscles had ruptured due to over pressure. They said some liquid has flown into the kidney and caused harm,” Kishore said. Meethalal was put on dialysis, but his condition did not improve. He was taken to Nadiad hospital on Monday evening. In a similar incident, a security service provider Nand Kishore Trivedi filed a complaint against two cops for misbehaviour and physical assault even though he had valid documents for movement.

On Monday, 734 patients were under treatment, while 118 had recovered. The maximum 242 cases are from Gurgaon district, followed by 214 from Rohtak and 211 from Hisar. Haryana government bounced back to stem the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the second wave but now it is expected to do the same for Mucor. The government and private hospitals remain under pressure. In the early stages of this post-Covid disease, the Manohar Lal Khattar government already has increased the reserved beds from 20 to 75 and planned for quick patient referral to the nearest medical college. Private and civil hospitals work on early treatment, while the state government has started arranging for 7,000 Amphotericin-B injections. The CM said: "As soon as the cases of black, yellow, and white fungus started appearing in the state, we took steps for timely treatment. The cases of Mucor have increased in the last few days, so the medical colleges have orders to keep the medicines ready. Medicine supply was a challenge in this fight but out CMOs found a way to get 7,000 injections, while we stepped in to curb black-marketing." The state government declared Mucor a notified disease and made an expert committee for the distribution of Amphotericin-B. The committee has approved 975 shots for 515 patients. This dosage is based on per kilogram body weight (5mg/kg, for instance).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/plan-in-action-yet-haryanas-mucormycosis-toll-hits-75/articleshow/83157204.cms||---

Some of the industrialists have already started getting calls from their customers for discussing delivery and next consignment plans that has brought sense of cheer amongst businessmen. Vinod Thapar, chairman of Knitwear Club, said, “Maharashtra has relaxed lockdown curbs slightly in several cities from Tuesday, while Uttar Pradesh too lifting day curfew from districts having less than 600 coronavirus cases and Rajasthan also has announced it will ease the restrictions from Wednesday at some places. Though these states are not going to open up entirely this week but the unlocking has started and several business activities will start right away. This is a good sign for garment factories of Ludhiana that were under extreme pressure due to piling of goods worth several hundred crores in our factories, in transit and in godowns of transports after one after another state went into lockdown. We are assuming that in next 7-10 days the movement of goods will start though it is not going to return back to normal as of now but still something is better than nothing.”According to Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, “We have heaved a sigh of relief as we have started receiving calls from our customers based in states like UP, Rajasthan and Delhi for holding discussions about the goods that were in transit or are held up at the godowns and offices of the transport ever since the lockdown in those state started. We were very much worried about these consignments as these were undelivered due to closure of the shops, offices and warehouses of our customers due to the lockdown in their states. We are hoping that in majority of the states shops, showrooms will be allowed to open in a day or so and our customers will be able to receive the goods.”Narinder Mittal, general secretary of the Ludhiana Business Forum, said, “This is a big relief for us as there was huge uncertainty over the future of the already shipped goods. It is a common trade practice that we cannot push our customers for payment of the goods, which are undelivered, so we were not asking them for paying up for these goods, but now customers are themselves calling us for finalising the payment schedule of these consignments as they also know that they will soon get the goods after their state governments have announced easing the curbs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/textile-industry-biz-picks-up-as-lockdown-curbs-ease/articleshow/83153342.cms||Mohit Behl

Recently, a 38-year-old gym owner of Ludhiana had committed suicide as the lockdown had left him broke. A few days ago, another gym owner had attempted suicide. On Monday, Gym Ekta Welfare Association, Ludhiana, met additional deputy commissioner Amarjeet Singh Bains and submitted a memorandum, seeking permission to open gyms. To make themselves heard, the association plans to stage a protest at 30 chowks of the city on Wednesday. Amarjot Singh, general secretary of the association, said, “There are about 500 gyms in Ludhiana and over 90% of them are on rental properties. With a decline in Covid-19 cases, the government has allowed non-essential shops to open. Salons, where employees come in direct contact with customers, are also open, but not gyms even as we check the temperature of all visitors, sanitise them as well as all the equipment.”Amandeep Singh of Gill Road, who owns a gym, said, “I have two kids, a 6-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son. Left with no funds, I could not pay my daughter’s school fee. Pushed to the wall, I had decided to end my life and reached a canal to jump into it. But then I thought about my children and family and returned home.” On learning about his plight, the gym association arranged ration for his family and paid his daughter’s school fee. The Ludhiana administration has allowed opening of non-essential shops, but not gyms, swimming pools, spas, among others, as per the directions of the minister of home affairs. ADC Bains said the administration would forward the memorandum to the government. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “Salons and parlours are allowed to open.

---||Nagpur||Lawyers allowed physical hearing after protests at district court||Nagpur: After technical glitches continued to mar online hearings started at the district and sessions courts, over 300 lawyers thronged the premises demanding resumtion of physical hearings. Later their delegation led by District Bar Association (DBA) president Kamal Satuja met Nagpur bench of Bombay high court’s senior administrative judge Sunil Shukre and apprised him of the problems being faced by them. Justice Shukre then spoke with principal district judge (PDJ) Sanjay Mehere and asked him to allow hybrid hearing on the condition of strictly following the standard operating procedure (SOP). It means the lawyers can plead their cases as per their convenience physically or virtually, but entry of their clients would be prohibited inside the premises, except for filing surety or as witnesses. Even the accused's entry would be barred and they were told to attend hearings in virtual mode from inside jail or police stations. “Since last couple of weeks or so, the court administration has prohibited lawyers from attending physical hearings in view of Covid-19 pandemic. We are told to attend virtual hearing, but it is marred by glitches and connectivity issues. The lawyers anyway need to visit the court for filling of humdast, execute surety and other works,” Satuja told TOI. TOI had first highlighted the issue of lawyers at district court facing difficulties in pleading their cases online due to an online system that was inadequate to handle load. After TOI’s news, fierce debates took place between the lawyers on WhatsApp groups. As lawyers crowded the court’s premises, Satuja selected 25 of them and went to meet justice Shukre. The delegations also assured the judge they wouldn’t bring their clients inside the courts. The PDJ later issued an SOP for the hybrid hearing. “Even the administrative judge realised it was practically impossible for all the lawyers to attend the hearing in present circumstances. Now, we have a choice to either attend the hearing virtually or physically. This decision brought a big relief to the legal fraternity at lower courts, as many of us are struggling for survival owing to the pandemic,” he added. Physical hearing increases risks of infection: Sanyal Speaking on the development, lawyer Ravi Sanyal stressed on the need to have a virtual system considering the pandemic situation in which about 40 from the legal fraternity had already succumbed to the virus, including former DBA president Sudeep Jaiswal. “There’s need for the judiciary to evolve itself as shown by the Supreme Court or HC where a seamless online system was made available for the lawyers. It should be replicated for all the lower courts as well. Even though the administration has allowed physical hearings, they should be completely stopped, considering threat to everyone, from court staff to judges to lawyers. We all need to accept the technology that ended geographical barriers,” he told TOI, adding that safety should be paramount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lawyers-allowed-physical-hearing-after-protests-at-district-court/articleshow/83175857.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The rape survivor was being coached at Sawai Man Singh Stadium. The matter came to light after the parents noticed a change in the minor's behaviour and questioned her. She broke her silence and told her parents about her ordeal. A case of rape was registered at the Jyoti Nagar police station on Monday under various sections of the Pocso Act and IPC. The accused, identified as Gaurang Nalwaya, was also arrested by the police on Tuesday evening. The girl had been pursuing a career in the sport and the accused coach, who was training her, got close to the survivor promising her chances to play in big tournaments. The family was initially unaware and only became suspicious after noticing changes in the girl's behaviour. “When the parents asked the girl, she narrated her plight and told them that she was raped multiple times,” a police officer said. “The accused allegedly raped the girl many times. In March 2021, he took her to Udaipur on the pretext of letting her play in a tournament and raped her. A complaint has been lodged by the family and a case registered under various sections," said deputy commissioner of police (south) Harendra Mahawar to TOI. Asked if the department had received similar complaints about the coach, a senior officer said, “We have not received any other complaint. But if we do find something more, we will include that too in the FIR. This is a clear breach of trust as parents trust such coaches and send their children to them for training," said Mahawar. The accused was taken into police custody in the morning and arrested later, said additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba.

---||Mumbai||Last month Maharashtra GST receipts down 36% over April, but up 59% from May 2020||MUMBAI: In a clear indication of the economic hit of the lockdown-like restrictions in Maharashtra, state GST collections plummeted by 36.4% between April and May. The curbs announced to control the second wave of Covid clamped down on most sectors barring agriculture, manufacturing, construction and essential services. Currently, non-essential retail has been allowed to open in a limited manner. GST collections in April reflected the transactions made in March. However, receipts in May reflect the transactions after the lockdown-like curbs began. The latest data shows that GST collections decreased from Rs 22,012 crore in April to Rs 13,399 crore in May—a fall of Rs 8,130 crore. GST is a consumption-based tax and is an indicator of economic activity. “There has been a decline in consumption especially since the non-essential retail sector and malls were closed. Even non-essential e-commerce activity was closed. This is reflected in GST collections,” said a senior official. However, GST collections in the state are much higher than they were during the harsh national lockdown last year, when most sectors were closed. GST collections in May are 59% higher than the corresponding period last year. The receipts in May 2020 were Rs 8,426 crore.The cumulative GST collection this year since April stands at Rs 35,412.5 crore. This is higher than the same period last year by a steep 172%. By comparison, the receipts in Maharashtra between April and May 2020 during the national lockdown were Rs 13,012 crore. Maharashtra had ended the pandemic-struck year of 2020-21 with GST collections that were 11% lower than 2019. Data showed that the state collected 1.6 lakh crore worth of GST in 2020-21 compared to 1.8 lakh crore in 2019-20. The receipts had dipped by Rs 20,609 crore. The state has been pressing the Centre to settle its pending GST compensation dues, which are currently Rs 24,000 crore. When the Maharashtra Budget was tabled on March 8, the state had revised its target for SGST collections. Although the target for 2020-21 had been set at Rs 1 lakh crore, the state had collected Rs 88,000 crore. The gap was Rs 19,146 crore. The budget documents said, “The tax collections are not showing the expected buoyancy due to the pandemic and non-receipt of compensation cess from the central government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/last-mth-state-gst-receipts-down-36-over-april-but-up-59-from-may-2020/articleshow/83158380.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Second wave takes sheen off gold demand||AHMEDABAD: With jewellery stores staying shut for most of May due to restrictions to curb Covid19, demand for gold and gold jewellery took a hit, causing imports of the yellow metal to plunge by 83%, month-on-month, in May. Gold imports stood at 0.59 metric tonnes (MT) in May against 3.54MT in April, according to import data from the Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. Deferred weddings and curbs forcing retail stores to shut caused import of gold to decline drastically. “Weddings are being deferred because people fear a wave of Covid infections. Moreover, shops were shut on Akshaya Tritiya, which is considered an auspicious time and drives gold sales. This hurt demand for gold to a great extent and could be a major factor in imports declining,” said a city-based jeweller. As gold prices are on the rise and weddings are deferred, demand is expected to remain low-key. “The price of gold stood at Rs 50,900 per 10g on Tuesday and has been edging higher. High prices are a dampener and demand for gold and gold jewellery is expected to remain muted,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). No orders that were previously placed for jewellery were cancelled during the recent round of restrictions and this according to jewellers was the only saving grace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-wave-takes-sheen-off-gold-demand/articleshow/83158439.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Meerut||Nothing green about horticulture works in Uttar Pradesh||MEERUT: Civil engineers heading horticulture department works? It is more of a norm than an exception in Uttar Pradesh, where the horticulture departments are headed by civil engineers in 29 development authorities in the state. The resultant state of horticulture is there for all to see. The facility that was constituted with an aim to have an effective planning to develop parks, plantations, green belts, vegetated landscapes and urban/rural forests “to enrich the atmospheric air with oxygen” is in a shambles, feel both environmentalists and constituents of the UP horticulture department. The primary cause of the grim picture of green works is the absence of dedicated horticulture departments in the public authorities. Speaking with TOI, a senior official at the department of horticulture said, “Horticulture works in most of the development authorities and urban local bodies are performed by the civil/construction divisions and their engineers. Most of these engineers either hold a B.Tech degree in civil engineering or a Diploma. The civil departments or their civil engineers lack any specialized scientific knowledge and experience in horticulture works. As a result, no importance is given to a department of immense significance.” Data accessed by TOI show that in big cities like Prayagraj, Gorakhpur and Varanasi, each has one horticulture inspector while the department is headed by civil engineers. Speaking with TOI, Akash Vashishth, conservationist and secretary, Society for Protection of Environment and Biodiversity, said, “Civil Engineering and Environmental Sciences/Ecology/Forestry are two completely different disciplines and a person qualified in one stream cannot take up or perform the job of another, whose requirements are completely different. Only a person trained and qualified in horticulture or allied streams such as forestry or environmental sciences can understand the requirements of various horticulture works and plan, perform and execute them efficiently. A distinct and dedicated horticulture department in a public authority is vital to prevent, control and abate the rising air pollution in most of the cities of Uttar Pradesh. But due to inadequate staff and control, prospects of better living conditions for public are being smothered for want of attention. Hence, I have written to the state government to give due importance to bettering city climate by providing teeth to the horticulture department.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/with-civil-engrs-at-helm-nothing-green-about-horticulture-works-in-up/articleshow/83153444.cms||Sandeep Rai

While few waterlogging complaints were received by the capital’s 12 municipal zonal offices, at least 81 cases of uprooting of trees were reported. Outer Delhi areas and parts of south Delhi like Najafgarh faced the maximum impact while East Delhi areas saw few complaints. In North Delhi Municipal Corporation jurisdiction areas, 41 complaints of tree falling, with maximum damage in outer Delhi areas like Rohini and Narela, were reported. Seven cases of portions of buildings or walls collapsing were reported from areas like Turkman Gate, Bhalswa, Inderpuri and Shalimar Bagh while waterlogging was observed in East Patel Nagar, Begumpur and Pooth Khurd areas. A senior official said that Rohini zone was impacted the most with more than 50% cases of tree felling being observed in this zone. A total of 22 trees were uprooted in various parts of Rohini, Udyog Nagar and Peeragarhi. Concretisation of base around trees has been the key cause of concern for roots of trees getting weakened, which eventually leads to a large number of cases of uprooting of trees during rain and thunderstorms. South Delhi Municipal Corporation received 35 cases of tree felling and uprooting while no complaints of waterlogging or building collapse were reported. Its south zone recorded maximum 16 cases of tree felling from sites in RK Puram, Pushp Vihar, Safdarjung Enclave, GK-2, Sheikh Sarai and Adhchini. Najafgarh zone recorded eight such cases from residential areas in Kakrola, Nawada, Shyam Vihar, Palam and Matiala. West zone areas like Janakpuri, Vikaspuri, Rajouri Garden and Punjabi Bagh witnessed eight tree felling cases while minimal impact was observed in the central zone. Three trees fell in Jangpura and the shooting range near Tughlaqabad Fort. Similarly, East Delhi Municipal Corporation recorded five tree felling cases and no complaints of waterlogging. Shahdara South zone witnessed three tree felling cases from Vivek Vihar, Jwala Nagar and Trilokpuri while Shahdara North zone received such complaints from Mandoli and Dilshad Garden colonies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/late-night-storm-fells-over-80-trees-outer-and-south-delhi-worst-hit/articleshow/83155043.cms||Paras Singh

On Tuesday he shared a photo of a referral hospital at Chandrayan in Saharsa, which was built at a cost of Rs 14 crore and inaugurated by him on November 18, 1995, on his Twitter handle. The name plaque installed on the occasion is, however, missing. सहरसा में करीब 14 करोड़ की लागत से बने इस रेफरल अस्पताल का 1995 में हमने उद्घाटन किया था ताकि पूर्वी और पश्चिमी तट… https://t.co/nK0dOyvwqB— Lalu Prasad Yadav (@laluprasadrjd) 1622527807000Taking cognisance of the matter, Lalu tweeted, “The hospital was set up to provide medical facilities to the people living on both the eastern and the western flanks of the embankment. But it met the same fate as thousands of other such hospitals in the state.” The photo was initially uploaded by the Saharsa district unit of the RJD, which was later shared by Lalu. The party alleged that the referral hospital at Chandrayan had virtually turned into a “bhoot bungalow”. The development comes a day after a similar photo related to a hospital at Chakbajitpur under Hilsa assembly segment in Nalanda district was shared by the former CM on his Twitter handle.

Had he improved the health facilities in the state during his tenure, the situation would have been quite different.” The JD (U) MLC added, “The people are aware of the situation that prevailed in government hospitals during the RJD regime. A rise in the number of footfalls during the NDA rule is a proof of the kind of work that has been done in the field of healthcare in the state.” Meanwhile, sources close to the first RJD family denied the report of Lalu’s visit to Patna in the near future due to “his health condition”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-chief-slams-nitish-over-poor-health-facilities-in-state/articleshow/83153443.cms||Ramashankar

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: In daring ghat operation, railway police rescue tribal woman lying injured along tracks||NAVI MUMBAI: When Karjat railway police got an alert about a woman found lying along the tracks in Khandala ghat section, about 13km away, they didn’t want to wait four hours for the next express train to cross the spot and decided to hit the track immediately. The complicated rescue involved a 13km drive, a 4km descent in the ghat and a 30-minute walk along the tracks to reach the 44-year-old tribal woman lying unconscious with injuries to her legs and waist. The four-member team then rigged up a makeshift stretcher with cloth and bamboo and hoisted her on their shoulders to make the trek back before rushing her to the government hospital in Karjat. The whole operation was completed in around two hours. Senior inspector of Karjat GRP, Avinash Andhale, said the motorman of an express train informed the station master at Palasdhari that a woman was lying beside the tracks between Jamrung and Palasdhari stations on Monday afternoon. Police said Ashabai Waghmare, who resides in Karla village near Lonavala, had gone to the forest to collect wood. She was returning around noon when she collapsed due to the heat. “The Pune GRP too received an emergency call as the location came under their jurisdiction, but they were located about 45 km. Hence, PSI TN Sarkale with constables Dnyaneshwar Gangurde, Tushar Turde and Mangesh Gaikwad were sent to the spot,” said Andhale.  He said with local trains not operating due to the lockdown and the next express train scheduled after four hours, it was decided to reach Palasdhari by jeep. “However, on reaching, the team found there was no further road access to the spot. So, they descended the ghat using the walking track along a 4km pipeline and reached the railway tracks. They then had to trek a further half-an-hour along the tracks to reach the spot where the woman was lying semi-unconscious with injuries to her legs and waist,” Andhale said. Police said Ashabai Waghmare, who resides at Karla village near Lonavala, had gone to the forest to collect wood. She was returning home around noon when she collapsed due to the heat. “Meanwhile, a Pune GRP team had boarded the Chennai Express and alighted at Karjat, but our staff had already rescued the woman by then. The Pune GRP team took the woman in an ambulance from Karjat government hospital to Sassoon Hospital in Pune for further treatment.

House-to-house pipeline network was laid around seven years ago, yet several areas in Kalamna continue to depend on water tankers. Due to lackadaisical attitude of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), residents have to queue up for at least a couple of hours to collect drinking water from tankers. As if this is not enough, water supply through tankers is erratic, complain residents. BJP corporator Rajkumar Sahu raised the issue in general body meeting, held to discuss the NMC budget. TOI visited the locality and found that citizens were also facing severe hardships to store water being supplied through tankers. Radhabai Karnake, a senior citizen, said since the area comes under NMC limits, they haven’t received tap water though the NIT had laid the pipeline about eight years ago. “We have been complaining to the NMC and NIT officials, but in vain. Every day, senior citizens like me struggle for a bucket of water being supplied through tankers. If the NMC cannot charge the overhead tank, it should provide one tanker per household every week at least,” she said. Residents also raised suspicion over tanker mafia preventing NMC’s water works department from charging the elevated water reservoir. A senior official from NMC’s water works department blamed NIT for the delay in charging the overhead water tank. NIT had handed over the tank to the NMC in March this year. “We got the overhead tank with many incomplete works,” the official claimed. “Since April, the NMC has installed valves and inter-connection of this tank with Wanjari Nagar tank. The work of sump was also completed by the NMC,” he claimed. NIT had started construction work of the overhead tank in 2007 and was supposed to complete it by 2010. Later, the civic agency extended the deadline to 2012. Along with the tank construction, NIT had undertaken house-to-house pipeline laying work in 2010. The pipeline network was completed in 2014-15, said a source. However, due to some disputes, the contractor engaged for the tank construction left the work midway. This forced the NIT to find another contractor to complete the task. This also nearly doubled the project cost, said the source. Now, the tank is almost ready. The NMC will soon recharge the network and start regular tap water supply to the residents, said a water works department official. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari directed the department to start water supply to the locality without further delay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/16l-litre-overhead-tank-ready-yet-no-tap-water/articleshow/83157408.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He moved away, built a life in Bhopal and home became a distant memory. Three decades on, the works of the poet will be taught to Urdu undergraduate students at the Meerut University. Badr is 86 now, has dementia and does not recognise anyone. “But Meerut has always been on his mind,” his daughter Saba Khan, 54, who lives in Meerut, said. The Board of Studies of Chaudhary Charan Singh University on Monday announced the decision to include Badr and other prominent poets from western UP — Ismail Meeruthi, Vishnu Prabhakar, Kunwar Bechain and Sudama Pandey, among others — in the curriculum for Urdu. “Under the New Education Policy, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has come up with a new syllabus which was sent to us,” Prof Aslam Jamshedpuri, head of the department, Urdu, told TOI. “The directions we got are that 70% of the syllabus will be determined by the UGC while 30% will be framed by the university.” Pro vice chancellor of the university, Prof Y Vimla, said, “While exercising the discretion to decide what makes up 30% of the syllabus keeping regional significance in mind, we decided to include these poets.” Saba said this would preserve his legacy. “It is good that he will be taught at the university but he has always been in the minds of the people of Meerut … His ghazals and couplets written with the 1987 riots in mind have become immortal.” For three months from April to June 1987, Meerut was in the grip of communal riots. Hundreds died. Around 10.30am around Shab-e-Barat (mid-April), rioters struck Shastri Nagar, where Badr lived. He was not in Meerut at the time — he had gone to a mushaira in Delhi. His son, Nusrat (who would go on to become a film lyricist) was home. He managed to escape as the house was burnt to the ground. Badr had lived in Meerut for 12 years, teaching at the Meerut College as the head of the department of Urdu. But the home he had known was suddenly gone. He wrote the iconic lines, often shared in the aftermath of violence — “Log toot jaate hain ghar banane mein / Tum taras nahin khaate bastiyan jalane mein (They break themselves in their effort to build a home, you show no mercy in burning their villages”) — as a stark reminder of the 1987 riots. Over the next two years, he wrapped up the vestiges of his life in Meerut, selling what remained of his property and possessions. In 1989, after being appointed the chairperson of the Urdu Sahitya Academy, he moved to Bhopal and stayed on. In 1999, he was awarded the Padma Shri for his contribution to literature. The same year, he received the Sahitya Akademi Award in Urdu. Earlier this year, a physical copy of his PhD degree was finally sent to his Bhopal home, nearly 50 years after he had been conferred his doctorate on the post-colonial Urdu ghazal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/30-yrs-after-poet-bashir-badrs-house-was-burnt-down-in-riots-his-work-to-be-taught-at-meerut-university/articleshow/83153475.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||India||Not taking it out on Alapan for Mamata’s behaviour: Centre||NEW DELHI: The fight between the Modi regime and the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal continued on Tuesday, with the Centre strongly rebutting the Trinamool Congress boss's claim that she could not participate in the review meeting chaired by the prime minister to assess the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas because she was informed about Narendra Modi's visit and engagements quite late. The government also refuted Banerjee’s claim that the PM had allowed her to leave without attending the meeting. Responding to the two claims made by Banerjee to deny she was rude to the PM, sources at the Centre said, “The PM’s visit was to assess damage due to Cyclone Yaas, so it could not be finalised before the visitation. In fact, similar timeline was followed when the PM visited Bengal last year after Cyclone Amphan. This time, both Odisha and Bengal were informed at the same time. However, Odisha managed the programme very well despite it being the PM's first stop." Sources rejected Banerjee's assertion that she had cut short her engagements to participate in the PM's meeting and maintained that the Trinamool boss boycotted the meeting to protest against the presence of leader of opposition Subhendu Adhikar. Once a trusted aide of Banerjee, Adhikari crossed over to BJP before the polls and went on to defeat the CM. Rejecting Banerjee’s statement that she had waited to meet the PM, sources said Modi landed at Kalaikunda at 1.59 pm and Banerjee landed at Kalaikunda at 2.10 pm. “It is clear that it was the PM who was made to wait for Mamata Banerjee as he landed much before her. This was also confirmed by a TMC MP who tweeted that there was no big deal in the PM being kept waiting,” a source said, referring to TMC MP Mohua Moitra’s tweets. Sources said while the CM walked 500 metres to reach the building where the PM was holding the review meeting, she had left by 2.35 pm without, as required by protocol, taking the PM's leave. Sources also denied that the Centre was taking its ire out on former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay. Denying that the Centre had acted unilaterally and was being vindictive towards Bandyopadhyay, who after opting for retirement has joined the Bengal government as advisor, sources said, “The order is perfectly constitutional since the chief secretary is an All India Services officer. He chose to ignore his constitutional duties, as a result of which no presentation was given to the PM and no officer of the Bengal government attended the PM’s review meeting." They went on to add that the very fact that Bandyopadhyay was given an extension at the Bengal government's instance showed that the Centre was not acting in a partisan manner. Similarly, Bandyopadhyay taking retirement was evidence that Banerjee and her government knew that they were on a weak wicket in terms of rules and procedure, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-taking-it-out-on-alapan-for-mamatas-behaviour-centre/articleshow/83160329.cms||Akhilesh Singh

He also alleged that Neetu managed to get a clean chit from the SIT due to his political approach and also alleged that now the leader was threatening him.Sunny has sent these videos to Mani Khehra, brother of deceased Rinkle, of Amarpura.Rinkle was murdered in September 2018 by a group of miscreants, who had barged into his house and brutally assaulted him to death. Neetu, his son and accomplices were booked in the case. Later, an SIT was also formed to investigate the murder that gave a clean chit to Neetu. However, his son and other accused were arrested, who are now out on bail.In the videos Sunny has also alleged that Neetu and his sons were the main conspirators and had arranged everything to them, including the rooms where they had stayed a night before the murder. Sunny has also stated that he would become key witness in this case.Meanwhile, Mani Khehra said, “Now when the accused has come on record and has spilled the beans about the murder, I will approach commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal and DGP Dinkar Gupta on Wednesday and demand justice. We will approach the high court, if we do not get justice.”Neetu said, “The SIT has given me a clean chit in the case. Moreover the case is before the high court, therefore, I would not like to comment on this matter. Besides, if Mani Khehra is in touch with Sunny, he can get him arrested.”’ ADCP-1 Pragya Jain refused to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/cong-councillor-neetu-ordered-hit-absconding-accused-on-social-media/articleshow/83153470.cms||Payal Dhawan

From branded garment outlets, street kiosks, books shops, and garages to even firecracker stores opened on Tuesday as government allowed non-essential shops to open after 55 days and expanded the opening times. However, not many customers were seen in the shops. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) order said standalone shops and those not in malls or shopping centres could remain open till 7 am to 2 pm. TOI toured around the city from 12 noon to 2 pm to see that shops in entire rows of markets areas were open. Shops were seen open even in smaller shopping centre like buildings having a group of shops. Such instances could be seen in Dharampeth, Sadar, and Central Avenue. Nagpur Central, a multi-brand store also popularly known as Central Mall too had opened. The management said technically it was not a mall because there were no movie theatre or food court there . “Only stores of different brand were operating in same complex. This does not mean that we are a mall,” said a store management official. The space is let out to major brands ranging from garments to other accessories, said a staffer here. Nirbhay Jain, the deputy municipal commissioner, in-charge of the opening up said in order to maintain uniformity in all the cities of the state, it has been decided to allow all shops except those in malls to operate. A senior NMC official said there was no clear definition of a standalone shop. When Tukaram Mundhe was the civic chief, any shop that had no other shops in its sides was considered as standalone. This means it has to be a single shop in a given stretch. This time the norm is not being followed anywhere in the state. Earlier, another NMC official requesting anonymity also confirmed that shops in market area are not to be considered as standalone. Ashwin Mehadia, president of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), said they have been insisting that all shops should be allowed to open. They have also given an undertaking the safety norms will be followed fully. Traders have agreed that restrictions can be imposed again if the Covid cases begin rising after seven days. It was a relief for a number of small businessmen who were back to work after nearly two months. Forty eight year old Mahendra Soni had finally got a job in a roadside shoe shop at Sitabuldi. He would be getting Rs6,000 a month, said Soni. The earlier job at a restaurant where he was paid Rs12,000 was lost during lockdown. Soni, who has a 10-year-old daughter, said it was difficult to make ends meet and he depended on relatives for daily needs. Kishore Ingole, a number plate painter near Dharampeth, said he could barely manage for a month if the restrictions continued. A fifty year old, Ingole said he was left with only Rs10,000. Vasudev Anjankar, a blind person in his sixties, also ventured out to beg at Sitabuldi. “I live with my wife at Mahal and beg for a living. I had not come out of the house for so many days. I did not know that the curbs have been eased,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/markets-go-live-again-but-not-many-customers-seen-on-day-1/articleshow/83155080.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Dye exports down 12%, intermediates by 25% in FY21||AHMEDABAD: The exports of dyes and dye intermediates from India declined in fiscal 2020-21due to the Covid-19 induced disruptions in the domestic and international markets. Gujarat alone accounts for almost 70-75% of the total dyes and dye intermediates exported from the country. In value terms, the dyes exports from India declined by 12% at $2.3 billion (approximately Rs 16,790 crore considering the value of rupee at 73 against the US dollar) in the financial year 2020-21, shows data compiled by Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). The dyes’ exports had stood at US$ 2.6 billion (Rs 18,980 crore) in 2019-20. The exports of dyes intermediates dropped 25% from $193 million (Rs 1,409 crore) to $144 million (about Rs 1,051 crore), the Chemexcil data further shows. “The negative growth in exports is mainly because the chemical industry’s operations were hampered in the first quarter (April-May-June) of fiscal 2021 due to the Covid-19pandemic induced disruptions and the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus infections,” said Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat region, Chemexcil. Agreed Yogesh Parikh, the immediate past president, Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers Association (GDMA). “The major dye and dye intermediates importing countries such as Turkey, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Italy had seen lockdowns and restrictions following the pandemic, which ultimately pulled down the exports down,” added Parikh. Gujarat is a home to some 1,500 dyes and dyestuff manufacturing units. The exports, of not just dyes and but also of other chemicals, gradually picked up as the year progressed and they showed significant improvement in February and March. Hence, the overall exports of different chemicals from India were down only by 2.6% to $17.6 billion in FY21 from $18.1 billion in the previous financial year. The reduction was largely due to the drop in exports of dyes and organic chemicals. Gujarat’s share in India’s total chemical exports is around 60%, said industry players“If there were less disruptions in the first quarter, the growth would have been in a positive trajectory,” he added. The exports, however, have again took a beating in May as the fierce second wave of the pandemic gripped the state and the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dye-exports-down-12-intermediates-by-25-in-fy21/articleshow/83158446.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Hyderabad||Largest Sputnik vaccine batch of 3 million doses flies into Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Around 3 million doses of Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V landed in Hyderabad from Russia on Tuesday morning. This is the largest consignment of Covid-19 vaccines to fly into India to fight the pandemic. The shipment also included the bulk substance of Sputnik that will be headed to Panacea Biotec for fill-finish of the vaccine into vials, sources said. The 56.5 MT shipment arrived on a special chartered freighter RU-9450 that touched down at Hyderabad airport after 3.30 am, GMR Hyderabad Air Cargo (GHAC) said. According to GHAC, the cargo was quickly dispatched to Dr Reddy’s Labs, the Indian partner of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The first tranche of Sputnik V that landed on May 1 comprised 1.5 lakh doses of the first component of the vaccine - Ad26 - while the second shipment that landed on May 16 contained 60,000 doses of the second component of the vaccine – Ad5. The arrival of the latest shipment now paves the way for a full-fledged rollout of the Russian vaccine at a time when the country’s vaccination drive has been hobbled by acute shortages. Sputnik V was the third vaccine to be granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the Indian drug regulator in mid-April after Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield (the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine). A commercial rollout of Sputnik V is slated by mid-June once the latest consignment is approved after testing at the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) at Kasauli. The testing process is expected to take about a couple of weeks. Dr Reddy’s had announced a soft launch of the vaccine in India on May 14 with a limited pilot to test the cold chain by administering the vaccine to its own employees in tie-up with Apollo Hospitals. While the vaccine requires specialised handling and storage at temperatures between -18 to -20C, Dr Reddy’s is already working on generating additional stability data for storing the vaccine in the 2 to 8C range to enable a wider rollout of the vaccine nationwide. The imported doses of the vaccine have been priced at Rs 995 per dose, including a GST of 5%, by Dr Reddy’s Labs and Apollo Hospitals will be administering it at around Rs 1250 per dose. The vaccine pricing is expected to come down once the local manufacturing comes into play. RDIF has tied up with five Indian manufacturers for churning out 852 million doses, which is enough to vaccinate 426 million people, while Dr Reddy’s has tied up with Bengaluru-based Shilpa Medicare for another 100 million-odd people equivalent doses. Dr Reddy’s is also planning to approach the drug regulatory authorities soon to seek approval for the single-dose version called Sputnik Light that comprises only the first dose (Ad26) of the vaccine and has shown an efficacy of 79.4%. The company is mulling urging the regulator to waive off the requirement to conduct fresh clinical trials for the single-dose jab. The two-dose Sputnik V showed an interim efficacy of 91.4% and in April this year, its developers Gamaleya and RDIF said the vaccine had shown 97.6% efficacy going by real world data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/largest-sputnik-v-batch-of-3-million-doses-flies-into-city/articleshow/83156329.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Sputnik doses made by Hetero get nod for Phase-III trials||HYDERABAD: A month after the expert panel’s go-ahead to Hetero Biopharma for conducting Phase III trials of the India-made doses of Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V, the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) at Kasauli has cleared the first batch manufactured by Hetero for use in the trials. Sources at the Hyderabad-based Hetero Group confirmed that CDL Kasauli has okayed the first batch of the ‘Made in India’ Sputnik V doses manufactured by Hetero at its facilities in Hyderabad, clearing the decks for conducting bridging trials on around 300 volunteers over the next couple of months. The subject expert committee (SEC) advising Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had asked Hetero to study the immunogenicity samples of locally-made Sputnik V doses on Day 21, 28 and 42 of giving the jabs. It also asked Hetero to assess the neutralising antibodies and gamma interferon during the study of the vaccine that comprises two human adenoviral vectors – Ad26 and Ad5 -- to be injected 21 days apart. The current norms require local manufacturers to conduct separate phase III studies as the emergency use authorisation (EUA) granted in mid-April to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories was only for the imported Sputnik V doses that were tested on 1,600 participants of the Phase II/III trials. The other Indian manufacturers roped in by Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) too will have to conduct separate trials before rolling out their shots unless exempted by the regulator, something Dr Reddy’s plans to do for speeding the vaccine’s rollout in India. Hetero Biopharma tied up with RDIF in November 2020 for local manufacture of 100 million doses of Sputnik V. RDIF has also tied up with Panacea Biotec (100 m), Gland Pharma (252 m), Virchow Biotech (200m), Stelis Biopharma (200m) and Shilpa Biologicals (100m), which adds up to over 952 million doses per annum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-doses-made-by-hetero-get-nod-for-phase-iii-trials/articleshow/83156238.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Rajkot||Rajkot’s industrial sector gets IT edge||Rajkot: In midst of Rajkot’s engineering industry and commodity trading, information technology (IT) industry too entered the scene with baby steps eight years ago and hasn’t looked back. Today, the cluster has created its own milestones and competing with Bengaluru’s IT hub. Several players in the city are providing total solution to various universities and educational institutions of India. While the rise in educational sector is around 400 percent, IT industry’s turnover from education sector was around Rs 12 crore, which has touched around Rs 50 crores. The biggest break-even came for the nascent industry during the Covid-induced pandemic period with “concurrency testing” — a concept that made conducting online exams of thousands of students at the same time possible when India was new to such a massive technological change. The situation forced the majority of educational institutes to adopt online education and exam systems. These IT companies started to provide institution with end-to-end solutions — from getting time tables from education institutions to communicating with students, handling papers and providing students and teachers technical support in appearing in exams to checking papers. According to a rough estimate Rajkot-based IT companies providing solutions to nearly 1,000 educational institutes and universities across India. Not only that, the firms also prepared AI (artificial intelligence)-based software that prevented copying or using any unfair means in exams. A camera would monitor students automatically and signal if anybody tried to copy or hear any voice there. Bhavesh Gadhethariya, whose company provides IT solutions to 30 universities and educational institutions across the India, said, “Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkota, Maharashtra technical university, two Karnataka-based universities, agriculture universities are our clients. There are very few players in India who can provide the solution to conduct tests at mass level (40 to 50,000 students) and that too, descriptive exams. We are proud to be one of them.” In 2019, Paytm had made a strategic investment in Gadhethariya’s company. There are many more entrepreneurs like him in Rajkot’s IT cluster riding the digital wave. Another entrepreneur Nilesh Gambhava said, “I have several private universities in Gujarat and Bengaluru-based universities using our solutions. I also got several clients in the past one year after the lockdown. The Covid situation has provided the IT industry an opportunity in the education field and it’s increasing every day.” Ronak Raiyani, president of Rajkot Information Technology Association (RITA) said, “Rajkot’s IT firms not only provide exam-based solutions, but are also handling management of entire universities throughout the year. Ahmedabad has the benefit of resources, but Rajkot is not lagging behind in terms of providing service and getting good clientele.” “Rajkot-based companies are preparing online learning solutions like mobile apps for several educational institutions,” said Jaydeep Nandani, chairman of RITA. Multilateral software allows people in big numbers to interact, share videos, and submit materials is in demand in the education sector currently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkots-industrial-sector-gets-it-edge/articleshow/83152710.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

They are available only in Hyderabad’s Niloufer Hospital, he said. Wanting the government to respond, the bench said: “There are 8,000 beds for children in Maharashtra.” The bench was also critical of the DPH’s affidavit because he failed to explain when would the proposed 14 RT-PCR labs become functional. “Though we have asked him to inform us of the status of the constitution of the experts’ committee to advise the government, he has failed to make any mention about the same...,” the bench said. The bench was also dissatisfied with government’s reply on private hospitals conducting an oxygen audit on their own. “,,,We asked you to appoint a nodal officer to oversee O2 supply and usage,” the bench said. “We asked you to issue revised GOs capping the prices of CT scan, PPE kits, etc., to meet the demands of the second wave, but it was not done. Nor was anything mentioned about it in the affidavit despite asking for it in the last hearing,” the bench added before posting the case to Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-20-oxygen-beds-for-children-in-state-hc-told/articleshow/83156199.cms||---

They plan to launch a campaign against these attempts being made to stall the development of Surat airport by creating awareness through personal meetings and social media campaigns. “One section of the builder lobby is trying to promote the idea of the need for more skyscrapers. Through this, they are trying to create pressure on various stakeholders including government bodies. In the past too this lobby floated the idea of shifting the airport to Navsari,” said Sanjay Jain, a WWWAS member. Around 95,000 members of WWWAS, majority of whom are frequent flyers are worried ever since the discussion over skyscraper development started in the city. It is argued that due to the funnel area on both ends of the Surat Airport there is no space left for the development of skyscrapers in a large portion of Vesu or Dumas. “Vesu and Dumas are not the only areas left where skyscrapers can be developed. But the issue is being raised by some people just to stall the development of the airport which is on a growth path after a long battle,” added Jain. In the past, the idea of shifting the airport to Navsari’s Jalalpore taluka was floated but the aviation activists had opposed it then too. “We should develop a new airport in nearby locations with an international terminal. The existing airport can continue as a domestic terminal,” said an activist. Jain said, “We will meet political leaders and government officials to explain our point. We will show them options for skyscrapers and create awareness among masses through social media.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/activists-allege-bid-to-stall-surat-airport-development/articleshow/83152565.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: OPD centres help bring down admission numbers||HYDERABAD: Intermediary Covid-19 outpatients services commenced across government healthcare centres have successfully completed as many as 13,05,793 consultations. The consultations include those suspected of Covid-19, symptomatic persons, and other patients under home isolation who want medical advice. “These centres have played a part in preventing people from taking wrong decision by following social media (advice) or following their own routine (for Covid-19 treatment). The centres have also helped in identifying cases which can possibly become critical. One of the key reasons for the rate of hospital admissions coming down is this early identification of critical conditions,” said a senior health official. The outpatient services had started on May 6 across 1,518 designated centres. So far, 2,57,277 home isolation kits have been distributed to those who are symptomatic or have tested positive. The outpatient centres were started across the state after the second wave of cases and are meant to provide preventive care as well as treatment for people. “These are like one-stop centres for people and outpatient services for Covid-19. Survey numbers are not exactly a reflection of case load but they have effectively prevented the spread. We saw the number of cases coming down even before lockdown while the lockdown too has helped curb the spread of infections further,” said director of medical education Dr K Ramesh Reddy. At these centres, one can walk in for advice on testing, treatment and even take a home isolation should they require one. These outpatient centres have been set up at primary healthcare centres (PHC), community health centres, and even at district government hospitals. Apart from Hyderabad and its surrounding districts, other areas in the state, where not many hospitals are available, have seen a high number of consultations as a result of these outpatient centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/opd-centres-helping-bring-down-admission-nos/articleshow/83156086.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Pandemic hits development of children with autism||HYDERABAD: While the Covid-19 pandemic altered daily routines at home and school for children in unprecedented ways, it was especially tough for children with autism, who may be more susceptible to the stress of change. The six-year-old son of Ravi Prakash Reddy, an IT professional, is among those stressed out due to the lockdown. Diagnosed with autism two-years ago, the boy’s routine saw a significant change, says the worried father. “We saw improvements when he was attending therapy sessions for a year before the pandemic. When the pandemic forced the city into lockdown and even before that when the cases were increasing, we couldn’t send him for the therapy sessions. We did not see the impact initially, but the lockdown caused an absolute lack of stimulus for any kind of development,” said Reddy. Mental health therapists TOI spoke to said that delaying regular therapy sessions of autistic children due to the fear of contracting Covid-19 might have an impact on the child’s functional status which is crucial during the initial four years of age. “The first four years of life are considered golden years for children with autism. As 95% of the brain development happens during these initial years, early diagnosis and regular therapy sessions can make a significant change in a child’s functional status,” said P Shoban Kumar, chief psychologist, Pinnacle Blooms Network. “Delaying therapy sessions due to the fear of contracting Covid-19 will definitely have an impact. Children will not develop effective social skills and may speak or behave in ways that create challenges. We instruct parents to take all precautions to avoid being infected by Covid-19, nevertheless, ensure the child does not miss even a single day of therapy at any cost,” said Kumar. However, as the state government is slowly easing the lockdown restrictions, parents and therapists of children with autism are working towards correcting new patterns of cognitive and behavioural development. “Lack of direct communication with therapists may have made things difficult for children with autism. However, since the lockdown is slowly being lifted, the sessions have resumed now, and we can help children overcome the stress of change. Discontinuing therapy sessions will only delay the recovery process,” said Surya Prakash, a clinical psychologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pandemic-hits-development-of-children-with-autism/articleshow/83156569.cms||Moulika.KV

The incident occurred in April, but came to light on Monday when a private bank official lodged a complaint with Hyderabad cyber crime police about an attempt by fraudsters to siphon money off frozen bank accounts in their Gurgaon branch. Kolkata Police, too, said they received a complaint from the bank last month. “A probe is on. We are cooperating with Hyderabad Police. Besides technical help, the STF is also probing the leads,” an officer said. According to the complaint, on April 21, a man approached the private bank branch in Alipore with a fake letter saying that the office-in-charge, cyber cell police, Lalbazar, has directed the bank to defreeze 12 accounts and transfer the amount to an SBI account. “The fraudster also showed a fake police ID card and the bank officials transferred around Rs 1.2 crore to the SBI account,” cyber crime ACP KVM Prasad said. “From the SBI account, the money was transferred to multiple accounts and withdrawn immediately,” he added. Police sources said around Rs 1.2 crore was initially transferred to an SBI account of Anand J in RGI Airport SBI branch. “The details of the account holder are all fake,” police said. A Kolkata Police officer said: “We are also investigating how the accused had first called up the branch manager, threatened him with police summons and then came down to the bank to force him to unlock the frozen accounts.” The fraudsters also sent a fake letter in the name of Hyderabad cyber crime police to Udyog Vihar branch of ICICI bank in Gurgaon in the third week of April, asking them to unfreeze 39 accounts linked to a loan app fraud case registered in Hyderabad. “In the letter, instructions were given to transfer the amount from frozen accounts to four accounts. But the bank officials alerted their Hyderabad office,” the ACP said. Bank officials verified with police and realised that the letter was fake and during the inquiry found out about the fraud at Kolkata. “We have registered a case pertaining to the fake Hyderabad Police letter received by the ICICI bank in Gurgaon. The bank filed a separate complaint in Kolkata about the fraud committed in Alipore,” Hyderabad cyber crime inspector D Prashant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-1-2cr-stolen-from-pvt-bank-in-multi-city-fraud/articleshow/83155113.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Hyderabad||What steps taken to curb private hospitals’ greed?: Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday asked the state government to explain the steps it has taken to rein in the private hospitals from exploiting families in the name of Covid-19 treatment and penalise the errant hospitals. The court gave 24 hours time to the director of public health (DPH) to inform it on the number of cases where the government has recovered excess money from the errant hospitals for collecting exorbitant charges from Covid-19 patients. The judges said it was not fair to leave the people to legal remedies after they sold their gold and properties to cater to the greed of the private hospitals in the second wave of pandemic. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said this after going through an affidavit filed by DPH Dr G Srinivasa Rao, who informed the court on115 show-cause notices issued to errant private hospitals. “It is ok to issue show-cause notices, but tell us the efforts you made to deliver justice to the exploited families. Let the director of the public health appear before us on Wednesday virtually and explain the steps taken so far,” the judges said addressing advocate general BS Prasad. The judges while resuming the hearing in the Covid-19 batch of PILs were unhappy with the incomplete affidavit filed by Dr Srinivasa Rao who failed to answer many queries raised by them in the last hearing. Senior counsel L Ravi Chander and advocate Chikkudu Prabhakar doubted the wisdom in cancelling the licence of some of the hospitals to offer Covid-19 treatment. “If they are found guilty of wrongdoing, then they should go lock, stock and barrel and they should not remain in the field at all,” they said. The judges said it is better to make them shell out excess money. “If you straightaway cancel their licence, then it would be a fait accompli. And it is not advisable to reduce the number of functioning hospitals during a pandemic,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-what-steps-taken-to-curb-pvt-hosps-greed/articleshow/83156165.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Bio E in pact with Canada’s Providence for mRNA vaccine||HYDERABAD: Biopharma major Biological E has entered into an agreement with Providence Therapeutics Holdings Inc for licensing the Canadian player’s mRNA vaccine candidate PTX-COVID-19-B for the Indian market as well as some other markets. As part of the tie-up, Providence will transfer the technology for manufacturing its mRNA vaccines in India to Biological E with a targeted capacity of 1 billion doses in 2022 and a minimum production capacity of 600 million doses, Biological E said on Tuesday. Apart from this, Providence will also export 30 million vaccine doses to India from its existing North American facilities. Biological E said it will be responsible for all clinical development and regulatory activities, including applying for emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the mRNA vaccine in India and other jurisdictions licensed by it. However, Biological E did not disclose the names of the other countries for which it has inked the licencing agreement nor did it divulge any financial terms of the transaction. The Hyderabad-based vaccine maker only said that the two players have executed a term sheet for a definitive licensing and collaboration agreement that also outlines the terms for sale by Providence of up to 30 million doses of its proprietary messenger RNA vaccine to Biological E and other end-buyers. “This sale represents the sale of all the remaining 2021 Providence production, plus a portion of the early 2022 Providence production, after accounting for the first sale of Providence vaccines to the Province of Manitoba, Canada,” Biological E said. Pointing out that mRNA platform has emerged as the front runner in delivering the first vaccines for emergency use to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, Biological E’s managing director Mahima Datla said the company hopes to provide yet India and other countries yet another shot at ramping up efforts towards achieving herd immunity. Providence CEO Brad Sorenson said the collaboration is an important commitment by the Canadian company to help India and other nations vaccinate their citizens against Covid-19. Apart from this, Biological E is also working on a two-dose recombinant protein Covid-19 vaccine with Texas-based Baylor College of Medicine that is currently in Phase III trials and expects to make 75-80 million doses per month of the vaccine from August this year. It has also entered into a tie-up with Johnson & Johnson for manufacturing 500-600 million doses per annum of the US giant's single-shot Covid-19 vaccine in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bio-e-in-pact-with-canadas-providence-for-mrna-vax/articleshow/83156401.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Vadodara||Patients needing BiPAP, ICU down 50% in less than a month||Vadodara: The number of Covid-19 patients in a critical condition on BiPAP or ventilators in the city and district has reduced significantly and has pipped the reduction in the number of active cases. With few critical cases, the number of deaths is also expected to go down significantly. According to data disclosed by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) in its health bulletins, the number of patients on BiPAPs or ventilators went down from 372 on May 4 to only 127 on June 1. Against this, the number of active cases dipped from 8,882 to 6,824 on the same days. Officials had earlier believed that while the number of new and hospitalised cases may go down rapidly, those in a critical condition on BiPAPs and ventilators would remain as such patients stayed in the hospital for a longer time. Such critical patients are mostly on BiPAPs with only a few on ventilators. Sources said that a major reason for BiPAP/ventilator beds remaining occupied in large numbers was that patients from the rural areas of the district were being shifted to the city in serious condition. At that stage, nearly half the new cases every day were from the rural parts of the district outside VMC limits. There was often a delay in bringing cases from the rural areas to hospitals making patients serious. Many such patients had to be accommodated in ICU beds including those on BiPAP/ventilators. Late presentation of cases particularly from rural areas is something that had raised concern in the second wave. The rapid reduction in the number of Covid cases was seen not only in Vadodara city and district but also in nearby districts leading to a drastic fall in hospitalisation. Against a peak hospitalisation of around 11,100 on May 4, the number on Tuesday night stood at 2,954. Against four vacant BiPAP/ventilator beds on May 4, the number stood at 426 on Tuesday. The number of such beds has also been reduced to 1,030 from 1,153.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/patients-needing-bipap-icu-down-50-in-less-than-a-month/articleshow/83151176.cms||Sachin Sharma

On the basis of a request by Gujarat Electronic and Software Industries Association (GESIA), the Gujarat government initiated the project to create infrastructure for a new IT hub in 2019. However, the pandemic struck and the project had to be put on hold. Now, after several rounds of consultations with GESIA and private sector IT companies, GIDC has started the project again. GIDC and GESIA have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the project. M Thennarasan, managing director, GIDC, said tendering and other processes to begin construction , as approved by the state government, has been initiated. “Despite considerable presence of the IT and ITeS industries in the state, the IT sector has not reached its full potential. To provide impetus to the sector, GESIA had made representations to the government and GIDC through letters and emails on the need to develop and build a technology hub with the allied eco-system in Gandhinagar,” the official said. He added that under the IT policy, various incentives and benefits are given to IT Parks and GIFT City was strategically selected as it being developed as a part of industry promotion. He further said, “Adhering to construction norms of GIFT City, GIDC has designed a ground floor plus 28-floor building to bring IT-related companies under one roof with shared infrastructure. It is also planned to create co-working spaces.” The official said GIFT City had allotted 6 lakh square feet of built-up area at the rate of Rs 850 per square foot. “Moreover, GESIA has submitted an EOI (expression of interest) of about 38 companies and proposed investment was worked out to be approximately Rs 405 crore with employment to over 9,000 persons. The industry is expected to invest Rs 1,000 crore in the new IT hub,” Thennarasan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gidc-starts-rs-405cr-it-hub-project/articleshow/83158454.cms||Kapil Dave

Though NMC’s notification was clear that only standalone non-essential shops, and not those located in malls and shopping complexes, will reopen, many shops were found violating the rules. NDS members said traders, especially from Gandhibagh, Mangalwari, and Satranjipura zones misinterpreted the rule and kept their establishments open in chaotic commercial places. Shops near Kamal Chowk too were found open. The situation was similar in Itwari, Gokulpeth, Sakkardara and other areas. The NDS teams were on their toes patrolling the city’s commercial areas to ensure all traders followed the new notification, said NDS commandant Virsen Tambe. The civic cops also faced resistance from many shopkeepers against the action. “We managed to close most shops which were found open against the new rule,” he said. In all, the NDS team on Tuesday penalized 23 shopkeepers and collected a fine of Rs1.73 lakh from them. The NDS team, along with the Gandhibagh zone, acted the most against shopkeepers breaking the Covid-19 protocol, said Tambe. Here, the team penalized five shopkeepers and shut over 50 shops for violating rules. Even a wine shop on Central Avenue was found open. The team imposed a fine of Rs15,000 on the shopkeeper — PS Jaiswal. Dharampeth and Mangalwari zones fined four shops each in commercial areas like Sadar, Dharampeth, Gokulpeth markets etc. In most places, the NDS team faced difficulties in explaining the new notification to the shopkeepers. Despite a clear ‘no’ to functioning of gyms and restaurants, the NDS team found Calcutta Roll and Perfect Fitness Gym at Kadbi Chowk violating the Covid-19 protocol. The team here imposed a fine of Rs5,000 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/confused-over-break-the-chain-rules-many-end-up-paying-fine/articleshow/83155142.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

A meeting with local body heads will be held on Wednesday to discuss about the project and to prepare list of the beneficiaries in each limit. Ernakulam on Tuesday recorded 2,081 new Covid-positive cases, including 2,068 contact ones. As many as 13 health workers and 21 guest workers tested positive for Covid. The highest number of cases of the day was reported from Thrikkakara with 149, followed by Kalamassery 71. West Kochi reported more than 245 cases. Test positivity was 15.6%.

Weathermen have attributed the showers in Patna, Vaishali, Saran, Gopalganj, Gaya and other districts to pre-monsoon Nor’wester activities, primarily due to high level of moisture amid surging temperature. The high level of moisture in the atmosphere was left behind by cyclone Yaas, which crossed Bihar last Friday after making landfall in Odisha coast on May 22. Meanwhile, the IMD, in its all-India bulletin issued on Tuesday evening, forecast thundershowers with lightning in the state even on Wednesday. Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre, said, “The thundershowers in Patna and many other places in the state on Tuesday was Nor’wester activity, which is a typical weather phenomenon of the pre-monsoon season.” “The high level of moisture and surging mercury created conducive conditions for formation of cumulonimbus clouds as part of Nor’wester activities. Light to moderate showers along with gusty winds occurred in south as well as north Bihar, mostly during the late noon hours. Such thundery weather is likely to occur on Wednesday as well and it will subside after dry and hot westerly winds start blowing in the region,” Sanjay said. As per meteorology, excess heating of the land amid high level of moisture during pre-monsoon season helps in formation of cumulonimbus clouds, bringing rain accompanied by gusty winds. The Nor’westers hitting Bihar usually originate from Chhotanagpur plateau region, when air over the plateau heats up and gains altitude with moisture support from any weather system in the region. Meanwhile, the IMD is likely to officially announce the onset of southwest monsoon in Kerala coast by June 3 and the normal date for arrival of the rain-bearing winds in Bihar is June 15-18. “There are several criteria to declare onset of southwest monsoon in Kerala coast, including rainfall and winds. For instance, at least 2.5mm rainfall should occur for at least two days in a row at a certain wind speed. However, the criterion of wind speed has not been fulfilled till date. It is expected that onset of monsoon in Kerala will be declared by June 3," Shailendra Kumar Patel, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/norwester-triggers-thundershowers-in-state/articleshow/83153500.cms||Piyush Tripathi

---||Nagpur||Ex-mayor in HC against hospitals & labs ‘looting’ Covid-19 patients||Nagpur: After receiving several complaints from patients against private hospitals and pathology laboratories allegedly “looting” them under the Covid-19 treatment and related tests, former mayor Sandip Joshi knocked the judiciary’s doors demanding an inquiry against all of them. The application, also having five patients allegedly exploited by various hospitals, is filed in the ongoing suo motu PIL based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed as amicus curiae. Even Joshi had roped in Bhandarkar to plead his case where he prayed for a uniform policy for capping the rates of coronavirus treatment across all hospitals and also for diagnostic tests conducted by the various pathology labs across Maharashtra to stop fleecing of the patients. The senior BJP corporator further demanded revaluation and recalculation of all medical bills filed by the complainants from the experts. The registration of hospitals, which would be found guilty of inflating the bills, should be cancelled with immediate effect for violations of provisions of law and orders issued by the competent authority related to charging of patients, he said. The four time corporator from Laxmi Nagar sought directives to the government for having a standard operating procedure (SOP) to deal with the patients’ complaints. He further accused the hospitals of not following the orders regarding treatment rates mentioned in September 19, 2020 notification and also asking patients to repeat same tests to inflate the bills. Citing numerous instances, the senior BJP functionary said one hospital charged a whopping Rs5 lakh under the head of medical management from the patient while other charged Rs80,000 towards bed charges without ventilator. Another hospital charged Rs24 lakh from a patient as he was admitted for a month. Blaming the competent authority — the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) — for inaction despite having powers under the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act, for acting against the hospitals, Joshi sought judiciary’s help in the issue to provide succour to the aggrieved patients. Joshi to protest at Pachpaoli police station today Sandip Joshi would be joining the protests of Kadekar family in front of Pachpaoli Police Station on Wednesday. In Joshi’s presence, the family had lodged a complaint against a private hospital for alleged negligence that led to the death of Dilip Kadekar on May 12. However, no action has been taken against the hospital administration till date. According to Joshi, despite repeated letters to the police, they were only getting answers that the probe was underway since last 18 days. He claimed that the police officials also threatened him and the family against organising the protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-mayor-in-hc-against-hospitals-labs-looting-covid-19-patients/articleshow/83155189.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The televisions and smartphones of many people were either damaged or broken in the recent sea flooding and erosion during the Tauktae cyclone and resultant rains. Voluntary organizations are trying to minimize the digital divide by providing phones with the help of sponsors. “There was severe damage to the house due to the sea flooding. My daughter Anugraha’s studies are now affected as she cannot attend the online classes. She does not have a phone and the television we bought recently was damaged by the waves. I am trying to buy a new phone but it is not affordable now,” said Antony Pollayil, a resident. V T Sebastian, patron of Janakiyavedi said that this time the sea turned rough unexpectedly and people did not get enough time to shift their belongings to safer places. Due to this the TVs, laptops and mobile phones of many people were either lost in the seawater or got damaged beyond repairs. Many of the kids are unable to attend the digital classes due to this. “Also, many students lost their entire textbooks and notebooks. Chellanam Janakiyavedi is trying to provide smartphones to these kids with the help of well-wishers. But students are already fed up by the frequent sea erosion and they are afraid,” he said. Many of the families, who lived close to the beach, have left their homes and migrated to safer places over the last two weeks as the coast is expected to witness another sea erosion with the advent of the monsoons. Many people have rented out houses in the interior parts of Chellanam as their houses were damaged by the strong waves. “Many families who moved to relief camps are now under quarantine after testing Covid positive. Chellanam had the highest TPR of 60 in the district after the sea erosion. Many of the children too are in the camps and they don’t have any facilities to attend the online classes,” said Jinson Veluthamannungal, a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kids-at-chellanam-suffer-as-floods-damaged-tv-mobiles/articleshow/83155238.cms||---

Four prisoners released on Tuesday evening from jail were given ‘vaccinated’ certificates too. Another 2,400 prisoners, aged 18 and above, are likely to be vaccinated soon. “Inmates who are 18 and above will be vaccinated in the days to come. It is subject to availability of vaccines. BMC said it will approach the government for vaccination of prisoners who are 18 and above,” said Shishir Joshi, CEO and founder of Project Mumbai. Arthur Road jail is a British era prison built in 1925. Though its official capacity is 804 prisoners, it houses 2,800 inmates. The jail houses 540 hardened inmates, arrested under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), 400 inmates accused in murder cases, 80 facing terror charges and 138 foreigners. Last year, there were more than 100 Covid-19 cases among prisoners and over 40 jail staff contracted the virus. As of Tuesday, the jail was Covid-19 free. Project Mumbai, which was working at Arthur Road jail for the first time, arranged doctors, nurses and data entry operators. It gifted four oxygen concentrators to the prison. A barrack was reserved for vaccination, while those taking vaccines were told to stay in another barrack for observation. Ten beds were arranged at the jail to tackle any emergency, and an ambulance was stationed outside the jail. Those vaccinated were given paracetamol too. “During communication through video calls, families of many prisoners would ask them about vaccination. Since the vaccination drive started, many inmates were excited to take jabs,” said Joshi, adding that Project Mumbai was hoping for similar camps in Byculla women’s prison. To register on Co-Win, the undertrial number was used as many did not have Aadhaar cards inside jail, said a jail official. “The camp at the jail was of great help,” said Nitin Vaychal, superintendent of Arthur Road jail. Earlier, 244 prisoners (aged 45 and above) were vaccinated in batches of 20 for two weeks. They were escorted to Kasturba Hospital. “Today, there was no tension of waiting or escorting,” said a jail official. Six refused to take the jab and gave in writing that they did not want vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ngo-helps-169-arthur-road-jail-inmates-get-jab-more-likely-soon/articleshow/83157520.cms||Mateen Hafeez

The trader, Pabitra Barik’s relatives had a narrow escape. The miscreants fled the spot after the incident. None has been arrested yet in connection with this incident. According to a local sources, the incident took place around 11.30am when Barik was going to visit his uncle’s family living at Sambhunath Das Lane near Sonapatty under the ward 21 of Baranagar Municipality. He, too, was on a two-wheeler. “My uncle died a couple of days ago. I came here to meet his bereaved family members. While I stopped in front of my uncle’s house, I felt a finger touch my neck. While I moved back immediately, I saw that two youths wearing helmets on a bike had already snatched my gold chain. As I shouted, the pillion rider pointed a gun at me. Then they took off my gold bracelet. While I tried to resist them, they opened fire,” Barik said. On hearing the gun shot, Barik’s aunt and her son rushed out of their house to find the snatchers trying to flee. While they raised an alarm, the miscreants also fired at them. “We saw Barik shouting for help while the snatchers were trying to flee. I and my son also raised an alarm to alert the locals. Then one of the bikers raised the gun and fired at us. Luckily, we had a narrow escape while the bullet struck on the wall of our house,” said Shovarani, Barik’s aunt. Cops rushed to the spot and collected CCTV footage that showed that the bikers were fleeing the spot. “There are several people associated with gold trading in the area that is locally known as Sonapatty. We suspect that the miscreants targeted the gold trader. We are scanning the CCTV footage to identify the miscreants,” said a senior police officer of the Barrackpore commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bike-borne-miscreants-open-fire-rob-gold-trader/articleshow/83155179.cms||Sanjib Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||Hacked ATMs: CCTV footage, inputs from other states help cops identify 3||Kolkata: An analysis of CCTV footage from the ATMs of a private bank, from where Rs 2 crore has been siphoned off, and inputs from cops in some other cities of north India have led Kolkata Police to identify three accused involved in the hacking of the machines. Two of them took 30 minutes to an hour to withdraw money from the ATMs, said a police officer. A forensic team visited the New Market ATM on Tuesday and carried out a detailed investigation into the modus operandi of the accused. Sources confirmed that it was a Man-in The Middle (MiTM) hack that involves bypassing the bank’s system. Cops said the accused had taken every measure to keep their identities hidden as they wore masks, full sleeves and goggles. “We have got some leads on their identities,” said a detective department officer. A team is likely to visit Nuh to question one of the accused nabbed by Faridabad police in connection with a similar case. The police charge sheet mentioned that the accused got the idea after a power cut at an ATM while he was withdrawing money. Cops at Lalbazar feel that someone having “complete technical knowledge” about ATMs was behind the thefts. In some of the ATMs, the fraudsters had swiped debit cards more than 60 times to withdraw the money. “We have been able to extract details of the debit cards that were used to withdraw the money but the cards have turned out to be fake,” an officer said. Cops said the agency in charge of ATM maintenance will be asked why it had failed to update the ARMs with the latest RBI guidelines that came several months ago. “The accused found eight ATMs using teller machines. All these ATMs were unguarded and maintained by the same company across the city. Hence, the insider angle is also strong,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hacked-atms-cctv-footage-inputs-from-other-states-help-cops-identify-3/articleshow/83155232.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The man, accused of raping his minor step daughters, wanted the reprieve on a prescription slip indicating his wife’s Covid diagnosis on May 15. “More than 15 days have already elapsed and there is no subsequent report to support the present health or medical condition of the wife of the applicant,” said additional district judge Munish Markan. The man’s counsel submitted that the medical condition of the woman had deteriorated and sought interim bail. The additional public prosecutor, on the other hand, contended that the only document relied upon by the applicant was the prescription slip of his wife. Besides, it was argued that the wife had only been recommended home isolation.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: CAG flags lapses in fish market construction||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city corporation preferred vitrified floor tiles and mirror-finished marble stone to essential items like drainage and water supply in the modern fish market at Palayam rendering it unusable by all means, as per the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) on general and social sector which was tabled in the assembly on Tuesday. The report points out lapses on the part of the corporation while constructing a modern fish market at Palayam. According to the audit report, the market was constructed without proper investigation and without co-relating the design with the requirements of the vendors. This resulted in non-utilization of the modern fish market which was constructed spending Rs 23 lakh. Even the basic aspects like seating facility and vending space were compromised and in the end there wasn’t sufficient width between the tables and the space was insufficient for seating arrangement. “While revising the estimate, the corporation had deleted essential items like plumbing works, water supply, etc, and included non-essential items like replacing ceramic with vitrified tiles for floor, changing the surface of fish vending table from kota stone to mirror finished marble stone, etc. This led to a situation where the fish market was completed without provision for drainage, water, etc, which was essential for normal hygienic operation and maintenance of the fish market,” the report said. It also flags the lapse on the part of the executive engineer who, according to the audit report, failed to verify the actual work done before effecting the payment and resulted in an overpayment of Rs 4.1 lakh to the contractor. The audit findings were confirmed by the state government and it was found that the estimate was technically defective. The contractor had refunded an amount of Rs 3.6 lakhs in 2018, following the state government’s direction to the city corporation. The CAG remarked that local self-government institutions may ensure that utilities being created are designed to meet the requirements of end users and the constructed utilities possess all required facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cag-flags-lapses-in-fish-market-construction/articleshow/83155267.cms||---

Mane was dismissed under Article 311 of the Indian constitution, which makes it possible to sack a government servant without a departmental inquiry if holding such an inquiry is not deemed practicable. Assistant inspectors Sachin Waze, Riyaz Kazi and constable Vinayak Shinde were arrested in the alleged planting of gelatine sticks outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house at Carmichael Road and in connection with Hiran’s murder. They were also dismissed on the same grounds. On March 4, Mane allegedly posed as inspector Tawde and called Hiran to Ghodbunder Road along with Waze and later handed him over to the killers. The National Investigation Agency probe concluded that Mane attended the two conspiracy meetings held at the Mumbai police headquarters and also activated the SIM cards procured from Gujarat to commit the crime. Unlike Waze, Mane too created an alibi by leaving his mobile phone in his office in Kandivli while he himself was present in Thane on the night of Hiran’s murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mansukh-hiran-murder-case-cp-dismisses-mane-under-article-311-in-mumbai/articleshow/83157616.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Rs 30 lakh aid big win for dead teachers' kin||BAREILLY/AGRA/MEERUT: Teachers' unions in UP which had given a list of 1621 teachers who they said had died due to Covid-19 that they contracted during panchayat poll duties have won a big battle against the administration with the state government now announcing that all the families will be compensated. “Teachers who died of Covid-19 on panchayat election duty will be compensated … The compensation amount has been increased from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 30 lakh … Anyone who died within 30 days of their duty is eligible,” said a statement from the chief minister’s office on Monday. Families of the dead teachers welcomed the news with cautious optimism. Jayadevi, the wife of one of them, said: “My daughters are 2, 12, 14 and 16. After my husband died, no government official had come to meet us. I was losing all hope. How would I bring up my children?” The government has also announced it will provide jobs for a member from each family. Jaydevi said it would help see her through. “I am qualified to work as a teacher. If I get a job, my family will be saved.” For 17 years, her husband Pradeep Katara had been working as a shiksha mitra. The job paid Rs 11,000 a month. He had been posted at the primary school in Agra’s Akola block and had been assigned to panchayat election duty at Bah on April 15. Eleven days later, he died while being treated for Covid-19 at a private hospital. For about a month since, Jaydevi was at her wit’s end — she had lost her husband, did not have a job and had four daughters to raise. TOI had first reported that several teachers had died after panchayat election duty when they suddenly displayed Covid-19 symptoms. Days later, the Allahabad high court issued a notice to the UP State Election Commission (SEC) and said “it appears neither police nor the SEC did anything to save people on election duty from getting infected by the virus”. When teachers’ unions started gathering data, they found hundreds had died across the state. The numbers kept rising and by May 17, the unions said 1,621 teachers had died. Two days later, the state government said the numbers were wrong — only three teachers had died. “We are happy the state has acknowledged that many people have died … Our priority is to ensure the names of all teachers who died are verified by their block education officers and sent to the Basic Shiksha Adhikari fast,” said president of UP Prathmik Shikshak Sangh Dinesh Chandra Sharma. “At least they can build a better future for their children.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/big-win-for-kin-of-dead-teachers-in-up-as-govt-promises-rs-30l-compensation/articleshow/83153547.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Nagpur||2nd wave took toll on children’s mental health: Docs||Nagpur: Mental health practitioners told TOI that children, like adults, too have not been spared of the psychological and physical complications during the Covid second wave. Already tied down by lockdown-like restrictions, the news about number of deaths all around have further aggravated problems. Noted psychiatrist Dr Rajesh Rathi, who said he is treating more paediatric patients now, said lockdown and restrictions have aggravated ‘attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)’ among kids. “This is a neuro development condition in children which affects their concentration, making them hyperactive and impulsive,” he said. Dr Shubhada Khirwadkar, well-known paediatrician and psychologist, said the second wave had affected some children who had to take psychological and psychiatric help to overcome their mental issues. “I have treated a few paediatric patients. One lost a parent and went into a shell, showing no interest in food, sleep, rest etc. Parents must try and spot the signs at the earliest,” said Dr Khirwadkar. Some also develop regressive behaviour with “common manifestations like bed-wetting and thumb sucking”. “Covid news is inducing fear in them. When even adults are not ready to accept sudden tragedies, children too can’t be expected to absorb the shocks,” said Dr Khirwadkar. Dr Khirwadkar also said students are facing anxiety disorder problems leading to panic on the uncertainty over exams and their performances. “We are getting paediatric patients with behavioural disorders ranging from screen addictions to irritability,” she said. Psychologist Raakesh Kriplani said a child is likely to suffer ‘post-traumatic stress disorder’ after any kind of deep anxiety. “This comes from the fear of losing someone, uncertainty over future especially career and doubts of getting infected and so on,” he said. Dr Rathi also said children are left shaken after seeing deaths from close quarters. “They are unable to express. Hence, parents must watch out for symptoms like loss of interest or lack of participation in activities, irritation and reduced concentration. Some children struggle to come to terms with the loss of their grandparents,” he said. Well-known psychiatrist Dr Sudhir Bhave also said children with “conduct problems” are common nowadays with their exposure to the social media and screen, and mobile phone addictions. “Parents complain that children have become defiant and demanding,” said Dr Bhave. For this, Dr Bhave said, “Parents must take children into confidence and mutually sort out issues like use of mobile phone, screen time etc.” Paediatrician Dr Vinky Rughwani said he is getting several patients in the age group between eight and 15 years of age for obesity. “In the 5-10 age group, children complain of headache,” he added. Kriplani also said a child’s repeated complain of boredom, nervousness, lack of concentration and so on are the early signs of depression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-wave-took-toll-on-childrens-mental-health-docs/articleshow/83155259.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||After ‘SMS’ last year, sugar control is the mantra post second Covid wave||NAGPUR: If the first Covid wave left us with the three most crucial Covid-appropriate actions of wearing masks, using sanitizers and maintaining social distancing ('SMS' in short), the second wave’s biggest lesson seems to be controlling sugar, especially after mucormycosis (black fungus) and other post-corona complications have left the society reeling. Medical experts advised citizens — especially the ones with diabetes — to check and control their sugar levels with almost the same intensity as following Covid protocols, but black fungus cases went on piling in the district and Nagpur division. With 25 additional cases, Nagpur district now has 1,122 mucormycosis cases and the division has 1,325 cases. Another five deaths in Nagpur district increased its toll to 102 and that of the division to 108, with a death in Gondia too. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said the coronavirus certainly had a strain that could increase the sugar level in the body. “One must control sugar, whether they are diabetic or non-diabetic,” said Shinde. Dr Suresh Gupta, community medicine specialist, said sugar is the determinant or indirect cause for many diseases, not just the fungal ones. “Sugar causes diabetes type-II. Irrespective of whether one is diabetic or not, sugar control can be considered a healthy lifestyle practice. Raised sugar levels can cause many infections apart from mucormycosis when the body’s defence is breached,” he said. With the load of the virus infection, said Dr Gupta, “A pre-diabetic can turn diabetic and face the consequences of it,” adding that adequate exercises, balanced diet, shunning of overeating and striking a balance between calorie intake and output was necessary. “Also, control your blood pressure, otherwise it can lead to hypertension,” he said. Dr Sanjay Deotale, president of the Nagpur chapter of Indian medical association (IMA), said sugar must be diligently controlled now, especially after seeing how Covid and diabetes lead to several complications, including black fungus. “Steroid therapy for different diseases including Covid is known to increase one’s sugar level. It’s a threat for non-diabetic patients too,” said Dr Deotale. Diabetologist Dr Sunil Gupta said there is now a new onset of diabetes after Covid, including among the those in the age group of 30-35 years. “Many patients have either been detected with diabetes during Covid treatment or after recovering,” said Dr Gupta. Diabetes also reduces immunity, Gupta added. “Non-diabetic patients should also check and control their sugar levels,” he said. “A sizeable chunk of the population is pre-diabetic, that is, somewhere between non-diabetic and diabetic. If administered steroids or even under stress, these pre-diabetic patients may turn into diabetic ones,” he said. Gupta suggested that if there is a family history of diabetes then every person in his 30s must check blood sugar once a year and if there is no such history, then every person in their 40s must get sugar checked annually for leading a healthy life. Dr Prashant Joshi, an epidemiologist and specialist in community medicine, said it would be a tricky challenge to control the sugar levels of the rural population as they may find it difficult to use insulin, following the directions of their treating doctors. “Sugar control is mandatory as its aggravation may not only bring mucormycosis but also lead to other ailments,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-sms-last-year-sugar-control-the-mantra-post-second-covid-wave/articleshow/83157647.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||100-bed Covid satellite facility comes up at Burrabazar; locals relieved||Kolkata: A 100-bed satellite health facility for Covid-19 patients at Burrabzar opened on Tuesday, brining much relief to locals. Due to the absence of good healthcare facilities barring Medical College Hospital in the area, many residents had to depend on private hospitals in south Kolkata, Salt Lake or off the EM Bypass during the pandemic. The Lohia Matri Seva Sadan, a landmark maternity hospital at 296B, Rabindra Sarani, has been closed for the past few years. Charnock Hospital approached the Lohia family, who owns the property, to turn it into the Covid satellite health facility. “The area is congested and many families live in cramped spaces. Even if one gets infected, they do not have any place for isolation. We hope that with facilities for doctors, nurses, oxygen, medicine and ambulance services, this unit will be of immense help. Though Covid cases are on the downswing, still we will keep this place running and ready in case of another wave,” said Prashant Sharma, MD, Charnock Hospitals. In the first week of May, the government in a meeting with wholesalers from Posta and Burrabazar had decided to reopen Mayo Hospital on Strand Road as a Covid facility for the benefit of local traders and residents. But the work is yet to begin. “North central Kolkata does not have proper healthcare infrastructure. The government hospitals are very crowded and there are no good private hospitals. Local residents have to admit their patients to the hospitals in south Kolkata, Salt Lake or EM Bypass,” said Vikas Ruia, a resident of Sir Hari Ram Goenka Street.  “We will now have a proper hospital managed professionally for Covid cases. For oxygen support, people won’t have to rush to big hospitals, paying thousands of rupees to the ambulances,” said Anil Gupta, a resident of Mahatma Gandhi Road. While mild to moderately infected patients will be tended at this facility, in cases, where patients need intensive treatment, they will be shifted either to Charnock Hospital’s main unit off the EM Bypass or the Haj House Covid Hospital run by it. Minister of state for health, Chandrima Bhattacharya, local MLA, Vivek Gupta, councillor, Smita Bakshi, and Kolkata Municipal Corporation commissioner, Binod Kumar, attended the opening of the health facility among others on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/100-bed-covid-satellite-facility-comes-up-at-burrabazar-locals-relieved/articleshow/83155292.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Joint commissioner of police (licensing) OP Mishra confirmed that the police have suspended the arms licences of Kumar and Kalra with immediate effect. “The process of cancellation of their licences has been initiated. They have been served with notices to explain why their licences should not be cancelled,” Mishra said. The joint commissioner added that the police took the action on the basis of the ongoing investigation in the two cases. Navneet Kalra, the owner of three restaurants—Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju—in Dekhi was arrested from Gurgaon on May 16 for allegedly black marketing and hoarding of oxygen concentrators. The cops had recovered 524 oxygen concentrators from the three restaurants owned by Kalra. He was granted bail on Saturday by a city court.

The life savers in the area managed to save two other persons who lost control in the choppy sea at Digha while taking a dip. The deceased were identified as Noor Mohmmad Midya (48) and Maidul Naskar (38). Four of them had got down into the sea on Tuesday afternoon. According to locals, four tourists were seen at the beach near Old Digha on Tuesday. It was around 2pm when the life savers spotted them standing on the beach. They asked the four to go back to their hotels as the sea was getting rough. The tourists, however, ignored the warnings and went deeper into the sea when suddenly they lost control. “Four of them have come together to attend some official work and were staying at a hotel here. Hotels in Digha were, more or less, empty since the cyclone Yaas had hit West Bengal coast. The life savers had initially stopped them from getting into the sea. The moment they went towards New Digha, the tourists jumped into the water. They did not pay any heed to them and went deeper into the sea,” said a local. Four of them were rushed to the hospital after they were rescued.

The accused have been identified as Rishabh Suri and Tanya Suri who lived in a plush house in Sector 46 of Gurgaon. They allegedly won the trust of the jeweller by buying small amounts of gold and paying up regularly. They had a third accomplice, currently at large, who used to pose as their father. “Recently, they started buying gold for a family function and promised to pay within a week. They disappeared after taking around 4.2kg of gold,” said DCP (central) Jasmeet Singh. Police had received a complaint from the jeweller on March 26. The victim had alleged naming the couple that they, along with one Vijay Verma, had absconded without making the payment. “After taking the gold, they started ignoring phone calls from the complainant and also absconded from their present address. On the basis of the complaint, an FIR was registered at Karol Bagh and investigation in the matter was taken up by SHO Maninder Singh’s team,” the DCP added. The cops said they had been trying to trace the accused but did not get leads initially as they had left Delhi. On May 29, the team received a tip-off about the couple residing in Sector 46, Gurgaon after which a raid was conducted and the two were arrested. “During interrogation, the accused said that they were fond of having a lavish lifestyle, staying in five-star hotels and owned a fleet of cars, including Audis and BMWs. They had gone into a huge debt because of the losses incurred in gambling and hence, planned to make money using this modus operandi,” the DCP further said. They first started with winning the trust of small businessmen and then later duped them on the pretext of credit, high returns, etc. Rishabh was earlier arrested by Telangana Police for running a fake call centre. Raids are being conducted to nab his associates. Efforts are also being made to recover the cheated jewellery, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/couple-in-20s-dupes-jeweller-of-rs-2-2cr-to-fund-lavish-lifestyle/articleshow/83155415.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Three students held for duping liquor sellers||KOLKATA: A gang of liquor fraudsters — all students and belonging to well-to-do families in Kolkata — were busted for allegedly duping online liquor sellers with fake digital payment documents and buying large quantity of expensive foreign liquor without actually paying for them. The incident came to light following a complaint lodged by the owner of a Waterloo Street bar-cum-restaurant at New Town police station. According to the complaint, a person named Rahul Agarwal had contacted them over Instagram and placed an online doorstep delivery order of liquor worth Rs 44,800 on May 22. He had asked to deliver the order at a New Town address. “The customer and his two friends took the delivery on road near Eco Park and showed the delivery personnel a fake “successful payment” receipt on a digital gateway. But they had never actually paid for the bottles and after a while switched off their cellphones,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Cops tracked the mobile tower locations of the numbers they had used to call and also the IP address which was used to create the fake social media profile. “During investigation, the youth who had placed the order was picked up first. He was from JBS Haldane Avenue off EM Bypass. Interrogating him, we picked up two of his associates – a 19-year-old resident of Ballygunge Circular Road and Palm Avenue resident, also 19-year-old. All three are from well-to-do families.,” said the officer. Police said the first two boys are due to appear for their Plus-II board exams this year while the third person is a first year student at a hotel management institute in New Town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/three-students-held-for-duping-liquor-sellers/articleshow/83155358.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||India||YouTube comments led to biggest raids for wildlife trafficking this year||DEHRADUN: The trail that led to wildlife traffickers in several successful operations this year had an unusual origin — YouTube comments. In at least five operations, pangolins and tiger skins were seized over the past one year by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network India by trailing tip-offs received from YouTube. Videos of “pangolins for sale” have long been shared on YouTube. A YouTube video posted shows a pangolin being led around by a string. The camera closes in on a piece of paper showing a date. Then the pangolin is stuffed in a bag and weighed. A comment below says “interested”. Another video from an active YouTube channel ‘DF Bhoot’, with 3.5k subscribers, shows someone doing an “electricity test” on a pangolin – a power tester is used to nudge a pangolin and it lights up. It is a common gimmick to draw customers. The subject reads “tester wala Bajar kit, call me at xxxx”. Videos alone don’t lead to much. So, WCCB volunteers go over the comments for clues that may lead to the identity of potential buyers. Sometimes, it doesn’t take much — buyers and sellers leave their numbers in comments. “One comment led us to a group of traffickers in Tinsukia (Assam). On February 18, we seized seven Chinese pangolin skins and one live Chinese pangolin from a hotel,” said HV Girisha, joint director, WCCB. Girisha said a team worked for weeks trying to get in touch with those who commented, tracked down the kingpin and then on February 18, a joint enforcement team of the WCCB and the Assam forest department caught two people, seven Chinese pangolin skins and one live Chinese pangolin from their possession in a hotel. It was the biggest recovery of this year. However, animal trafficking on platforms like YouTube and Facebook is not new and perpetrators have learnt to remove all traces of the crime on the ground. To counter this, the WCCB has launched “WILD NET”, a program designed to track and check illegal animal trading online. Any suspicious activity online would send alerts to enforcement agencies in the country. Girisha said that they also spread awareness among e-commerce platforms on how to detect online animal trafficking. Pangolins remain one of the most sought-after mammals in the international wildlife body parts trade. Pangolin meat is consumed for its high protein content and the scales are used to prepare medicinal pastes or as ornaments or gift items. Also, the demand for live pangolins has increased over the years. “It is an increasing trend. Pangolins caught live are used for sacrificial or occult purposes. Out of every 10 pangolins related seizures, at least two to three are found to involve live animals,” said Saket Badola, head of TRAFFIC India, the wildlife trade monitoring network that works in collaboration with WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). From the fact that the business has shifted largely online, it can be said that mostly youths, who tend to be tech savvy, are involved, Badola said, adding easy transfer of money had made it easy for traffickers. Earlier, simply following the cash would lead to a culprit, but that is not the case anymore. “With so many channels to transfer money, it has become difficult to follow the network of traffickers,” said Badola. In 2019, TRAFFIC in collaboration with MOEFCC organised a meeting with online platforms like Google, Facebook, YouTube and e-commerce sites like IndiaMart and Flipkart to ensure that their platforms are not used for trading protected species. “Another meeting of various stakeholders is scheduled for early July,” said Badola. Found across Asia and Africa, the eight various species of pangolin are tagged under the “vulnerable” to “critically endangered” species under the IUCN.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/youtube-comments-led-to-biggest-raids-for-wildlife-trafficking-this-year/articleshow/83160760.cms||Ishita Mishra

This project was launched during the first lockdown and it had benefited many. “In this unprecedented pandemic, trained psychiatrists will be available for telephonic counselling free of cost,” said Dr Sanjay Deotale, president of Nagpur IMA. “People may contact them on their respective numbers according to the time slots on which they will be available for free counselling. The helpline will be active till June 30,” said Dr Deotale. 18 leading psychiatrists in Nagpur and the psychiatry department of three leading medical colleges in Nagpur district have agreed to provide free support to the needy patients. The psychiatry department of AIIMS Nagpur can be contacted from 9 am to 5 pm on working days on 0712 2352033. Lata Mangeshkar Hospital psychiatry department will remain available from 10 am to 4 pm daily on 7888006620 while the psychiatry department of JNMC, Sawangi Meghe, can be contacted from 11 am to 4 pm daily on 9910775717 or 9035089795. The list of individual psychiatrists and their availability is displayed at the IMA headquarters and on their social media page. According to doctors, the pandemic has triggered emotional, physical, and economic issues. One out of three patients suffer from neurological, psychiatric problems post-Covid. “Unfortunately, people are still reluctant to get professional help to deal with the psychiatric issues. Simple counselling can be a great help in majority of cases,” said doctors who used to attend the calls during last Covid-19 wave. “Apart from assessing mental health issues, people share the impact of misinformation which we call ‘the infodemic’. Through this we try to provide the much needed support system to them,” said a senior member of the panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ima-resumes-free-psychiatric-helpline/articleshow/83155389.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Flanked by senior party leaders Shibu Baby John and MP N K Premachandran, Azeez told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that RSP did not discuss the need for leaving the Congress-led UDF. “If there arises such a possibility, RSP would take an appropriate decision at the suitable time,” he said. The leaders said the attempts to link John’s request for leave from party activities for some time should not be construed as internal rift in RSP. Premachandran said the inherent organiational weakness of UDF was one of the major reasons for the current rout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-plans-to-leave-udf-rsp/articleshow/83155384.cms||---

She filed a missing person’s complaint on May 25. Vishwakarma, a security guard, had vanished on the same day. When the police questioned Shahida, she gave evasive responses. “On Tuesday, a police team carried out an inspection of Shahida’s house and found it odd that some tiles of the kitchen were covered in a fresh layer of cement. When asked about it, Shahida stayed mum. The team then decided to pull out the tiles and examine the spot,” said additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant. After the initial digging, police found a huge hole in the ground. Shahida then allegedly admitted to the crime. “On May 22, after Raees reached home from work, Vishwakarma strangled him with a nylon rope with Shahida’s help. Her children were asleep at the time. The duo packed the body in a gunny bag, removed tiles in the kitchen, dug a hole and buried the body. They then replaced the tiles with cement,” said an officer. Shahida claims she had distracted her two children when they woke up due to the digging noise by plonking them in front of the TV and turning up the volume. But the police believe the children might be aware of the crime and could have been threatened into silence. The police are hunting for Vishwakarma. Shahida allegedly told investigators that the two were keen to live together and therefore plotted to eliminate her husband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-husband-strangled-as-children-slept/articleshow/83157701.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Three lives lost in a year since construction of Bhiwandi flyover, kin call for safety measures||MUMBAI: A four kilometre long flyover in Bhiwandi has taken three lives within a year of its construction, prompting the families of victims and local representatives to demand immediate interventions. Amol Varkute, 35, was riding to work on the Bal Thackeray flyover at Bhiwandi recently when a car rammed into his motorcycle, throwing him off the structure and killing him instantly. Varkute's family, which has been campaigning for a safer commute, said they wanted to ensure no more lives were lost. Varkute worked in a private company at Bhatale village, about seven kilometres from Bhiwandi. "He was a safe rider and would unfailingly don a helmet," his brother, Ajay, told TOI. The flyover connects Kalyan Naka to Saibaba area. Varkute used to take the flyover every morning and would pick up a colleague after descending the bridge on his way to work. Times ViewIt is alarming that three casualties have been reported within a year of constructing a new bridge. Speed reduction measures must be implemented. But it is equally important for motorists to adhere to speed restrictions. In developed nations, a speed limit of 30km per hour is enforced. Strict enforcement of speed limits by the local police should go hand-in-hand with better infrastructure so that motorists stick to lower speeds.On May 15, he left home around 9.30 am. While he was on the flyover, a speeding car came up from the opposite direction. "The female motorist was trying to overtake another vehicle and ploughed into Amol's bike. He was thrown off due to the impact and landed on the bonnet of the car. But the motorist could not control the vehicle and it continued moving forward. Amol fell several feet from the flyover onto the road below. His helmet was crushed," Ajay recounted. The woman was arrested and subsequently released on bail. Varkute was the sole breadwinner and is survived by his wife, mother and two children. Bhiwandi MLA Rais Shaikh said the flyover was a narrow two-laned road with no divider nor speed breakers. "The bridge has resolved the issue of congestion but is unsafe. Vehicles zoom past at immense speeds and speed reduction measures are needed," said Shaikh, who has dashed off a letter to the MMRDA. "The bridge has some sharp curves and is not very well illuminated. The anti crash barriers on either side are low and sound barriers are entirely missing," he said. "The flyover construction has been done adhering to Indian Road Congress (IRC) norms. As the flyover is two-laned and built for vehicular traffic moving in both directions, a road divider cannot be placed. The height of anti crash barriers provided on both sides is as per IRC norms. To restrict speeding, thermoplastic rumblers are provided. The number of such rumblers shall be increased to further restrict speeding. If any measures are required to be taken on humanitarian grounds, they will be considered," said a statement from MMRDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-lives-lost-on-unsafe-bhiwandi-flyover-in-a-yr/articleshow/83158498.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Goa||Injured Rowllin, Sana out of Qatar clash||Panaji: Rowllin Borges has been ruled out of the Fifa World Cup qualifier against Qatar with a hamstring injury and remains a major doubt for the other two games. The Mumbai City FC midfielder is among the players who coach Igor Stimac trusts in the middle of the park. His absence has caused problems in the past for the national team, and even though there are youngsters like Suresh Singh and Lalengmawia (Apuia), stepping into his boots may not be easy. FC Goa midfielder Glan Martins, who gave a good account of himself in the AFC Champion League, could now be handed his international debut. “I feel sad. Rowllin is one of the most important part of the team. He provides stability to the centre of midfield. He is out for the first game (against Qatar). Hope he recovers well,” Stimac told TOI on Wednesday. According to team sources, Stimac will also miss the services of Chinglensana Singh. The in-form Hyderabad FC defender was pencilled to play alongside Sandesh Jhingan in defence but is understood to have complained of mild soreness. “It is unlikely that the coach will take a risk. There are two more important games (after Qatar) and a fit Sana can be crucial,” said the source. Meanwhile, Sunil Chhetri returns after missing the two friendlies in Dubai against Oman and United Arab Emirates. He will captain the team. Chhetri was struck with Covid in March and did not make the trip to UAE. He also missed the last clash against Asian champions Qatar in the first leg as viral fever meant he was confined to the hotel room. “Everyone knows what it means for Indian football. Each one of our players understand what it means to have Sunil back in the team and on the pitch with them. “They will go out with more courage with him around. It’s a great pleasure working with him. I will try everything in my abilities to keep him playing as long as possible. He trains in every training session as if he is 25 (years old) and plays as if he is 25. He is scoring goals and I am happy that he can encourage our players,” said Stimac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/injured-rowllin-sana-out-of-qatar-clash/articleshow/83186393.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The agency sprang into action after the DGM of the large corporate branch of Bank of India, Ajeya Thakur, filed a complaint before the CBI against Vimal Oil and Foods Limited and its directors Jayesh Patel, Mukesh Patel, Ditin Patel and Mona Acharya, for defrauding the Bank of India and eight other banks. “The fraud was perpetrated by the directors along with some public servants and other unknown persons and was worth Rs 679 crore which is total outstanding amount as on date of the NPAs (non-performing assets) of the consortium member banks,” reads the FIR filed at the Bhopal branch of the CBI. It has been alleged (by the DGM of the Bank of India) that the company promoters had carried out the fraud by various mala fide activities such as diversion of loan funds, unlawful transactions, sales or purchases with certain selected parties that were not existing, the FIR states. The accused persons have shown inflated invoice prices and routed revenue funds which led to incurring a loss of Rs 678 crore to the Bank of India and other banks in the consortium. CBI registered a case under charges of criminal conspiracy and cheating against the company promoters and unidentified public servants in the case. Vimal Oil and Foods Limited is the flagship company of Vimal Group, which has its registered office at Hanumant Heduva village near Palavasna railway crossing in Mehsana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cbi-searches-at-oil-companys-premises/articleshow/83157754.cms||---

Thiruvananthapuram has covered 46,012 persons in two weeks under this category, the highest among all the districts. It has attained 3.15% first dose coverage till date in this category. The capital has recorded the highest coverage in first and second dose in another age-appropriate group too. In the category of those aged above 45, the capital has administered the first and second dose to the highest number of persons among all districts; 6.79 lakh persons have been covered in this category under first dose and 1.75 lakh persons have been given second dose so far. In case of health care workers, Thiruvananthapuram records 76% of fully-vaccinated category. The capital records lower percentage in full vaccination of health care workers along with districts like Pathanamthitta, Kozhikode and Malappuram. Along with Kollam, the capital has recorded the lowest coverage in terms of full vaccination for frontline workers at 69%. The officials associated with vaccination said that almost all major hospitals were equipped to prioritize vaccination for age appropriate groups and this is being reflected in the fast pace at which the younger group is being vaccinated in the district. With the government prioritizing staff of this age group from different lines of employment and departments, the health department has also expedited processing and approval of applications. The government had initially notified 32 categories as front-line workers for prioritization for vaccination in the age group 18-45 years as a first lot. Later, 11 more categories were notified as front line workers in the same age group. The team is gaining momentum even while dealing with problems regarding vaccine supply and it has also enabled officials to tide over initial hiccups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/capital-leads-in-jabs-to-younger-age-category/articleshow/83155514.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The court was hearing the bail petition filed by Giri Ram J who was arrested on April 15. He was booked under sections of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner is one of the directors in two stevedore companies based at Tuticorin. The first company has collected GST from its customers during 2018-19 and 2019-20 for Rs 4.6 crore and the same was not paid to the government. The company has also availed ineligible excess input tax credit worth about Rs 2.5 crore without proper documents. Similarly, the second company has also failed to pay Rs 4.9 crore GST amount collected from its customers during the years 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 and also fraudulently availed input tax credit worth about Rs 1.8 crore without proper documents. The judge said that judicial custody of the petitioner is not going to serve any purpose, more particularly, when he is ready to pay Rs 1.5 crore towards liability as well as two of the directors are enjoying the benefit of not to arrest order. Hence, the judge granted bail to the petitioner by directing him to deposit Rs 1.5 crore to the authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-grants-bail-to-man-held-for-gst-evasion/articleshow/83155474.cms||---

Government pleader Poornima Kantharia told a bench of Justices S S Shinde and Abhay Ahuja that the Union government must be impleaded as it concerns travel abroad. “It is not the state of Maharashtra that will take a decision,” she said, adding that the US embassy must also be made a party. The court heard a petition by Altamount Road residents Viral and Bijal Thakker who urged the HC to appoint the girl’s maternal aunt Purvee Parekh (also a co-petitioner) as her legal guardian. Parekh will then be able to accompany her niece, who is a US citizen by birth. Due to the pandemic situation, the US government had on April 30 restricted travel of Indians to the US with the exception of US citizens. A minor US citizen can be accompanied either by non-citizen parent or a legal guardian. But due to personal reasons, the parents are unable to accompany her. Appearing for the parents, senior advocate Milind Sathe said the daughter’s school vacations begin from June 1 till July 1. He said the parents are not seeking relief from the Centre or State but an order of the high court. “The parents are seeking appointment of the aunt as legal guardian for a limited purpose,” he said, adding that the HC has passed several orders appointing legal guardians. When Kantharia read from the April 30 presidential notification on implementation of restrictions on entry to the US, Sathe reiterated that the parents are not seeking relief from anyone “except the court”. He said the Guardian and Wards Act has no provision for appointing legal guardians in such a situation. Kantharia said, “When there are parents, you want (the HC) to appoint the aunt as legal guardian.” Questioning what was the state’s problem, Sathe said it must “justify with one reason why a guardian should not be appointed”. He also said “consulates cannot be made party respondents”. The judges said they would give the state a week to respond. Justice Ahuja added, “Until then, crystallize your thoughts.” They also posted for June 8, the hearing on HC order to appoint legal guardians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/couple-moves-hc-after-maharashtra-state-says-no-to-daughters-us-trip-for-vax/articleshow/83155788.cms||Rosy Sequeira

However, these tablets failed the tests on Tuesday. FDCA officials have also found that the fake drug was also listed on an online pharmacy store and was being sold for Rs 1,096 per strip. The counterfeit drug was also available at a number of local stores in three major Gujarat cities. “We had conducted high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Infrared attenuated total reflection (IR-ATR) tests on the tablets and could not find any favipiravir content. It is basically made of starch. We are following leads and reaching out to all those pharmacies who have been duped,” says Gujarat FDCA chief, HG Koshia. Koshia further said that the alleged kingpin Sudip Mukherji used to offer bills with fake certification from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and even WHO. “Many pharmacists carelessly accepted these without verifying the certification numbers even though all pharmacists are trained to cross-check such details. We will be registering a case against them also,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-favipiravir-tablets-were-starch/articleshow/83157805.cms||---

Though the civic body has lodged a complaint with Kotwali police alleging theft on May 18, an offence is yet to be registered. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has also ordered inquiry as to how works of around Rs28 lakh were carried out on the property despite the dispute over ownership.NMC officials told TOI, “A team of sports department visited the gym on May 17 and found all machineries worth Rs7.90 lakh missing. A complaint was lodged with Kotwali police.”“The NMC ran a school on the land for over three decades. The school was shut due to lack of students. A compound wall and gym was constructed on the land by the NMC in 2010-11. Equipments were purchased and kept in the gym, which was reportedly closed after running for a few months,” said the officials.One Ravindra Ramlal Satbhaiyya, a resident of Mahal, had filed a case in district court claiming land ownership in 2015. Despite the matter being sub judice, the NMC constructed a skating rink there by spending Rs20 lakh in 2018.The NMC, collector office and city survey office failed to produce documents in the court proving the land was owned by the government.“The district court on August 14, 2018, declared Satbhaiyya as the land owner. The court directed the NMC and collector office to demolish compound wall, vacate and hand over the possession of land to Satbhaiyya family. Since then, the land was in possession of this family,” said the officials. The NMC filed an appeal only after BJP’s Dayashankar Tiwari raised the issue in 2019.“There were two keys of the gym — one was with the NMC and the other with Satbhaiyyas. As the NMC had filed an appeal, gym machineries were not removed,” they said.“The NMC team found the gym equipments missing last months, though the lock was intact,” said officials. Kotwali police station PI Dnyaneshwar Bhosle said Satbhaiyya family had got the possession of the land as per court order. “Concerned person in his statement claimed that NMC officials had taken away all equipments,” said Bhosle. As the matter is sub judice, we did not register offence and are investigating further, he said.After theft of gym equipments, NMC deputy commissioner Milind Meshram reportedly came to know about the case. He has submitted a proposal with the civic chief for an inquiry into the expenditure of Rs28 lakh on the land for gym and skating rink despite the property being disputed one.Meshram is likely to direct PWD superintending engineer to conduct an inquiry and submit the report.In a nutshell * NMC used to run a school on land in Jalalpura for over three decades* School was shut due to lack of students* NMC constructed a compound wall and gym in 2010-11* Equipments worth Rs8 lakh were purchased and kept in the gym* Gym was closed after running for a few months* Ravindra Satbhaiyya filed a case in district court claiming ownership in 2015* NMC spent Rs20 lakh on constructing a skating rink in 2018* Court upheld ownership claim of Satbhaiyya, who took possession of the land in 2018* NMC did not remove gym machineries as it had filed an appeal* Equipment found missing last month, police complaint lodged* Probe ordered into Rs28 lakh expenditure despite dispute over the property||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmcs-rs8-lakh-gym-items-vanish-from-disputed-land/articleshow/83155498.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Rajiv Thakkar, a resident of Sanskruti Flats, said in his FIR with Vastrapur police that accused Devang Dave, a resident of Bhagyoday Society in Palanpur town of Banaskantha, duped him when Thakkar was searching for the injection for his cousin. “On April 28, my cousin Tejas Gadhia , 41, was admitted to a private hospital on SG Road after being tested positive for Covid-19. As his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to the ICU and doctors recommended tocilizumab injections,” said Thakkar in the FIR. He enquired about the medicine and a friend suggested the name of the accused. Thakkar said that he called up Dave who demanded Rs 45,000 for one injection. “On April 30, Dave called me and said that he would deliver the injection at a spot close to Himalaya mall in Vastrapur,” he said. Thakkar said he waited there the entire night, but no one arrived. “Dave kept telling me that his aide would come and hand over the injection, but nobody came that night,” said Thakkar. He said that Dave later told him that he would give him another injection or return the amount. However, he failed to do either for almost a month. Finally, Thakkar approached Vastrapur police and filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust against Dave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-45k-lost-in-quest-for-tocilizumab-vial/articleshow/83157858.cms||---

They have also seized four litres of freshly-brewed illicit liquor, 300 litres of wash and brewing apparatus consisiting of a LP gas cylinder and stove from the house. Kazhakootam excise range inspector Mohamed Rafi said that the catch was based on a tip-off from the intelligence wing of the excise department. It was a joint operation along with officials of Kadinamkulam police station.

Founder of Nandrimaravel, an organisation working with community dogs, K P Marikumar, said that it had requested the authorities to help them feed the community dogs on roads, which are often affected by the lockdown. “If hotels and eateries function as usual, they manage to get food and people will also feed them. But with people being confined to their homes, these animals are badly affected,” he said. When they had met the corporation commissioner, who is also an animal lover, he assured them of help. A private milk firm has offered help, and these activists have been receiving 40 litres of milk per day. A biscuit manufacturer also came forward to provide biscuits, which they find easy to distribute and they received 600kg of biscuits on Tuesday. Many volunteers have come forward to feed the dogs in various parts of the city. They were able to feed more than 300 dogs. There are also puppies for which these biscuits and milk are a blessing, said Marikumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/corpn-commissioner-arranges-food-for-dogs/articleshow/83155502.cms||---

In Ghaziabad too, trees and hoardings were uprooted at a number of places, leading to traffic disruptions in Lohia Nagar, the Meerut road industrial area and Sanjay Nagar.Monday was also one of the wettest nights of May in the region, with both cities reporting rainfall up to one inch. The weather turned dry and patchy on Tuesday. However, from the range of mid-40 degrees last week, the mercury dropped to around 31 degrees on Tuesday — a possible result of the overnight rain.“A big tree fell in the C block of our sector, which led to power disruption. It was only on Tuesday morning that the Noida Authority staff came to clear it,” said Laxmi Narain, RWA president of Sector 19. KK Jain, a resident of Sector 34, said that some eight to 10 trees were uprooted in the area. In Sector 34, at least three cars were damaged after they were trapped under falling trees, said Dharmendra Sharma, general secretary of Sector 34 RWA. “Windscreens of cars were shattered at the parking slots of Nilgiri Apartments, while an overhead water tank fell at the Aravali Apartments,” he said.A tree was uprooted near gate number 2 and 5 of Noida’s Jal Vayu Vihar. In Greater Noida too, a tree was uprooted in front of house number A 344 in Sector Beta 1 that led to a road block and damaged a water pipeline. A similar incident was reported from sector Delta one.In neighbouring Ghaziabad, residents also complained about uprooted trees and hoardings in Lohia Nagar that caused traffic disruption. Similar disruptions were reported from the Meerut Road industrial area and Sanjay Nagar.“Trees get so easily uprooted here because they are planted superficially. The roots are not deep and because of the surrounding concrete, the trees are unable to sink their roots. The roots should be allowed enough space to sink deep,” said environmentalist Vikrant Tongad.Following complaints of large numbers of hoardings and trees getting uprooted, Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC) rushed teams to the affected localities to clear the roadblocks. “Trees were uprooted at several places. In the Lohia Nagar area, a hoarding collapse was reported while a pole in the Govindpuram area fell because of strong winds,” a GMC official said. All roadblocks in both the cities were cleared by Tuesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/trees-vehicles-bear-rains-brunt/articleshow/83157812.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

Last year’s malaria figures were down drastically due to an extended Covid-19 lockdown, similarly, few dengue cases were reported. In Ghaziabad, as part of preparations to contain dengue, GMC is carrying out fogging.“There is a roster sent to the health department, but the employees for fogging and sanitisation are the same. They only do sanitisation work because that’s the priority for now. With many of the workers falling sick or leaving, the departments are also short of workers,” said an official from the Greater Noida Authority.However, the district health department started an anti-malarial drive from Tuesday. Dr Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer of GB Nagar, said, “The drive will continue till June 30. During this month-long drive, Asha workers will go to the villages and check people with symptoms for fever. A dengue drive will be held from July 1 to 31 in the district.”While no deaths have been reported from malaria and dengue in the past few years, cases have decreased from 434 in 2018 to 424 in 2019 to 27 in 2020 for malaria. Similarly, for dengue as against 28 cases in 2018, 40 in 2019 and 28 in 2020. No cases have been reported this year.

---||Nagpur||As vax wait continues, doctors suggest flu shot for kids||Nagpur: Paediatricians have recommended flu shots for children before the onset of the monsoon as a shield against influenza, even as the wait for their Covid-19 vaccination continues. Apart from the aim to boost kids’ immunity during the monsoon — the most vulnerable period of the year — paediatricians also want to minimize influenza and swine flu cases in the coming months as the government has asked them to be prepared for tackling Covid infection among children, who are expected to be the worst hit during the anticipated third wave. Fewer cases of flu in hospitals would also mean more beds and better attention to Covid patients, said district paediatric task force member Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala. Though lauded by paediatricians for its benefits, the flu shot’s price (around Rs1,200-1,400) is being considered as a major disadvantage as it is available only in the private sector. State task force expert Dr Sanjay Oke, also a paediatric surgeon, has suggested that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray make flu shots free for all since they cannot be afforded by the economically weaker section of the society. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) - Nagpur paediatrics department head Dr Meenakshi Girish said though flu shots per se have no direct protective value against Covid, they may help boost one’s innate immunity, which is considered the first line of defence. “Various studies show that if the innate immunity is strong, Covid’s viral load can be controlled at the entry level,” she explained. The Indian academy of paediatrics (IAP) also recommends flu shots for kids, Girish added. “Flu shots are being talked about nowadays as flu and Covid have similar symptoms,” said the doctor, who is also part of the district paediatric Covid task force. Paediatrician Dr Vinky Rughwani said some studies have showed that there is a possibility of some “cross protection” for Covid too in flu shots, but that is only a perception and hence, parents should not be lulled into a false sense of security after the shots as they are meant for protection against influenza. Another paediatrician Dr Uday Bodhankar said flu shots are effective and recommended them for children with co-morbidities, among others. “The shot gives protection against 60-70% of the monsoon-borne influenza,” he said. Dr Jhunjhunwala added that while Covid-19 and flu are both viral infections, they are different entities. “Flu shot is advisable as influenza has a high mortality rate in India. Moreover, ensuring fewer flu patients can lead to greater focus on paediatric Covid patients,” he said. Rajesh Dehlikar, a father of two, said he had been advised by his paediatrician to ensure his children take the flu shots. “We thought it would be safer to take flu shots as Covid vaccines are not available. Something is always better than nothing,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-vax-wait-continues-doctors-suggest-flu-shot-for-kids/articleshow/83155642.cms||Soumitra Bose

They said that they are shelling out their produce at a throwaway price of Rs 1300 per quintal. Bihar Kisan Sangharsa Samanvay Samiti, Purnia unit, coordinator Nyaz Ahmad said, "Unseasonal rainfall and cyclone Yaas caused extensive damage to maize crops in the district. Besides, farmers don't have proper storage facilities, compelling them to sell their produce at a throwaway price. " "The MSP for maize fixed by the government is Rs 1,850. But, the farmers of this region are not getting their due," he said. Nyaz further said, "Bihar is one of the top leading producers of maize in the country. Our state's contribution in maize production is around 80% and 24 districts out of 38 in the state produce 30 quintal maize per hectare. Major maize producing districts are situated in the Seemanchal region. Even then, the farmers of the Kosi belt are the worst sufferers." Irshad Ahmad, 40, a farmer of Jhunni Istambrar under K-Nagar block of the district said, "The MSP is just on paper. The government always makes hollow promises. We are selling our maize at Rs 1200-1300 per quintal." Mohammad Shaukat Alam, a farmer of Bela Rikabganj under the K-Nagar block said, "The MSP for maize is Rs 1850, but we were forced to sell our produce at Rs 1200-1300 per quintal. We didn't have storage and drying facility for foodgrains. The recent heavy rainfall caused a huge loss to standing maize crops, as well as those kept in an open field for drying." "We were planning to stage a protest rally in Purnia, but re compelled to stay indoors because of the second wave of Covid-19," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/farmers-forced-to-sell-maize-below-msp-in-seemanchal/articleshow/83153700.cms||---
---||Madurai||Zero waiting ward comes up at Madurai hospital||MADURAI: Covid Free Madurai, a citizens forum in Madurai has established a zero-waiting ward at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), which would help save lives by helping those who need oxygen while waiting for a bed at the hospital. This facility has been organised in coordination with many institutes and which have jointly provided 45 stretchers and 90 oxygen cylinders to the GRH. During the peak of the second wave, many ambulances were making a beeline to the GRH, in which patients with low oxygen levels had to wait for a few hours till they found a bed. The need for a zero wait ward in Madurai was stressed by experts after it was successfully implemented by the Chennai volunteers in the government hospital there. When patients from the ambulances are assisted to this zero waiting ward while waiting for a bed and also given oxygen, it goes a long way in maintaining the stability of the patient till he or she gets a bed. Trained volunteers would assist the patients to get the oxygen masks fitted, while waiting in this section. Monitoring officer for Covid in Madurai, Dr B Chandramohan said that this contribution would help the GRH in triaging the patients who are in need of emergency attention. A vehicle has also been kept ready outside this facility to take cylinders for refilling as and when required. Former deputy director of public health, Tamil Nadu, Dr K Kolandasamy, chief advisor for the forum, said that this facility would be of great help in the advent of a third wave. The facility was handed over to the dean of the GRH, Dr A Rathinvel in the presence of the Madurai district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar and Chandramohan. Volunteers from Covid Free Madurai, V A Palanikumar, J K Muthu Saravanan and Balaguru, were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/zero-waiting-ward-comes-up-at-grh-to-benefit-patients-waiting-for-beds/articleshow/83155564.cms||---

If the government’s plans work out, new IT towers would come up in tier-III towns like Ramagundam in Peddapalli district and Wanaparthy district headquarter apart from Nalgonda, a tier II town and district headquarters within a year. The IT department had already developed IT towers in Warangal, Khammam and Karimnagar, while the ones at Siddipet, Nizamabad and Mahbubnagar were under construction. “We are planning to develop IT towers with about 1,500 seats capacity in Ramagundam, Wanaparthy and Nalgonda. These are being considered by the government following requests from public representatives and Non-Resident Indians (NRI) belonging to the respective regions. Some of them had set up IT firms in the US. In Nalgonda itself, an NRI has foward up to set up his shop with 600 seats,” Vijay Rangineni, chief executive officer, IT Investments, Telangana, told TOI on Tuesday. The government has been promoting setting up new IT towers with a purpose to decentralise IT development, which will provide employment opportunities to locals. Secondly, the present move would also decongest the IT corridor, especially in the western part of the city, and there would not be any infrastructure problem in tier-II and III towns. Interestingly, there is an increasing demand for land and space for IT firms in Warangal, the second biggest city in Telangana. An IT tower was constructed in Warangal a few years ago with 250 seats. Last year, Cyient and Tech Mahindra had opened their branches in Warangal. Minister KT Rama Rao earlier said Warangal would be the next destination after Hyderabad as there are nearly 20 engineering colleges, including NIT, around the historic city and better connectivity to Hyderabad and other places. “Six more companies, including some top IT brands, are evincing interest to set up their branches in Warangal and sought land (2 to 5 acres) to have their own buildings. The government will take a call on this,” Vijay Rangineni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-state-govt-plans-to-promote-it-in-tier-iii-towns/articleshow/83155583.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Noida||After storm, outage hits homes for hrs, complaints pour in||Noida/Ghaziabad: While Monday’s late-night showers brought the much-needed reprieve from the summer heat in the region, it also brought along the prolonged, painful power cuts. Several areas in Noida and Ghaziabad witnessed three to seven-hour outages, as rain and strong winds led to a breakdown of power infrastructure in the neighbouring cities. In Noida, long outages were reported from many sectors. While a pole near the transformer of Sector 51’s F block led to the electrocution of a sanitation worker on Tuesday morning, a 33/11 kV line was damaged in Sector 19 leading to a night-long blackout in one block. In several other areas, voltage fluctuations irked the residents. In the rural areas of Dadri, about 30-40 electricity poles fell.Sanjeev Kumar, RWA general secretary, Sector 51, said, “This morning, a sanitation worker got a shock from a pole while cleaning and was knocked out briefly. We took him to the nearby Surabhi hospital. He was discharged after a while. There was no power from Monday midnight to 6.30am on Tuesday. Through the night, people had to stay awake. Inverters did not suffice during the nearly seven-hour outage. As a result, many faced water scarcity in the morning. Whenever it rains, three-four electricity poles are damaged here. Most areas around transformers have overgrown trees.”Sector 19’s C block also faced a seven-hour outage as a tree fell on the 33/11 kV line, said Laxmi Narain, RWA president. Sector 30 residents reported voltage fluctuations all through the night, while residents of Sector 36 complained of lack of water supply. Residents of Sector 29, Rajat Vihar, sectors 62, 34 and 25, and Beta 1 and Delta 2 in Greater Noida complained of power outages.When contacted, VN Singh, chief zonal engineer of the Noida power department, told TOI, “A 400 kV transformer had developed some fault due to which supply was disrupted in some areas. The problem has been fixed. In urban areas, some sectors faced problems due to uprooting of trees or pole damage, which was fixed too.”In neighbouring Ghaziabad too, overnight rain and strong winds led to outages in many parts of the city. In Indirapuram’s Ahimsa Khand, for instance, there was a power disruption for three hours. “There was an outage in most parts of Indirapuram from 12am to 3am but in areas like Shakti Khand, power was restored soon,” said DK Pandey, a resident of the area. In some parts of Vaishali and Vasundhara, the power situation normalised only in the morning. “We were told that the rain had triggered local faults in the area, leading to an outage for about six hours” said Arvind Mishra, a Vaishali resident.“In Meerut road industrial area, a tree fell on the 11000kV line, which led to outages at many places, including Kavinagar. As a precautionary measure, we had to shut off power at many places but it was restored soon after the rain,” said an official from the power department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/after-storm-outage-hits-homes-for-hrs-complaints-pour-in/articleshow/83157865.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Madurai||Madurai doctors offer free consultation to Covid-hit||A group of young doctors have been providing succour to thousands of Covid-19 patients for the past one month by offering free consultation, advice for getting better treatment and trying to dispel myths associated with vaccines. It all started when Dr O G Jeyan, a private practitioner from Munichalai, got a call from his school teacher who got infected a month ago seeking his advice. After helping him out, he realised there would be thousands looking for consultation or guidance over phone on testing and other aspects. A 2019 batch pass-out from Madurai Medical College, Jeyan thought he should start providing free consultation. He got an enthusiastic response from his batchmates, juniors and seniors, when he dropped the idea among them. With a team of 12 doctors under the banner ‘Vimochana’, he joined hands with Sharmila Noor of Boom Welfare Community Trust who has been into social activities including arranging blood for people through an emergency helpline. She put together a 15-member team and put in use mobile numbers for people to contact. The team is responsible for connecting patients or relatives to the doctor available at a particular point of time. Jeyan said the number of doctors has gone up to 25, each of whom spares an hour or two daily for this purpose. "Initially we received around 40-50 calls a day, which went up to 400 to 500. Now it ranges around 80-100. We must have attended about 5,000 calls in a month," he said. Sharmila says now even Tamils settled abroad are making use of the facility. A senior psychiatrist offers counselling too.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Couple plots murder after wife survives suicide bid||Thiruvananthapuram: A couple attempted to murder a young man in broad daylight on the national highway near Korani, after the wife survived a suicide attempt, according to police investigators. Lekshmi (26) and her husband, Ajeesh, were arrested on Monday. The alleged crime took place on Sunday. Attingal police station house officer inspector T Rajesh Kumar said that Lekshmi was in an alleged relationship with the survivor, Nidheesh, 30, of Mangalapuram. This relationship developed while Ajeesh, a habitual offender, was in prison. Nidheesh was an employee of a facilitation centre at Valikode. Lekshmi met him when she visited the centre to apply for Aadhaar card three months ago. Nidheesh was also a married man. Later, when Ajesh was released from the prison, he came to know about this relationship and this created a rift between the couple. When the problems between them grew worse they approached the local police at Venjaramoodu nearly two weeks ago. The police officers initiated reconciliatory talks and sent them back together. “But apparently, the entire episode had apparently caused serious mental trauma for the woman,” the inspector said. She attempted suicide on Friday by slitting her wrist. However, she was spotted on time by Ajeesh and she could be saved. The couple blamed Nidheesh for having created problems in their life and they wanted to retaliate. They summoned Nidheesh to Korani, where he was attacked by the couple. As per the statement he gave to the police, Ajesh stabbed him using a knife while Lekshmi held him from behind. While Lekshmi was apprehended by passersby, Ajesh managed to escape. He was caught by the police a day later from his hideout. “We suspect that Ajesh, who has been involved in several violent crimes, might have encouraged his wife to commit the crime,” the SHO said. Nidheesh, who suffered multiple injuries in the attack, continues to be under treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/couple-plots-murder-after-wife-survives-suicide-bid/articleshow/83155715.cms||---

Forest officials, along with members of Mulshi Disaster Management Committee and some locals, managed to send the animal back to the forest after a three-hour-long effort. Pramod Balkawde of the committee said, “Residents of Darawali village in Mulshi had been spotting the Gaur on the hillock near the village for the past two days. On Tuesday morning around 7.30am, the animal crossed the Paud-Mangaon highway and entered Survewadi, a small hamlet near Darawali.” After noticing the bison, the residents alerted the committee members and the forest department. Range forest officer PV Kapse, Balkawde and their teams reached the spot. “We wanted the Gaur to go back to the forest safely. He had crossed the highway and was wandering in Survewadi,” Balkawde said. Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests (DCF), told TOI, “After getting information about the bison, our team was in Mulshi since Tuesday morning. The animal has been sent to its habitat. There are a significant number of Gaurs near Pune. Sometimes an animal ventures out. In such cases, we send it back to the forest.” Late on Sunday night, a bison was also spotted at Sonapur village near Panshet. As the stray dogs were chasing him, the bison went towards Panshet dam area. On December 9 last year, an Indian bison succumbed to exhaustion after running for two hours amid frenzied crowds in Kothrud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rescuers-help-shepherd-indian-bison-into-forest-in-mulshi-taluka/articleshow/83155646.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Madurai||Madurai has beaten other dists in Covid control: Min||Madurai: Finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan has said that Madurai is ahead of other districts in the control of Covid-19 spread because of “distributed strategy and proper planning with a scientific approach.” Had they not planned strategically and allowed the disease to spread into semi-urban areas, Madurai would have been in a very bad situation, he told reporters after a Covid review meeting in the presence of his cabinet colleague P Moorthy, district collector Dr Aneesh Sekhar and monitoring officer B Chandramohan.“Two weeks after we started work, Madurai has vacant beds, in both oxygen and ICU, both in government hospitals and private hospitals. We are committed to total transparency in controlling the disease, right from the crematorium data,’’ he said. Commending minister Moorthy for his work on the ground including the appointment of 3,800 temporary staff for door-to-door screening to identify cases early, he said that roping in rural PHCs and enabling vaccine and testing facilities in them had helped bring the disease under control.The minister blamed the shortage of vaccines on bad planning and management by the Union government, which had exported a large number of vaccines before meeting its own demand. India, which had the capacity to produce the highest number of vaccines, did not plan or give importance to the same, he said.“We also hope to bring enough medicines for treating black fungus and Covid-19,’’ he said. “GRH now has a zero waiting ward and we soon plan to bring an 8,000 litre capacity oxygen plant to Madurai,” he said. Asked if the state government shouldn’t cooperate with the Union government to avail more benefits, he said such a question did not arise, and that it was the duty of the Union government to consider all states as equal and provide for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-has-beaten-other-dists-in-covid-control-min/articleshow/83155628.cms||---

Police have detained three of the accused and are searching for their acquaintance who is on the run. The deceased has been identified as 26-year-old Firozkhan Pathan, who tried to broker peace when his cousin and his friend got into a fight. Police said, “Mohmmed Asif and Mohammed Hussain were friends. They were both arrested earlier and sent to Sabarmati jail. There, the two had a big fight. Recently, both of them came out on parole. On Monday, when all the friends got together, Hussain and Asif recollected their dispute in jail which led to a major dispute among the two.” They added that Asif and his friends including Muzaffar Shaikh and Bahu Shaikh began chasing Hussain in order to kill him. “Firoz tried to intervene and stop the three men but they attacked him.

---||Madurai||South Tamil Nadu registers most Covid deaths in May||MADURAI: The southern districts have seen a rapid increase in Covid-19 deaths in the second wave, with the toll in May alone coming up to 78% of the total deaths from the disease in the region from March 2020 to April this year. Madurai continues to top the table with 902 deaths till May 31, of which 385 were added in a month. Kanyakumari follows with 728, out of which 426 died in a month. The total Covid-19 deaths in all the southern districts till April were 2,323, but another 1,809 were added in May, taking the toll to 4,132 by May 31. Sources at Government Rajaji Hospital say the high number of deaths in Madurai is also because the hospital has a patient overload as it is the biggest GH for all the ten southern districts. It is the first hospital where patients seek relief in an emergency situation. Madurai is also the hub of private hospitals in the southern districts. Virudhunagar district is third in terms of death toll with 410 so far while Dindigul recorded an 89% increase in May compared to the deaths in the previous 14 months. Sivaganga district, which has comparatively lesser medical infrastructure, has seen fewer deaths. The total till April 2021 was 132 while it had just 29 deaths in May, taking its total to 161 till date. However, the death rate in many of the southern districts has decreased now, except for Kanyakumari, Dindigul and Tenkasi which have been seeing an increase. The overall death rate of the southern districts had decreased to 1.15% by May end from 1.24% till April as the total cases had also gone up. The number which was 1,85,189 till April went up by 1,74,217 cases in May — a 94% increase — to touch 3,59,409. Kanyakumari district collector M Arvind said one reason for the high deaths could be the presence of a large number of private hospitals in the district, which shared about 2,000 beds for patients from other districts who came there for treatment. Though the Asaripallam medical college hospital has a 24KL oxygen tank, which was sufficient to meet the requirement, some private hospitals faced issues when the second wave hit. “But now the situation has stabilised and we are able to give the private hospitals also a fair share of liquid oxygen and we expect the deaths to come down,’’ he said Dindigul district collector M Vijayalakshmi said the referral of critical cases from private hospitals to government institutes at the last moment was a challenge and now they had asked the private hospitals to ensure that very critical cases are not transferred to GH. In terms of oxygen requirement, the district was able to meet its needs, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/record-covid-deaths-in-south-tn-in-may/articleshow/83155647.cms||M K Ananth

Minister for cooperatives I Periyasamy released the water on Tuesday. Farmers in Theni district had requested the chief minister M K Stalin to release water from the Mullaperiyar dam for irrigation. As the water level in the dam touched the comfortable level of 130.9 feet, the chief minister ordered the release for the single crop in Theni district and parts of Dindigul district. Periyasamy said that it was after nearly 14 years that water was being released for irrigation from the Mullaperiyar. PWD sources said that water would be released from the dam only if the water level touched 120 feet during this period. The minister said that a total of 300 cusecs, including 200 for irrigation and 100 for meeting the drinking water needs of Theni district would be released for a period of 120 days. A total area of 14,707 acres - 11,807 in Uthamapalayam block, 2,412 in Theni block, 488 in Bodinayanakur - would benefit from this water release. Farmers have been asked to use the water judiciously.

---||Nagpur||Let’s learn to sail in the waves||The second wave will probably end soon, but the sufferings it caused to countless people will not be forgotten for long. Now, experts and government are preparing for the third wave of the pandemic, which may or may not be bigger than the first two, and the jury is still out how it will affect children. At TOI Debate, panellists discuss the reasons that led to resurgence of the viral infection and the measures needed to blunt its impact in the futureNagpur: The general consensus after the first wave was that the worst is over and normal life can slowly resume. But the second wave caught everybody, right from government to experts to common people, off-guard. It also defied the belief that Indians are more resilient due to our exposure to unhygienic surroundings and history of past infections. “We are equally vulnerable as other countries,” said Dr Pankaj Harkut, a cardiologist, who also pointed out that slow pace of vaccination due to initial hesitancy among the vulnerable population, non-adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour and mutation in the virus are responsible for the second wave. Dr Harkut emphasized on studying the virus for mutations while preparing for the next wave. According to Dr Himanshu Patil, endocrinologist and diabetologist, lowering the guard after the first wave and mutation in the virus caused the second wave. “Now, we should hope for the best but prepare for the worst,” he said. Pointing that there was premature celebration after the first wave ended, Dr Shubhada Khirwadkar, senior paediatrician and former president of IAP Nagpur, said three Ps mattered. “First is paucity of resources, both human and technical, pressure that led the virus to become more contagious and lack of preventive measures,” she said. Most experts had declared that the second wave would not be severe. So, what went wrong? Giving insight into what happened in Nagpur, Avinash Thakre, ruling party leader in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), said that only about a month after cases began rising rapidly, we came to know that a double mutant was in circulation. “Had the experts warned us, our preparations could have been better. We can’t blame the experts too, probably they too didn’t expect this,” he said. On the slow pace of vaccination, Thakre too said there was hesitancy initially and only after the third report about Covaxin trials came out, the turnout increased. He emphasized that the authority was not lacking in efforts but even after increasing the bed capacity to 10,000, they proved inadequate. Khirwadkar attributed the delay in getting data about virus mutation to not enough genome sequencing. “Investment in research labs is definitely lacking,” she said. Neurosurgeon Dr Ninad Shrikhande blamed over-confidence of people and government, lack of knowledge and an underprepared administration for the devastating second wave. “We did not learn from experience of developed countries like US,” he said. Dr Shrikhande strongly felt that instead of last year, the nationwide lockdown was needed at this juncture. Countering this, Thakre said last year’s lockdown allowed us to control the spread and helped gather more knowledge about the virus, prepare our resources and manpower to fight it. “As far as Nagpur is concerned, the administration had reserved 2,900 beds only for Covid patients in November 2020. The capacity was increased to 3,900 in March but nobody could have thought the requirement would reach around 13,000,” he said. The city required 70 tonnes oxygen in the first wave. “The administration then made provision for 110 tonnes, but 280 tonnes oxygen was needed at the peak of second wave. Yet, we arranged it on time,” said Thakre. According to Dr Patil, there was no fear of pandemic after the first wave, which led to superspreader events. Joseph George, president of NGO Together We Can, felt the NMC office-bearers and bureaucrats had always been at loggerheads over handling of the pandemic. He claimed that in February when he had warned municipal commissioner that things were going out of hand, the reply was “nothing is going to happen”. “Gatherings and marriages were stopped only from the last week of February. By that time damage had already been done. NMC is not prepared for the third wave,” he said. Thakre responded that in a pandemic a municipal corporation was responsible for only quarantining people. “Yet, NMC created bed facility,” he said. Experts across the world are stressing mass vaccination was the only way to end the pandemic, but India has been slow so far. On this, Dr Shrikhande said the government placed the vaccine order very late. “There was over confidence on part of government, which is quite evident now,” he said. Dr (Major) Vaibhav Chandankhede, head & neck surgeon, IGGMCH, said he would like to look at solutions rather than pondering over mistakes. He said need was to speed up the vaccination drive for 18-44 age group. Dr Khirwadkar too said covering this group quickly will also prevent infection among children. George made it clear that vaccinating rural population was going to be a big challenge. Khirwadkar confirmed that vaccine trials have started for the 2-18 age group. “We would be ready to vaccinate them maybe after 4-6 months,” she said and emphasized on motivating children and their families to follow measures like sanitization, wearing mask and physical distancing. IAP is conducting awareness programmes in this regard, she said. Referring to reports that 8,000 children were infected in Ahmednagar district in May, Kalyani Deshpande Marpakwar, assistant government pleader in high court and a mother, said that CSR funds being collected by the administration from big companies can be used for creating health infrastructure and providing medicines for children. “Protecting children needs to be the priority as vaccine is not available for them yet,” she said. “Now, health should be the priority above all else. Spending on health infrastructure should increase. Right now, make vaccination mandatory,” said Renu Mohile, homemaker and mother of young children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lets-learn-to-sail-in-the-waves/articleshow/83184763.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Football season ends without a game in Kolhapur||Kolhapur: The football stadiums were empty and no matches took place in Kolhapur for the entire playing season for the first time since the game gained foot in the city 70 years back. The Kolhapur Sports Authority (KSA) administration said on Monday night that the registration of teams and players was done this year, but no tournament or a match was conducted due to the Covid wave and lockdown. There are over 2,000 players associated with around 99 teams in the city. Sachin Gaikwad, a right half player from Balgopal Talim, deprived of the financial support through team contracts, has been selling vegetables in front of Padmaraje School these days. “This year, all the players are suffering financially. I am selling vegetables to support my family,” he said. In 2019, the football season was called off due to a fight between two teams. Last year, a tournament was cancelled mid way and the season called off due to Covid restrictions. Omkar Patil, mid-fielder for Patakadil Talim Mandal, said his work in a private nationalized bank has helped him. “The players earn their six-month income through the football team contracts. It has not been there since last year.” Local players were finally getting some recognition and national platform through the league matches. However, with no tournament or ground activity, the football career of many players is in jeopardy. Sachin Patil, captain of Dilbahar Talim, said that their fitness levels have been affected due to continuous lockdown. “There is a huge difference in the practice done on ground and working out at home. Since the last three seasons, the players are not on the field. Players will now need three to four months of practice to return to proper fitness levels. Hopefully, Covid will decrease and the next season will start on time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/football-season-ends-without-a-game-in-kolhapur/articleshow/83158551.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Rituals were performed by priests and Hanuman temples remained closed due to the corona induced lockdown in the city. However, a number of devotees were seen outside temples, paying their obeisance on the auspicious day. At Hanuman Setu temple many people were seen clicking selfies. The temple authorities had barricaded the main entrance so that no devotee could breach the Covid protocol. “Though we were not allowed to enter the temple, we wanted to thank the lord for saving our lives,” Avantika Srivastava, a devotee, said, adding that “it has been a troublesome year for everyone and a temple visit gives us solace.” Meanwhile, Hanuman Setu Temple and Naya Hanuman Temple, Aliganj did the live-streaming of the morning and evening ‘aarti’ on Facebook, giving an opportunity to devotees to have a ‘darshan’ of the Lord Hanuman. “Devotees were curious about temple re-opening, but the need of the hour for everyone is to stay indoors and read Hanuman Chalisa in their homes. Had the temples been opened on Tuesday, it would not have possible for us to enforce the Covid protocol,” said Anil Kumar Tiwari, chief executive officer and administrator of Aliganj Shri Mahaveer ji Trust (Naya Hanuman Mandir).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bada-mangal-celebrated-amid-full-covid-protocol/articleshow/83157983.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Debt-ridden man who killed wife, mother, son gets life term||RAJKOT: A debt-ridden imitation jewellery maker who had strangled his mother, wife and seven-year-old son in a suicide pact in October 2017 but later developed cold feet when he tried to kill himself, was sentenced to life imprisonment on Tuesday by a local court here. Additional sessions judge P N Dave found Alpesh Vajani (42) guilty of murdering his wife Deepali (36), mother Bharati (65) and son Madhav with the help of his father Jitendra Vajani (67), who died a few months ago during the course of the trial. According to case details, Alpesh was under heavy debt and was facing a severe cash crunch because of his mother Bharati’s illness for which she had to be hospitalized for two months in 2017. A depressed Aplesh and other family members agreed on a suicide pact. They lived in Radha Mira Park on Morbi road in Rajkot city. As decided, Alpesh strangled his wife Deepali, mother Bharati and son Madahv with the help of his father Jitendra on October 15, 2017 night. After killing three family members, Alpesh wrote a suicide note and left it in the house. He and Jitendra tried to hang self, but could not gather courage. So they left home and tried to end lives on the railway track. But there too the duo backed out. They kept on roaming in the city. Two days later, Alpesh’s neighbours called the police after a foul smell started emanating from his house. Police broke the door to access entry and found decomposed bodies of Deepali, Bharati and Madhav. They also found ‘dupattas’ hanging from fans in both rooms. On further searching the room, police found a suicide note written by Alpesh, where he had stated that he was under severe financial crisis so he along with his wife, son and parents have decided to commit suicide. Alpesh had further written that he and his father were going to a railway track on Morbi Road to end their lives as they could not gather the courage to hang themselves. While the police were doing investigation Alpesh and Jitendra returned home. During questioning, the duo confessed to killing the three. They were arrested for murder and lodged in Rajkot central jail. A few months ago, Jitendra died during the treatment while Alpesh was in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-gets-life-imprisonment-for-killing-wife-mother-son/articleshow/83152722.cms||---
---||Nagpur||20 lakh tests in Nagpur, equivalent to 70% of total population||NAGPUR: The number of Covid-19 tests has crossed the 20 lakh mark in the city — almost 70% of total population. As per data of district civil surgeon, 20,155,28 tests have been conducted in the city between March 16, 2020 and June 1 this year. The estimated population of the city is around 29 lakh. Thus, the number of tests is 69.5% of total population. Tests in rural parts of the district are less as compared to the city. 7,95,158 tests have been conducted in rural parts and estimated population is 23.73 lakh. Thus, number of tests is 33.5% of total population. The district’s estimated population is 52.73 lakh. Overall tests in the district are 28,10,686 which is 53.3% of total population.  Meanwhile, positive cases dropped to 203 in the district on Tuesday which was lowest in a day after 125 days. Cases were 142 in the city and 57 in rural on Tuesday. Remaining four cases were from other districts. Previous lowest cases in a day were 166 (city | 122, rural | 42 and other districts | 2) on January 27. Tests also declined to 10,545 on Tuesday while 12 patients succumbed. Active cases dropped to 5,619. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Tuesday urged people to continue following Covid guidelines. “Number of cases and transmission has gone down. Therefore, we have started opening economic activities in a phased manner. But all should wear mask, avoid spitting in public places and maintain social distancing,” he said. Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association Dr Anup Marar told TOI, “Number of Covid-19 tests do not mean such number of people underwent tests. There may be many people who got tests done multiple times. Many companies had made testing compulsory for their employees irrespective of symptoms. But such large number of tests depicts good awareness among people,” he said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “Tests on time help in containing the virus spread and preventing deaths. But number of tests won’t make any sense in the manner of estimating infection prevailing in the city or symptomatic population and calculation of herd immunity. Many tests were done also for other purposes like travel, joining offices etc,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/20l-tests-in-city-equivalent-to-70-of-total-population/articleshow/83155680.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Madurai||Disclose materials used in making sanitary napkins: Madras HC||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday sought a response from the central and state governments on a plea which sought the manufacturers to disclose the materials used in the manufacture of sanitary napkins and diapers, on its wrappers. Observing that the petitioner had flagged an important issue, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi directed the central and state governments to file counter affidavits in order to ascertain the parameters put in place in this regard. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by S Ayyaa, a resident of Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli district. The petitioner stated that though the schemes implemented by the governments on menstrual hygiene is progressive, it is necessary to take note of the ill-effects caused by the poor quality of the napkins. He stated that toxins such as dioxin and trihalomethane are being used which could cause harmful diseases like cancer, infertility, hormonal imbalance and multiple menstrual disorders. He stated that companies manufacturing sanitary napkins and diapers wilfully do not disclose the materials which are used. Unfortunately, the people without analysing the importance of hygiene fall for the advertising, cost and packaging of these products. He stated that sanitary napkins and diapers made of biodegradable and chemical free materials such as bamboo fibre, jute fibre, corn starch would help preserve the health of the people as it would have no side effects. Since no steps were taken on the representation to the authorities in this regard, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench. He also sought the authorities to make mandatory the standard test issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards for the companies manufacturing sanitary napkins and diapers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/disclose-materials-used-in-making-sanitary-napkins/articleshow/83155678.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Leopard kills pig near Maharajbagh, still elusive||Nagpur: Five days after entering the city, the still elusive leopard made its first kill of a stray pig near a nullah adjoining the agricultural field on Maharajbagh Road. The leopard was sighted by a woman labourer in the area on Monday afternoon. Foresters made all out efforts to trap the animal by deploying cages with bait and cameras but the big cat eluded them. On Tuesday morning, the half-eaten carcass of the pig was found near the compound wall of the farm was the only evidence of its still being around. There are many stray pigs and dogs moving in three nullahs near the zoo.“As the leopard is suspected to be in the same area and may return on the kill, we have decided to change the strategy,” said Surendra Kale, assistant conservator of forest (ACF).“We have deployed three trap cages in the one-km radius of the zoo. Goats have been kept as baits in two cages while the half-eaten pig has also been put in one of the cages near the same spot where it was killed. Besides, eight camera traps have also been deployed,” said Kale.The officials and citizens are perplexed at the animal behaviour but experts on leopard ecology and man-animal conflict say there is nothing to worry unless people chase or disturb the animal it will attack humans only in self-defence.“Leopards are secretive animals very adaptive to woody areas in the cities. Due to their superlative stealthiness, they hide well,” said Vidya Athreya, a wildlife biologist who works on human-leopard interactions.Citing the example of Aarey Colony near Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Mumbai, Athreya said, “Leopards are frequent visitors to Aarey. They also enter residential complexes and housing societies in search of prey but rarely harm humans. It must be the same with Nagpur leopard.”“There is a need for strong monitoring. Secondly, people should also not disturb or chase the animal. In many cities, leopards come close to human habitations and people don’t even know. Many times we learn about it through CCTV footage,” Athreya said.Dr Mayukh Chatterjee, head, human-wildlife conflict division, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), said, “In last five days, the leopard has not harmed any human means it is very adaptive even in city areas. It is comfortable with some vegetation and woody patches. The animal can harm only if it is injured or old. For five days it is moving in the city without getting noticed means it is quite mature and sensible.”Dr Chatterjee said, “Leopards have homing instincts. If not disturbed, it will find its way back to the forest it came from. There should be round-the-clock monitoring and cautioning people about dos and don’ts. If you crowd around it, then it will attack to escape.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-kills-pig-near-maharajbagh-still-elusive/articleshow/83155731.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 2,938 appointed to grant-in-aid schools||GANDHINAGAR: Addressing a decade-old issue, the state government on Tuesday handed over letters appointing 2,938 teachers to non-government grant-in-aid higher secondary schools across Gujarat. Speaking on the occasion, CM Vijay Rupani said the state government has appointed 14,000 teachers in the past decade. The government claimed that even during the pandemic, the appointment procedure has been faceless and paperless, ensuring transparency and fairness in appointment of teachers in grant-in-aid schools. The CM said that although schools remained closed during the past academic year, education continued online because of the pandemic. While the CM distributed appointment letters to five teachers in the state capital, district collectors distributed letters to teachers in all the districts of Gujarat, where programmes were held simultaneously. Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said that as a result of mass promotion of all students, state-wide bridge courses will be introduced in all primary and secondary schools to keep students abreast with all major concepts of the previous year.

He added, “This dip has a direct link with the decline in Covid cases. In April, when the pandemic had peaked in Pune, about 40-50% of children with fever would test positive for Covid. In May, that percentage was down to below 5 to 10%.” Bharati Hospital, with one of the largest paediatric units in the region, has also seen a steep fall in children with Covid-like symptoms. “Since May 10, the number of kids in our fever/Covid OPD is now down to just 1 to 2 per day,” said paediatrician and Bharati's deputy medical director Jitendra Oswal. In April, the hospital had 189 Covid cases below 18. In May, there were 57. During the second wave, doctors said many from the same family were testing positive due to high transmission rates. So, a sizeable number of cases were those below 18. “But cases overall have been dropping over the last three weeks. And children are no exception,” said paediatrician Jayant Joshi.  Flu shots are also being given in good numbers. “Flu shot doesn’t protect against Covid, but can prevent influenza viruses-associated infections and curb pneumonia during the pandemic,” said paediatrician Sharad Agarkhedkar. Paediatrician Vijay Varad said, “Mask use has risen among children. We need to promote their use even after curbs are relaxed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sharp-drop-in-kids-with-covid-like-signs-doctors/articleshow/83155713.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Experts fear coercion may trigger hesitancy for tests||Pune: Health experts fear that the state’s emphasis on institutional quarantine in the rural areas might be counter-productive, as many may evade tests to avoid being taken to such centres.Dr PP Doke, former health director of the state government, said there was a need to strengthen home isolation by ensuring that the patients abided by the Covid protocols. “A coercive measure will never yield results. If a person has facilities at home and assures the administration that he or she would abide by the rules, there should be no forced institutional quarantine.” Public health expert Dr R Jotkar said any coercion could not ensure people’s participation, especially during the time of Covid. “A threat to move a mild asymptomatic person to a Covid care centre will not help, as he or she may avoid getting tested. Such measures will never go down well with people,” he said. When the state had first issued a he statement of “compulsory institutional quarantine” and then revised it stating that they are not banning home isolation, senior administrative officials had said the percentage of patients in home isolation was large and it would be practically impossible to push everyone for institutional quarantine. A healthcare worker in the rural area said that before the state government had emphasised on institutional quarantine, people were willing to be tested. “Now there is hesitancy,” the worker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-fear-coercion-may-trigger-hesitancy-for-tests/articleshow/83155700.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad dist: 608 black fungus cases, 57 deaths during 2nd wave||Aurangabad: The administration has revealed that the Aurangabad district has registered as many as 608 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) and 57 patients have succumbed to the fungal infection during the second wave of the pandemic. As per the official data, the district currently has 345 active mucormycosis cases and 206 patients have been cured so far. The actual number of mucormycosis patients has been found to be more than the official estimates. The district administration is now making efforts to get a larger quota of Amphotericin B injections that are used in the treatment of the fungal infection. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said he has established contact with the state-level health authorities to discuss the mucormycosis situation and the supply of Amphotericin B injections. “The district administration has requested the public health department to revise the Amphotericin B quota considering the total number of active cases,” he said. Going by the official data, Aurangabad district has over 9% mortality rate among mucormycosis patients. Local Shiv Sena MLA Sanjay Shirsath said the state government should supply Amphotericin B injections at the division-level instead of the state-level. “The mortality rate among mucormycosis patients is worrisome. Many patients are getting life-long deformities despite getting cured. There must be concerted efforts to manage mucormycosis cases along the lines of Covid management,” he said. Among mucormycosis patients treated under the surgical category, maxillectomy (the removal of all or part of the upper jaw); debridement (the removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue) and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (a minimally invasive technique used to restore sinus ventilation and normal function) are some of the common treatments. The break-up of cured mucormycosis patients who underwent such procedures was not available with the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-dist-608-black-fungus-cases-57-deaths-during-2nd-wave/articleshow/83158583.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Mayo resident doctors go on mass leave||Nagpur: More than 200 resident doctors in Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), also known as Mayo hospital, have proceeded on indefinite mass leave from 9am on June 1. The medicos, who are postgraduate students of various specialized fields, are insisting to get the surgical complex back for non-Covid patients, so that they can get experience of their respective specialization. The surgical complex building is earmarked as Covid hospital and only such patients are being admitted here for the last 12 months. According to president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) at IGGMCH, Dr Ganesh Parwe, the district administration and guardian minister had assured them to get this building freed for non-Covid work once pandemic scenario improves in Nagpur. “Now, Covid cases have gone down significantly. We have only 31 patients admitted in the surgical complex building. Engaging such a big infrastructure for 31 patients is not proper. Despite several requests and reminders, the dean is not taking any action on our demand. Hence, we are left with no option but to go on mass leave,” said Dr Parwe. The residents also made it clear that they don’t want patients to suffer due to their agitation. “No junior resident is working in OPD, wards including SARI wards, labour room and casualty. We do care about seriously ill patients and hence we will be working in ICUs, including Covid ICU,” states a letter issued by the MARD committee. IGGMCH dean Dr Ajay Keoliya had a meeting with the agitating doctors on Tuesday. Later, he appealed to the medicos to resume duties or face action as per rules. “The college council meeting was called on June 1, but no one from the residents attended. We have been asked to start non-Covid work in surgical complex building step-by-step. We have already started the process of vacating the fourth floor. In later phase, third floor will also be vacated and non-Covid work will start there,” reads the letter signed by Dr Keoliya. According to him, mucormycosis patients admitted in ward 6 and 24 are being shifted to other wards. After sanitization, operation theatre and tables will be handed over to general surgery and orthopaedic department. “I have informed higher authorities about the mass leave and DMER representatives will speak to the doctors,” said the dean.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mayo-resident-doctors-go-on-mass-leave/articleshow/83155755.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

According to locals, the issue of this huge tree which was blocking the road persisted for almost three days before the officials took initiative to remove it. “It was a huge tree which was uprooted due to the heavy winds a few days ago. Although the locals removed the branches, the entire trunk which was lying in across the road was not cleared by the civic officials until the issue was published in the newspaper,” said Shubhi Garg, a class 6 student and the citizen reporter who highlighted the problem. Shubhi who took pictures of the tree blocking the entire road said that she highlighted the issue on TOI’s citizen reporter app with the help of her mother, Sonam Garg. Another citizen from Yellareddyguda said that the tree which was lying in the middle of the road was causing severe problems to the commuters who regularly take the road. “We were forced to take a detour on all the three days because there was no space for vehicles to go to the other side of the road. We are glad that it has been finally cleared. I request the GHMC officials to ensure that these issues are resolved immediately,” said Manik Agarwal, an entrepreneur. Meanwhile, city mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi who has been inspecting the sanitation works in different parts of the city from past few weeks urged GHMC staff to work effectively and informed them that strict action would be taken against those failing to provide service to the people properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/yellareddyguda-road-cleared-after-being-blocked-for-3-days/articleshow/83155891.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Loan app case: Rs 1.18 crore siphoned off from Kolkata bank account||HYDERABAD: Armed with a fake letter, fraudsters posed as cybercrime officials and managed to transfer Rs 1.18 crore from a Kolkata bank account, earlier frozen on the request of Hyderabad police, in the multi-city loan app fraud case. The incident occurred in April, but came to light on Monday when an ICICI bank official lodged a complaint with Hyderabad cybercrime police about an attempt by fraudsters to siphon off money from frozen bank accounts in their Gurgaon branch. On April 21, a man approached an ICICI branch in Alipore, Kolkata with a fake letter saying that the officer in-charge, cyber cell police, Lal Bazaar, Kolkata, has directed the bank to unfreeze 12 accounts and transfer the amount to an SBI account. "The fraudster also showed a fake police identity card and without even asking how Kolkata police can give instructions to the bank about the case investigated by Hyderabad police, the bank officials transferred Rs 1.18 crore to the SBI account as mentioned in the letter,” cybercrime ACP KVM Prasad said. “From the SBI account, the money was transferred to multiple accounts at various places and withdrawn immediately," he added. Police sources said that Rs 1.18 crore was initially transferred to an SBI account of Anand J in RGI Airport SBI branch. "The details of the account holder are fake," police said. As part of a loan app fraud case, Telangana police had registered 28 cases, involving 211 apps and arrested 32 accused. Police wrote to banks and froze 1125 accounts across the country containing about Rs 190 crore. Similarly, in the third week of April, fraudsters sent a fake letter in the name of Hyderabad cybercrime police to Udyog Vihar branch of ICICI bank in Gurgaon asking them to unfreeze 39 accounts linked to a loan app fraud case registered in Hyderabad. "In the letter instructions were given to transfer the amount from frozen accounts to four beneficiary accounts. But the bank officials sensed something was wrong and alerted their Hyderabad office," the ACP said. Bank officials verified with police and realised that the letter was fake and during the subsequent inquiry found out about the fraud at Kolkata. On Monday, a representative of ICICI bank lodged a complaint with police and a forgery case was registered. "We have registered a case under Sections 66-d of the IT Act, 419, 420, 468 and 471 of the IPC, pertaining to the fake Hyderabad police letter received by the ICICI bank in Gurgaon. The bank filed a separate complaint in Kolkata about the fraud committed in Alipore," cybercrime Inspector D Prashant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/loan-app-case-rs-1-8-cr-siphoned-off-from-bank-a/c/articleshow/83155775.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Schools in the city said they were prepared for conducting the exams and also ready with the option of cancelling the exam and stated that the safety of students was a priority. Manasi Parmar, a CBSE student, said, “We are happy that a decision has been made. We were confused as to what would happen. Now the decision about the future course also needs to be taken immediately.” Ankit Rathi, another CBSE student, said the fate of entrance tests and the admissions thereafter hangs in balance. Rathi added, “For undergraduate admissions, the entrance exams are more important than the Std XII exams. We need to know how that will come into effect. Considering the situation and the cases, the board must take appropriate action in time.” Maya Sen, another CBSE board student, said, “We are now relaxed and can finally set our books aside and focus only on admissions. However, we are worried about how it would be conducted.” Principal of The Orbis School, Nalini Samuel, said, “Keeping in mind the danger of infection spreading among the staff and students, even conducting an examination for a few of the subjects would put both teachers and the students at risk. The board can also come up with online examinations as many universities have resorted to this method. Undergraduate courses could have divided weightage to the scoring of the school examinations and also conducting entrance exams like a CET to maintain a balance between the efforts of the children, while keeping their best interest in mind.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbse-isc-students-relieved-but-admissions-are-a-new-worry/articleshow/83155746.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

While the formal announcement for setting up the health institution was made back in July 2018, things could not progress due to non-sanctioning of the suitable land. As announced earlier, the new college at Osmanabad is proposed to have an intake capacity of 100 students. “The 10-acre land has been allocated after completing all formalities related to handing over of the title and obtaining NOCs from different government departments. While the recruitment for filling up the posts of faculties has been already initiated, the appointment of other staff will be also beginning soon. If all goes as per plans, the medical college will start its academic activities by the next academic year,” an official release said, quoting Osmanabad Guardian Minister Shankar Gadakh. Stating that the proposed medical college would be expanded by starting different super specialities, Gadakh said efforts are on to acquire more land that is required for such expansion. “The unutilised land from neighbouring Auyrveda College and ITI can be acquired for expansion of the proposed medical college. The state higher and technical education department, public health department, among others will be contacted soon for getting the additional land,” Gadakh said. Once the new medical college is ready on Osmanabad, the total number of such state-run institutions imparting medical education will go up to five in Marathwada. Aurangabad, Ambajogai (Beed district), Nanded and Latur already have government-run medical colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/proposed-medical-college-in-osmanabad-finally-gets-land/articleshow/83158595.cms||---

The footfall has dropped from average 136 per day to 37 per day. However, it was different at Kingsway Hospital that on Tuesday became first private hospital in Vidarbha to begin inoculation after revision in guidelines. Their session of 300 slots was created on Tuesday and slots were filled within five minutes. The central government had stopped vaccine supply to private hospitals and allowed them to procure directly from manufacturers from May 1. Kingsway Hospital became the first one to get Covishield doses from Serum Institute of India (SII) two days ago. Director Amit Somani told TOI, “435 people were vaccinated on trial basis a day ago. 576 were inoculated on Tuesday. Thus, 1,011 people were vaccinated. Our target is to inoculate 1,000 per day.” Two more private hospitals in city are trying to get doses from their headquarters in Mumbai and Hyderabad. After launching on May 1, the state had stopped vaccination of 18-44 years age group from May 12. Many from this age group are eager to get inoculated. On the lines of Mumbai, NMC had begun two centres for drive-in vaccination on May 14. As per NMC’s data, 1,225 people were vaccinated at a daily average of 136 in first nine days. Since then, the footfall started to drop. In last one week, 260 took the jab at a daily average of 37. The capacity of two centres is over 600 per day. NMC officials said, “We were planning more such centres in other parts of the city. Now, the plan has been dropped considering poor response in these. They might get good crowd when the government resumes vaccination of 18-44 years age group,” they said. Main motive of drive-in vaccination was to make inoculation easier for senior citizens and persons with disabilities. The overall number of beneficiaries has also continued to decline in the district. In all 3,539 healthcare workers, frontline workers and 45-plus took first and second dose in the district on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/footfall-at-two-drive-in-vax-centres-drops-to-below-40/day/articleshow/83155899.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Aniruddha Joshi, a final-year engineering student, said two of his team members live in Akola while the other two live in Pune. “We divided our work. They did most of the analytics and simulation part while we are doing the experimental part. The problem is that we have to buy everything from scratch. In the laboratories, we have all the basic infrastructure available, but at home, we need to buy everything right from the soldering gun. With the electrical shops closed, we have to order everything online and it is also costlier.” Students who were interning with various companies were unable to utilise their opportunities because the lockdown restricted many companies to call only 50% of their staff at a time, leading to lesser priority given for mentoring the interns. Mausam Dhande, a final-year production engineering student, said that in his internship, he could only complete the research based part of his project as the lockdown set him back to working in a virtual mode. “We had to adapt ourselves to the virtual part of it. We generally have to research a project and then come up with an innovative solution for the company to apply, but this time, that could not be done because of the lockdown,” he added. Manohar Chaskar, dean of science and technology faculty at SPPU, said, “There are some master’s level (PG) courses wherein project work is essential and important. Due to the lockdown, these students could not go to the college and hence a lot of their work is pending. Hence, we decided that these final year master’s level students in pharmacy, engineering and architecture, can submit their projects and appear for viva latest by August 31 instead of June-end. This is only applicable for master’s level students and not for undergraduates.” Practical Difficulties Students are divided into groups and the projects are made after spending almost a year in the laboratory Lockdown has ensured that none of them could meet often let alone use the college laboratory for making the live projects Many groups, including those from civil engineering and mechanical engineering, have taken to software-based projects These can be completed without having to step out of their homes Recently, Savitribai Phule Pune University announced a three-month extension for the project work It is for postgraduate students in engineering, architecture and other technical courses||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/final-year-project-work-for-technical-courses-takes-a-tumble/articleshow/83155882.cms||Ardhra Nair

The ED named 41 accused, including promoters of Musaddilal Gems and Jewels Private Limited and their relatives, in the chargesheet in the scam worth Rs 139 crore. The ED attached Rs 130 crore, including jewellery of Rs 86 crore, in February this year under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Immediately after the announcement of demonetisation on November 8, 2016, Musaddilal Gems and Jewels, Vaishnavi Bullion Pvt Ltd and Musaddilal Jewellers Private Ltd deposited high value currencies of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 to the tune of Rs 111 crore in their bank accounts. The accused raised fake cash receipts and sale invoices attributing alleged gold jewellery purchases by creating 5,911 fictitious customers between 8 pm and 12 am on the night the demonetisation was announced. The ED alleged that Musaddilal Jewellers MD Kailash Chand Gupta and his sons fabricated invoices below Rs 2 lakh by following the advice of CAs to avoid the mandatory requirement of KYC or PAN of customers. “The accused collected black money from other jewellers and friends and got the same deposited into their bank accounts to convert it into gold by taking commission,” it alleged. The directorate further said the accused had knowingly contributed their black money in demonetised cash for conversion to gold. The ED said family members of Kailash Gupta, Neel Sunder Tharad, proprietor of Ashta Lakshmi Gold, and Pavan Agarwal of Sri Balaji Gold contributed black money to the tune of ₹88 crore and generated further profit.

Mayor Usha Dhore and BJP house leader Namdev Dhake visited beneficiaries’ homes during the drive in which two bedridden citizens were vaccinated against the infection. Tuesday's drive was largely symbolic, officials said, with plans being laid out to reach more such individuals. The beneficiaries on Tuesday were a 75-year-old from New Sangvi and an 88-year-old from Bijli Nagar. Mayor Dhore said, “We are committed to vaccinating elderly citizens who cannot come to the vaccination centre due to underlying conditions.” Dhore added that vaccinations for this group would be free. “I urge citizens to register immediate family or relatives, who need these drives, on the ‘Me Jababdar’ mobile application,” she said. Dhake said vaccinations for bedridden citizens would be streamlined as the app is being modified. Vikas Dhakane, the additional commissioner of the PCMC, said the civic body’s outreach plan for those who were unable to step out of their homes is part of attempts to cover every beneficiary on the rolls. “We are also shortlisting a location for a drive-in vaccination programme. We may start the programme this week,” Dhakane said. He added that the PCMC, like the PMC, would soon start a dedicated vaccination site for students headed abroad for studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/in-pimpri-chinchwad-jabsbegin-for-the-bedridden/articleshow/83155820.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The incident on May 29 night prompted officials to warn beneficiaries that strict action would be take against them if they do not vacate the houses immediately. The houses were constructed in Polenigudem village of Chilkur mandal. Local tahsildar Rajeshwari explained to the families that the contractor had not handed over the houses to the panchayati raj department and that the houses lacked some basic amenities. The beneficiaries, however, were unwilling to listen to the authorities. Police tried to explain to the beneficiaries that certain procedures had to be followed for them to occupy the houses and if they do not vacate, they may be forced to book cases against them. The beneficiaries countered officials saying that the construction of the houses had been completed three years ago and said they have waited enough. Sources said the contractor has not handed over the houses to the panchayati raj department as he has not got his bills cleared by the officials. There is also no drinking water, electricity and drainage facility to the houses. Officials said since some of the works are still pending, the houses would be handed over at a later stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/2-bhk-beneficiaries-force-way-into-houses/articleshow/83155805.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

A day after he was received by Indian government authorities at Indo-Pak border in Attari on Monday, Vaindam said he should have listened to his mother and just stayed home. The techie, who spent over four years in Pakistan prisons, said that he managed to procure a software engineering textbook with the help of local Indians and prepared in the jail for job interviews. “I am ready to give job interviews now,” he said. While working at Shore Info Tech company in Madhapur as a software engineer, Prasanth went missing on April 11, 2017 after leaving home for work. A missing case was registered at Madhapur police station (388/2017) on April 29, 2017. “Due to some personal issues, Prasanth wanted to go to Switzerland and due to financial constraints, he wanted to go by foot. On April 11, he boarded a train to Bikaner after leaving his cell phone and other belongings at home,” Cyberabad commissioner VC Sajjanar said. After reaching Bikaner, Prasanth crossed the Indo-Pak border and was arrested by Pakistan police from Cholistan desert, adjoining Rajasthan’s Thar desert. “Initially, I was beaten up as the Pakistan cops wanted to know why I entered into Pakistan but they stopped when they realised that I was not a spy and went there by mistake,” Prasanth said at a media conference in Cyberabad police commissionerate. After getting an intimation about the repatriation of Prasanth through the Indian government, Madhapur police went to Attari border in Punjab on Monday and received him. Prasanth was handed over to his brother in Hyderabad on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/remorseful-prasanth-wants-to-apply-for-jobs/articleshow/83155867.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Pune||Colleges cannot hold back exam forms, says SPPU||PUNE: After many complaints from students and parents about colleges refusing to forward the examination forms submitted by their students were received by Savitribai Phule Pune University, the authorities declared that eligible students should not be deprived of the assessment for financial or any other reason. The university will hold the semester examination from June to August this year. While the students can fill up their forms and pay the examination fees online, the college has to forward the form from its portal to reach the university exam department. However, many colleges are holding on to the filled up forms without forwarding them to the university when the student has not paid the pending yearly or semester fees. Director of the board of examination and evaluation at SPPU Mahesh Kakade, via a circular on Monday, said, “It has come to our attention that the examination forms filled online by the students are not being sent (inwarded) to the university by the institute citing that the student has not paid his or her full fees. This is not acceptable. Colleges must ensure that examination forms of all students are filled and inwarded so that there is no academic loss for students.” A student, who did not wish to be named, said, “Our practical and internal marks are still with the college authorities. We cannot openly criticise the college or its wrong-doings because there is a chance that they will target students. All we are asking is to give us some more time to send the pending fees. All of us and our families are going through a financial crisis and hence have not been able to pay the fees. Moreover, colleges too should cut down their fees because many facilities for which they are taking fees are not being utilised for over a year.” The circular is out, but colleges are still reluctant to inward the examination forms. Students are being threatened that their forms will not be inwarded without paying the full fees. Colleges are openly flouting a university order. The university should provide separate Google Forms or e-mail to lodge a complaint and take immediate action against the erring colleges, says Kamalakar Shete I Student Activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-cannot-hold-back-exam-forms-says-sppu/articleshow/83168887.cms||Ardhra Nair

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who chaired the meeting, said it was a “positive discussion”. Meanwhile, the Ramdas Athavale-led RPI started a ‘protest week’ in the state demanding to restore the ‘reservation in promotion’. RPI workers protested at Tardeo junction, Chembur, Anushakti Nagar, Goregaon, Solapur among other places. The state had decided to keep 33% of promotion posts vacant to be filled by candidates from backward classes like Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribe and Special Backward Classes, subject to the Supreme Court’s final verdict. Though the issue is hanging fire, the general administration department, headed by CM Uddhav Thackeray, on May 7, ordered that all posts be filled by promoting candidates only on the basis of seniority. Last week, Congress minister Nitin Raut and state Congress chief Nana Patole had said the party would take a strong stand if the government would not restore it within two-three days. Sources said Congress leaders ‘advised’ Raut to tone down his stand as it could cause trouble for the MVA. Raut, a sub-committee member, said: “The issue was discussed in a positive manner to find a way to restore reservation in promotion. We hope it will be sorted out soon.” He said the matter is now sub judice as a PIL is being filed in Bombay HC and hence, legal aspects will also have to be considered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/33-quota-in-promotion-no-decision-yet-by-cabinet-sub-panel-rpi-begins-protest-week-in-mumbai/articleshow/83158073.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Lucknow||Lucknow gives its best shot with record 19,500 jabs in a day||LUCKNOW: The city witnessed the highest single day turnout in the mass vaccination campaign against Covid-19 so far with 19,545 people taking the jab on Tuesday. It was also the inaugural day of Mission June, UP government’s big push to immunisation programme in the state. Vaccination was carried out in 150 booths – 147 government and three private – across the city. The district administration had created three mega centres at Ekana Stadium (20 booths), KD Singh Babu Stadium (nine) and Chhota Imambara (nine) with the target to inoculate 11,000 people, but turnout was less than expected at these places. There was also a difference between the number of vaccinations at these centres provided by the district administration and health department. While the chief medical officer’s office said total 4,633 people got the jab, the press statement issued by the district administration said 5,633 were inoculated. District immunisation officer Dr MK Singh said, “The difference in numbers might be due to some human error or the three centres might have updated the numbers after we released their figures. In any case, the data will be corrected on Wednesday.” The two reasons for less than expected turnout were sultry weather and huge crowds at the three centres. However, there were many who were determined to take the shot despite difficulties. Ajay Ranjan (30), who came along with his friends at KD Singh Babu Stadium, said: “The most important thing at this time of pandemic is to get vaccinated at the earliest. Since the entire month’s slots are already booked, going back without taking the dose would have meant waiting for a long time to get another slot. Therefore, my friends and I decided to get the shot.” CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “The turnout of the people of 45 years and above was comparatively low but we expect that their participation will increase in next rounds.” He said barring a few booths, social distancing and management was good during the drive. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash said all the necessary arrangements including sanitation, drinking water, chairs, helpdesk, police for crowd management, postvaccination observation rooms, emergency health services and special bus service were made. “We would improve the services and create more such centres to vaccinate maximum number of people during the ongoing drive.” Highest turnout in 18-44 year age group:More men (11,720) than women (7,825) took the vaccine shots on Tuesday. In fact, this trend was witnessed across all age groups. Among the age groups, the highest turnout of 15,276 (78%) was of people in the age group of 18-44 years – which 13,473 taking the first jab while 1,803 getting the second shot of the two-dose vaccine course. In the 45-59 years category, 2,939 people got inoculated – 2,706 with the first dose and 233 the second. Similarly, in 60 years and above, 905 people took the vaccine of whom 797 got the first shot while 108 took the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-gives-its-best-shot-with-record-19-5k-jabs-in-a-day/articleshow/83158057.cms||Yusra Husain

The victim was assaulted multiple times and became pregnant due to the sexual assault. On August 8, 2015, Ghatkesar police received a complaint from the victim, stating that she was pregnant due to the repeated sexual assault by the accused at his house in Ghatkesar. Police said the victim was a neighbour of the accused. “Whenever his wife was out of home, the accused used to call the victim to his house and offer her coffee laced with sedative. Once she was unconscious, he raped her,” police said. Due to multiple assaults, the victim became pregnant and her family realised this only after she was found to be seven months pregnant. After the completion of the trial on Tuesday, metropolitan sessions judge (MSJ) B Suresh convicted the accused and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The court also imposed Rs 10,000 fine on the convict.

---||Hyderabad||HC junks HCA plea seeking quashing of ACB chargesheet||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Tuesday dismissed criminal petitions filed by Hyderabad Cricket Association executive committee members — Arshad Ayub, DS Chalapathi, K John Manoj and R Devraj — Nagarjuna Construction Company (NCC) and a few others who were urging the court to quash the ACB chargesheet against them in the alleged HCA fund misappropriation case being tried by the ACB court in Hyderabad. “Face the trial and prove your innocence,” Justice K Lakshman said and added that it is the trial court that would decide whether the members of HCA executive committee fall under the definition of public servants and are amenable to the jurisdiction of Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), 1988. Senior counsel V Ravi Kiran Rao, who appeared for the ACB, and informed the court that the state government gave 23 acres of public land to the HCA on a 25-year lease at a nominal rent of Rs 1 lakh per annum in 2004. The government had also granted funds from 1961 to 1983 to the HCA.  “ACB officials did a proper probe and dropped some charges against the accused when they found them to be irrelevant. A chargesheet too was filed. If the accused find any loopholes, they should use them during the trial to prove their innocence and the same cannot be a ground to quash the case against them here,” he said. The HCA was given 23 acres of government land at Uppal for constructing a cricket stadium. The office-bearers were charged with conniving with the contractor NCC by raising construction cost from Rs 31 crore to Rs 108 crore and embezzling a huge amounts from this. Prima facie, the judge said, there are serious allegations against the petitioners herein. “However, whether the HCA has received any aid or financial assistance, whether the office-bearers of HCA have discharged public duty, and whether they are the public servants as defined under the provisions of the PCA is a question of fact and triable issues. The same will be decided during the course of the trial. Those things cannot be decided at the high court,” the judge said. Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel C Nageswara Rao said the managing committee members never discharged their functions as public servants. Therefore, the provisions of PCA cannot be applied against them. “The offences alleged against the accused are not maintainable,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-junks-hca-plea-seeking-quashing-of-acb-chargesheet/articleshow/83155918.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Social distancing falls flat as Lucknow forgets caution amid enthusiasm||LUCKNOW: Social distancing went for a toss at three big vaccination centres—Ekana Stadium, KD Singh Babu Stadium and Chhota Imambara—as hundreds turned up to get the jab against Covid-19 on Day 1 of the mega inoculation drive on Tuesday. As people stood in long queues for hours in hot and humid weather for their turn, shortage of hands to ensure discipline led to overcrowding at some booths for the first half of the drive before officers intervened to streamline the situation. The drive was from 10am to 4pm. While people in the 18-44 years age group had to come after booking slots on the CoWin portal, walk-in vaccination facility was given to those aged 45 or above. However, people started arriving at 8.30am. As a result, by the time vaccination could start, there were long queues outside the centres with people standing close to each other. Inside the centres, there were arrangements of chairs, water and tents, but due to overcrowding, many had to stand for hours. A number of people also had to go back without getting the shot after seeing the huge crowd and hot weather. The total number of vaccinations at the three centres could not reach the target of 11,000. Gomtinagar resident Raj Kumar Singh came to Ekana camp with his son and wife, but left without taking the jab after waiting for two hours. “I booked a slot for 11am thinking the arrangement will be good in a big centre, but after seeing the crowd and no one to manage it, I am going back instead of taking the risk,” he said. Similarly, Poonam Dubey and Prem Kumar drove from Aliganj to Ekana but left disappointed after waiting for an hour. “The authorities need to revamp the mechanism, otherwise such overcrowding in camps will pave way for the third wave,” the couple said. Ankit Kumar (23) had booked a slot at KD Singh Babu Stadium and brought his father for spot registration. “I sent my father back because he has arthritis and cannot stand for long. Even I felt unsafe standing in the jostling crowd,” he said. “The administration has neither arranged for wheelchairs nor made separate queues for women,” said Geeta Bhatnagar (44), at KD Singh Babu Stadium. A large crowd had also assembled outside Chhota Imambara following announcements from local politicians asking people to reach the vaccination centre with their Aadhaar cards. “Contrary to the announcement in my colony that walk-in facility is for all, the service was only for elderly,” said Amit Gautam. Officers said that there were some hiccups on Day 1 of the drive, but things will improve from Wednesday. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash appealed to the people to come only at their slot times to avoid rush and overcrowding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/social-distancing-falls-flat-as-city-forgets-caution-amid-enthusiasm/articleshow/83158069.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Hyderabad||Raju is an interloper, dismiss his plea: Jagan tells CBI court||Hyderabad: Charging YSRC MP K Raghu Ramakrishna Raju with attempting to use court as a platform to settle personal scores, AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has described the Narsapur MP as a dishonest man, who defrauded banks on one hand and claiming that he has no questionable antecedents on the other. “He is an interloper trying to use the criminal justice process for personal and political gains,” Jagan Mohan Reddy said on Tuesday in his counter-affidavit filed before a CBI court, hearing the petition filed by Raju seeking cancellation of bail granted to Jagan in the quid pro quo case. Referring to the allegations made by Raju in his petition about influencing and coercing witnesses, Jagan said the petitioner did not show a single instance of influencing the witnesses in support of his claims. Countering the allegations made on his non-appearance before the trial court, Jagan said that dispensing with the presence was through an application and a court decision. “Raju failed to show how my physical absence has resulted in the delay of trial. As the presence of a chief minister is required for efficiently administering the state, the high court earlier granted me the liberty to approach and seek permission from the trial court as and when required to remain absent from the court,” he said. Referring to the allegations the rebel MP made against YSRC party functionaries like Koneru Rajendra Prasad, MPs Vijay Sai Reddy and Ayodhya Rami Reddy and MLA Dharmana Prasad Rao, Jagan, in his affidavit, described them as political functionaries, who do not fall under the official jurisdiction of a chief minister. Raju did not follow the basic rules that ask him to make those persons as parties when he was making allegations against them. Though he made serious allegations against senior IAS officers like the chief secretary, none of them was made parties to the case, Jagan said in the counter. Describing Raju’s petition as an attempt to tarnish his reputation, Jagan said that the petitioner miserably failed to make out a case for cancellation of bail and urged the court to dismiss the plea. He also enclosed the copies of CBI FIRs against Raju that charged him with defrauding banks to a tune of more than Rs 1200 crore and also the YSRC party’s petition filed before the Lok Sabha speaker seeking disqualification of Raju from his parliament membership on account of his anti-party activities. CBI chose not to file any counter in the matter and said that it was leaving it to the discretion of the court to take a decision in the interest of justice. The CBI court posted the for hearing case to June 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/raju-is-an-interloper-dismiss-his-plea-jagan-tells-cbi-court/articleshow/83155937.cms||---

The plan includes strengthening of the Covid paediatric ward at the Ahmednagar civil hospital, establishing Covid beds for children at primary health centres (PHCs) and rural hospitals and imparting training to government paediatric doctors and nurses on how to treat Covid-infected children. On Monday, district collector Rajendra Bhosale had said 9,928 children and teenagers under 18 tested positive for Covid-19 in Ahmednagar in May. Of them, 89 were aged up to 1 year, 3,052 between 1 and 10 years and 6,787 between 11 and 18 years. But Bhosale said the mortality rate in this age group is less than 0.5% and over 96% of the patients were asymptomatic. Bhosale has formed a district paediatric taskforce, headed by district civil surgeon Sunil Pokharna and RMO Suvarnmala Bangar. The president of the panel is Ashish Kokare. Talking to TOI, Sachin Solat, the secretary of the taskforce and a government paediatrician, said the number of Covid beds for children at the civil hospital would be increased from the existing 25 oxygen beds to 100. “As per the new plan, there would be 25 beds with ventilators and the remaining 75 would be oxygen beds. This infrastructure would be in place within the next 15 days,” added said Solat. The panel has also decided to set up 10 beds at the PHCs across the district where Covid-positive asymptomatic children would be treated. “At each of the rural hospitals in the district, there will be 10 oxygen beds for children and a trained pediatrician and nurse would be deployed. Children who need oxygen support will undergo treatment there,” Solat said. If the condition of a child suddenly worsens, s/he would be immediately transferred to civil hospital, he added. According to him, phase-wise training of government paediatricians and nurses has already started. “There is no need to worry on the medicine front. The medicines needed to treat Covid-positive children are readily available,” Solat said. The panel has decided that in case of dire need the district administration will seek help from private pediatricians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-taskforce-forms-plans-to-treat-covid-infected-children/articleshow/83158623.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The committee learnt about the digging a few days after the work had started and filed an online complaint with deputy collector of Mormugao, Sachin Desai. “The dredging with heavy machinery is causing irreparable damage to the khazan land in an eco-sensitive zone,” Lopinho Xavier, BMC chairperson said. The deputy collector had asked the talathi to inspect the site on May 29. BMC alleged that after the inspection fresh digging was carried out and a few hundred tonnes of mud has been dug and dumped in a nearby property. “The deputy collect has asked the party to produce documents and orally informed him to keep the work on hold,” a source said. The promoter had assured the panchayat that the one-of-its kind tourist recreation project would be pursued by maintaining natural balance and provide employment to locals. A section of villagers and Cortalim MLA, Alina Saldanha have opposed the project.

And that will help the state government start the process for e-auction,” Sawant had said. Recently, law minister Nilesh Cabral had said the department has vetted the memorandum of understanding (MoU) to be signed between the directorate of mines and geology and MECL to identify new iron ore mines in the state. Mining in Goa came to a halt three years ago following the decision of the Supreme Court quashing the second renewal of 88 mining leases. Since then the government and the mining companies are trying to restart mining activities in the state. While it’s currently unknown if the industry would restart this financial year, the state government has set a target of mopping up Rs 550 crore from the industry. Of the state’s 40 constituencies, ten have substantial areas dependent on mining, four in South Goa -- Sanvordem, Curchorem, Sanguem and Quepem and six in North Goa -- Poriem, Valpoi, Bicholim, Sakhali, Mayem and Tivim. Two mining companies have approached the apex court for extension of the mining leases till 2037. The companies had filed a special leave petition after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. The state government before the apex court had said that the mining companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8 A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, they are entitled to extend their mining leases up to 2037 but it will abide by the decision of the court. The state government has also filed a review petition in the apex court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/formation-of-mining-corp-delayed-as-law-dept-seeks-clarifications/articleshow/83155994.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Activists flag concerns after GHMC razes Sarai||Hyderabad: Locals and heritage activists raised concerns after Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) demolished part of Amberpet Sarai, a rest house which was constructed for travellers during the Qutub Shahi period. The Sarai was built keeping in view the needs of travellers to the city. Mohammed Majid, a resident of Amberpet said, “It is very sad that heritage structures in the city are being neglected to such an extent. The structure has been standing here since ages. They cannot destroy heritage in the name of development. We would have never allowed them to raze the structure if we knew from before that they were going to do this.” Heritage activists in the city said that these structures stand as examples to the people of the friendly policies of the then-rulers and the government must protect them for the future generations. “I was told that the GHMC has demolished the Sarai for road widening. On one side they are claiming that they want to protect all the heritage structures in the city and on the other side they are demolishing these structures in the name of development. It has come to my notice that a cheque of Rs 5 crore was given to Waqf board as compensation for demolition of these structures,” said Anuradha Reddy, city convener, INTACH (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage). “Amberpet Sarai was built along with Ashoorkhana and the Jama Masjid in the Qutub Shahi period,” said Anuradha. While GHMC officials have agreed to demolish the structure for road widening, they said that the Sarai is not a notified heritage structure, and all necessary permissions were acquired from the Waqf board before razing the structure. “It is not a notified heritage structure. It is a Waqf board property and they have given us the consent after receiving a compensation check. I do not remember the compensation amount, but the due process has been followed,” said B Narsing Rao, assistant city planner, Secunderabad Zone. “In total, we have identified 281 properties on both sides of the road out of which nearly 270 properties have been demolished in the last one-and-half year by paying total compensation to the affected persons,” Rao added. However, when contacted, Waqf board chairman Mohammed Saleem said, “I have to check if it is a notified structure or not. Will not be able to comment anything about it now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/activists-flag-concerns-after-ghmc-razes-sarai/articleshow/83155973.cms||Moulika.KV

He said the rise in infection for those aged up to 18 from November last year to this April was a negligible 1.48%. The state’s Covid tally shows that there has not been much change in the number of minors getting infected in the last six months. “The proportion of minors infected is in the range of 6% to 8.5% of the total cases in the last six months,” said Awate. While the state is making arrangements for treating children in case of a third Covid wave, Awate said, “No preparation goes waste. But there is no need to create an atmosphere of fear in the entire community.” In the wake of Ahmednagar district registering nearly 10,000 cases among minors last month, the state health department analysed the data of six months and noted that the mortality rate was just 0.07% in this group. Additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas said in a statement that Maharashtra has set up a paediatric task force and all necessary care has been taken to ready infrastructure and treatment protocols ahead of the third wave. The state health department said the number of Covid cases in minors was almost similar to overall cases. With an overall rise in cases, the spread was seen in children too, a health official said. Dr Naveen Thacker, president-elect of the International Paediatric Association, said every pandemic is known to come in waves. “The severity of a wave would depend on how diligently we follow Covid protocols, including wearing masks, maintaining social distance and how fast the eligible population is vaccinated. There is no biological basis to say that children would be selectively affected in case of a third wave. If there is a large number of total cases, the number of cases in children will also be high and a few will get serious infected too. We must prepare well but there is no reason to panic,” he said. A national expert group has also been constituted to review Covid infections in children and approach the pandemic in a renewed way. The group is examining signs not available four-five months before. The group would review available data, clinical profile, the country’s experience, disease dynamics, nature of the virus and the pandemic, and come up with guidelines, said Dr V K Paul, member, health, Niti Aayog, in the daily briefing of the Union health ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-infection-rate-largely-stable-in-minors-in-last-6-mths-expert/articleshow/83164170.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Lucknow||Over 48,000 kids below 10 years in UP have come in Covid grip: Govt data||LUCKNOW: At least 48,696 children below the age of 10 years have contracted Covid-19 infection in the state since the onset of novel coronavirus pandemic, according to the data shared by state health and family welfare department on Tuesday. The number of boys (27,851) with Covid-19 infection was higher than the girls (20,839). Also, 1.42 lakh cases among minors were recorded in the age group of 11-20 years. Together, it formed about 11.3% of the total caseload in the state. Speaking about the agewise trend of Covid-19 cases, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said: “Over 89% of total cases belonged to other categories, including 2.8% children below 10 years of age, while the remaining 11% patients were over 60 years. However, 43% of deaths took place among the elderly. Therefore, it is important to save them from getting exposed to infection.” The data is crucial in view of the concerns that more children could get infection in the anticipated third wave. Global estimates indicate that about 40% of cases in the third wave could affect minors. Children are at risk because the paediatric age group has not yet developed immunity either through natural infection or immunization. As of now, vaccines available in India are for those above 18 years. While official assessment of comparative data of the first and second waves is not available, health staff engaged in documentation and surveillance process said the number of children affected in the second wave was several times higher than the first wave.“The number of children affected in the first wave was in three digits. It did not cross the 1000-mark,” an official said. Assessment of information from different hospital sources indicates that age is no factor in Covid-19 infection. Last week, a newborn baby delivered at a government hospital in Varanasi tested positive while her mother was not infected. “While the health system is improving, parents can sensitize children on Covid-19 prevention protocol to minimise risk. Though vaccine trials are underway, it will take some time for it to be available for public use,” said head of paediatrics department, King George’s Medical University, Prof Shally Awasthi. The government has also drawn an elaborate plan to meet the challenge.  “Among the steps taken by the government under the leadership of CM Yogi Adityanath, development of paediatric intensive care units and training of required workforce are important. The government has also made separate arrangements to vaccinate parents of children below 12 years of age,” said Alok Kumar III, secretary to the Chief Minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/over-48000-kids-below-10yrs-in-up-have-come-in-covid-grip-govt-data/articleshow/83158077.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Rs 200 no deterrent, BMC mulls hiking penalty for spitting in public to Rs 1,200||MUMBAI: The Rs 200 fine for spitting in public places in Mumbai is all set to see an upward revision with the BMC on Tuesday announcing that it will hike the penalty amount owing to increase in the number of offenders amid the pandemic. The penalty amount may be as high as Rs 1,200, said a senior civic official. The BMC has penalised more than 14,000 citizens for spitting in public and collected a cumulative fine of Rs 28.67 lakh this year. The highest fine of Rs 4.70 lakh was collected from L ward, which includes Kurla and Sakinaka. A senior civic official said municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has approved the proposal to increase the fine amount. However, the BMC is yet to finalise the revised amount. “The proposal to hike fine will have to be cleared by the civic general body. Once this is done, the Corporation Resolution will have to be sent to the state since the Greater Mumbai Cleanliness and Sanitation Bylaws 2006 will have to be amended. The existing fine of Rs 200 for spitting in public remains unchanged for the last several years, and it is high time that it is hiked,” the official said. Last month, the Bombay HC had asked the BMC, police and state government to take steps to sensitise officials and the public against the menace of spitting, especially in view of the pandemic. The HC had asked the police and the BMC why a fine of Rs 200 was being collected when the fine stipulated by the state government was Rs 1,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-200-no-deterrent-bmc-mulls-hiking-penalty-for-spitting-in-public-to-rs-1200-in-mumbai/articleshow/83158081.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||Time to reimagine political structures, voting systems||By Viiveck Verma In the past one year, India has not only locked horns with the deadly Covid-19 but has also fought economic crises and witnessed unprecedented political activity. In such extraordinary times, it is essential to rethink our polity itself as well as the relationship between leaders and followers, authorities and the people. Firstly, there is an urgent need to reimagine the multi-party system. While the diversity of the country needs to be articulated in the polity, the current parliamentary system observes a usually divided opposition against an often put-together government. The division of votes is so much that both the government and the opposition lose immediate relevance. For instance, in the 15th Lok Sabha, the Indian National Congress-led UPA won 262 seats and had to be supported by several other ideologically diverse parties to form the government. In the current Lok Sabha, the government may have secured a majority but the opposition is splintered with the largest opposition party, the Congress, reduced to 44 seats against BJP’s tally of 303. As the Election Commission declared in 2019, India has a total of 2,293 political parties and this inevitably complicates any idea of a stable government or opposition due to fragmentation of election mandates. Messy situations of vote-splitting can be prevented by limiting the number of political parties that contest elections. Fewer parties in the running with clear ideological underpinnings will not just reduce election costs but also lead to fewer situations of horse trading and defections, since political stands will no longer be a matter of circumstance but of declared allegiance. This would lead to strong governments and oppositions and consolidated articulation of the people’s mandate. It is also crucial to rework our institutional structures. Our institutional architecture must be rebuilt to place constraints on immoderate exercises of power and lack of accountability by authorities. For instance, once elected, governments, MPs and legislative assemblies hold massive power for at least five years and there’s no direct way for voters to put them to test, in case of misuse of powers, till elections arrive. Accordingly, the Right to Recall law, which allows for removal of heads of panchayats through verified votes by people in certain states of India after a lock-in period of one or two years, must also be implemented at the national level to ensure a more accountable legislature. This would ensure an immediate sanction against non-performance and greater power to people to hold their representatives accountable. The other reforms needed are in the realm of electoral politics and finance. To ensure 100% voting, the process must be simplified and made more accessible to people. This would include an increase in the number of polling booths, greater enrolment of voters and a quick and simple voting process. Indian voters staying away from their constituencies and NRIs should be allowed to cast their votes through electronically transferred ballots. This is likely to make elections more inclusive. In terms of spending by political parties, there should be stricter regulations with details of donations and contributions to campaigns being made compulsory to submit, alongside a cap on expenditure and a limited campaign time for the election cycle. Greater financial transparency and a regulated campaign can create conditions for free and fair elections. It is simultaneously necessary to have greater independence for institutions— India could certainly use an independent central bank, with powers to disagree with the ruling dispensation over economic matters, for example. Similarly, an independent media and lesser restrictions on the internet can allow for honest critiques of governments and increase citizen participation in popular public narratives. Most fundamentally, a democratic upsurge can occur when people are given greater rights and choices. Therefore, there should be a general attempt to increase the scope of not just fundamental rights but also measures like the Right to Information. Individual freedom and privacy must be protected at all costs and authorities should commit to taking greater and frequent feedback from electors. All these will help in creating an inclusive and progressive political and legal framework that allows people to engage with the governance. On the whole, political reforms are necessary to renew people’s trust in authorities and institutions, by mandating their accountability and transparency.

The blast also caused a 25-feet pit in a roadside trench and shrapnel sprayed across a radius of more than 200m. Superintendent of police Pramode Kumar Shewale told TOI, “The blast was so intense that it was heard, and even felt, several kilometres away.” The officer said the quantity of the gelatine being carried is yet to be ascertained. “The destination, the ownership and legality are also to bedetermined,” said Shewale. Mudkhed police station’s inspector Mahesh Sharma, who, along with his team, was among the first to reach the spot, said an offence has been registered against suspects for violation of the Explosives Act. Police said the pick-up’s left rear wheel had come off and the driver, identified as Mahendra Kumar Jat, lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle fell into a roadside trench and caught fire. Two passersby saw the accident and rushed to the rescue of the driver who was trapped inside the pick-up. Somehow, the duo, with the help of locals, pulled the driver out. The driver then told them that the vehicle was carrying explosives. Showing presence of mind, the locals stopped traffic on both sides of the road. Within minutes, there was an explosion leaving the driver as well as one local resident seriously injured. LCB inspector Dwarkadas Chikhilkar said, “Some locals have stated the blast caused tin shades on their homes to blow away and windows and walls to crack. Some walls had also collapsed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-gelatine-laden-vehicle-explodes-2-hurt/articleshow/83158624.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He said the rise in infection for the age-group of 0 to 17 years from November last year to April 2021 was a negligible 1.48%. The state’s Covid tally shows that there has not been much change in the number of children getting affected in the age-group below 5 years and below 18 years in the last six months. “The proportion of those affected is in the range of 6% to 8.5% in the last six months,” Awate said. While the state is making arrangements for children’s treatment ahead of a possible third wave of Covid-19, Awate said, “No preparation goes waste, but there is no need to create an atmosphere of fear in the entire community.” In the wake of Ahmednagar district registering over 9,000 cases among children last month, the state health department analysed data for six months and noted that the death toll was 0.07% among children. Additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas in his statement said the state had set up a paediatric task force and all necessary care had been taken for readying infrastructure and treatment protocols ahead of a third wave. The state health department said the number of Covid cases among those below 18 years old was almost similar to the overall cases. With an overall rise in cases, the spread was seen among children also, a health official said. Dr Naveen Thacker, president-elect of the International Paediatric Association, said every pandemic was known to come in waves, where there would be a third, fourth or fifth wave. He said, “The severity of a wave would depend on how diligently we follow Covid protocols, including wearing masks, maintaining social distance and how fast the eligible population is vaccinated.” He said, “There is no biological basis to say that children would be selectively affected in case of a third wave. If there are a large number of total cases, the number of cases in children will also be high, and a few will get serious disease also. We must prepare well, but there is no reason to panic.” A national expert group has also been constituted to review Covid-19 infections among children and approach the pandemic in a renewed way. The group is examining signs not available four-five months before. It would review the available data, clinical profile, the country’s experience, disease dynamics, nature of the virus and the pandemic and come up with guidelines, said Dr V K Paul, member, health, Niti Aayog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/infection-rate-among-children-in-maharashtra-state-stable-in-last-6-mths/articleshow/83156096.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||RTO hopes for uptick in registration of vehicles||Pune: The Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad are hoping for a fillip to flagging vehicular registrations now that vehicle showrooms have reopened. Official data shows that vehicle registrations at both RTOs have dipped by more than 80% in April and May, compared to the quarter of 2021. “There have been some registrations online — mainly of vehicles bought before restrictions were imposed. Now that some showrooms have opened, we hope to regain lost ground,” a Pune RTO official said. “We plan to at least try to get back to 2019 levels. Now that some showrooms are opening, we expect those who couldn’t buy vehicles during festivals like Akshaya Tritiya and Gudi Padwa to make purchases now,” the official said. Auto showrooms too expect business to pick up. “We have had enquiries about two-wheelers for the past two months,” a representative of a two-wheeler showroom in Kothrud said. “Public transportation is still out of bounds for the general public and so, we expect that sales of two-wheelers to shoot up,” Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjay Sasane told TOI. Pune RTO had registered 91,795 two-wheelers in 2020-21, compared to the 1,67,406 two-wheelers registered in 2019-20. Similarly, the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO had registered 61,449 two wheelers in 2020-21 against 1,03,075 two-wheelers in 2019-20. Siddharth Ingle, a working professional, said, “I wanted to buy a bike on Gudi Padwa or Akshaya Tritiya, but showrooms were shut. I wil buy it this weekend.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rto-hopes-for-uptick-in-registration-of-vehicles/articleshow/83156010.cms||Joy Sengupta

I really hope this continues, as I suffered huge losses in the past two months. I had to pay rent of Rs75,000 in April and May though my shop was shut,” Wadhonkar said.Non-essential shops, shut since April 3, reopened on Tuesday. Some had a throng of customers, while others waited for business to pick up. Many stores were seen offering steep discounts to woo customers.A trader dealing in kitchenware in Kondhwa said he did decent business. “I sell utensils and other kitchenware. I have a large group of regular customers and sent them a message on Monday about reopening. I told them about discounts on items like pressure cookers, gas lighters, etc,” he said.Avinash Thorat, who owns a readymade garments shop on Laxmi Road, said, “It is very difficult time for me and my employees. During last year’s lockdown, I was able to pay them half their wages. But this year, it was very bad. I now hope ‘achhe din aayenge’,” he said.Other shopkeepers were a disappointed lot. “There is little relief because people don’t want to step out, let alone go shopping. I don’t have much hope for business picking up, but it felt good to open the shutters after a long time,” a garments trader from Rasta Peth said.A customer buying a pair of earphones at an electronics outlet in Camp said, “Though shops were offering home delivery, I prefer checking out an item in person,” he said.

The association said it proposed holding camps across the city for this purpose.“We are anticipating high footfalls at shops in the coming days. So, it is necessary to get maximum members vaccinated. There are around 10,000 shopkeepers and employees yet to be vaccinated,” Sachin Nivangune, president of the Pune District Retailers’ Association, said. “We are planning special drives for them with the PMC’s help,” he said. Another member of the association said a separate vaccination drive would be held for shopkeepers and staffers in the 18-44 age group. The Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP) was also planning similar vaccination camps. Secretary Mahendra Pitaliya said such a camp was held a month ago with help from PMC.

---||Lucknow||BJP is getting desperate to remain in power: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Launching a pointed attack over what he described as the ‘internal tug of war’ of the BJP leadership, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said the marathon meetings between the saffron brigade and the UP government is taking its toll on the functioning of the government. He said the people of the state are still battling with the pandemic while the BJP is getting desperate to remain in power. The former UP CM said the state administration has come to a standstill and people are left to themselves to face miseries unleashed by Covid-19 in the state. “It is ironical that people are yet to come out of the devastation caused by the second wave of the pandemic and the BJP government is making false claims. The government has started claiming that it is prepared to counter the third wave. This when the government itself is unable to provide adequate lifesaving drugs to those infected with black fungus which is the result of the second wave,” Akhilesh said. The fact that 18 months after the pandemic hit the people of the state the BJP government has decided to go in for detailed investigation into the nature of infection explains that nothing has been done in this regard till now. “What was the government doing for a year and a half at this front,” the former UP CM said. On the vaccination drive, the former CM said the BJP government has promised to vaccinate everyone in the state by Diwali. “There is nothing in place that suggests that everyone will be vaccinated before Diwali. Ninety-eight per cent of the people have not received the second dose. How would there be protection without people getting both the doses?” Yadav said that due to unavailability of adequate vaccines, discussions are underway to give different jabs during the first and second doses, revealing how the government is making a mockery of itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-is-getting-desperate-to-remain-in-power-akhilesh/articleshow/83158079.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Another trian from Jodhpur had more than 1,000 passengers. These figures are impressive considering that the incoming passenger traffic had dropped to 100-150 per day ion the past two months,” the official said. Public relations officer Manoj Jhawar said, “The number of arrivals from the north has started to increase and we expect it to rise.” Suraj Patel (35), a mason, had returned home to Anuppur district of Madhya Pradesh after the second wave of the pandemic hit and lockdown-like restrictions were imposed mid-April. Patel is now ready to return to Pune. “My employer has sent me Rs2,000 for travelling expenses and I will be coming back and joining soon,” Patel said. Munesh Yadav, who returned to Pune from his home in Gorakhpur, said he couldn’t find employment back home. “I tried for a while and then decided to come back. My employer was more than happy to take me back,” Yadav, who works in construction, said. Last month, Pune-based Pebbles Infratech, the company engaged in the construction of the multi-level parking project at Pune airport, arranged 12 air tickets for specialized construction workers from Jharkhand. “Presently, there is a shortage of manpower in the construction business and many have left for their homes due to the second wave. This, in turn, has affected projects. We are hoping that they come back soon,” an official with the company told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/railways-records-steady-rise-in-passengers-from-north/articleshow/83156053.cms||Joy Sengupta

ACB Aurangabad, headed by superintendent of police Rahul Khade, arrested head constable Ganesh Antrap serving with MIDC Waluj police station for allegedly demanding Rs 1.50 lakh and after negotiations accepting Rs 60,000 from the complainant. “The accused had registered a complaint about some marijuana issue. Instead of verifying the facts and acting on the complaint, Antrap started harassing the complainant and allegedly demanded the money. After verifying the complaint, we laid a trap and arrested Antrap on Tuesday morning,” he said. In the second trap conducted by ACB Aurangabad, a clerk with the deputy director of education department was arrested for accepting Rs 9,500 to forward the pension file of a former education department employee. “The pension file has been pending for two years and the accused clerk has been identified as Nirmal,” Khade said.

Currently, only 50% of commission agents are allowed to function at the Market Yard every day. The wholesalers’ body said that the functioning of the market at full capacity appears feasible now with the drop in the number of cases. Retail sales were stopped at the market to avoid crowding. Vilas Bhujbal, leader of the association of the wholesalers and commission agents, said, “We held a meeting with the APMC authorities on Tuesday to discuss our demands. We appealed to them to allow all traders to function daily. This will help the farmers as well.” Bhujbal said that the APMC administration has asked them to wait for a week or more. “The authorities said that the markets will function till 2pm. So, allowing all the traders to open their shops daily could lead to chaos and crowding. The traders will discuss the administration’s instructions. Most likely, the traders will wait for another week with the hope that they will be allowed to function at full strength,” he added. The APMC authorities said that all necessary steps were being taken to avoid overcrowding at the wholesale market. The traders and retailers were being allowed entry only with pass and token. It will take some more time to allow opening of the market at maximum strength, the authorities said. Meanwhile, traders from the wholesale grocery market said that they want the administration to allow loading and unloading of commodities till 5pm. Many consignments arrive in the afternoon from other states, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wholesalers-push-for-100-ops-at-gultekdi-market/articleshow/83156046.cms||Sarang Dastane

Now in the Hyderabad town of Pakistan’s Sindh province, less than a year old Reyansh Udasi is set to meet his father in Jalgaon in Maharashtra. On the other side, roads have been cleared for eight-year-Lavina Nagdev who lost her mother two months ago to be with her extended family in the Usta Mohammed town of Balochistan province. She is at present at Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh. TOI had reported both the cases. Reyansh was conceived in India but born in Pakistan. His father Kailash Udasi who lives in Jalgaon is an Indian citizen and his wife Sonya is a Pakistani citizen who was living in India after marriage because of her long-term visa (LTV).The couple had gone to Pakistan for a brief visit in February 2020, but were stranded after borders were closed due to Covid. At that time, Sonya was pregnant. Reyansh was born in Pakistan on August 2020 as the mother remained stranded. Kailash returned when Indian citizens were repatriated, while Sonya, who is still Pakistani, had to wait for her turn. Born in Pakistan to a mother who had a passport from the same country, Reyansh was technically a Pakistani. After going through intricate procedures, Reyansh had finally got a Paksitani passport and the Indian government too has promptly issued a visit visa. Kailash is now waiting for the borders to open after which the mother and child can cross over. The borders have been closed for the second time due to Covid.Lavina’s father Ajeet Kumar Nagdev, had come to India 10 years ago on an LTV. He ran into financial troubles after his wife Rekha Kumari developed a kidney ailment. The lockdown also hampered his garment business. Nagdev decided to return to Paksitan where his family resides and start afresh. Meanwhile, his wife died. As Lavina was born in India, her name was endorsed in the passport of her mother who is no more. This left the eight-year-old stateless, thereby hampering her return.Following TOI’s story, the Pakistan high commission at Delhi issued a separate passport for Lavina enabling here return. Nagdev also waits for the borders to open. He is thankful to both the governments for their prompt help. A decision on opening the borders will be taken by the National Command Operation Centre (NCOC) from Pakistan’s side. NCOC has been set up for Covid control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tale-of-two-stranded-kids-is-close-to-a-happy-ending/articleshow/83156076.cms||Shishir Arya

The boy, identified as Harsha Vardhan from Beerjepalli village under Chowdepalli mandal in Chittoor district, developed complications while they were coming back from the court and breathed his last in the auto. He was the only child of the family. Harsha had met with a near-fatal accident about four years ago and was bedridden since then. “Following the accident he used to suffer bleeding from the nose frequently. His brain and spine bore the brunt of the impact and he was confined to bed since then. We approached many doctors and hospitals, but all of them said the bleeding disorder he suffered due to the accident has no cure,” said G Aruna, his mother. Despite their limited resources, the family tried their best to provided the best possible treatment to Harsha. His farmer father G Mani even sold off some land and took his only son to hospitals in Tirupati, Vellore and some other cities. “We spent over Rs 4 lakh and approached several doctors and hospitals over the last four years, but there was no improvement in his condition,” she added. Having run out of money and hope, Aruna was advised by one of her relatives to move the local court seeking help for treatment of her son or accord the necessary permission for his mercy killing as she could not bear to see the pain and agony of her only child. For the past two days, the helpless mother had been doing the rounds of Punganur court to file the mercy killing petition. On Tuesday, Aruna again came to the court with her son and after failing to file the petition, was returning home in an autorickshaw when he started bleeding all of a sudden and died in her arms. “I thought I could save my son by approaching the court. But before the judiciary could help us out, he died in my arms,” the inconsolable mother said. Watch Tragic!

The cannabis, weighing 1,132-kg, was packed in 47 fertilizer bags that were kept under dry grass at a farm in Masa Khandeshwari village. The farm raided by police is owned by Balaji Shinde and it was taken on rent by his relatives Balaji Kale and Rajendra alias Dadaji Kale. The two men own around 15 acres and carry out farming activity. Police have launched a manhunt for the Kale brothers who are suspected of working closely with the inter-state suppliers. An offence under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act has been registered with Kalamb police station. Osmanabad superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan said, “We suspect the involvement of an inter-state gang and accordingly, different teams have been formed to unearth the racket having the capacity to supply and deal in marijuana weighing in tonnes..” He added, “The suspects might have decided to unload 1,132 kilogram of marijuana in the remote village before the contraband is repacked for sales and distribution.” Authorities said the suspects somehow got to know about the raid and fled their homes. LCB inspector Gajanan Ghadge said, “The suspect duo are criminals on police record and we suspect they took the neighbouring farm on rent, so that they could carry out their illegal activities from there.” Preliminary probe has revealed that this marijuana reached Osmanabad from Hyderabad. Citing the recent detections of high quality marijuana intercepted by city police, an officer privy to the probe said the seized marijuana does not appear to be of a local breed. “There is lot of awareness about marijuana plants among villagers. So it is difficult for someone to grow marijuana in such large quantity locally,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/1132-kg-marijuana-worth-rs-1-2cr-seized-by-osmanabad-police/articleshow/83158634.cms||Mohammed Akhef

However, he robbed the auto driver’s bag containing cash and cell phone worth Rs23,000 and fled. The incident happened off Karve Road on Monday evening. Pravin Jagannath Devkale (25) of Kiskindanaar in Kothrud has lodged an FIR with the Alankar police station. “Devkale runs a vegetable stall near the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Kothrud. He uses his auto to transport the vegetables and in free time, ferries the passengers,” inspector Santosh Barge of the Alankar police station said. Barge said, “Around 5pm, Devkale was heading towards his home after concluding business for the day. However, while passing through a waterlogged stretch, his auto broke down after the water entered the vehicle’s engine.” Devkale tried to get his vehicle going, but could not do so. “At this point, a motorcycle rider with a mask on stopped near Devkale and offered to help. Both men pushed the auto out of the waterlogged stretch.” “Immediately after that, the motorcycle rider sped away stealing a polythene bag with cash and cell phone worth Rs23,000 kept in the vegetable box,” Barge said, before adding Devkale could not recall the registration number of the bike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biker-pretends-to-help-auto-driver-steals-cash-phone-off-him/articleshow/83156105.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Positivity rate soars to 36% in dist despite drop in Covid cases||Coimbatore: The test positivity rate continues to increase in the district, despite the daily caseload dropping by 26% from the peak over the past five days.The test positivity rate for May 24-30 period stands at an all-time high of 36%, compared to 30.5% during May 17-24. It’s the second highest test positivity rate in the state during the period after Tirupur (38.1%). Epidemiologists say this could mean two things - precision testing or inadequate testing of primary and secondary contacts.Daily cases had been dropping in the district by anywhere between 2% and 6% over the past four days, giving officials hope that the same would fall below 2,000 by June 7, when the extended lockdown would end. Dr Bharani Kumar Anbalagan, assistant programme manager, directorate of public health office, said, “The lockdown is helping reduce the virus transmission and the number of people getting infected. We are reaching a plateau.”Epidemiologists are, meanwhile, wondering how the test positivity rate is increasing, while fresh cases are dropping. The test positivity rate of 36% means almost one in every three people getting tested are positive for the virus.Health department officials say the positivity rate could point to infectivity of the virus, extent of spread among the population and the effectiveness of contact testing. Dr Senthil Kumar, deputy director of public health, said, “While Bengaluru recorded a positivity rate of 55% during the peak, it was as high as 62% in Brazil. While we don’t deny that the positivity rate is reflective of the extent of the virus presence in a community, it could also be a reflection of how precise our contact testing is. Instead of wasting swab samples to show numbers, we test only the people closest to the positive cases, saving manpower and time.”Epidemiologists, however, call for expanding testing of primary contacts. The recommended testing ratio of contacts is 1:25 for every positive case. The testing ratio in the district was 1:10 until April, when cases began crossing 600 a day and zoomed past 1,000. Dr K Kolandasamy, former director of public health, said, “Only when you test a patient’s primary and secondary contacts, which include immediate family members, domestic help (if any), neighbours and others that the person has met, the virus spread could be controlled. This is critical to preventing a third wave as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/positivity-rate-soars-to-36-in-dist-despite-drop-in-covid-cases/articleshow/83156113.cms||---

Police first found the body of the accused, Vipin Yadav (30), hanging from a tree and later recovered the girl’s body from a nearby well. It was only after police recovered cellphones of the two and went through messages that it was established that the youth was in love with the girl but was agitated after he spotted her with another youth from her village. SP Hardoi Anurag Vats said that both the man and the girl had gone missing from their homes on Monday noon. “They were spotted last on a bike together by villagers and then both went missing,” said Vats. Around 10pm on Monday, both families lodged complaints at Mallawan police station about their missing family members. A massive manhunt followed and in the meantime, some villagers spotted Vipin’s body hanging from a tree. “Mobile phone handsets of both victims were recovered which showed the messages exchanged and also confirmed that they were together hours before their death,” said a senior police officer privy to the probe. The messages also showed that Vipin was angry with the girl after having spotted her with another man, said police. Investigation showed that the girl was strangulated to death and then dumped near a well. Some villagers had also spotted Vipin and the girl near the well and his bike’s tyre marks confirmed the same. Based on this, the girl’s father has lodged a complaint of murder against Vipin.

Unconfirmed reports said that Eatala, along with Bandi Sanjay, met BJP national party president JP Nadda again on Tuesday. Both parties remained silent, but highly placed sources told TOI that JP Nadda has asked the former health minister to resign and that he would be given more priority than the rule book that party uses for former ministers, MLAs and MPs. “Our leadership has indicated to him that there is no vacancy in national executive council now, but he will be accorded more priority in the party than is being offered to those who are joining from other parties,” a top source said During the interaction, the former minister was reportedly asked to prepare a report on the functioning of TRS regime in the state and submit it as soon as possible. Though the minister agreed to resign, both sides feel they should wait till TRS itself suspends him. Interestingly, though Eatala met BJP leaders, his wife Jamuna challenged the TRS to prove their allegations. “There is thought in the both camps that since it is imperative for him resign first to TRS before joining BJP. Resigning from TRS would give him more mileage as sympathy factor will help him,” sources said. Eatala who has been in Delhi since Sunday is expected to return on Wednesday along with BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar. With June 2 being Telangana formation day, there was speculation that some announcement would come on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-or-eatala-who-will-make-the-first-move/articleshow/83156081.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The petition said Poonawalla had left for the UK due to “fear and constant pressure” from CMs and “big persons”. It also said the Covishield vaccine produced by SII are manufactured in Maharashtra, which is a “modern state”. “Can you explain how many police personnel were given?” the HC asked Thakare, who said Poonawalla has been given Y-plus security through the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/consider-issues-raised-in-plea-for-poonawalla-security-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/83158113.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘New mobile app will help consumers track bills, lodge complaints’||Q. What steps are being taken to prepare for the monsoon season? Last year, multiple colonies suffered prolonged outages. Is it going to be the same this year? - Kanthi K A. In the period of one year, TSSPDCL has conducted extensive maintenance activities to prepare for the upcoming monsoon season. We have repaired damaged and worn-out electrical lines, ensured reinforcement of safety measures, upgraded our system wherever required and adopted a revamped digital mode for complaint redressal. TSSPDCL has formed an additional pool of manpower to handle the situations arising due to the monsoon. We have constituted disaster management teams and control rooms for tackling situations like heavy monsoon and flood. Our disaster management teams coordinate with the district administration/GHMC for handling adverse situations. We have also strengthened our manpower to deal with adverse situations arising due to severe weather conditions. Our team of engineers and field crew are equipped with modern technologies to ensure minimum power outage even during monsoon. Q. During the last monsoon, TSSPDCL advised people to shift electrical meters to first floors to avoid power shutdown due to water clogging in cellars. Do discoms charge for this shift? -- Pavan Sanganabhatla A. It is true that we could not restore power in some apartments as water entered the cellars and it could not be pumped out for several days. The TSSPDCL shifts meters to first floors free of cost provided apartment associations come forward and give their representations and provide us with material. We don't charge any fee for services. It is good and safe for apartments too as this can avoid electrocution issues. Last time, the discom shifted meters in more than 250 apartments that faced flooding problems. Q. Meter readers aren’t coming immediately after 30-31 days. This is resulting in huge losses to consumers as sometimes the slabs are changing, and we are paying a higher bill as unit rates are different for different slabs. What is your solution? -- Palepu Vaman Kumar A. To overcome such problems and to allow consumers to directly check their meter reading, in case they have any doubts about consumed power units, the TSSPDCL has come up with a mobile App made available from June 1. Consumers can just click the photo of their meter reading and submit through the app. It is a safe and accurate way to get the monthly billing done on time. And bills can be paid immediately through the app. Amid this pandemic, to ensure the safety of consumers, I request them to maximise the use of the TSSPDCL mobile app to connect with us. The online app is available in Google play store/ App-Store. Q. Is uninterrupted power supply a myth? Because despite multiple promises, nothing seems to have changed on the ground. Also, what is the main reason for frequent power interruptions? -- Anand Menon A. TSSPDCL has put in place all measures for uninterrupted power. We have upgraded our distribution network through implementation of technologies like SCADA, distribution management system, ring main networks. We conduct periodic maintenance of distribution lines and transformers. TSSPDCL’s reliability of power supply in the GHMC is rated as one of the best in the country among other metro cities. Q. It is observed that several autos are plying in the city issuing warnings about authorities disconnecting power if bills are not paid. But I believe these are of no use since, even after being cut, people are getting reconnections, at times by paying a penalty. This is increasing the burden on consumers who are already paying hefty power bills. Are the authorities doing something to fix this? -- P V S Rao A. The department has put in place the mechanism to increase consumer awareness towards online services without leaving the safety of their homes. This is done through loudspeaker announcements by autorickshaws. Further, due to lockdown restrictions and safety protocols, many of our payment counters and e-Seva offices are operating with limited hours. To ensure that consumers do not face any issue, we encourage them to avail the online services through TSSPDCL mobile app. Also, during the lockdown, we have suspended any disconnection of domestic services so that our consumers do not face any hassle. Our meter readers have been taking readings while following all safety measures, so that we can issue bills timely. Q. My home electricity bill in the last two years has increased by almost three times. Earlier the average monthly bill used to be around Rs 600, and now it is always over Rs 1,800 a month. This, despite the usage remaining much the same. Is this rise in cost justifiable? -- Mir Mufavizulla Khan A. Electricity bills are issued as per the tariff order approved by TSERC. The electricity tariff has remained constant for the last four years. The applicable electricity tariff slab for any consumer depends on the energy consumption ie higher the energy consumption, higher is the electricity bill for the month. It has also been observed that due to lockdown and extended hours at home, many consumers are displaying increased electrical usage. This has resulted in higher electricity bills. Q. We are a small pharmacy that does not even consume 50 units per month. Yet, we are being charged a development fee. Is this allowed? Should we be exempted from it? -- Naveen M A. Development charges are payable by different categories of consumers for new connections and additional loads in case of existing services. The charges depend on the category of service and applied load. In case of existing consumers, the development charges are applied in case maximum demand exceeds the contracted load for the service. Such charges are displayed in the monthly bill of the consumers. In case any consumer has queries regarding the development charges in their bill, they can kindly contact the concerned Divisional Engineer, TSSPDCL for resolution of the billing related issues. Q. Power situation in RK Puram has not changed in the last decade. Even inverters dry up due to long outages. Does the department plan to redo the underground cabling here to avoid overhead cable damages? -- Vinod K S A. TSSPDCL is ensuring 24/7 power availability in our entire jurisdiction. This is even more important now with our consumers staying indoors and following lockdown guidelines. Our engineers are monitoring the power supply position round the clock. The power outages experienced by consumers are due to already scheduled maintenance activities, the information of which is circulated beforehand. In terms of upgrading and strengthening the electrical infrastructure in RK Puram, in 2020-21, TSSPDCL has executed works amounting to Rs 7.03 lakh which include upgradation of lines, installation of new lines and transformers for maintaining uninterrupted power supply. We are also undertaking gradual need-based maintenance of electrical lines while ensuring minimum disruption of power. We have installed the latest technologies which help detect and rectify faults, thus reducing power outages. Q. I live in Trimulgherry and have previously complained to authorities about high voltages that lead to damage of electrical appliances. Since my complaint has been ignored, I want to know who is responsible for maintaining the voltage? How can consumers be compensated for such losses that they suffer? -- B Sreeramulu A. We take all precautionary measures to limit the chances of high voltage on the distribution network. We undertake regular maintenance activities like tree trimming, transformer maintenance, line maintenance etc. which have drastically reduced voltage related problems in the past few years. In terms of improvement of the electrical infrastructure in Trimulgherry, in 2020-21 TSSPDCL has executed works amounting to Rs 19.88 lakh that include upgradation of lines, installation of new lines and transformers for maintaining uninterrupted power supply. Q. When the manually collated electrical records were computerised, all the data were not captured. As a result, the department is asking for additional deposit or have filed cases against such consumers. When they protested, the department asked them to produce more than 30 years old records. Can something be done about this? -- Omim Maneckshaw Debara A. With the department adopting a completely digital process, all records of TSSPDCL consumers, including metering and billing details, are now maintained electronically. The data of many of our consumers whose supply was initiated by erstwhile APSEB are also now available in our IT database. But in case you find that your records are not updated with us, you are requested to contact the concerned ERO. Consumers can also contact TSSPDCL to register a complaint through TSSPDCL mobile app and website. Q. I am a resident of Navanirman Nagar, Jubilee Hills. We have been facing power cuts almost every other day for years, causing inconvenience to every resident. Please do a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and resolve these issues for good. -- Ankit Sethi A. TSSPDCL is committed to providing quality power supply to all consumers. However, planned power shutdown can happen due to maintenance activities and unplanned power outages occur due to faults in the electrical network. We have developed a robust system to track and analyse all faults occurring in our distribution network. In terms of upgrading and strengthening the electrical infrastructure in Navanirman Nagar, Jubilee Hills, in 2020-21 TSSPDCL has executed works amounting to Rs 10 lakh which include upgradation of lines, installation of new lines and transformers for maintaining uninterrupted power supply here. Q. Meter readers aren’t coming immediately after 30-31 days. This is resulting in huge losses to consumers as sometimes the slabs are changing, and we are paying a higher bill as unit rates are different for different slabs. What is your solution? -- Palepu Vaman Kumar A. To overcome such problems and to allow consumers to directly check their meter reading, in case they have any doubts about consumed power units, the TSSPDCL has come up with a mobile App made available from June 1. Consumers can just click the photo of their meter reading and submit through the app. It is a safe and accurate way to get the monthly billing done on time. And bills can be paid immediately through the app. Amid this pandemic, to ensure the safety of consumers, I request them to maximise the use of the TSSPDCL mobile app to connect with us. The online app is available in Google play store/ App-Store. Q. During the last monsoon, TSSPDCL had advised people to shift electrical meters to first floors to avoid power shutdown due to water clogging in cellars. Do discoms charge for this shift? -- Pavan Sanganabhatla A. It is true that we could not restore power in some apartments as water entered the cellars and it could not be pumped out for several days. The TSSPDCL shifts meters to first floors free of cost provided apartment associations come forward and give their representations and provide us with material. We don't charge any fee for services. It is good and safe for apartments too as this can avoid electrocution issues. Last time, the discom shifted meters in more than 250 apartments that faced flooding problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-mobile-app-will-help-consumers-track-bills-lodge-complaints/articleshow/83156133.cms||---

They were at the hill station without an e-pass, or without masks and did not follow social distancing rules, among other offences. The Lonavla city and rural police have collected fines of Rs 3.3 lakh on Saturday and Sunday from them. Most of the 92 visitors fined for travelling without an e-pass were from Mumbai. An e-pass is not required within the district, but is mandatory for intra-district travel. A Pune Rural police officer said revellers had started coming to Lonavla since Friday night. On Saturday, people began visiting tourist spots and the police swung into action against those out on the roads, he added. “The Pune Rural police in May took action against over 3,000 people for venturing out and not wearing masks in Lonavla, Kamshet and Vadgaon Maval areas and collected Rs15.6 lakh in fines,” sub-divisional police officer (Lonavla) Amrut Deshmukh told TOI. The rural police had stepped up vigil during the weekend in anticipation of a crowd after the noticeable decline in Covid-19 infections and an improvement in the overall situation in Mumbai and in Pune. T Y Mujawar, inspector of the Lonavla rural police, said, “Revellers from Mumbai and from Rajgad district visited rural parts of Lonavla. In many cases, one person had obtained the e-pass and was accompanied by five others. Many had no masks. If a person has an e-pass, but is driving without a mask, he will have to pay the fine.We will continue to take action.” Maval’s Shiv Sena MP Shrirang Barne, who visited the Lonavla Municipal Council on Tuesday to take stock of the Covid situation,said that he had told the administration to be extra vigilant about tourists’ inflow in Lonavla during the monsoon. “People in Lonavla are dependent on tourism. Their business should be sustained and at the same time they should not be affected by the virus,”he said. Many people also visited Pavana area where the Lonavla Rural police fined 169 people. Inspector of Lonavla city police Dilip Pawar said, “We have fined three establishments for violating the restrictions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-600-weekend-revellers-fined-in-lonavla-for-covid-norms-violation/articleshow/83156091.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Pune||Pune cop booked, brother held on doctors assault charge||PUNE: A constable of the Pune police crime branch was booked and his brother, Sagar Siddheshwar Gaikwad (35), was arrested on the charge of creating ruckus at a civic-run Covid care centre and later assaulting two doctors and some staff members at the Balewadi police chowky, close to the healthcare facility, on Monday afternoon. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone IV) Pankaj Deshmukh told TOI, “Our team is searching for the constable who ran away from the police chowky amid chaos, leaving behind his brother. Our personnel present at the police chowky intervened and tried to pacify the constable and his brother, when the latter started slapping the doctors and the Covid facility staffers. The constable ran away as he knew the consequences of his act, but we shall apprehend him soon.” Deshmukh said, “The assault incident occurred inside as well as outside the police chowky. The policemen at the chowky were able to apprehend the constable’s brother.” Dr Ajayshri Adhikrao Mhaskar (25) of Baner lodged a police complaint in connection with the incident. Gaikwad and his constable brother had gone to the Covid facility to enquire about the health of one of their relatives admitted there. The doctors were busy in a meeting and did not answer their phone calls. This enraged the duo and they started abusing the hospital staffers. Mhaskar and another doctor came out to pacify them, but they kept abusing the staffers. The doctors then decided to approach the police and went to the chowky. The duo went there and slapped and punched the doctors and other staffers. The police have registered a case under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 332 (whoever voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentionally insults), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. The police also invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Medicare Services Persons Act. Senior inspector Rajkumar Waghchaure of the Chatushrungi police said, “The Gaikwads are residents of Aundh. The constable is currently posted with the Pune police’s crime branch. When they could not contact the doctors at the Covid facility, the two brothers decided to check out the health condition of their relative on their own, which led to the ruckus.” He said, “Mhaskar and his colleagues had decided to resolve the issue at the police chowky. The doctors and staffers were explaining what had happened at the centre to the policemen when Gaikwads reached the police chowky. After abusing the doctors and staffers, the duo slapped and punched them,” Waghchaure said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cop-booked-brother-held-on-docs-assault-charge/articleshow/83156116.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Rebate in property tax till June 30||PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday extended the deadline for payment of property tax at discounted rates by a month till June 30. “The PMC had introduced a special scheme of 15% discount to those who have paid tax diligently. The deadline for this scheme was May 31. It has now been extended by a month,” said Hemant Rasane, the PMC standing committee chairman. The standing committee approved the proposal on Tuesday. As per the data, the PMC earned Rs770 crore from property tax. Out of it, Rs546 crore was collected in May. The civic body earned tax from 5.5 lakh properties in the last two months. “During the pandemic last time, the civic administration’s finances were dwindling. At that time, the co-operation from taxpayers had helped the civic body a lot in meeting its needs. The taxpayers have given their support during the first two months of this financial year also,” said Rasane. The civic record shows that around 10.5 lakh properties fall under the tax net. On an average, Rs1,400 crore is collected through this tax. As per PMC officials, property tax is one of the biggest income sources for the civic body.

---||Coimbatore||Crime becomes investigation wing, top cop redefines duties||Coimbatore: City police commissioner Deepak M Damor has renamed the crime police as the investigation wing police, who would hereafter handle all the cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), while the law & order police would take care of special and local laws as well as bundobust duty. He also made it clear that the investigation wing police could be used for bundobust duty only with his permission. “The new system will help speedy disposal of cases,” he said. There are 15 crime police stations in the city limits. A police source said officers with good track record would be transferred to the investigation wing soon. In a circular to all police officials, Damor had a few days ago said each police station should have law & order and investigation wings. The investigation wing, he said, would probe cases under the IPC thoroughly, collect evidences, register chargesheet, send witnesses to the court and follow the case till the judgement. The Law & order police, he said, would take care of patrolling, prevention of crime, registering cases under special and local laws, maintaining station records and other administration related works. They would also deal with cases registered under Section 174 of the Criminal Code Procedure (CrPC). The top cop has directed the law & order police officers to receive complaints from people and register a first information report (FIR), which should be forwarded to the investigation wing police for further investigation. They have also been asked to cooperate with the investigation wing police during the arrest and protection of accused, and seizure of stolen items. The law & order police are now tasked to get the case numbers of cases under investigation and those for which chargesheet have not been filed from courts and hand them over to the investigation wing police. The assistant commissioners of police (law & order) have to, meanwhile, hand the case diary, grave crime report and progressive report over to their counterparts with the investigation wing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/crime-becomes-investigation-wing-top-cop-redefines-duties/articleshow/83156149.cms||A Subburaj
---||Kolhapur||OBC seats will ‘open’ up for all: SEC secretary Kurundkar||Kolhapur: The seats reserved for the other backward category (OBC) candidates will be converted into open category in the wake of the recent Supreme Court order, secretary of the State Election Commission Kiran Kurundkar told TOI on Tuesday. The state election commission is waiting for the Covid situation to ease to schedule the elections for five municipal corporations, two Zilla Parishads and over 100 nagar panchayats, which are over due. The SC has struck down the law mandating 27% flat reservations for the OBC candidates in the local bodies from grampanchayats to ZPs and municipal corporations. Instead, it has recommended that the state government get empirical data of the population of OBC in the respective local body to fix the reservation quota. The quota for OBC must not be above 27% and most importantly, the overall reserved seats for all categories (SC, ST and OBC) should not exceed 50% of the total seats in the local body. The election for the municipal corporations of Navi Mumbai, Vasai Virar, Aurangabad, Kolhapur and Kalyan Dombivali along with Bhandara and Gondia ZP’s and 100 Nagar Panchayats are overdue. Currently, these local bodies have administrator rule. Kurundkar said, “As per the Constitution it is mandatory to hold election for local civic bodies after the end of five year. We postponed the election due to Covid situation. Now, if the Covid situation eases, we have to announce the schedule to hold the elections to these civic bodies.” He added that if the government does not come up with a solution to address the OBC quota issue till then, all seats of OBC will be converted into Open category. The process of final restructuring of the ward boundaries, fixing reservation for each ward and preparing of the electoral rolls have been completed before the start of the next wave in March and it was just a matter of time to state election commission to announce the schedule for the election. The ten-yearly census has the numbers for SC and ST community, but OBC’s are not counted. The 27% reservation in the local bodies started in 1994 in Maharashtra. In many local bodies, the reserved seats are more than 50% while in many it is below 50% as the SC and ST population varies. To convert the OBC seats to open, only a declaration by local civic body is sufficient and it will not require process to draw the lots again for all but except for reserving quota for women seats from the seats converted into Open category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/obc-seats-will-open-up-for-all-sec-secretary-kurundkar/articleshow/83158648.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Hry extends term of Sushma’s daughter, 84 others in AG office||Chandigarh: The Haryana government has extended the tenure of Bansuri Swaraj, daughter of former Union minister and senior BJP leader late Sushma Swaraj, as additional advocate general Haryana to represent the state before Supreme Court (SC) in legal matters. Bansuri, an SC lawyer, was appointed additional advocate general by Manohar Lal Khattar in March 2021. As per the new order, she would continue on her post till March 10, 2022. The state government, however, has not extended the tenure of advocate Deepa Singh, who is wife of former DGP KP Singh, as additional AG. Besides Deepa Singh, the contract of two more law officers, Rajiv Goel, DAG and Gaurav Gulzar, assistant AG, have also been discontinued by the state government. The three were engaged to represent the state before the Punjab and Haryana high court at Chandigarh. Despite their ouster, around 156 law officers are still serving the state’s AG office at Chandigarh. The state government has also removed two more law officers---Vineet Dhanda and Raghav Sabharwal from its Delhi office. With this, the number of law officers now in Delhi is 51. According to sources, Haryana’s AG office is still one of the largest, having around 207 law officers. Sources added that considering the current pandemic situation where the work in the courts has been reduced on account of restrictive hearings, the state government had initially decided to reduce the size of law officers by removing 30 law officers. However, most of these lawyers managed to save their posts through their connections with the ruling alliance. So did those related to central ministers, judges of the high court and senior state bureaucrats. Thereafter, the government had to extend the tenure of 85 law officers, whose contract had come to an end recently and only five (two in Delhi and three in Chandigarh) have been removed. The state government has also extended the term of senior advocate Naresh Shekhawat, who was appointed in the AG office as senior additional advocate general from JJP quota last year, till May 20, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-extends-term-of-sushmas-daughter-84-others-in-ag-office/articleshow/83156151.cms||Ajay Sura

Identified as Tarun Sable, the Phulambri taluka resident, along with his friends, had warned the government that ‘if no decision is taken about Maratha reservation till May 31, they will take extreme step on June 1 by immolating themselves at any of the government offices holding constitutional position,’ forcing authorities to deploy heavy bandobast at all important government offices since Tuesday morning. Aurangabad special branch inspector Pramod Khatane told TOI, “Since posting the video eight days back, the man and his friends had gone underground, giving a tough time to police in the district.” After they remained untraceable, different police teams were deployed at the offices of Aurangabad revenue divisional commissionerate, district collector, zilla parishad CEO, commissioner of police, superintendent of police, special IGP Aurangabad range, High Court and different courts in the district since Tuesday morning. Police teams ensured that no one gets an entry inside these office premises without verifying their credentials.

While the body of Pradip Malannavar, 17, surfaced on Tuesday morning, the body of Saniya Mulla, 16, was fished out by Navy divers in the afternoon. According to Ponda police, Mulla slipped and fell in to the river and Malannavar jumped in to save her. However, both teens were unable to withstand the strong water current and disappeared in deep water. An intense search was lauched by the fire and emergency services personnel on Monday evening, but neither of the teens were located. Police then summoned Navy divers to continue the search on Tuesday. The divers were able to retrieve Mulla’s body from the river bed which was caught in weeds. The tragedy occurred when a group of seven students of the Dada Vaidya High School, Curti-Ponda had visited Okamb on Monday to celebrate their Class X promotion. “After enjoying a swim in the river, Mulla slipped in the water while climbing out. Seeing her being pulled by the water current, Malannavar jumped in an attempt to save her,” Ponda PI Mohan Gaude said, quoting eyewitnesses. A case of unnatural death has been registered at the Ponda police station.

Across city hospitals, nearly a dozen cases have been treated by physicians and surgeons, who caution that complaints of excruciating and unexplained stomach pain should be investigated. Sunil Gavali is one recent case treated at Holy Spirit Hospital, in which doctors detected a Covid-induced clot in the intestine. The 58-year-old had come to the emergency ward with severe abdominal pain after a meal. The man, an OT staffer at the same hospital, was vaccinated with both doses of Covishield, and there were no usual Covid red flags. When Gavali’s pain didn’t subside with medications, doctors did a CT scan which showed multiple clots in the main artery supplying blood to the intestine, called mesenteric superior. Follow TOI's Covid live blogVascular surgeon Dr Aniruddha Bhuiyan said there was no time to spare as the clot had led to intestinal gangrene, which if not treated immediately, could become fatal. The surgeon dissolved the clot and cleared it, reversing the gangrene and avoiding a surgery of the intestine that could have been debilitating. “It was my tenth case in the past 8-9 months where Covid and intestinal clot have presented together,” he said, adding that in several cases, patients didn’t come with the typical respiratory signs. “Stomach pain was their only complaint,” he said, adding that Gavali had subsequently tested positive for Covid. Read AlsoThird Covid wave in India could be as severe as second: ReportCiting international experience, the SBI Ecowrap report estimated that the intensity of the third wave won't be much different than the second wave. However, it said that deaths can be minimised with better preparedness. Average duration of third wave for top countries is 98 days. During the nowStudies have shown that around 16-30% of Covid-19 patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms and have minimal to no signs of respiratory problems. Patients with intestinal clots can come with acute mesenteric ischemia, a rare abdominal emergency associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Laparoscopic and gastrointestinal surgeon Dr Hemant Patil, who consults with Fortis and Jupiter Hospitals, has diagnosed five cases of intestinal gangrene, of which one succumbed due to complications of Covid and two needed surgeries to eliminate the gangrene. “They all presented with acute abdominal pain and were later detected with Covid,” he said, adding that after the pandemic there’s been a definite rise in cases of intestinal gangrene among Covid patients and even among vaccinated people. Surgeon Dr Jiten Chowdhry is currently treated two patients in their 50’s of which one is a diabetic. “One of them had a history of Covid and the other person tested positive after he came to us with intestinal clot,” he said. “There is emerging evidence that some Covid patients can purely present with gastrointestinal signs,” he said. Gujarat’s Rajkot has reportedly seen over 100 such cases.  Gastroenterologist Dr Amit Maydeo said that he has not seen cases of intestinal clot, but they have seen Covid patients come with diarrhoea, loose motions, severe pancreatitis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-clots-in-coronavirus-patients-causing-near-fatal-gangrene-in-intestine/articleshow/83156244.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Such a weird alliance has no intention to protect the rights of the weaker communities. It did not take the steps necessary to protect the Maratha and OBC reservations in the past 15 months. Our BJP-led government had also witnessed similar legal battles, which we had won as our priorities were in place,” she said. In the wake of the Supreme Court rejecting the quota for OBCs in local self-governing bodies in Maharashtra for breaching 50% reservation limit, Munde said a cabinet sub-committee must be formed to decide the future road map. “There is a need to chart out a time-bound programme to deal with the legal tangle following the apex court’s ruling. The sub-committee has to play a pivotal role in restoring the political rights of the OBCs,” she said. While addressing reporters on Monday evening, Munde warned that no polls would be allowed to get held in the state until the OBC quota issue is resolved. “Before the next polls at different places in Maharashtra, the state government should effect corrective measures, failing which, the OBC community will take to the streets,” she said. Munde added that the Maratha community should get reservation without disturbing the quota for the OBCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mva-govt-doesnt-have-a-mindset-to-work-pankaja/articleshow/83158699.cms||---

Other victims included a 36-year-old man without comorbidities who died nine days after admission to the CMCH, and a 13-year-old boy, who succumbed to the virus on Monday.

The price in Hyderabad for petrol stands at Rs 98.2, while 12 other districts are poised to touch the mark of Rs 100 per litre of petrol. These districts, include Bhadradri Kothagudem, Jagityal, Joguamba Gadwal, Kamareddy, Komarambheeem Asifabad, Mancheryal, Medak, Nirmal, Nizamabad, Siddipet, Vikarabad and Wanaparty have per litre petrol price ranging from Rs 99.12 paisa to Rs 99.87 paisa. Officials said the price of per litre petrol in Hyderabad currently stands at Rs 98.2, and will not take not more than one week to touch the Rs 100-mark. “The price variation between Hyderabad and mostly remote districts is the result of transport cost as petrol from depots at Hyderabad, Suryapet, Kothagudem is transported to various designated districts,” Marri Amarendar Reddy, Telangana Petrol Dealers Association president told TOI. The petrol in pipeline reaches depots maintained by three oil companies and tanker vehicles with a capacity of 10,000 to 25,000 kilolitres carries them to petrol pumps. Now, the lowest per litre petrol is at around Rs 97 in Warangal Rural, Warangal Urban and Suryapet districts. There are about 3000 petrol pumps across the state, out of which 750 are in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. The petrol pumps in city sell 3,000 kilo litres to 8,000 kilolitres on average. But some in busy areas like Tarnaka, Hitech city even sell 20,000 kilolitres a day. “The lockdown has impacted the daily sales as our commission for per litre stands at just Rs 3 even though there is price hike. It is a loss for us too as price hike also is one reason for drop in sales,” city petrol pump owner who do not want to be named said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/petrol-breaches-rs-100/litre-mark-in-two-t-districts-others-on-verge/articleshow/83156216.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Chennai||The man who looked for rhythms in words||By R RangarajThe poet of similies (Uvamai Kavignar), lyricist and the man who carried forward the legacy of Bharathidasan — Suradha’s life was all about stringing words to form a constellation of expressions.Born on November 23, 1921 at Pazhaiyanoor in Nagapatnam district, Suradha was named T Rajagopalan by his parents. Growing up near Narimanam, the village of Tamil poet and composer Gopalakrishna Bharathi, young Rajagopalan grew up to love the art of playing with words. Initially a fan of poet Sudhanandha Bharathi, he began writing poems while in school. Knowing his love for poetry when a tea-shop owner presented him with a book of poems by Bharathidasan, the boy’s life took a turn. He became a follower of Bharathidasan and learned Tamil literature from Sirkazhi Arunachala Desikar. His love for Bharathidasan was so much that he adopted his name Subburathinam and dhasan, to use the name of Subburathinadhasan, shortened to Suradha. As a student, it was obvious that Suradha would come under the influence of the Dravidian movement in his district. Many of his school friends also assumed an important role in the movement in the later years. Suradha also wanted to meet Bharathidasan but did not have enough money to undertake the journey. He took to whitewashing the walls of a temple to fund his trip. The much anticipated meeting happened on January 14, 1941. From then on, Suradha became a disciple of Bharathidasan, helping the latter with the proofing and printing of his works. He was given a monthly salary of `20.Tamil magazine ‘Ponni’ published Suradha's poem ‘Solladaa’ in its issue of April 1947, and introduced Suradha as a poet of the Bharathidasan legacy. Suradha first came to Madras to act as a minister in the Puratchikavi drama of Bharatidhasan staged in the presence of ‘Periyar’ E V Ramaswami Naicker and N S Krishnan. In those days, Suradha wrote several short stories. Some of Suradha's poems were also published in the magazine ‘Sivaji’, brought out by poet Triloka Seetharam. Trichy AIR would broadcast a few recitals of Suradha’s poems. It was during this time that his catchy phrasing began to be noticed. Poet Ku Sa Krishnamurthy is said to have provided him an opening to write for films. In 22 years, he wrote 50 songs for 26 films.He first started writing songs for Tamil films in 1952 for ‘En Thangai’. He wrote the dialogue and songs for M K Thyagaraja Bhagavathar’s ‘Amara Kavi’, the song "Yaanaithantham polae pirainilaa" (crescent-shaped moon like an ivory tusk) drew high praise.He could be romantic as he could be deep. In the song "Puriyaadhu priyaadhu" for the film ‘Aadiperukku’, Suradha wrote the philosophical lines, "Valarndhavar vaazhvil koduppadhai marandhaar, Oru Pidi Saambalil Mudivaanaar" (The man who prospered, failed to help others. Ended up as a fistful of ashes).One of his best songs was "Aadi Adangum Vaazhkaiyadaa" in ‘Neerkumizhi’. For the film ‘Mangaiyarkarasi’, actress P Kannamba uttered the dialogue: "Neruppu Sooriyanukku Theriyum Niraparaadhi Naanenru", (the hot sun knows that I am innocent), during the shoot and wondered why "neruppu sooriyan" (hot sun) when "sooriyan" (Sun) already means hot. The poet replied, "Nilaa Enraale Adhu Venmaidhaanae, Adhai Yaen Vennilaa Engirom?" (when the moon already signifies whiteness, why call the moon white moon).In the song "Ennamellaamor Idathhaiyae Naadudhae" (Thirumanam), Suradha’s lines were widely appreciated especially, "Maamalarin Nizhaldhaan Manamveesumaa? Muthumalaiyin Nizhaldhaan Vilaipogumaa?" (will the shadow of a flower provide fragrance? Will the shadow of a necklace have buyers?)Having written more than 3,000 poems, Suradha was also extremely popular in Tamil literary circles as he presided over several debates on Tamil poetry. For some time, he worked in Muthumizh Nilaiyam set up for Bharathidasan in Chennai in 1943. He brought out his own publications ‘Ilakkiyam’ in 1958 and ‘Suradha’ in 1966. A Kalaimamani recipient, when the Paavendhar award was instituted by the Tamil Nadu government in 1990, Suradha was the first recipient. On September 29, 2008, his statue, put up by the VCK party, was unveiled at Ashok Nagar in Chennai by chief minister M Karunanidhi.In popular memory, Suradha attained immortality with the opening lines of "Aadi Adangum Vaazhkkai Adaa" (life may be extravagant but you will have to accept containment) in the film ‘Neerkumizhi’, especially with the second line "Aaradi Nilamae Sondhamadaa" (In the end, only six feet of land is your own). When someone questioned him as to why he mentioned six feet (needed for a burial), while Pattukottai Kalyanasundaram had referred to eight feet, Suradha quipped I am shorter than him, for me six feet is enough. The poet who never forgot his humour and wordplay.(The writer is president of Chennai 2000 Plus Trust)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/the-man-who-looked-for-rhythms-in-words/articleshow/83159710.cms||---

The state-of-the-art cargo terminal being operated by AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Limited (AAICLAS), a subsidiary of AAI is the biggest in north India apart from Delhi. This is the third largest DCT developed by AAICLAS apart from Kolkata and Chennai. The cargo terminal will also start international operations once the pandemic situation improves, claimed officials. Built with a budget of Rs 21 crore, the DCT is spread over 13,000 square metre and while domestic as well as international operations divisions will be in the same building, adequate segregation has been done for smooth functioning though the track dock will be common for both. J S Balhara, director, Jaipur International Airport said, “Over the last few years, the cargo circulation had increased manifold as while in 2014-15, 9265 metric tonnes of cargo was circulated which increased to 17,680 metric tonnes in 2019-20. Although this quantity dipped slightly due to Covid, we have anticipated an increase in the same once the situation improves.” The cargo terminal is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for handling in-bound and outbound cargo. The terminal has strong rooms for valuable cargo as well as dangerous cargo rooms and four cold storages for handling general goods, valuables, perishable items, hazardous cargo etc. Other facilities include parking space, X-Ray machines, round-the-clock fire management, CCTV cameras and others. The ground floor of the DCT building will house the offices of the employees. Five airlines namely Air India, Indigo, GoAir, Air Asia and SpiceJet will initially be able to process their cargo and an official added, “While booking for the cargo can be done through the airlines, the warehouse operations will be handled by AAICLAS. This cargo terminal will cover most of north India and in fact even Delhi as there waiting is long but at Jaipur DCT, the cargo circulation can be done quickly. Cargo from Jaipur can be sent to majority of the airports in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/domestic-cargo-terminal-at-city-airport-becomes-operational/articleshow/83156230.cms||---

Last year, the lockdown period was a rollercoaster of emotions as we were doing online classes and I was terribly missing my friends and my sports activities. It was a very new experience for everyone, but we got used to staying at home after a while. My online classes were only for half the day, hence I had more time to finish my homework and attend extracurricular classes. I was also missing my gymnastics and basketball classes. My interaction with my friends was limited and I was detached from the rest of the world. That’s when my brother and I started helping my mom in household chores like mopping, watering plants and doing dishes. We learnt how to cook sandwiches, Maggi and pasta. These things kept me engaged. We got a new oven and my mom started giving us baking assignments. My brother and I started baking every Tuesday, making Tuesday’s a special family day with baked goodies and playing board games after dinner. We baked banana bread, lemon bars, brownies etc. While indulging in these calorie-filled treats, we had to take care of our health too. So, I joined my parents in practicing yoga. As a family we took on a challenge of becoming fit in the next eight weeks. We started tracking each other’s progress against fitness goals and it was fun! My evenings would mostly be spent in attending book clubs with my friends. The last 18 months have been toughest for most people, but it has also taught us to be optimistic and do little things that make us happy. I love bonding with my family during our game nights, playing Pictionary and laughing together. This period has also helped me grow as an individual and become more responsible and kind towards others. Once this is over, I look forward to attending school and meeting my friends all over again.

She charges her patients 15% below the government-fixed rate for private hospitals. For the last four weeks, Sirsa’s private doctors also serve for free at Jan Nayak Chaudhary Devi Lal Vidyapeeth Covid Care Centre.

Along with Dr Aggarwal, doctors Anzy, G S Gupta, Shaileza, Sanjiv Goyal, Atma Ram Godara, Neeraj Chaudhary, Kirti Chaudhary, Santosh Beniwal, Shamina Ahuja, and Anil also donated blood. On May 25, IMA cricket team Avengers donated blood. "The association has 250 members in Sirsa, who have pledged to continue these camps for a long time," the district IMA president said. Dr Archana got infected in October 2020 while helping a Covid-positive woman deliver. Her work goes on with cooperation of doctors Sonia Jindal, Rahul Garg, and Neeraj Galhotra (anaesthesia expert), and Manish Garg, and the staff nurses. They have helped 21 Covid-positive women deliver in 25 days of May. Seven of those were caesarean sections. No other doctor was infected but the nurses were. On how she persuaded private doctors to charge below the government rate, she said: "Most of the doctors in Sirsa are sensitive to the needs of the times. We do get complaints of overcharging but then those doctors come round after a bit of counselling."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pvt-doctors-serve-for-free-at-covid-centre/articleshow/83156221.cms||---

Congress MLA from Deeg-Kumher and former minister Vishvendra Singh’s son Anirudh continued to attack his father on Twitter for the second day on Tuesday. In reply to a tweet on his differences with his father, Anirudh said, “He (Singh) has collected debt without family knowledge and wants to clear it by selling our ancestral palace. He cannot do so with ancestral property. My mother has to be the custodian for future security of our property.” Anirudh added , “I earn myself. Have not taken a penny from him in 15 years. My mother supports me.” A day earlier, the scion of erstwhile Bharatpur royal family called his father alcoholic and accused him of indulging in domestic violence against his (Anirudh’s) mother Divya Singh, as the mother-son duo refused to pay off the MLA’s debts. The original tweet, though, was later deleted. In another tweeted reply on Tuesday, Anirudh said, “Mein koi property nahi hadap raha hu. Nahi kuch apne naam par mang raha hu. (I am not usurping property. Nor am I demanding anything in my name.) He has taken debt without family knowledge, and selling ancestral palace to save himself. He cannot sell ancestral property. My mother has to be the custodian of ancestry.” Anirudh, the only son of Bharatpur ex-royal, the other day came out publicly against his father by tweeting, “I have not been in touch with my father for 6 weeks now. He has turned violent toward my mother, collected debt, turned alcohol, and destroyed the businesses of friends who are supporting me. It is not just a difference of political ideologies (sic),” he said. He accused his father of spoiling his and his friends business when he refused to oblige him. “For the last 15 years, we are doing our business independently from my father. If we are doing our business separately from him, why should we clear his debts. When we refused clear debts, he turned violent. He also harmed mine and my friends’ businesses,” Anirudh told TOI. In reply to a tweet, Anirudh acknowledged that he deleted the tweets following the intervention of Congress MLA Sachin Pilot. “Pilot Sahab kahenge toh gardan bhi katwa dunga apni (sic),” replied Anirudh. Vishvendra Singh, a former cabinet minister in the Congress government, was sacked after he went with the camp of former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot during the political rebellion against chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year. The Congress circles were abuzz that Singh has now switched sides and joined Gehlot camp against the wish of his son Anirudh, who is an ardent Pilot supporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/property-dispute-embroils-bharatpur-royal-family/articleshow/83156263.cms||Joychen Joseph

Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has also asked government departments to form an integrated body to finalise beneficiaries of schemes announced by him on Sunday. Staff of education department has already started working on this, while the departments of technical education and other courses too have been roped in for the job. This comes along with compiling details from village panchayats. Officials said once data is compiled, it will be put through a verification process after beneficiaries apply though various portals. The government is likely to rely upon school records, records of Parivar Pehchan Patra, and Aadhaar cards. “The purpose is to ensure beneficiaries start getting benefits at the earliest. We have suggested an integrated platform as our beneficiaries will be till the age of 21. Hence, technical education department and colleges are being roped in,’’ said Vinod Mehta, principal media advisor to Haryana chief minister. He added that in addition to giving benefits out of state and central schemes, the educational institutions too needed to take a proactive approach. “Else, our priority is to quantify the beneficiaries first,” he added. When contacted, Kulbhushan Sharma, president of private Schools’ management body of the state, admitted to helping such students. He, however, added private schools will not go by government advisory. “I think that private schools will have moral responsibility to provide support and free education to such students. Rest, we don’t follow government advisories as they have not yet reimbursed our payments under Rule 134A of Right to Education Act,’’ said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-ropes-in-teachers-to-start-work-on-implementing-benefits/articleshow/83156250.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid case count lowest in 83 days though tests more than on weekend||MUMBAI: Despite the increase in the number of tests, Maharashtra reported fewer cases on Tuesday than it had on Monday. However, there was a significant rise in fatalities. The state reported 14,123 cases from 2.22 lakh tests that were conducted in the last 24 hours. Tuesday’s daily detections were the lowest in 83 days since March 10 (13,659). Maharashtra had added 15,077 cases on Monday from the 1.9 lakh tests conducted on Sunday and reported 184 deaths. The state reported 477 fatalities on Tuesday and added 377 old deaths, taking the total death toll to 96,198. The state’s total caseload rose to 57.6 lakh cases. Although cases registered in Mumbai on Tuesday (830) were higher than on Monday (666), experts said it was only a function of the increased number of tests. While 17,865 tests were carried out on Sunday (resulting in the Monday tally), the corresponding number on Monday was 23,503 tests. “The second wave has truly made a rapid decline in both Mumbai and Maharashtra and that too, earlier than expected,” said Maharashtra Covid task force member Dr Shashank Joshi. “The decline occurred mainly due to the restrictions and curbs that reduced crowding. But we need to lift these curbs with care to ensure that there is no crowding and people observe Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Joshi said. The focus now should be on vaccination and carrying out sero surveys to check the antibody levels in vulnerable pockets in the slums, which were most affected during the first wave in 2020. “Sero surveys done so far have shown decreasing levels of antibodies among the city’s slum pockets. We need to check these levels again. If the levels fall lower, we should plan ahead to ensure residents are protected with vaccination,” he said. However, the thick tail in both Mumbai and Maharashtra is a cause for worry. “Our cases haven’t dropped as drastically as has happened in Delhi,” said Dr Joshi. “We need to test more aggressively and perhaps even focus on home-based testing to ensure that patients are identified early and treated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-case-count-lowest-in-83-days-though-tests-more-than-on-weekend/articleshow/83156365.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Ahmedabad||MIS-C: Watch for fever, gastric trouble after Covid recovery||AHMEDABAD: Reya Trivedi (name changed), a three and a half year old girl from city, surprised Dr Nirav Benani, a city-based paediatrician. “She came with D-dimer score of over 16,000 and CRP of 125. On any count, the biomarkers were way too high for any age group. Further diagnosis pointed at multi-organ inflammation syndrome in children (MIS-C). After five days of treatment, we managed to bring down the markers to acceptable levels,” said Dr Benani. Covid-19, considered to be less severe for the kids and teens, is now infecting the Covid-recovered or asymptomatic Covid patients with MIS-C, and the prevalence is increasing in the second wave where high number of kids got infected, said city-based experts. Dr Rakesh Joshi, additional medical superintendent at Civil Hospital, said that they have so far recorded 10 cases of MIS-C in April and May. “In all the cases, the children had presence of antibodies – meaning they had Covid infection. The onset of symptoms is observed three weeks after the Covid infection,” he said. “Keep an eye on fever and gastric troubles.” “The youngest patient I am treating is four-month-old with heart involvement. She is under observation due to dilated coronary arteries (small aneurysm) and haemorrhage in stomach. She is now stable with medicines,” said Dr Pushkar Srivastava, a city-based paediatrician. “While we have not seen any deaths so far, it can surely be life-threatening. In two of the patients, we had to give them medicines to improve blood pressure. We are still to understand its long-term impact on organs.” Dr Chetan Trivedi, member of the executive council of IACP, said that with rise in Covid infection among the children, we may see rise in MIS-C in the near future.  “It is a bit difficult to diagnose and thus the doctors may suggest several tests. Early diagnosis and treatment can surely reduce complications,” he said. “In our experience, its occurrence is still very low among kids. As the age progresses, the complications can arise. But what we request to parents is to keep an eye on the symptoms even after recovery from Covid,” said Dr Nishchal Bhatt, a city-based paediatrician and member of state government’s task force on vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mis-c-watch-for-fever-gastric-trouble-after-covid-recovery/articleshow/83156380.cms||---

While over 400 kids lost both their parents, 172 will never see one of their parents again. In Bundi, 70 children lost either of their parents or both while in Alwar the number stood at 34. In Jaipur, 29 kids lost both their parents while two lost one of their parents. In Bhilwara, the number stood at six. “This data is for the months of March to May 21,” said Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) officials. RSCPCR chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “A lot of children were orphaned during the second wave and few were also abandoned by their extended families when either one of the parents died as they were unable to take care of them. We collected the data through helplines, police and district administration and now will identify the best possible ways to care for these children either through their extended families or residential care.” In 33 districts, 411 children lost both parents to Covid while 172 lost their single parent and six minors were abandoned. Officials claimed that they are regularly getting details about the children who have been left without caregivers and measures are being taken on priority basis to ensure that they get access to food and shelter immediately. The state government had declared that it would look after children orphaned during the pandemic, irrespective of the fact if their parents died due to Covid or some other ailment. A couple of days ago, the central government also declared that children orphaned due to Covid will be looked after by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/over-400-raj-children-lost-both-parents-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83156313.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

Singh said that it is unfortunate that rivers and mountains, which are our future, are being encroached by real estate mafia and that nature needs to be protected. He was addressing a press conference related to excavation work allegedly carried out by real estate mafia in the eco-sensitive Bramhagiri mountain — supposed to be the origin of the Godavari river. Stating that Bramhagiri is one of the holy places in the country and origin of the river Godavari, Singh expressed the need to save Bramhagiri and appealed to all sections of the society to get united to save such sacred places like Bramhagiri and Trimbakeshwar. Singh said that it is the responsibility of the state government to protect and save rivers and their origin places. “I will be writing to chief minister and state minister for environment on the issue, urging them to save Bramhagiri,” he said. Singh said that they will launch a severe agitation — ‘Save Bramhagiri’ — if the government fails to save mountain. Rajesh Pandit, an environmentalist, said that the Bramhagiri houses rare species of plants and it will impact the ecology of that area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/need-to-protect-eco-sensitive-zones-like-bramhagiri/articleshow/83158746.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Chandigarh||Antibiotic overuse in Covid patients may create super bugs: Expert||Shimona.Kanwar@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: After steroid misuse in mucormycosis, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in community settings is expected to be the next fallout of Covid-19. Alarmed by indiscriminate use of antibiotics in mild and moderate cases, where there is no indication for the same, Dr Nusrat Shafiq of the department of pharmacology said, “AMR has already a wide prevalence of resistant organisms. It is possible that since antibiotics are being used now mostly outside the ICUs like in the wards or home, there can be resistant superbugs in such settings in the community.” Dr Shafiq is managing antimicrobial stewardship in PGI. AMR occurs when bacteria, virus, fungi and parasites change over time and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of spread of disease, severe illness and death. Recently, ICMR published a study on overuse of antibiotics, where it was found that secondary infections in Covid patients in hospital settings was caused by irrational antibiotic prescription practices. The study mentioned that overuse of antibiotics in Covid patients could “create drug resistant bugs which can be a clinicians nightmare.” Doctors have been seeing AMR mostly in critical care units due to overcrowding, availability of limited doctors to many patients and longer hospital stay. “During Covid, there can be a possibility of an alarming rise in AMR in patients managed in home and ward settings. It can be there one year down the line,” Dr Nusrat warned. Azithromycin and doxycycline are mostly commonly prescribed in Covid cases. “Earlier, there was rudimentary evidence for the basis of Azithromycin’s efficacy due to its inflammatory properties, but subsequent studies proved otherwise. It is still in some of the guidelines, though doxycycline has been removed,” said Dr Nusrat. She added, “Unless there is an indication or suspicion of infection, it should not be given. And if it is given when suspected, it should be stopped immediately soon after the diagnosis.” In PGI, there has been a reduction in AMR due to less use of antibiotics and less overcrowding, as distancing has to be maintained and sufficient infection control measures. Box: Red flag Azithromycin is indicated when there is community-acquired pneumonia. However, it is being prescribed during Covid even for mild and moderate cases in home isolation. The ICMR study found that secondary infections in Covid patients is low. Thus there is less requirement of antibiotics in such cases as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/antibiotic-overuse-in-covid-patients-may-create-super-bugs-expert/articleshow/83153989.cms||Shimona Kanwar

At several places, dozens of trees were uprooted, and as a result several electricity cables were damaged leading to power fluctuation and outages which lasted for two to 13 hours. Residents alleged that that lack of maintenance, upgrade of infrastructure and monitoring by the electricity department cause disruption in power supply. RK Yadav, RWA president of Sector 46 said, “The power supply got disrupted around 1.15 am on Monday. In some areas, it was restored around 3 am, while in other pockets the electricity department was only able to restore it at 7:30am. In our sector, around 15-16 trees were uprooted during the storm. We had to remov them to clear the roads. Whenever there is rain or storm, the electricity infrastructure is hit hard, leaving us in trouble.” The power failures have also hampered the water supply in some areas of the city. “Due to the power failure, the water supply to Sector 9A, 9 and housing board is also hampered during the morning hours affecting around 4,000 families in the area. There are some patients in our colony, who are still need to use oxygen concentrator to maintain their oxygen level have faced lot of difficulty last night,” said Lalit Suraj Bhola, General secretary, RWA sector 9A.

---||Pune||PCMC makes institutional quarantine a must for most||PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body has made institutional quarantine a must for all Covid-19 patients, barring bedridden citizens and pregnant women among others, from June 10 across its 32 wards — a decision that contradicts the state government’s advisory on the issue. Last week, the Maharashtra government had in an advisory said rural areas in the districts with an average weekly positivity rate higher than the state’s rate should emphasise on institutional quarantine. The advisory had kept civic areas, such as Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, out of the advisory’s purview. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) commissioner Rajesh Patil on Tuesday told TOI that the civic administration emphasized on institutional quarantine to tide over the anticipated third wave of Covid. He said, “Many Covid patients do not abide by the home isolation regulations. We can stop the spread of the virus with institutional quarantine. We cannot initiate precautionary measures only when the caseload increases. Now that the cases are low, we want to bring it further down. The measure can cause a little inconvenience, but the decision has been taken in the larger interest.” When contacted, state health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that no mandatory quarantine measure could be imposed on a person with adequate facilities at home. “I will speak to the PCMC commissioner on the issue. The state government has not banned home isolation. No coercive measure should be used against any person who has enough space at home. Institutional quarantine is only for people not having adequate facilities at home,” he said. Tope said, “We have made it clear that the emphasis on institutional quarantine is for the rural areas. In the city areas, where a person has a huge bungalow or a spacious flat, there is no reason for shifting them to institutional quarantine. We understand the (PCMC’s) effort is aimed at reducing the infection rate. But coercive measures cannot be used.” Patil said the civic administration would set up 32 ward Covid centres to ensure availability of the institutional quarantine facility for all the patients, except the bedridden citizens, pregnant women, citizens with physical disabilities and and single parents. He said the administration would take feedback on the order from its teams and also increase the number of exceptions on the list, for whom institutional quarantine would not be necessary. Each of these centres would have a minimum 50 beds and Covid testing facility. Patil said the administration would also institutional quarantine at the designated hotels, if the patients wished. Housing societies with 100 flats or a population of more than 500 have been told to create isolation facilities at clubhouses. The directive stated that the patients would have to get quarantined at the society clubhouses, ward Covid centres, hotels or the bigger medical facilities of the civic body. In his directive, a copy of which is with TOI, Patil said the private doctors would have to report all patients and also the suspected patients to the civic body. The directive stated that the private and government Covid testing laboratories would have to send the report of the patients directly to the civic body for timely institutional quarantine. Patil has also directed the formation of a ward-level Covid vigilance committee to keep a tab on the infection spread in the twin towns. The committee will comprise the local corporator, a medical officer, social activist and a representative of the local NGO or from the trading community. The PCMC decision has also not gone down well with health experts and housing society members. Health activist Abhijit More said making the institutional quarantine a must would not help people who have the home isolation facility. “But there are some pockets in the urban areas where discipline is not followed. The PCMC’s measure might yield some results in such areas,” he said. Tejaswini Dhomse, chairperson of the Pimpri Chinchwad Housing Society Federation, said, “The ‘mandatory’ institutional quarantine does not make any sense, when the cases are going down. It will create a lot of burden on housing societies to set up the quarantine facilities and look after them. The civic body should strengthen its medical facilities.” Shiv Sena leader Rahul Kalate said the PCMC commissioner should have discussed the guidelines with the corporators before implementing them. “The vaccination should be the first priority now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-makes-institutional-quarantine-a-must-for-most-commissioner-patils-order-contradicts-maha-advisory/articleshow/83156275.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||India||IUML moves SC for stay on Centre’s citizenship order to 5 states||KOZHIKODE: The anti-CAA Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, seeking a stay on the Union home ministry's order empowering officials in 13 districts across five states to grant citizenship to non-Muslim religious minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh under the Citizenship Act, 1955. IUML, which had earlier challenged the 2019 citizenship law in the apex court, termed the recent order an attempt by Centre to implement its "mala fide designs envisaged under CAA". The Centre is yet to frame the rules for implementation of the new legislation. The home ministry's May 28 order empowers officials in Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab to grant citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from the three countries residing in the specified 13 districts. According to IUML's petition, the 1955 Act provides for citizenship by naturalisation in the case of any person other than an illegal immigrant. "Furthermore, the order does not withstand the test of Article 14 (of the Constitution) in as much as it treats people within a particular class i.e. persons entitled to apply for citizenship by registration and naturalization unequally by virtue of their religionit states. IUML's plea also mentions that it had filed a writ petition against CAA for being violative of articles 14, 15 and 21 and the basic structure of the Constitution by discriminating against people on the basis of their faith and religion. When that case was being heard, the Centre had submitted in the apex court that staying the Act was not necessary since the rules of CAA hadn't even been framed. IUML's petition was drawn up by advocate Haris Beeran and filed by fellow advocate Pallavi Pratap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iuml-moves-sc-for-stay-on-centres-citizenship-order-to-5-states/articleshow/83161462.cms||---

Preliminary investigation by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) health department revealed that the patients are suffering from gastroenteritis and they developed the illness due to consumption of contaminated water. During inspection SMC officials found that a drainage line water was getting mixed with a water supply line at a particular spot.  Majority of the patients are from Vivek Nagar and Ram Krushna Colony in Kathore. Around 45 patients are at the government-run community health centre while 21 are admitted at a trust-run Lokhat Hospital. Three patients are admitted each in nearby private hospitals. A large number of children fell sick and admitted to the hospital, said hospital officials. Locals informed health officials that they have been suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea since Sunday. The trust-run hospital has been receiving the patients since Sunday evening as the CHC was closed.  Those who died were identified as Gemal Vasava |(45), Harish Rathod (42), Mohan Rathod (70) and Vijay Solanki (38). They died due to severe health conditions after developing gastroenteritis, health officials informed.  “Condition of the majority of the patients is stable now. Health teams started taking preventive actions by distributing ORS pouches and examining residents who are still at home. Around 250 residents in the area were affected due to the contaminated water,” said a health department official.  SMC started the process to repair the water supply line and clear the drainage flow to prevent further contamination. Along with the health department, Varachha zone officials also visited the spot to find out the cause of contamination and repair it. “Drainage water is getting mixed with the drinking water pipeline. The drainage and drinking water pipeline network were laid by the gram panchayat and after identifying the fault SMC teams are repairing it,” said an SMC officer. SMC supplied drinking water through tankers in the area. Kathore is recently included in Surat municipal limits by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/four-die-72-fall-ill-drinking-gutter-laced-drinking-water/articleshow/83152614.cms||---

The older children, who are in Class 6 and 7, should be given more work,” she can be seen saying. The video has over 669k views on Twitter and has also been shared on several Facebook pages. The video was first posted by travel blogger Namrata Wakhloo on Saturday. She also later took to Twitter to thank the LG for his actions. “Thank you so much LG Sir, for taking note of the little child’s concern. I am so glad that her plea reached your office. Warm regards,” Wakhloo wrote. The girl’s plea drew several reactions on social media. “So adorable... But it’s a matter of fact that the duration o online classes are prolonged which makes the children tired,” wrote a user.

He said the Congress party is etched in the minds of the people of Goa and so it will not be difficult for it to win the next assembly elections. Further, he said that the BJP government has failed on all fronts and that people are aware of what’s happening in the state. Blaming the state government for the current Covid-19 situation in the state, Kamat said that is was a matter of shame that patients were dying due to insufficient supply of oxygen at hospitals. Kamat was speaking after inaugurating an ambulance provided by Dattaram Pednekar, social activist and Congress worker, at Verla, Canca. Pednekar said that two ambulances and a hearse van have been provided free of cost for Siolim constituency.

In a statement, NBF said fair and honest criticism forms the backbone of democracy. “NBF herein reiterates and urges the Government of India to immediately set-up an independent neutral national agency to probe into any allegations of professional misconduct by journalists, executives, and owners of news media company, in order to prevent selective harassment by state authority and to ensure freedom of press.” On Monday, a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud, L Nageswara Rao, and S Ravindra Bhat, had observed that the “ambit and parameters of the provisions of Sections 124A, 153A and 505 of IPC 1860 would require interpretation, particularly in the context of right of the electronic and print media to communicate news, information and rights, even those that may be critical of prevailing regime...” The bench was hearing petitions by TV5 and ABN, who had challenged the FIR charges against broadcasting news and views critical of Andhra Pradesh government and its CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nbf-hails-sc-stand-on-misuse-of-sedition-law-to-gag-media/articleshow/83161997.cms||---

I’ve uncovered the truth,” said cricketer-turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday after meeting the AICC-appointed three-member panel led by leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge in New Delhi. Sidhu has been critical of chief minister Amarinder Singh for his role as the home minister, especially on the issue of sacrilege cases. “I came here upon being called by the high command. I conveyed the voice of the people of Punjab. Truth can be eclipsed but not defeated,” said Sidhu, who appeared upset after the meeting. He did not take any questions. Sidhu and Jalandhar (Cantonment) MLA Pargat Singh continued their aggressive posturing even as the panel met the second group of 25 Congress MLAs to contain the crisis in Punjab ahead of the next elections. Speculation is rife that the panel may consider recommending two deputy CMs or two working presidents.

They also enhanced the shop timings from 5 am to 5 pm on weekdays i.e. Monday to Friday. Private offices have also been allowed to work with 50% staff in place of the earlier 33%. However, the weekend restrictions would continue. The decisions were taken after a meeting of the Mohali market association representatives with deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. The administration has asked the Mohali market association to appoint “monitors in markets to ensure Covid-19 safety protocols are followed.” According to the district officials, the decisions were taken due to a decline in the number of active cases in the past few weeks. Responding to the demand of traders on allowing opening of shops on weekends as well, the officials informed that it was a state subject and any decision in this regard would be taken by the government. “If active cases continue to decline, more relaxations may be considered,” said an official. Dayalan said the market associations must ensure vaccination of their entire staff and contact the local SDM for organising vaccination camps at the market-level. Mohali SSP Satinder Singh on Tuesday also cautioned shopkeepers against overcrowding in markets. “Shopkeepers have to prevent overcrowding, ensure wearing of masks and social distancing. Noncompliance will invite challans and may even force the administration to withdraw relaxation if it results in the spread of the virus,” said the SSP. According to the administration, shops can be opened from 5 am to 5 pm. Restaurants and eateries can stay open, but only for home delivery, till 9 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/restriction-lifted-in-mohali-now-shop-from-5-am-to-5-pm/articleshow/83162190.cms||---
---||Goa||Sex workers, transgenders suffer silently amid pandemic||Panaji: The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted all sections of society in varying degrees. But while their distress and vulnerabilities have got some attention, scant notice has been taken of the most marginalised section — people involved in the flesh trade and their dependents. A study conducted at four locations — Kolkata, Goa, Mumbai, and New Delhi — involving 212 participants, including transgenders, revealed that they have been severely affected by the pandemic. The study pointed out that across locations, the lockdown impacted income and basic sustenance, causing sex workers and their families more anxiety than the pandemic itself. “Having no means to earn brought uncertainty, helplessness, and dejection,” the Mumbai team wrote about the range of complexities and changes that the pandemic brought. Within a few months, many were pushed to the brink of destitution, exposing them to further exploitation, while few received help from the government. The Goa team reported that some women said their children had to drop out of school. “An entire academic year of many children of sex workers has been wasted. This is the risk, for such children may not continue their education or may likely be trapped in the web of commercial sexual exploitation. Some may even be forced into child marriage,” the Goa team reported. The study has been conducted by the Goa based voluntary organisation, ARZ, with assistance from similarly placed organisations. After sex workers’ collectives sought attention to their challenges and support during the pandemic, the Supreme Court ordered states and Union Territories to supply dry rations to them without insisting on the production of identity documents. Although they got some relief, it wasn’t easy for those who moved away from the trade. The study showed that the living of such people became more challenging during the pandemic as they could not seek assistance by revealing their past identities, as they now lived with their families and among communities that did not know about their previous profession. Arundendra Pandey of ARZ, who conducted consultations along with Juliana Lohar in Goa, said that given that there is almost no state or community-based rehabilitation for people desiring to move out of commercial sexual exploitation. If they got any support, it was minimal. “Due to lack of educational and vocational skills, they had to rely on the informal sector. With no documents to support their identity, the government schemes targeted at the marginalised section were out of their reach,” said Pandey. After the SC passed its order, he said the Maharashtra has started giving cash assistance to women sex workers, but the Goa government is yet to take any such initiative. The plight of transgenders has been equally bad. A transgender group reported that they pooled in their resources to survive but still had to cut down their food intake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sex-workers-transgenders-suffer-silently-amid-pandemic/articleshow/83155034.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Nagpur||NDCCB scam: Govt didn’t pay SPP for case||NAGPUR: More skeletons are tumbling out in the multi-crore Nagpur District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) scam case involving Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) minister Sunil Kedar after the resignation of special public prosecutor Jyoti Vajani. It has now come to fore that criminal investigation department (CID), which comes under state home department, has not paid even a single penny to the lawyer for pleading the case ever since she was appointed by the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court in November 2019. As per sources, the CID has failed to issue even a notification for her payment for this case, which is lingering for 17 years. Interestingly, Vajani’s remuneration for other cases was not affected. “This proves again that the government was deliberately trying to desist the SPP from going ahead with the case from day one,” say sources. Sources also said that Vajani was allegedly forced to resign from the case, in which state’s animal husbandry, dairy development, sports and youth welfare minister Sunil Kedar is prime accused. Kedar was chairman of NDCCB when Rs125 crore scam, often referred as ‘Gilt Scam’, rocked the bank in 2002. The investigating agency has named several others as accused, apart from Kedar. All of them are charged under sections 406, 409, 468, 471, 120-B and 34 of IPC. “She wouldn’t resign just for the sake of money. There are other factors working behind her resignation,” they said. Sources also claimed numerous attempts are still being made to delay the trial. “One one hand, counsels for the accused deliberately skipped hearings citing Covid threat and on the other witnesses travelled all the way from Mumbai and Pune for deposition during the Covid restrictions,” say sources. “Though the Nagpur bench had on November 8, 2019 directed to complete the trial within three months, the case is still pending even after over a year. Due to refusal of defence counsel to examine the witnesses, the trial is further delayed. One of the witnesses was a senior citizen, who came all the way from Mumbai to depose, but was sent back without deposition,” sources told TOI. Probe reason behind SPP’s resignation: Petitioner Petitioner Omprakash Kamdi, who had filed the case in the HC, demanded investigation into SPP Jyoti Vajani’s sudden resignation when the NDCCB scam case trial is at the last stage. “The SPP was doing a fair job. Obviously, Vajani was pressured to resign by the government, which wanted to save the minister and other accused. There can be no other reason, as Vajani had successfully handled many high profile cases in the past,” he told TOI. The entire scam amount allegedly swindled by the accused belonged to poor farmers and it is biggest travesty of justice that even after 17 years, the accused are still roaming free and occupying high positions in the government, said Kamdi. “After the scam was busted, many farmers had committed suicide as they couldn’t get back their money saved for daughters’ marriage. Even bank employees weren’t paid salaries, forcing them into penury,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ndccb-scam-govt-didnt-pay-spp-for-case/articleshow/83157419.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Many parts of Noida were without electricity for up to seven hours, and several areas in Ghaziabad, too, reported shattered hoardings, smashed cars and blocked roads. The minimum temperature in the capital dropped to 17.9°C, 10 notches below normal, and the lowest ever recoded in June. Light rain is expected early on Wednesday as well, but the mercury is likely to rise from Thursday. Like May, this June could be cooler than normal, according to senior IMD scientist Kuldeep Srivastava. After coolest May in 13 years, mercury to rise but heatwave unlikely in June: MetDelhi’s lowest temperature in June before this was 18°C on June 17, 2006. “The record was broken on Tuesday primarily because of the strong wind speed and rain in parts,” Srivastava said. Delhi’s base station, Safdarjung, received 15.6mm of rainfall till 8:30 am on Tuesday. Palam received16.4mm and Lodhi Road 13.2mm during the same period. The maximum temperature in Delhi was of 33.6°C, Met officials say the mercury is expected to rise once again and could touch 40 degrees by June 7. A heatwave in June, though, is unlikely, with western disturbances likely to take place. Delhi has recorded its coolest May in the last 13 years, with a mean monthly maximum of 37.5°C. It was only lower in 2008 — at 37°C. Despite the rain, Delhi’s air was in the ‘moderate’ category on Tuesday, largely due to dust upliftment. SAFAR, a body under the ministry of earth sciences, says the AQI is expected to be between ‘satisfactory’ and ‘moderate’ in the next three days. “Isolated Thunderstorms with gusty winds are likely in Delhi for the next two days and local dust uplifting is likely. The short-lived dust spike is likely to improve by following the rain and the washing out process,” said SAFAR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-storm-cool-delhi-to-17-9c-lowest-ever-in-june/articleshow/83162241.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Pune||10,000 minors tested Covid positive in Maharashtra district in May||NASHIK/PUNE: As many as 9,928 children and teenagers aged under 18 have tested positive for Covid-19 in Ahmednagar district in May, said district collector Rajendra Bhosale. Of them, 89 were aged up to 1 year, 3,052 were between 1 and 10 and 6,787 between 11 and 18 years, he added. However, Bhosale said the mortality rate in this age group is less than 0.5%. “The recovery rate is robust,” he pointed out, adding that the district had around 86,000 positive cases in May. Sachin Solat, a member of the district paediatric task force, said the figures were not at all alarming as far as children and teenagers getting infected in the district were concerned. “The number was around 11.5% of the total Covid cases registered in May in the district, which is acceptable. There is nothing unusual about it,” he said. According to Solat, 96-97% of the children and teenagers infected in May were asymptomatic. Citing an example, he said that of the 350 Covid -19 patients presently undergoing treatment at the civil hospital, only six were aged under 18. Solat said the bulk of the cases were from the rural parts of the district, where the infection had spread. “These children and teenagers have got the infection from elders in the family who were initially infected. We must remember that there are hundreds of joint families staying together in one home, where the infection can spread easily,” he said. Bhosale said the coronavirus in the second wave of the pandemic was extremely virulent. “But a section of teenagers who got infected were lax in not following the restrictions imposed by the district administration and moved around in public places without adhering to Covid safety protocols,” he added. State paediatric task force member Dr Aarti Kinikar said the panel had taken note of the high number of children and teenagers getting infected in Ahmednagar and was working to ascertain the reasons behind it.  “The task force will meet on Tuesday in Mumbai, where the Ahmednagar issue will be discussed,” she added. The authorities were unable to immediately provide data of children and teenagers getting infected in the district in March and April. Ahmednagar city NCP MLA Sangram Jagtap said the administration had started preparing for the third wave keeping children in mind. “The administration has started meeting paediatricians in the district to discuss what needs to be done in cases where children get infected in large numbers. We have also requested private hospitals in the district to start preparing Covid wards for children. The administration will soon inform the state government about its requirement of medicines and other things to treat children infected by Covid,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10k-minors-tested-covid-positive-in-maharashtra-district-in-may/articleshow/83162103.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Goa||Panchayats step in to help Covid patients, families with meds, ration||Panaji: Goa has over 200, but not all of these boast quick and easy access to a Covid care hospital. Apart from this, ease of availability of resources is also a matter of concern. From doorstep deliveries for patients in home isolation, sanitisation of spaces, and in some areas even provision of ambulances, panchayats are going out of their way to source help and provide for their residents. At Chimbel, in a bid to meet the needs of Covid patients, the panchayat is keeping themselves updated about the number of families under home isolation to ensure that family members don’t struggle to get their medicines and ration. “We have a team of volunteers that visit the houses and provide them with their requirements. The BLO has also helped us in reaching out to people in need,” said sarpanch Chandrakant Kunkolkar. The Chimbel PHC has on certain days recorded the highest number of Covid cases in the state. This, the panchayat says, is because the testing facility receives footfalls from Taleigao, Merces and Santa Cruz and sometimes even Curca and Bambolim. The Taleigao panchayat has put together separate teams for various services – ambulance-on-call, sanitization, delivery of home isolation kits – in a bid to ease the burden on the state’s paramedics and health workers. “The team of volunteers in the village are under health officer Dr Jude and coordinate with patients and drop them to the hospital. On their return from the hospital, we also provide them with a Covid care kit. We also have volunteers helping out the health officials with vaccination at the community hall,” sarpanch, Agnelo Da Cunha said. A pancha from Siolim said that it is getting increasingly difficult at the panchayat level to manage the Covid situation. “We can do very little in our capacity. For now, patients are being provided with Covid care kits. Door-to-door garbage collection from homes of isolated families is also being carried out,” the pancha said. A youth political group however has started free emergency vehicle service, sanitization and food delivery for those is home isolation in Siolim. The local authorities of some areas have taken it upon themselves to provide doorstep delivery of food for those in home isolation. Pancha of Reis Magos and Verem panchayat Prasanna Nagvenkar said that they have tied up with the local Sai Baba Sanstha to provide patients with free nutritious meals. “Members of the panchayat also often personally provide medication to families in home isolation,” he said. A helpline number is being circulated via social media for patients residing in Camurlim, Colvale, Revora, Nadora, Pirna, Assonora, Sirsaim and Tivim where free vegetarian lunch and dinner meals are provided on request. In the Penha de Franca, Salvador do Mundo and Socorro panchayat jurisdictions, those having trouble with vaccine registrations are being assisted through the VacciAssist vaccination drive. Here, volunteers will travel ward-by-ward from June 1 onwards to register residents on the Cowin app. In Ponda, a citizen-led group is offering virtual physiotherapy sessions for post-Covid recovering patients to help them improve physical strength. These sessions are being carried out in English, Konkani and Marathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panchayats-step-in-to-help-covid-patients-families-with-meds-ration/articleshow/83155146.cms||Nida Sayed

They have been told to submit their say within two days and have been warned of action under Wildlife Protection Act. A video of a large group of commuters on bikes and cars crowding either side of the Moharli Road had gone viral on social media on Monday. The clip showed a bunch of bikers obstructing the path and shooting videos even as two tigers prowling along the tar road came quite close to them. While others were seen to turn around and move to some distance, one of the bikers — identified as Arvind Banda — did not budge and paddled back his idle motorbike a few feet only when the tigers reached quite close. The tigers were forced to leave their natural path and walk into the woods because of the obstruction by the commuters. RFO, Moharli range, RG Mun, has served notices to four commuters identified as Arvind Banda, Sanket Vekhande, Shalik Jogwe and and Sahil Baig. Banda is learnt to be an owner of a homestay at Moharli, while Vekhande’s father owns a popular resort there. Jogwe, who is a naturalist, has been served as his bike has been spotted in the video clip. Foresters are trying to identify others seen in the video clip, sources in the TATR said. The notices state that the commuters were seen shooting video of tigers from close range and obstructing their natural prowling path, forcing them to move away. The recipients have been directed to given their reply in writing within two days at RFO Moharli office and have been warned of action under Section 9 of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Traffic on Padmapur-Moharli Road has increased considerably, leading to multiple incidents of disturbance to wildlife. Two accidents have taken place on the road in recent months in which a leopard and a spotted deer have been killed. Moharli forest, having as good wildlife as Tadoba core zone, has always remained attraction for free safari. Many youths take time off and go for a ride along the smooth road and often booze during the trip. TATR management has failed to curb this disturbance despite efforts to deter such intruders by raising the entry fees at Padmapur gate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tatr-serves-notices-to-4-for-obstructing-tiger-path/articleshow/83157453.cms||Mazhar Ali

There was no mention about clearance from the forest department’s wildlife wing.The tiger-bearing area falls in compartment numbers C-26, C-27, and C-33(A) falling in Hirapur, Govindpur, and Pimparwadi villages in Zari-Jamni taluka under Pandharkawada forest division in Yavatmal forest circle. According to documentation, there are resident tigers in the diverted area. On April 26, a pregnant tigress with four cubs in the womb was burnt to death by miscreants in the Mukutban range. The area is on the northern side of the proposed cement plant.The land diversion hit hurdles in 2019 when it was found that the entire forest area proposed to be diverted falls in the tiger corridor of Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary-Tadoba-Andhari and Kawal tiger reserves.The patch is also part of the Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP) approved by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (TATR) in 2016-26. Section 38 (O) (1) (g) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act (WPA), 1972, calls “to ensure that tiger reserves and areas linking one protected area or tiger reserve with another protected area or tiger reserve are not diverted for ecologically unsustainable uses, except in public interest and with the approval of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) and on the advice of the NTCA”.The NTCA too had sought a report about the project falling in the corridor. Accordingly, PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar had sought a proposal on wildlife clearance from then filed director of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR).“Now, before clearing the ground for wildlife clearance, the state chief wildlife warden has set up a four-member committee to study the proposal. The committee will conduct a site visit before making a decision,” said sources.The committee will be headed by CCF & field director of MTR, conservator of Yavatmal Circle, state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe, and Yavatmal honorary wildlife warden Ramzan Virani. The committee has been asked to submit a report in one month.TOI on August 26, 2019, was the first to report about it. The company will now have to seek clearances from the state board for wildlife (SBWL) followed by NBWL.In 2018, clearance to the Reliance cement project had snowballed into a big controversy as wildlife activists alleged Pandharkawda tigress T1 aka Avni was shot dead to pave the way for the cement plant. But the proposed area is 70km (as crow flies) from T1 territory.Sources said the forest to be diverted is of high value with 0.4 density. There are resident tigers in the area and the forest is contiguous the plant will break connectivity.The application seeking diversion of forest land was officially moved in July 2009 and in-principle approval came in 2012, but due to non-compliances, the proposal was pending. The final approval came in January 2018 after completing all the formalities including payment of net present value (NPV). The Birla Corporation plans to invest Rs2,400 crore in the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-member-panel-to-study-wildlife-clearance-to-reliance-cement-in-yavatmal/articleshow/83157552.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

He said the more the state takes precautions, the more it will succeed in keeping the virus at bay. Talking to reporters at Calangute on Tuesday, he said just because the number of cases has reduced, it does not mean that people can start moving around freely again. “It is necessary for people to stay at home for some more time. Cases should come down to zero, deaths should reduce to zero,” Lobo who had two months ago opposed strict measures said He said it's important that people who are eligible take the vaccine because that's the only way to overcome Covid. “They think they might die because they've seen some Whatsapp messages saying so. This is all wrong news," the Calangute MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curfew-must-be-extended-to-jun-15-lobo/articleshow/83155224.cms||---

But we cannot keep prolonging the lockdowns. We have to end it. But that is in your hands,” Stalin said in a video message. Stalin said the state was facing the second wave due to the failure to put an end to the first wave of the pandemic. It created a crisis for the state's medical infrastructure and finance, he said. “We should come out of it soon. People of the state should take responsibility to break the chain of transmission of the virus and return to development and progress,” he said. The chief minister said the state had overcome the shortage of oxygen beds and medical liquid oxygen in a short span of time. “Within a span of three weeks, TN government overcame the shortage of beds and oxygen,” he said. On the vaccination drive, the CM said, “We have administered three lakh vaccines and done 1.7 lakh RT-PCR tests daily. No other state has achieved this feat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-cm-m-k-stalin-seeks-cooperation-of-citizens-to-end-lockdown/articleshow/83162263.cms||---
---||Delhi||Reinstate 41 Air India pilots, give back wages to them: Delhi HC||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday came to the rescue of 41 Air India (AI) pilots who were sacked by the company last year, as it quashed the national carrier’s decision and directed their reinstatement. Justice Jyoti Singh, in her order, also directed that back wages would have to be paid to the reinstated pilots along with their seniority. It, however, clarified that the payment of back wages will be as per rationalisation (reduction) of allowances of pilots carried by AI due to the impact of Covid-19 and also made it clear that extension of contract in the future, of those who are on contract, would be at the discretion of AI as per their performances. Pilots blame lack of decision-makingA detailed judgment would be available only on Wednesday. Appearing for some of the petitioners, advocates Keshav Sehgal and Gaurav Sethi had challenged the national carrier's decision to terminate their services effective from August 13 last year. The pilots argued that there was a lack of decision-making by AI when they withdrew their resignations that had been submitted in 2019. Citing the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) issued by the DGCA, the pilots were required to serve a mandatory six months’ notice period during which they withdrew their resignations in March 2020, Sehgal submitted. However, no decision was taken by AI on the withdrawal of these resignations, forcing them to move the HC. Even as the plea was pending, AI issued a letter on August 13, 2020 illegally and retrospectively accepting their resignation, the petition contended, in violation of settled position of law. In November last year, the HC had asked AI to take a sympathetic view of the situation and said the employees cannot be left high and dry. Defending its decision, AI had then told the court that after lockdown, 90% of its regular pilots are sitting at home as most of its fleet was grounded and cited huge losses of Rs 1,300 crore each month. It said that accepting the withdrawal of resignations will cause financial distress, particularly in light of Covid-19 while arguing that contractual obligations can’t be challenged in writ petitions. The high courthad asked Air India to consider the grievances of the pilots, who were engaged on contract after they superannuated. It had asked AI to see whether there is a possibility of a “golden handshake” for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reinstate-41-ai-pilots-give-back-wages-to-them-delhi-hc/articleshow/83162266.cms||Abhinav Garg

Lobo said most of the youths, right from Keri, Arambol to Canacona have taken loans for their businesses, which have been closed due to the pandemic making it impossible for them to pay the installments. The Calangute MLA said that he has been approached by several youth saying that the banks are constantly calling them. “I have asked the chief minister to call for a meeting with the RBI and all other banks and tell them that we need to give a moratorium on the loans for six months, the last three months and the next three months, because otherwise all these loans will become NPAs (non-performing assets),” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/moratorium-on-biz-loans-need-of-hour/articleshow/83155255.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Tiger kills woman in Chandrapur||CHANDRAPUR: A woman was killed in a tiger attack in yet another incident of man-animal conflict in the FDCM Chichpalli range on Tuesday morning. There was tension at the spot after villagers had a spat with forest officials over rising incidents of tiger attacks. Victim Vaishali Mandale along with the other women from village Sushi Dabgaon had gone to the Dongarhaldi forest to collect firewood. While the woman was busy collecting firewood in compartment No. 526, a lurking tiger attacked and killed her. On hearing cries and on seeing the tiger mauling her, the other women rushed to the village to get help but in vain. The woman’s body was found in the shrubs. RFO, VL Pinjari, rushed to spot and pacified the irked villagers who were not ready to move the body. The body was later sent for the postmortem. Forest officials paid Rs 25,000 as ex-gratia to the victim’s family. A sum of Rs 5 lakh would be handed over via a cheque within three days. The remaining aid of Rs 10 lakh would be deposited in the bank account of the victim’s heir. This is the 21st human kill in predator attack this year. Most of the victims were out in the forest to collect the produce when they fell prey to the beasts. As per the statistics, 18 victims were killed by tigers, two by leopards and one by an elephant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-kills-woman/articleshow/83157586.cms||Mazhar Ali

It was also decided to insist with the government that it vaccinate high-risk parents at the earliest. It is feared that in the third wave, the proportion of children getting affected will be high. “We want to tell the government to somehow immunise parents having comorbidities early. We discussed how many paediatric beds will be needed to be created,” Goa Medical College (GMC) dean and chairperson of the expert committee Dr S M Bandekar said. In the worst-case scenario, Bandekar said they would need 1,300 paediatric beds all over Goa. If required, not just hospital beds, but those at Covid care centres could also be requisitioned. In its earlier meeting, experts had recommended that lactating mothers and those whose children are less than two years of age, be immunised on priority. At Tuesday’s meeting, Bandekar said it was also discussed how to strengthen the home- isolated patients. The expert committee will submit its recommendations to the task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/expert-panel-to-push-for-early-immunisation-of-high-risk-parents/articleshow/83155334.cms||---
---||Goa||Shell shock: After 6-year hiatus, Verem locals reap bounty of tisreo||Panaji: At a time when seafood supply has been largely impacted due to the ongoing statewide curfew, fishmen in Verem along a small stretch of the Mandovi are busy harvesting a bounty of clams. Locally known as tisreo, locals say that this is the first time in six years that the shellfish have reemerged on the riverbed. “We have been extracting tisreo since last month,” said Deodita D’Souza, whose husband and son go out with other fishermen to the middle of the river channel in canoes early morning and gather the clams with their feet using a special circular net. With this newfound treasure, the fishermen are fiercely guarding their waters, driving away anyone who attempts to scoop up the prized delicacy. “Some people from nearby Pilerne and even as far as Siolim had come here on Sunday. We politely told them they can’t collect the tisreo. This is our bread and butter. Likewise, we are also not allowed by the fishing community in Nerul to enter their territory,” she said. The Verem fishermen usually start as early as 2am, and sail back five hours later. Such is the demand that some people place orders a day prior, while others prefer to wait at the nearby landing areas for the canoes to arrive with the sackloads. A few households along the main road are also doing brisk business, selling the entire stock by afternoon. “Around 100 people have been gathering the clams every day, which has helped us earn a living. We will wind up one day prior to Nag Panchami,” said Sanjay Chodankar, a local fisherman. TOI had recently reported that a significant decrease in navigational and industrial activities along the river bank has brought down the level of coloured dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the Mandovi estuary during the lockdown last year. The combined effect of reduced water pollution and ship-barge movements, and improved water quality in the Mandovi has led to favourable ecological conditions for the shellfish to return and thrive, said Baban Ingole, retired chief scientist, biological oceanography, National Institute of Oceanography. “Tisreo cannot survive in highly polluted and turbid water. It also needs stable, undisturbed conditions at the bottom of the river. In fact, the stretch from Verem up to the area near Campal indoor stadium was once known for its abundance of tisreo,” said Ingole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shell-shock-after-6-year-hiatus-verem-locals-reap-bounty-of-tisreo/articleshow/83155422.cms||Jason Soares
