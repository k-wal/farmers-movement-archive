---||World||McDonald's says hackers breached data in Taiwan, South Korea||NEW YORK: Fast food giant McDonald's on Friday said hackers breached their servers and accessed data from customers in Taiwan and South Korea.  The announcement by the iconic US chain about "recent unauthorized activity on our network" comes amid a wave of cyberattacks worldwide targeting everything from meatpacking plants to pipelines to public utilities, some of whom have had to pay ransoms to hackers.  "While we were able to close off access quickly after identification, our investigation has determined that a small number of files were accessed, some of which contained personal data," McDonald's said in a statement.  However, the files accessed did not contain information about customers' payments, nor were operations disrupted, the company said.  "Based on our investigation, only Korea and Taiwan had customer personal data accessed, and they will be taking steps to notify regulators and customers listed in these files."  The company said it had worked with "experienced third parties" to investigate the breach, but did not provide details on the scale of the hack.  "A few additional markets will take steps to address files that contained employee personal data," McDonald's said, without elaborating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/mcdonalds-says-hackers-breached-data-in-taiwan-south-korea/articleshow/83443919.cms||---
---||India||Govt refuses to exempt mainstream media from new IT rules, asks them to comply with its provisions||NEW DELHI: The government has refused to exempt the digital news content of mainstream television channels and print media from the ambit of the the IT Rules, 2021 and asked them to take "urgent steps" to comply with the provisions of the digital media rules immediately. The rationale for bringing the websites of the organisations under the ambit of the law is "well reasoned", the information and broadcasting ministry said in a clarification to digital news publishers, publishers of online curated content or OTT platforms and associations of digital media publishers on Thursday. "Making any exception of the nature proposed will be discriminatory to the digital news publishers who do not have a traditional TV/print platform," the ministry said. The National Broadcasters Association (NBA) had recently written to the ministry, urging it to "exempt and exclude" the traditional television news media and its extended presence on digital news platforms from the ambit of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, saying they are already "sufficiently regulated" by various statutes, laws, guidelines, codes and regulations. "Since the code of ethics requires such digital platforms to follow the exiting norms/content regulations, which are in vogue for the traditional print and TV media, there is no additional regulatory burden for such entities. Accordingly, the request for exempting the digital news content of such organisations from the ambit of digital media rules 2021 cannot be acceded to," the ministry said. However, the ministry said, it does recognise that entities having traditional TV and print media are already registered with the government either under the Press and Registration Books Act or the Uplinking and Downlinking Guidelines of 2011. "The digital version/digital publication of the organisations having traditional news platforms (TV and print) may be following internal guidelines of the self-regulatory bodies. Accordingly, if the organisations so desire, they can request the same self-regulatory bodies to serve as the Level II of the self-regulatory mechanism, after ensuring consistency with the Digital Media Rules, 2021," it said. The ministry clarified that when any news and current affairs content of a digital news publisher is transmitted on an OTT platform, such content would be outside the regulatory responsibility of that platform. "However, if any OTT platform receives a grievance related to such news and current affairs, it may transfer the same to the publisher concerned of that content. Accordingly, there should not be any apprehension on this count either to the digital news publishers or to the OTT platforms," it said. The ministry noted that the television news channels already have a self-regulatory mechanism in place to adjudicate grievances relating to the violation of the programme code under the Cable Television Network Act, 1995 and their internal codes or guidelines. "The requirement of Level II under the Digital Media Rules, 2021 is only an extension of an existing institutional practice. Further, the composition of the self-regulating body would be decided entirely by the publishers and the government has no role to play," the ministry said. "It is neither stipulated nor intended for the government to either interfere or obstruct the formation of the self-regulating body including its composition," it added. The ministry also dismissed the concerns that the oversight mechanism stipulated under the digital media rules would lead to excessive government control over the functioning of the digital news publishers and the OTT platforms. "In this regard, it may be mentioned that even at present, in respect of the traditional TV channels, there is an oversight mechanism in the government by way of an inter-ministerial committee (IMC), which looks at certain grievances relating to the violation of the Programme Code, a mechanism which is in existence since 2005," it said. Over the last 15 years, the IMC has given recommendations by way of advisories, warnings etc. in respect of a large number of cases involving the content of both news and non-news channels in relation to the Programme Code and in almost every such case, the TV channels have accepted the recommendations of the panel, the ministry said. "The IMC mechanism has stood the test of time. The concept of an inter-departmental committee (IDC) is similar," it said. "Further, Level III is visualised as a residual level, insofar as the grievances which do not get addressed at the first and second levels would go to the IDC. Accordingly, the apprehension of excessive government control through these mechanisms is misplaced," the ministry said. In the overall context, the Digital Media Rules, 2021 may be complied with by the digital news publishers and the OTT platforms without any misapprehensions, it added. "The publishers may furnish the requisite information in the prescribed format immediately, take urgent steps for appointing a grievance officer, if not done, and place all relevant details in the public domain, constitute self-regulatory bodies through mutual consultation so that the grievances are addressed at the level of publishers or the self-regulating bodies themselves," the ministry said. More than 500 publishers have already submitted their details in the requisite format, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-refuses-to-exempt-mainstream-media-from-new-it-rules-asks-them-to-comply-with-its-provisions/articleshow/83443965.cms||---
---||World||US House lawmakers introduce bipartisan bills to target Big Tech||WASHINGTON: Lawmakers in the US House of Representatives introduced five bills on Friday, four of them aimed at reining in the power of the tech giants in what one congressional aide described as a revolution in antitrust.  Among the five bills, two address the issue of giant companies, such as Amazon Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, creating a platform for other businesses and then competing against those same businesses.  One measure would require platforms to sell a subsidiary if owning it creates an incentive for the platform to advantage its own products or lines of business.  "From Amazon and Facebook to Google and Apple, it is clear that these unregulated tech giants have become too big to care and too powerful to ever put people over profits," said US Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat who sponsored this measure along with Representative Lance Gooden, a Republican.  A second measure would make it illegal in most cases for a platform to give preference to its own products on its platform with a hefty fine of 30% of the US revenue of the affected business if they violate the measure. Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, was a sponsor of this bill along with Gooden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-house-lawmakers-introduce-bipartisan-bills-to-target-big-tech/articleshow/83444188.cms||---
---||World||Congress, justice department probing Donald Trump seizures of Democrats' data||WASHINGTON: The justice department's internal watchdog launched an investigation on Friday after revelations that former President Donald Trump's administration secretly seized phone data from at least two House Democrats as part of an aggressive leaks probe. Democrats called the seizures a "shocking" abuse of power. The announcement by inspector general Michael Horowitz came shortly after deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco made the request on Friday. Horowitz said he would examine whether the data turned over by Apple followed department policy and "whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations." House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif, and another Democratic member of the panel, California Rep Eric Swalwell, said Apple notified them last month that their metadata had been subpoenaed and turned over to the Justice Department in 2018, as their committee was investigating the former president's ties to Russia. Schiff was then the top Democrat on the panel, then led by Republicans. While the justice department routinely investigates leaked information, including classified intelligence, subpoenaing the private information of members of Congress is extraordinarily rare. The disclosures, first reported by the New York Times, raise questions about what the justice department's justification was for spying on another branch of government and whether it was done for political reasons. The Trump administration's attempt to secretly gain access to the data came as the President was fuming publicly and privately over investigations - in Congress and by then-special counsel Robert Mueller - into his campaign's ties to Russia. Trump called the probes a "witch hunt," regularly criticized Democrats and Mueller on Twitter and repeatedly dismissed as "fake news" leaks he found harmful to his agenda. As the investigations swirled around him, he demanded loyalty from a justice department he often regarded as his personal law firm. Schiff and Swalwell were two of the most visible Democrats on the committee during the Russia probe, making frequent appearances on cable news. Trump watched those channels closely, if not obsessively, and seethed over the coverage. Schiff said in a statement that the seizures suggest "the weaponization of law enforcement by a corrupt president." Senate Democratic leaders immediately demanded that former attorneys general Bill Barr and Jeff Sessions, who both oversaw Trump's leak probes, testify about the secret subpoenas. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate judiciary committee chairman Dick Durbin said in a statement that "this appalling politicization of the department of justice by Donald Trump and his sycophants" must be investigated. They said that Barr and Sessions are subject to a subpoena if they refuse. Prosecutors from Trump's justice department had subpoenaed Apple for the data, according to a committee official and two other people familar with the matter. The records of at least 12 people connected to the intelligence panel were eventually shared by the company, including aides, former aides and family members. One was a minor. Apple informed the committee last month that the records had been shared and that the investigation had been closed, but did not give extensive detail. The committee official and the two others with knowledge of the data seizures were granted anonymity to discuss them. The justice department obtained the metadata - often records of calls, texts and locations - but not other content from the devices, like photos, messages or emails, according to one of the people. Another said that Apple complied with the subpoena, providing the information to the justice department, and did not immediately notify the members of Congress or the committee about the disclosure. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, said in a statement that the data seizures "appear to be yet another egregious assault on our democracy" waged by the former president. "The news about the politicization of the Trump administration justice department is harrowing," she said. The committee official said the panel has continued to seek additional information, but the justice department has not been forthcoming on questions such as whether the investigation was properly predicated and whether it only focused on Democrats. It is unclear why Trump's justice department would have targeted a minor as part of the probe. Swalwell, confirming that he was told his records were seized, told CNN on Thursday night that he was aware a minor was involved and believed that person was "targeted punitively and not for any reason in law." The Senate intelligence committee was not similarly targeted, according to a fourth person who was aware of the probe and granted anonymity to discuss it. There's no indication that the justice department used the records to prosecute anyone. After some of the information was declassified and made public during the later years of the Trump administration, some of the prosecutors were concerned that even if they could bring a leak case, trying it would be difficult and a conviction would be unlikely, one of the people said. Federal agents questioned at least one former committee staff member in 2020, the person said, and ultimately, prosecutors weren't able to substantiate a case. The news follows revelations that the justice department had secretly seized phone records belonging to reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN as part of criminal leak investigations. Following an outcry from press freedom organizations, the justice department announced last week that it would cease the practice of going after journalists' sourcing information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/congress-justice-department-probing-donald-trump-seizures-of-democrats-data/articleshow/83444210.cms||---
---||India||Pak National Assembly gives Kulbhushan right of appeal against his conviction, death sentence||ISLAMABAD: The Imran Khan-led Pakistan government has finally delivered on speculation that circulating in the country for many months that it would help India on the Kulbhushan Jadhav issue through legislation by providing him a right of appeal in a civilian court against a death sentence handed down to him by a military court. Amid a ruckus by opposition lawmakers, the government bulldozed the Jadhav-related bill, along with 20 other bills, through the National Assembly on Thursday. The opposition members staged a walkout and pointed out a lack of quorum three times, but each time the chair declared the house in order and continued business. This forced the opposition to resort to a noisy protest. They gathered in front of the speaker’s dais and started raising slogans like "Modi ka jo yaar hai gaddar hai, gaddar hai (Whoever is Modi’s friend is a traitor)" and "Kulbhushan ko phansi do (Hang Kulbhushan)". A Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawmaker, Ahsan Iqbal, claimed the government had included the bill in the heavy legislative agenda to provide relief to the alleged Indian spy. The bill, "The International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Bill, 2020", was moved by law minister Farogh Naseem in the house. In July 2019, the ICJ had observed in its judgment that Pakistan was under an obligation to provide an effective review and reconsideration opportunity to Jadhav against his conviction and sentence. In order to give full effect to the said judgment, the law minister said, it was necessary to provide a mechanism for review and reconsideration of Pakistan’s own choice. "This can be done by law only," Naseem said, adding that it was mandatory to bring legislation in order to provide fresh consular access to Jadhav under the ICJ decision. Opposition members accused the government of giving an "NRO" to Kulbhushan, while the minister alleged that they were speaking the language of India and meeting its objectives. The NRO refers to the National Reconciliation Order under which Benazir Bhutto (and many others) were able to return to Pakistan from exile as cases against them were dropped. The term is now commonly used to describe an attempt to use an ordinance to allow someone to escape the legal process. Naseem said he was shocked at the opposition’s behaviour and it seemed that the opposition had not read the ICJ verdict. "Had we not promulgated the ordinance and now not moved for passage of the legislation, India could have approached the UN Security Council and moved the ICJ to take action against Pakistan for contempt of court," the law minister said. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the opposition parties were speaking India’s language. "India wants us to not pass this legislation, while the opposition members are following the same agenda," he said. The government had already enforced the law through promulgation of an ordinance in May last year, soon after the ICJ verdict in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. Amid stiff resistance from opposition parties, the National Assembly’s standing committee on law and justice had approved on October 21 last year the bill seeking a review of Jadhav’s conviction. Jadhav, according to Pakistan, was arrested on March 3, 2016 from Balochistan’s Mashkhel area. New Delhi, however, said he was a retired Indian Navy officer abducted from Iran. A secret Pakistan military court had sentenced him to death in April 2017. His appeals against his conviction had been rejected by the military appellate court. On India’s appeal, the ICJ had stopped Pakistan from executing him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-national-assembly-gives-kulbhushan-right-of-appeal-against-his-conviction-death-sentence/articleshow/83444404.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

In an interview to Times Now, Sinha said: “These are baseless and mischievous conspiracy theories circulated by a small section of anti-national elements. Such rumours are also fanned by certain elements based outside India.” Clearing the air on the movement of paramilitary forces — which had fuelled rumours about bifurcation of J&K — Sinha said: “These personnel were deputed outside J&K for elections. They were in quarantine and now moving to respective postings. Moreover, there is normal practice of troop movement in anticipation of Amarnath Yatra.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-bifurcation-rumours-spread-by-anti-national-elements-manoj-sinha/articleshow/83444832.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Chicago police officer charged in January 6 attack at Capitol||CHICAGO: A Chicago police officer has been charged with breaching the US Capitol and entering a senator's office during the January 6 insurrection.  Karol Chwiesiuk, 29, was arrested Friday and faces five misdemeanor counts, including entering a restricted building, disrupting government business, an disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds with intent to impede congressional proceeding.  Prosecutors allege in a criminal complaint that Chwiesiuk was among a mob of people who broke into and damaged the office of Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat. They also say that days before he traveled to Washington to attend a rally supporting then-President Donald Trump, Chwiesiuk said in a text to a friend that he was going "to save the nation" and was "Busy planning how to (expletive) up commies." He later sent photos of himself inside the Capitol, according to prosecutors.  Chwiesiuk was on medical leave from the police department at the time he traveled to Washington for the attack, the complaint states.  Chwiesiuk appeared in federal court in Chicago on Friday. His attorney, Tim Grace, said Chwiesiuk has been a Chicago police officer since 2018 and that he previously served as a Cook County sheriff's deputy. He was stripped of his police powers this week and is on desk duty, Grace said.  Police Superintendent David Brown said during a news availability Friday that Chwiesiuk had his police powers stripped on June 2 after the department learned of his participation in the attack. Brown said that if the allegations are true, it is "a betrayal of everything we stand for."  "What happened in D.C. on Jan. 6 was an absolute disgrace," he said. "The fact that a Chicago police officer has been charged in that attack on American democracy makes my blood boil."  Five people, including a Capitol police officer, died in the attack and hundreds of people were injured. Two other officers killed themselves afterward. More than 450 people from throughout the country have been criminally charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/chicago-police-officer-charged-in-january-6-attack-at-capitol/articleshow/83444986.cms||---
---||Goa||Former Goa Ranji Trophy player Jerry Fernandes passed away||PANAJI : Former Goa allrounder Jerry Fernandes,57, passed away at his Porvorim residence on Thursday. According to sources, Jerry was struggling with health. He was a diabetic and used to regularly undergo dialysis at a city hospital. Jerry played nine matches for Goa, taking 16 wickets at an average of 57.62, while scoring one half century. He donned colours for Stamina CC, Panjim Gymkhana and Chowgule CC. Born in Pune, he was among the probables for the Maharashtra Ranji Trophy team. However, he chose to ply his trade in Goa. "For me, he was a mentor and motivator,” said former Goa cricketer Sudin Kamat. “The year I made my debut, he played his last season for Goa in 94-95. We played together for a long time for Panjim Gymkhana. He bowled beautifully and as a lower-order batsman saved many matches for Panjim Gymkhana as well as Goa.". Others said Jerry was a quick learner. He quickly adapted to the demands of the game and could bowl left-arm orthodox too, giving captains an additional option. Aditya Tarcar, who captained Panjim Gymkhana in the 80s, was all praise for the cricketer. "Some people were made for cricket. Jerry was one of them. He was a captain's delight. I remember when Sharad Pednekar left us, we had a vacuum of pacer. Fernandes joined us and with Sudin Kamat and Jayesh Shetty, they formed a deadly trio," said Tarcar. Once Panjim Gymkhana were bowled out for 110 against Dayanand Gymkhana on a wet pitch in Bandodkar trophy in 1984-85. By the time they went for lunch, the pitch had eased out for batting. "Jerry was eager to go out and said, 'We will not eat before getting them out'. Such was his dedication. With Jayesh and Fernandes, we bowled them out for 29. I still remember his words," said Tarcar. He was popular among the opposition too. Jude Cardozo, former Goa wicketkeeper batsman, said, "He never got angry. As a pacer, he should have been aggressive, but he let the ball do all the talking and never sledged. In fact, after beating batsmen, he used to look at them and smile. He was too good and ideal sportsperson," said Cardozo. Girish Parekh, another former Goa cricketer and member of the Ranji Trophy selection committee, reflected on his dedication for the game. "Usually, pacers have limited life, but Jerry worked hard to keep it up. He had lovely variations and to have a left-arm pacer was a novelty and unique thing for Goa," said Parekh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-goa-ranji-trophy-player-jerry-no-more/articleshow/83444809.cms||Paresh Mokani
---||World||NC Supreme Court upholds murder charge in child abuse case||RALEIGH, NC: North Carolina's Supreme Court on Friday upheld a lower court's decision finding a man guilty of first-degree murder by starvation and neglect of his 4-year-old stepson in Gaston County. The child, Malachi Golden, died in May 2015 weighing 19 pounds (9 kilograms) at the time, roughly half the weight of an average boy his age. Malachi experienced spasms at 4 months old and had been prescribed an anti-seizure medication that was effective in treating his disability, the justices noted in their opinion. Thomas Allen Cheeks was accused of not providing the child with medical treatment for over a year. He was the primary caretaker and provided up to 80% of the child's care. When emergency medical personnel arrived and pronounced the child dead, a law enforcement official saw that the kitchen was stocked with food items, and found a bottle containing an unused 30-day supply of Malachi's seizure medication dated nearly two years before Malachi's death. Tiffany Cheeks, the child's mother, worked during most of the day. When she returned home one night, she discovered her son was blue and not breathing. When she asked her husband to resuscitate Malachi, the stepfather refused, according to the opinion. She called 911 for help. In 2017, a trial court convicted Weeks of murder and child abuse after concluding that he intentionally starved the child. The court sentenced him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. A unanimous ruling from a Court of Appeals panel saw enough evidence to support the trial court's determination that starvation caused Malachi's death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nc-supreme-court-upholds-murder-charge-in-child-abuse-case/articleshow/83445560.cms||---
---||World||Florida supermarket shooter had recently declared bankruptcy||FORT LAUDERDALE: The gunman who killed a grandmother and her one-year-old grandson inside a Florida supermarket had declared bankruptcy earlier this year after falling deeply into debt, federal court records show, though detectives don't know of any connection between him and his victims.  Timothy J. Wall, 55, carried out the slayings Thursday at a Publix in Royal Palm Beach, Palm Beach County sheriff's spokeswoman Teri Barbera said Friday.  The shooting sent dozens of employees and customers fleeing the store as Wall then killed himself. No other injuries were reported. The sheriff's office scheduled a Friday afternoon news conference to provide an update. Authorities have not released the victims' names, citing a state law that allows survivors to block their release.  Wall listed in his bankruptcy filing $6,000 in assets, including $9 in checking, $18 in savings, $4,100 in a stock trading account, $740 in bitcoin and a $300 gun. He said he earned $24,000 last year as a laborer working through a temp agency and his mode of transportation was a $600 scooter.  Meanwhile, he had accumulated more than $215,000 in debts, most of it owed on the home his ex-wife now owns, the bankruptcy file shows. She divorced him in 2018 and he had signed over their house to her in 2019, Palm Beach County court records show.  State records show that the couple once owned a dry cleaning business in the Publix shopping center. It is unclear when it closed, but Wall last filed an annual report with the state in 2012.  No previous criminal record for Wall could be found. Neither Wall's bankruptcy lawyer, Ryan Loyacano, nor his ex-wife immediately returned calls Friday seeking comment. The Associated Press is not naming her to protect her privacy.  The shooting happened shortly after 11:30 a.m. Thursday in the produce section of a Publix located in a strip mall that also houses small shops and restaurants. Detectives initially said the shooter and the victims may have known each other, but their investigation has turned up no link, Barbera said.  Publix is Florida's largest grocery chain and has more than 1,200 stores in the Southern United States. The company said in a Thursday statement that it was cooperating with law enforcement. The sheriff's office said the supermarket would be closed until Saturday.  Royal Palm Beach is a middle-class suburb of 40,000 residents, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) inland from Palm Beach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-supermarket-shooter-had-recently-declared-bankruptcy/articleshow/83445863.cms||---
---||World||Hungary: Bill would ban 'promoting' homosexuality to minors||BUDAPEST: Hungary's governing conservative party has prepared new legislation that bans showing pornographic material and any content portraying or promoting sex reassignment or homosexuality to anyone under 18.  Fidesz, the party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, described the legislation as part of an effort to protect children from pedophilia.  But LGBT rights activists denounced the bills as discriminatory, with some comparing the proposed legislation to a 2013 Russian law banning gay "propaganda." Human rights groups have described the Russian law as a tool of discrimination and harassment.  "These proposals, which have dark echoes of Russia's anti-gay 'propaganda law,' will further stigmatize LGBTI people, exposing them to greater discrimination in what is already a hostile environment," said David Vig, director of Amnesty International Hungary. He used the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.  Fidesz submitted the legislation to the Hungarian Parliament on Thursday. It includes a measure aimed at fighting child abuse along with various amendments prohibiting transmitting information about LGBT people or same-sex relationships.  The bills are scheduled to be debated Monday and to be voted on Tuesday. They are expected to pass easily given that Fidesz has a majority in parliament.  "Tagging these amendments to a bill that seeks to crack down on child abuse appears to be a deliberate attempt by the Hungarian government to conflate pedophilia with LGBTI people," Vig said Friday.  Luca Dudits, an executive board member with the Hatter Society, a Budapest-based LGBT rights group, said there is no similar law anywhere in the European Union "that is so hostile" to lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.  "We are very worried about the outcome," Dudits told The Associated Press by phone.  Gabriella Selmeczi, a lawmaker with Fidesz who is among those who introduced the legislation, denied that it is discriminatory or anti-liberal.  "True liberalism is when children are left alone with questions about their sexual orientation until the age of 18," she said.  Orban's government in the past has depicted migrants as a grave threat to Hungary and the nation's Christian identity, a theme the prime minister has successfully used to win past elections. With the next elections scheduled for 2022, and fewer migrants entering Europe, the ruling party has increasingly depicted the LGBT rights movement as a threat. Human Rights Watch denounced the legislation, saying that "Orban's government has sought to scapegoat LGBT people as part of a wider strategy to sidestep human rights obligations and cement Orban's brand of authoritarianism."  The legislation prohibits making pornographic content available to anyone under the age of 18, "as well as content that depicts sexuality for its own sake, or promotes or displays deviations from the identity of the sex of birth, gender reassignment or homosexuality."  The ban also applies to advertisements and education.  Marton Pal, a representative of the Foundation for Rainbow Families who has adopted children with his same-sex partner, described his shock at learning of the new bills on Thursday.  "Yesterday was a hard day. We went to sleep with a lot of anger," Pal told Hungarian TV channel RTL. "When we read these amendments to the law, we gasped for air at what is happening around us, and why there is this stigma. We are trying to process what opportunity this law creates for power."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/hungary-bill-would-ban-promoting-homosexuality-to-minors/articleshow/83446116.cms||---

Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that the agency had cleared about 10 million doses. The New York Times said that the batches being discarded amount to around 60 million doses, citing people familiar with the matter. Without disclosing or confirming the number of vaccine doses, the FDA said in a news release that it had authorized two batches of the vaccine for use, that several other batches were not suitable for use and that others were being evaluated. The agency said it was not yet ready to authorize Emergent BioSolutions Inc's plant for manufacturing the J&J vaccine. Production of J&J's vaccine at the Baltimore site was halted by US authorities in April and J&J was put in charge of manufacturing at the plant. One source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the J&J doses are expected to be exported to other countries. The doses are already in vials and ready for use, the other source said. Safety concerns about the J&J vaccine paired with flagging US demand for vaccinations in general have slowed rollout of the one-shot vaccine to a crawl. Close to half of the 21 million doses produced for the United States sit unused. The FDA said its decision allows for the J&J doses to be used in the United States or exported. The agency said the drugmaker and Emergent must agree that the FDA can share relevant information about the manufacturing of the doses with regulators where the vaccine is shipped. J&J, in a statement, confirmed that the FDA authorized the two batches, but did not acknowledge the doses regulators decided should be tossed. "Today's decisions represent progress in our continued efforts to make a difference in this pandemic on a global scale," Kathy Wengel, J&J's chief global supply chain officer, said in the statement. The FDA declined to comment beyond its statement. Last month, Emergent Chief Executive Robert Kramer said it was his understanding that there are 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine ready for FDA review and that regulators had begun the review process. The April halt followed the discovery that ingredients from AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine, also being produced at the plant at the time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccine. AstraZeneca's shot is no longer being made there. An FDA inspection also turned up a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices at the Emergent plant. Separately, Europe's drug regulator said on Friday that batches of J&J Covid-19 vaccine made for the region around the time the contamination issues were revealed at the Baltimore plant would, as a precaution, not be used. The European Medicines Agency did not say how many shots were affected, but Reuters has reported it involves millions of doses, making it harder for J&J to meet a target of delivering 55 million to Europe by end of June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fda-asks-johnson-and-johnson-to-discard-millions-of-covid-19-vaccine-doses/articleshow/83445818.cms||---
---||World||US vaccine surplus grows by the day as expiration dates loom||In Tennessee and North Carolina, demand for the Covid-19 vaccine has slowed down so much that they have given millions of doses back to the federal government, even though less than half of their total populations are vaccinated.  Oklahoma has not asked for new doses from the government for more than a month, spurning its 200,000-a-week allotment. Around the country, states are rushing to use up doses before they expire this summer.  The US is confronted with an ever-growing surplus of coronavirus vaccine, looming expiration dates and stubbornly lagging demand at a time when the developing world is clamoring for doses to stem a rise in infections.  Million-dollar prizes, free beer and marijuana, raffled-off hunting rifles and countless other giveaways around the country have failed to significantly move the needle on vaccine hesitancy, raising the specter of new outbreaks.  The stockpiles are becoming more daunting each week. Oklahoma has more than 700,000 doses on shelves but is administering only 4,500 a day and has 27,000 Pfizer and Moderna doses that are set to expire at the end of the month.  Millions of Johnson & Johnson doses nationwide were set to expire this month before the government extended their dates by six weeks, but some leaders acknowledge it will be difficult to use them up even by then.  "We really cannot let doses expire. That would be a real outrage, given the need to get vaccines to some under-vaccinated communities in the U.S. and the glaring gin vaccinations and the inequity of vaccinations that we have globally," said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco.  The U.S. averaged about 870,000 new injections per day at the end of last week, down sharply from a high of about 3.3 million a day on average in mid-April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  President Joe Biden wants to have 70% of the adult US population at least partially vaccinated by July 4. But the U.S. could well fail to meet that target. As of Friday, 64% of Americans 18 and older had had at least one dose, by the CDC's count.  Some states, especially in the Northeast, have already reached that 70% goal for adults, while places like Mississippi and Alabama are nowhere close. Mississippi, in fact, has been transferring large quantities of vaccine to other states and the federal government.  Amid the glut, the White House has announced plans to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June and also buy 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine and donate them to 92 lower-income countries and the African Union over the next year.  With demand stronger in Maine and Rhode Island, the two states received 32,400 doses each from Mississippi, where just 35% of people have had a first shot. Mississippi has also transferred 800,000 doses to a federal vaccine pool. The state has seen demand plunge to December levels, with only 14,000 doses administered there this week.  Each week, states are allotted a number of doses from the government and are allowed to order shots from that. But more states, including Oklahoma, Alabama, Utah, Delaware and New Hampshire, have stopped placing orders for new doses in recent weeks because they have such a large inventory. That has added to the ballooning federal stockpile.  Those skipping the vaccine include Benjamin Schlink of Pearl, Mississippi, who said he believes he is healthy enough to fight the illness.  "The way I look at it, I don't worry about it, because God is in control," he said. "If God wants you to have it, you'll have it."  Gayle Charnley, 69, said some of her neighbors in the small town think she should get the shot, but she is not planning on it. "They're just forcing them on people as fast as they can get them, and we don't know what the long-term effects are going to be," she said.  Hundreds of millions of vaccine doses have been administered around the world with intense safety monitoring, and few serious risks have been identified.  Some of the demand slowdown is a natural part of the rollout process. In Massachusetts, 68% of people have a first dose and the mass vaccination sites are shutting down as officials shift to harder-to-reach places, such as drug treatment centers.  Demand has been especially low for the J&J vaccine, a one-shot, easy-to-store formula that held great promise because of its convenience but whose rollout has been hurt by links to a rare blood clot disorder and contamination problems at a Baltimore factory.  Bibbins-Domingo said that with many parts of the world desperate for doses, the U.S. has a moral obligation not to waste the J&J formula, which is especially useful in remote areas, among people who are homeless and in rural communities.  "At all costs, we need to make sure that those doses get to people who can use them." she said.  In West Virginia, demand has nearly dropped off completely for the J&J vaccine. About 42% of the total population there has gotten at least one dose.  That's in spite of a sweepstakes raffling off everything from cash to hunting rifles to pickup trucks. When Ohio kicked off a trend of million-dollar prize drawings a few weeks ago, officials saw a robust 43% increase in vaccination numbers - but only for the first week.  In North Carolina, $25 cash cards helped bring people to vaccine clinics, but even so, the state isn't ordering any new doses from the government for the second week in a row.  Instead, the state has given back 1.2 million doses. In Tennessee, 2.4 million have been returned to the federal pool. It's a disappointing development to William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University's medical school in Nashville.  "If the governor is not making an impassioned plea - and ours hasn't - then I look to local leaders of every kind," he said.  In Colorado, which has given over 175,000 back to the federal pool, there's a million-dollar lottery, and drag queens have begun beckoning people at clinics during Pride Month. In New Mexico, the nation's biggest lottery grand prize, $5 million, halted a downward trend in vaccinations and may have even caused a slight improvement, officials said. Washington state allowed marijuana stores to offer free joints this week.  While incentive programs may not have sent vaccination rates soaring, they are still a worthwhile tool for states working through the difficult "last mile" of a marathon, said Dr. Nirav Shah, head of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers.  About one-quarter of the hundreds of people who responded to North Carolina's cash-card giveaway said it was key to their decision to get the shot that day.  "If states are able to prevent chains of transmission that would have otherwise landed people in the ICU on a ventilator, missing weeks of work, keeping their family out of school, if we can avoid a handful of those incidents, then these programs will have been worth it," Shah said.  Several states aren't ordering new vaccines from the government, including Alabama, Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Utah, and Oklahoma. Other states, such as Iowa and Nevada, are still ordering new doses but in dramatically reduced amounts.  Still, Shah said the nation's vaccine rollout is moving much more quickly than he expected, and he welcomed efforts to expand distribution to hard-pressed regions like Africa.  "One of the things that the pandemic has illustrated is that we are not safe, as a state, as a country, as a globe, until everywhere is safe," he said. "We should be doing our part to vaccinate everyone in the globe."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-vaccine-surplus-grows-by-the-day-as-expiration-dates-loom/articleshow/83446641.cms||---
---||World||California selects another 15 winners in vaccine lottery||SACRAMENTO: California selected another 15 people on Friday to win $50,000 each just for getting the coronavirus vaccine amid hopes from state officials that the chance of winning big money will convince skeptics to get inoculated ahead of the state's broad reopening next week.  The lottery-style drawing selected winners from the nearly 22 million Californians who have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. State officials identified the winners by what county they lived in, with plans to contact them in the coming days.  Fifteen other people won the prize last week. But state officials could not reach two of them. The two were replaced by alternate winners in Sacramento and Monterey counties, Gov. Gavin Newsom said.  In addition to the $50,000 prizes, the state has pledged to give $50 gift cards to 2 million people who get vaccinated.  But the big prize will be handed out on Tuesday, when Newsom will oversee a drawing where 10 people will win $1.5 million each. Newsom has said that on that same day he will lift the state's stay-at-home order and end most restrictions on businesses - including allowing fully vaccinated people to stop wearing masks under most circumstances.  One of last week's $50,000 winners was 17-year-old Nancy Gutierrez, who is about to finish her junior year of high school in the San Diego area. Newsom indicated the money would go into a savings account because Gutierrez is under 18.  "My only advice: Don't spend all that money. Invest it in your future and in your mind," Newsom told her during a news conference in Vista, California, that was streamed on the governor's social media channels.  Gutierrez appeared with Newsom at the news conference, smiling while holding a microphone and answering questions from the governor as he acted like a game-show host for the second week in a row. Gutierrez said she and her family initially did not believe the news that she had won and encouraged everyone to get vaccinated.  "I think most of us want life to go like back to normal and getting the vaccine would definitely help that," she said.  Newsom said California has administered nearly 40 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine and that 70% of the state's adult residents have received at least one dose.  Newsom said it would be "challenging" to for the state to achieve a rate of 75% to 80% of California residents vaccinated with one dose, but that he believes the prize money has been an effective incentive.  Newsom said the state administered 1.43 million does over the past week, an increase from the fewer than 1 million doses that were given out the week before.  "Just a handful of states can lay claim to seeing week over week increases in vaccination doses being administered," he said. "We're here to celebrate that."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-selects-another-15-winners-in-vaccine-lottery/articleshow/83447116.cms||---

The 25% share of total monthly domestic production of vaccines, which is meant for private hospitals, is to be allocated by states and Union Territories to participating hospitals according to respective quotas, a senior Union government official said here on Friday. According to the new guidelines, states are to “aggregate the demand of private hospitals keeping in view equitable distribution between large and small private hospitals and regional balance”. The Centre will, based on the aggregated demand, facilitate supply of vaccines to private hospitals and payment through the National Health Authority’s electronic platform, the guidelines say. Officials said the exact protocols are being finalised but the term “facilitate” does not mean the Centre buying the shots for distribution to private hospitals. Making payments through the NHA portal will be optional, the official clarified, adding that a hospital can pay manufacturers directly for vaccines allocated. This system, which will come into effect on June 21, will mean that larger chains with a pan-India presence, cannot bulk buy for distribution among their hospitals in different states. In each state, they will have to be part of the "aggregated demand" finalised by the government concerned. "Private hospitals are free to procure (and pay for their allotted quota) directly from the vaccine manufacturers. However, for those hospitals – mainly the smaller ones – which may be unable to do so directly, either the state or the central government will facilitate and the payment will be done through the National Health Authority’s electronic platform," the official said. The idea is to ensure equitable distribution of vaccine doses across the country and among smaller private hospitals and those in remote areas, which do not have adequate wherewithal to access and procure vaccines directly from manufacturers. Equitable distribution of stocks among private hospitals is seen as crucial as many hospitals were unable to participate in the vaccination drive because of their inability to procure from manufacturers, either because of lack of stocks or relatively smaller number of shots needed. As a result, sessions in the private sector are mostly limited to metros and Tier 1 cities. Of the total 42,704 sessions organised on Friday till 11pm, only 1,945 were in the private sector. The government has also fixed the price of the vaccination at private hospitals across the country based on price indicated by manufacturers and after including Rs 150 as service charge. Private hospitals will charge Rs 780 for a shot of Covishield, Rs 1410 for Covaxin and Rs 1145 for Sputnik-V. This includes taxes as well as Rs 150 as service charge.

---||World||Joe Biden to route US border wall funds to military and construction site clean up||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's administration will return more than $2 billion in funds allotted under his predecessor Donald Trump to build a wall along the US-Mexican border to the military and devote other remaining money to construction site clean up, the White House budget office said on Friday.  The move will return funds to 66 military projects spanning 11 states, three US territories and 16 countries, the White House said in a related fact sheet. The projects include $79 million to renovate a US military school in Germany and $9 million for a firing range in Indiana.  Trump, a Republican, made the wall a signature part of his presidency, saying it was needed to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. During his four years in office, Trump secured about $15 billion for the project, including $10 billion in redirected US military funds.  Biden, a Democrat, issued an executive order on Jan. 20 - his first day in office - that paused wall construction, saying "a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution."  The Biden administration said on Friday that it would use its legal authority to stop any new border wall construction while calling on Congress to redirect existing resources to technology-based border security.  Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, said on Thursday that his state would build its own border wall, but whether he has the resources and legal authority to do that remains unclear. Abbott and other Republicans have criticized Biden in recent months for rolling back Trump restrictions as the number of migrants arriving at the border has reached the highest monthly levels in two decades.  After Congress declined to provide money that Trump had requested for wall construction, his administration redirected funds appropriated by lawmakers for other purposes in order to pay for the project. Democrats accused Trump at the time of exceeding his power as president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-to-route-us-border-wall-funds-to-military-and-construction-site-clean-up/articleshow/83447304.cms||---
---||India||Modi praised UP’s measures to battle second wave: UP govt||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday appreciated the measures taken by the UP government in battling the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to an official statement put out soon after UP CM Yogi Adityanath returned to Lucknow from Delhi. The statement added that Modi complimented the measures taken by the state government during his meeting with the CM. The meeting between Modi and Adityanath was held against the backdrop of speculation of the BJP leadership’s unhappiness with the CM and a plan to clip his wings. The UP government’s description of what transpired in the hour-long meeting as seen as a riposte to rumour mongers who have stoked murmurs of an “imminent” change in Lucknow, leaving BJP circles simultaneously bewildered and intrigued with their perseverance. Soon after the meeting, an obscure news site quoted “PMO sources” as saying that A K Sharma, the former bureaucrat who served in Modi’s office before being nominated as an MLC in UP, would be appointed deputy chief minister. When contacted, sources in the PMO slammed the claim as “fake”. During the meeting, Adityanath expressed gratitude for the Centre’s help during the peak of the crisis. He thanked the Centre especially for rushing oxygen on trains and aircraft. He told the PM that funds provided under PM Cares would help the state government in setting up oxygen plants in all districts. Adityanath’s engagements in Delhi, which included meetings with home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda, have been linked to the possibility of a ministerial reshuffle in UP. The presence of Anupriya Patel, who heads BJP’s ally in UP Apna Dal, in the meeting that Shah had with the CM, has been seen as a pointer to the expansion of the ministry, likely to be undertaken with a view to assuage the ally and accommodate claims from within. The official claim about the CM being complimented by Modi was also seen as a sign of Adityanath feeling reassured as BJP leaders are not expected to spin developments concerning the PM. The “change chatter”, which has buffeted the CM for some time, intensified during the second wave of Covid-19 infections. Statements by BJP general secretary in-charge of party organisation B L Santosh praising the state government for taming the threat brought no respite. During the meeting with Modi, Adityanath said the Centre’s decision to provide vaccines to the state would help speed up the vaccination drive, which has been put into top gear with BJP’s organisational machinery helping the state government ramp up the massive enterprise. Adityanath also discussed development work undertaken by his government and projects, which will be completed in the near future. He told the PM how his government tried to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoods by imposing partial curfews, instead of a complete lockdown. He informed the PM of the state government’s decision to swiftly implement the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana — entailing free grains up to 5kg to the needy — till Diwali.

---||World||Nevada schools reckon with race, triggering polarization||RENO, NEVADA: Nevada has become the latest flashpoint in a national debate over how to teach students about racism and its role in US history, with parents clashing over curriculum proposals. People wore MAGA hats and waved signs outside a packed school board meeting this week in Reno, while trustees considered expanding K-5 curriculum to include more teaching about equity, diversity and racism. Opponents say the proposal would lead to the teaching of "critical race theory," which seeks to reframe the narrative of American history. Critics say such lesson plans teach students to hate the United States. A conservative group even suggested outfitting teachers with body cameras to ensure they aren't indoctrinating children with such lessons. "You guys have a serious problem with activist teachers pushing politics in the classroom, and there's no place for it, especially for our fifth graders," Karen England, Nevada Family Alliance executive director, told Washoe County School district trustees on Tuesday. District officials there and in Carson City, where a similar debate is playing out, say critical race theory is not part of their plans. The clashes mirror fights underway throughout the US. In GOP-controlled statehouses, lawmakers have passed measures prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory, a reaction to the nation's racial reckoning after last year's police killing of George Floyd. Nevada has bucked that trend. Governor Steve Sisolak signed legislation this week to add multicultural education to social studies curriculum standards and teach students about the historic contributions of members of additional racial and ethnic groups. Dr Jonathan Moore, deputy superintendent of Nevada's education agency, said the laws clarified social studies "content themes," which already included concepts like social justice and diversity. The standards do not include critical race theory, which draws a line from slavery and segregation to contemporary inequities and argues racism remains embedded in laws and institutions. Meanwhile, the Black mother of a mixed-race student is suing a Las Vegas charter school over a "Sociology of Change" course that covers the concept of privilege as it pertains to race, gender and sexual orientation. In Reno, the Washoe County School district arranged overflow rooms and set up loudspeakers outside Tuesday's school board meeting to accommodate a large crowd. Opponents gathered outside carrying signs that read "No CRT," "CRT teaches racism" and "The School Board works for the people!" "You say there's no CRT (critical race theory) in this curriculum," Sparks resident Bruce Parks told trustees. "It is being taught in our schools right now. When you use words and language like 'white male privilege,' 'systemic racism,' that's straight out of CRT." On the other side of the entrance, students, parents and teachers wore green T-shirts and carried signs with slogans including "Amplify Student Voices" to signify support for "Washoe County School District Students for Change," a group that has pushed for curriculum additions. "These are systemic issues, and they've been here for a long time. But I think the protests last year really gave light to how divided people were and how polarized people were," said Michael Arreygue, a college student who attended Washoe County schools. "There's people who don't want to acknowledge that these problems exist - that there is systemic racism and injustice." Superintendent Kristen McNeill recommended the district form a task force to review curriculum instead of implementing the plan. The board approved the task force on Wednesday. In Carson City, a proposal to incorporate concepts like equity into the strategic plan raised concerns about how schools broach the topic of race. At a Tuesday school board meeting, parent Jason Tingle said he was worried when he heard talk about critical race theory in schools. But he reviewed district materials and concluded the fears were unfounded. "I've yet to see anything in the curriculum that shows that we are actually going to take a hardcore approach to critical race theory," said Tingle, who has four children enrolled in district schools. "Until our kids come home and show us something different or tell us something different, then we should keep our faith in the school district and let them do what they were sent here to do."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nevada-schools-reckon-with-race-triggering-polarization/articleshow/83447413.cms||---
---||World||Joe Biden nominee's link to 1989 logging sabotage blasted by GOP||BILLINGS: President Joe Biden's nominee to oversee federal lands in the US West is facing Republican pressure to withdraw over her ties to environmental activists convicted of spiking trees to sabotage a national forest timber sale more than 30 years ago. US Senator John Barrasso, the ranking Republican on the Senate energy committee, said on Friday that US Bureau of land management nominee Tracy Stone-Manning should be disqualified for her collaboration with "extreme environmental activists." As a 23-year-old graduate student at the University of Montana, Stone-Manning sent a letter to federal officials in 1989 saying spikes had been inserted into trees in Idaho's Clearwater National Forest. The letter warned "a lot of people could get hurt" if logging proceeded, according to court documents obtained by The Associated Press from federal archives. Spiking trees involves inserting metal or ceramic rods into trunks so they can't be safely cut down, and the tactic has sometimes been used to halt timber sales. Stone-Manning testified against two friends and former housemates who were convicted in the case, saying she mailed the letter at the request of one of them and to prevent people from getting hurt. She was given immunity to testify and was never charged with or convicted of any crimes. The case received extensive media coverage at the time, and Stone-Manning years later had to explain her involvement to Montana lawmakers prior to her confirmation to lead the state's environment agency under former governor Steve Bullock. Its resurfacing comes as some Republicans have sought to undermine Stone-Manning's nomination, characterizing her as a partisan Democrat and environmental radical. Barrasso, of Wyoming, said after seeing the documents in the case that Stone-Manning's participation should disqualify her from heading the Bureau of Land Management, which regulates grazing, energy drilling, logging and other activities across 245 million acres (100 million hectares) primarily in the West. "Tracy Stone-Manning collaborated with eco-terrorists," Barrasso said in a statement. "She worked with extreme environmental activists who spiked trees, threatening the lives and livelihoods of loggers. While she was given immunity from prosecution to testify against her companions in court, her actions were disgraceful." Stone-Manning did not respond to telephone and text messages seeing comment. An administration official who asked not to be identified said officials knew about the criminal case and Stone-Manning's testimony prior to her nomination. "She has always been honest and transparent about this matter, which has been covered by the media for decades, and ultimately testified against the responsible individual, who was convicted," said the person, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss a pending nomination. During a Tuesday hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, GOP lawmakers including Barrasso grilled Stone-Manning over her record as a senior official at the National Wildlife Federation, where she was a frequent critic of the Trump administration's pro-industry agenda. The animosity toward her nomination reflects anger among some Republicans over Stone-Manning's role in the 2020 election. She served as treasurer and board member of the environmental group Montana Conservation Voters, which ran ads against Montana Republican Senator Steve Daines when Bullock unsuccessfully challenged him in November. At the time of the tree spiking, Stone-Manning was a recently arrived environmental studies graduate student in Missoula. She also worked during that time as an informal spokesperson for the loose-knit environmental group EarthFirst!, whose members gained notoriety in the 1980s for espousing "direct action" such as blocking timber sales to protect the environment. As part of her involvement, she helped edit a newsletter called the Wild Rockies Review and participated in satirical skits aimed at drawing attention to timber sales, according to a transcript of her 1989 testimony. In 2013, when she was questioned by Montana lawmakers about her involvement with EarthFirst!, Stone-Manning responded that she had left because the group's members were "angry." "Anger doesn't do much. It doesn't solve problems. What I do is solve problems," she said, according to an article in the Missoulian. Beginning in 1999 Stone-Manning directed a nonprofit group that pushed cleanup of one of the country's largest contaminated Superfund sites, Montana's Clark Fork River. She later worked as an aide to Senator Jon Tester and chief of staff for Bullock. Tester introduced Stone-Manning during the Senate hearing and defended her after Barrasso criticized her environmental record. "I would not be here today introducing her if I thought she was the person you described," Tester said. "This a good person, that has a good heart, that understands the value of our public lands." The vote on her nomination has not been scheduled. It would take every Senate Republican plus at least one Democratic lawmaker to block her nomination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-nominees-link-to-1989-logging-sabotage-blasted-by-gop/articleshow/83448140.cms||---

She had made the controversial comment during a TV debate while talking about the change in the Covid standard operating procedure in the islands which had zero cases and the subsequent spurt in cases. The FIR was registered against her under Section 124 A (Sedition) and 153 B (Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration). The activist had later clarified that she compared the administrator Praful Khoda Patel with a bio-weapon and not the government or the country. “Only truth will prevail. The BJP leader who gave the complaint was a Lakshadweep native. When he is betraying the land he was born in, I would continue my fight for it. My voice will be louder from now on,” Sultana wrote on Friday.  She had posted on Facebook on Tuesday that there was a campaign against her, trying to picture her as anti-national. “Everyone who has seen the debate would know that I used that word to denote Praful Patel. I felt that Praful Patel and his policies were like a weapon,” Sultana had said. Kavaratti police registered the case based on a complaint by C Abdul Kader Haji, state president of BJP, Lakshadweep. Meanwhile, a resignation letter surfaced on Friday in which at least 12 members of BJP from Chetlat island tendered their resignation from the primary membership of the party in protest against complaint filed by Haji against Aisha Sultana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sedition-charge-on-lakshadweep-filmmaker/articleshow/83448813.cms||---

The man, Suraj Sahu, did it to exact revenge on the victim’s family, who had shifted his childhood friend, who he was in love with, to Varanasi where she got married. The victim was the girl’s cousin. Sahu had demanded as ransom from the family of the victim, Raj Pandey, a photograph of his uncle after he was beheaded. Sahu claimed that Pandey’s uncle had raped his mother six years ago and had got Sahu injured in a road accident. On Friday, police produced Sahu before a court which remanded him in custody till June 14. Pandey was killed even as family and friends kept on negotiating with Sahu with a false hope. During negotiations, Pandey was heard howling in the recorded audio clip, pleading to his mother and others to get him released.  After failing to convince Sahu, Pandey’s family and friends rushed to seek police help but by then it was too late.  Police claimed that Sahu kept on negotiating while concealing the murder. Police said Sahu also described to the boy’s family how he was torturing the teenager by gagging him and hanging him from a tree and leaving him gasping for breath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/girl-married-off-to-someone-else-stalker-abducts-kills-her-teen-kin/articleshow/83449018.cms||Soumitra Bose

During his interrogation, Han Junwe, who is wanted in a case being probed by ATS Lucknow, said he and his associates would hide the SIM cards in undergarments and send them to China. A business partner of Han, named Sun Jiang, was arrested by ATS Lucknow recently on several charges, including illegally transporting Indian SIM cards to China. Han was named by Sun as an accomplice. Han, who had gone to China, could not get an Indian visa due to the ATS case and hence decided to get a Bangladeshi business visa to enter India illegally from Bangladesh. He was, however, intercepted by BSF. Han told interrogators that he has travelled to India four times earlier — once to Hyderabad in 2010 and to Delhi-Gurgaon thrice after 2019. An Apple laptop, two iPhones, a Bangladeshi SIM card, an Indian SIM card, two Chinese SIM cards and two pen drives were among items recovered from Han. Han, along with an Indian partner, Pottelli Prashant Kumar, had formed acompany, Hua Tong Behatar Vishwa Technology Pvt Ltd, with its registered office in Hyderabad. Han claimed he has a 100-room hotel in Gurgaon’s DLF Phase-3 named ‘Star Spring’, where most of the staff are from China. Jaiveer Lohia, the original owner of the hotel, confirmed that the company owned by Han and Prashant had taken Star Spring on lease for 10 years at Rs 15 lakh per annum. The 10-year lease agreement, inked in October 2019, names Han and Prashant as directors of the company. It mentions their PAN and Aadhaar details. According to Lohia, Han mostly employed Chinese nationals. “Also, only Chinese nationals stayed at the hotel,” he said, adding that earlier this year, Han and his wife had left India. After the Lucknow ATS recently raided his hotel, Lohia decided to revoke the lease agreement||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chinese-held-for-illegal-entry-ran-100-room-gurgaon-hotel/articleshow/83449117.cms||---

Ranchi, Chandauli, Simdega, Sonbhadra and Rajgarh have emerged as the top five districts with maximum change in net resilience since 2018, according to the UNDP appraisal. “Given the positive impact of the programme, it is necessary to ensure the focus on development is encouraged further and momentum gained so far in expediting growth is maintained. Based on the findings of the evaluation, it is recommended that the success of the programme be scaled up and replicated for other sectors and districts,” the UNDP report recommended. It said that a remarkable feature of the programme that has greatly contributed to its success, is the commitment shown by the top most political leadership of the country to bring about rapid progress in the under-developed pockets in India. This includes regular monitoring of the programme at the level of PM Narendra Modi, who has motivated and enthused district collectors to deliver their best at field level. The aspirational districts programme was launched by the Centre in 2018 to usher in development in the country’s most backward areas. Government thinktank Niti Aayog anchors the programme in collaboration with the central and state governments. The focus is on five critical sectors — healthcare, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development and basic infrastructure. The least improved districts according to the UNDP’s resilience and vulnerability index were Sitamarhi in Bihar, Gumla (Jharkhand), Dantewada (Chhattisgarh), Bijapur (Karnataka), and Nawada ( Bihar). “Overall, findings from the net resilience index indicate that the aspirational districts, on average, have been on an upward trajectory since the inception of the programme. A closer look at the best performers indicates an improvement in resilience along with a corresponding reduction in vulnerabilities,” the report said. “On the other hand, the least improved districts have seen significant increases in vulnerabilities. The latter calls for focused attention on specific sectors where these districts have underperformed. Replicating successful programs and learnings from top performers might form the basis of the inclusive growth among the aspirational districts,” it added. “More importantly, the programme was launched with the objective of reducing inter and intra-state disparities and it is on track of achieving it. The unique features of introducing competition, handholding support from the Centre and state and collaboration with various agencies is proving successful in realising the vision of holistic development,” according to the report. “However, stakeholders such as prabhari officers and development partners also warned that the momentum gained at the inception of the programme is starting to diminish and efforts must be made to motivate the districts. In fact, as the programme has completed three years, it may be advisable to introduce re-training and learning programmes on best practices among the districts to regain momentum and work towards achieving the remaining targets,” the report added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aspirational-dist-programme-a-big-driver-of-growth-undp/articleshow/83449577.cms||Surojit Gupta

Noting that China was a bigger security challenge to India than Pakistan, Gen Rawat said it had been communicated to Beijing that restoration of status quo in eastern Ladakh as it existed in April 2020 was the ‘bottomline” for India.  If that happens, there “will be some kind of belief in each other, satisfaction that it's not likely to lead to further escalation,” the CDS told a TV channel. “I am quite sure both sides are looking to return to status quo ante,” he said. Gen Rawat’s statement comes ahead of the Army commanders’ conference from June 16 to 18, which will be chaired by Army chief General M M Naravane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lac-pullback-slow-as-there-is-suspicion-on-both-sides-cds-rawat/articleshow/83449723.cms||---

Local police had initiated this novel tactic in a bit to weaken the influence of Maoists on tribals in Bhadradri Kothagudem district bordering Chhattisgarh. In July 2019, Maoists abducted a local TRS leader and killed him in Sukma district. The victim, 45-year-old Nalluri Srinivas, was tasked by the government to keep tribals away from Maoists. In September 2018, several tribal community members were taken to Chhattisgarh and beaten up. In October 2020, Maoists killed a man whom they accused of being a “mole” of the Special Intelligence Bureau. The area has also witnessed encounters. “With the border being porous, Maoists sneak in and out of the area. The idea of getting the villagers hooked to TV and giving them access to clean drinking water seems to be working,” a top intelligence official said. Cops were first tasked with distributing water filters to the tribal families, so they don’t have to scout for clean water anymore. “The families are now being given television sets with set-top boxes and they are very happy,” the officer said. Bhadradri Kothagudem SP Sunil Dutt said so far 2,500 water filters and 66 television sets have been provided. “Our priority is to see that the Guthi Koya tribals have access to all basic needs,” SP Sunil Dutt said. The Guthi Koya tribal families in Cherla, Dummagudem, Gundala, Aallpalli, Bodu, Karakagudem, Komararam, Edulla Bayyam and other hamlets are the focus of the police. “This is also a bid to give them knowledge of what is happening in the outside world,” a village leader said. During the lockdown, the local police in the agency areas distributed essential commodities to the tribal families. “Maoists have no support in the villages. The police will interact more with villagers, know their needs and provide them and solve any issues they have,” SP Sunil Dutt added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/water-filters-tv-sets-wean-tribals-away-from-red-meets/articleshow/83449930.cms||---

Police recovered 29 cars worth over Rs 2 crore. The accused were identified as M Chandramouli, a native of Parvathipuram in Vizianagarm district and L Siva Ramakrishna, a resident of Seethampeta in Srikakulam district. The third accused, S Ravi, a native of Bobbili, is absconding. The accused used to identify car owners in need of money and would promise owners a monthly income of Rs 25,000 as rent on their car. Worried over EMIs and vehicle maintenance, many would consider the offer. Vizianagaram police chief B Raja Kumari said one P Rajesh of Srikakulam district had filed an FIR on May 29, claiming that Chandramouli had promised him a monthly income (Rs 29,000) in the form of rent for his car. Chandramouli and L Siva Ramakrishna took away his car after entering into an agreement. They neither gave him money nor returned his car. Later, Rajesh came to know that they had mortgaged the car. Parvathipuram police investigated the case and nabbed Chandramouli. Chandramouli along with two others used to hire cars in Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts by paying a small advance but never returning them. Chandramouli said they had mortgaged 29 rented cars to various persons by taking loans of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh. The gang pledged the rented cars for money to meet their vices and other expenses, Raja Kumari added. Car owners from Parvathipuram, Battili, Seethampeta, Cheedikada and Vizag have claimed 23 cars seized from the gang. Police said some gangs were cheating people on the pretext of earning income via car rental during the Covid-induced financial crisis and appealed to people not to fall prey to such fraudsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vzm-cops-bust-car-rental-scam-recover-29-vehicles/articleshow/83442514.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Patna||IGIMS doctors operate on 103 patients with black fungus in 25 days||PATNA: The Patna-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) has created a milestone on Friday by crossing a century mark of the most challenging surgery on the the patients diagnosed with mucormycosis (black fungus) in various vital organs, including brain in 25 days since May 18. The IGIMS was designated as a dedicated Covid hospital in the beginning of May, but it soon started getting patients of mucormycosis in both Covid and non-Covid conditions. Remarkably, of the total 103 surgeries performed by its 20-member team, there was no casualty. IGIMS director Dr N R Biswas and medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal congratulated the team for their untiring services in the fight against the black fungus, which is an uncommon disease that emerged with varying severity during the second phase of the Covid pandemic. Mandal said altogether 174 patients of mucormycosis were admitted to IGIMS since May 18 and 103 of them have been successfully operated upon while 25 more patients would be taken to the operation tables soon. The surgeries performed included those by endoscopy, he said. However, it all did not come as a routine surgical affair. “We hardly had any experience of performing surgeries of mucormycosis affecting many vital organs at a time. We held many video training sessions by watching the complicated surgeries in hospitals of very developed countries and then decided to constitute a separate mucor department and, thereafter, began our efforts to accept the new medical challenge,” said Dr Mandal. Each patient coming to the IGIMS OPD was examined by experts of ENT, eye, maxillofacial surgery and neurosurgery after which the team evaluated the stage of infection to be followed by taking him to the operation theatre (OT). Mandal said, “The biggest challenge for the team was the surgery of a 72-year-old person with hypertension, high blood sugar and thyroid problems. But they did it successfully and the patient was discharged after the follow-up treatment.” He also appreciated the doctors from the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital for associating with the IGIMS team for over ten days in performing surgeries. Dr Rakesh Kumar Singh, head of the ENT department, said the task began with clinically confirming the areas infected by the deadly fungus indicating different stages. In the first stage, only ENT surgery was required while the second needed ENT and eye specialists. He said in the third stage, doctors of maxillofacial surgery were also added to the team of ENT and eye while the fourth included those of neutosurgery. Anaesthesia experts are unmissable members of the mucor surgery teams. Other doctors associated with the surgical team include Sarita Singh, Amit Sharma, Mahesh Kumar, MS Ali, Vidya Bhushan, Priyakar and Javed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/igims-doctors-operate-on-103-patients-with-black-fungus-in-25-days/articleshow/83439221.cms||VK Tripathi

A police team has been stationed in the locality to ensure peace and keep watch on the outsiders visiting the area. Banka police has registered an FIR against unknown people in connection with the bomb explosion. The Banka police and the anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of the state police are trying to find out who had concealed the crude bombs inside a container at the madrassa and for what purpose. Bhagalpur zone DIG Sujeet Kumar said forensic science laboratory (FSL) team has made elaborate investigations at the explosion site besides gathering several pieces of evidence from the spot. “The FSL is yet to submit its final report and police investigations are on,” Kumar said. Banka SP Arvind Kumar Gupta said, “Based on our multidirectional and scientific investigations so far, it is evident that the explosion was caused by crude bombs which were hidden in a container kept inside the madrassa. We have analysed the postmortem report of the deceased imam. The body had multiple injury marks. The causes of death have been attributed to injuries and asphyxia.” Earlier, Banka DM Suharsh Bhagat and SP Gupta had claimed on Monday that the explosion in the madrassa was triggered by crude bombs. A massive explosion had occurred at the madrassa at Navtolia village under the Banka sadar police station area around 8am on Tuesday. Major part of the building had collapsed. Imam of an adjacent mosque, Maulana Abdul Momin Ansari, had died in the explosion. Meanwhile, the Banka SP held a high-level meeting with senior police officers and SHOs of the district on Friday and directed them to identify those involved in the balst and arrest them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-headway-in-banka-madrassa-blast-case-yet/articleshow/83438739.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Though there are no patients there at present, the hospitals that operated the facilities have decided to maintain the places so that they are ready to admit patients when the third wave strikes. “Our last Covid patient from the stadium hospital was shifted to the general ward of our Salt Lake hospital only a couple of days ago. Even if it does not have any patient any more, we will still maintain the infrastructure. Cases are on a massive downswing at present. We are keeping our fingers crossed, but many healthcare experts are talking about a third wave. So we need to remain prepared,” said AMRI Hospitals Group CEO Rupak Barua. When hospitals were absolutely overwhelmed and unable to handle the patient load, Medica Group of Hospitals had converted Kishore Bharti stadium into a 200-bed Covid hospital on April 10. AMRI followed suit by taking over India’s largest football stadium at Salt Lake with 250 Covid beds on May 7. “The Kishore Bharti stadium hospital is now completely empty, with the last patient being discharged about 10 days ago. But since we are expecting a third wave, we will keep the facility intact for at least six more months,” said Medica Group of Hospitals chairman Alok Roy. Unlike safe homes and satellite facilities, these two mini hospitals are equipped with almost hospital-like facilities, including liquid medical oxygen (LMO) tanks for uninterrupted oxygen supply and bed monitors. They catered to mildly infected patients, as well as the moderately ill patients who needed HDU beds. Back then, the state would record positive cases between 17,000 and 20,000 per day. “We had hired additional manpower — a 140-strong team — for the field hospital and at a point of time it had as high as 75% occupancy. The unit had not only helped patients, but also our three hospital units where we would receive numerous SOS messages for a bed,” said Barua. At present, all three units of AMRI together have about 120 Covid patients out of 404 beds. Medica, too, has only about a 40% Covid-bed occupancy in its hospital. Currently, fresh cases have dipped by three times or above. The two stadiums are, however, being utilized as community vaccination centres by the two respective hospital chains. “We are administering about 5,000 doses daily from our stadium unit and we plan to expand it to reach more people,” said Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/beds-empty-but-hosps-keep-stadium-units-ready/articleshow/83443493.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Business||Sebi looks into deal between PNB Housing Finance, Carlyle||MUMBAI: After an institutional advisory firm raised serious questions about the deal between global private equity major Carlyle and other entities to buy a substantial stake in PNB Housing Finance, markets regulator Sebi has asked stock exchanges to look into the transaction. Sources said bourses have asked PNB Housing Finance, a listed entity, to share the details of the deal under which the company is set to make a preferential allotment to Carlyle and other entities for Rs 4,000 crore. After the allotment, Carlyle and five other entities are set to make an open offer to PNB HFC shareholders at Rs 403 per share to acquire 26% of the expanded capital of the company. However, since the announcement of the deal, the stock price has more than doubled to its Friday close on the BSE at Rs 818. Once the open offer ends, the PE major and its associates could hold over 50% in the company. On Wednesday, SES, an institutional investor advisory firm, had alleged that the whole process of preferential allotment in PNB HFC was ultra vires of law and its structure is against the minority shareholders of the mortgage finance company. It also alleged that the process adopted gives indirect management control to the PE major and would lead to a Rs 2,000-crore loss to PNB, one of the largest government-run banks. Through an email, PNB HFC had told TOI that the entire process was done after due diligence and so structured to benefit all shareholders. In its report, SES had raised several concerns, which included whether a rights offer was a better proposition than a preferential structure. It also said that by opting for a preferential allotment PNB, the current majority owner in the company, would lose at least Rs 2,000 crore. SES also pointed out that 85% of the shareholders were part of the deal while only the public shareholders were left out. It had also said that the pricing of the offer was a convenient refuge under Sebi’s capital raising rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-looks-into-deal-between-pnb-hsg-carlyle/articleshow/83444841.cms||---

While some developments have managed to hold on to the prices, most properties have seen a marginal decline over the past year. India on the whole has fared extremely poorly on the global house price index, dropping 12 spots to 55 among 56 countries, just above Spain. In Kolkata, the micro-markets in Rajarhat and Howrah are among the worst affected with sales continuing to dip. Last year, these had taken a beating with sales declining by 27%. Rajarhat, plagued by oversupply, saw prices drop by 5%. Properties in Salt Lake and Jessore Road witnessed a 2% dip while it fell by 1% in Kankurgachhi and BT Road. Knight Frank assistant VP (research) Divya Grover said the decline in certain markets had pulled down the weighted average property price in Kolkata. “Kolkata was also impacted by Amphan. Though sales had picked up in the latter half of the year due to pent-up demand, the second wave has again hit the market,” she said. House sales had dipped by 21% in 2020 against 2019 while the quarter-on-quarter dip was by a whopping 48% in the last quarter of 2020. That situation, realtors said, had not improved in the first quarter of 2021. While Q1 2020 saw 2,937 units being sold, the sales increased to 3,921 in the third quarter after a washout second quarter owing to the lockdown. In the fourth quarter, sales crashed to 2,054 units. The weighted average price of residential real estate in Kolkata is Rs 3,213 per sqft. “The price decline is either in micro-markets where there is over-supply or in projects where the developer is offering discount for liquidity. But overall, prices in Kolkata have remained firm,” said Nandu Belani, president of the Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India. Knight Frank India chairman and MD Shishir Baijal said, “In Q1 2021, India witnessed meaningful recovery in sales volumes.However, with the second wave and threat of new virus variants, there could be a pressure on sales volumes as well as on price growth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-real-estate-sales-take-a-hit-with-4-avg-price-drop-micro-markets-worst-affected/articleshow/83443576.cms||Subhro Niyogi

While Policybazaar is one of the largest online distributors of health, motor and term life insurance the broking licence allows it go far beyond its present operations. “As a web aggregator, we were already among the top ten distributors of insurance. We can now provide a wider range of products to a wider range of customers and engage with them offline,” said Yashish Dahiya. The company can now sell all types of insurance plans including property insurance to businesses ranging from small shops to companies. It can engage with customers offline, and it can also assist clients in claims servicing. Policybazaar’s distribution accounts for nearly 25% of India’s life covers, and over 10% of India’s retail health business. It accounts for roughly half of all internet-based insurance purchases in the country and has been doubling its business annually. The insurance broking licence has been granted to Policybazaar’s parent PB Fintech. With the web aggregator business merging into the broking entity, the company will be the largest retail broker from its first day of operations. While brokers do not take any insurance risk on their books, the changed status would mean that Policybazaar would have to make a significant investment in building up points of presence in different cities. Policybzaar is the country’s largest insurance marketplace. The group has other fintech brands including Paisabazaar, b2b venture ZPhin and a lending & insurance marketplace in the UAE region. The group has investment backing from the likes of Soft Bank, InfoEdge (Naukri.com), Temasek, Tiger Global Management, True North and Premji Invest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurance-broking-licence-for-policybazaar/articleshow/83444995.cms||---

According to the RBI, forex reserves increased by $6.8 billion in the week ended June 4 to $605 billion. The current level of forex reserves are enough to cover nearly 16 months of imports. According to RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, the central bank has enough ammunition to meet challenges arising out of “global spillovers”, a reference to any sudden policy changes in the US or geopolitical shifts that could lead to funds exiting India. India is now less than $200 million behind Russia, which has an almost identical level of reserves. The pile-up of foreign exchange reserves is an outcome of the RBI’s strategy of buying dollars when there is a sudden spurt of inflows, which causes volatility in the forex markets. In FY20, the RBI added over $100 billion to the reserves. It has also sold dollars when the rupee came under pressure. In February and March, the central bank had depleted its stockpile by almost $10 billion by selling dollars. Foreign fund buying of shares and debt in India also added to the reserves. According to the data from CDSL, in FY21, net inflows of about $37 billion came in through these routes and while another $400 million net flows were added to it. According to a report by Brickworks Ratings, the exchange rate volatility demands more forex interventions by the RBI. Hence, the accumulation of forex reserves helps the RBI to maintain the exchange rate at a comfortable level. The report points out that doubts over India’s economic recovery led to significant capital outflows in April and May. The RBI’s purchase of dollars also has a corollary impact on rupee liquidity. Every $1 billion that the RBI purchases results in around Rs 7,300 crore of rupee funds being released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/forex-reserves-cross-600bn-for-first-time-on-foreign-flows/articleshow/83444730.cms||---

They have supported us with advertisements worth $15,000 in the first wave too,” said Dr Srikanth, adding that “Facebook has also enabled the alert option for Andhra Pradesh, which allows the health department to send Covid-19 alerts to all Facebook users in Andhra Pradesh.

Talking to media persons in Gopalganj, the minister said the state government has already made provision for confiscating ill-gotten assets of sand smugglers. “A task force has been set up under joint leadership of DM and SP for the purpose,” he added. The minister said the process has already started after preparing the list of people involved in causing huge loss to the state exchequer by illegal sand mining from rivers. According to the minister, FIRs were lodged and vehicles seized during raids on illegal sand ghats in over a dozen districts. Meanwhile, sources said the economic offences wing of the state police has been assigned the task to confiscate the assets of sand smugglers. ADGP (EOU) N H Khan had recently sought information about sand smugglers operating in districts like Rohtas, Aurangabad, Bhojpur, Patna, Saran and Gopalganj. Aurangabad SP Sudhir Kumar Porika said over 60 trucks and 150 tractors engaged in transportation of illegal sand were seized from Barun, Obra and Daudnagar police stations in the district. In adjoining Rohtas district, altogether 820 vehicles have been seized since January this year. Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti said two additional police camps have been set up to check illegal mining in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-properties-of-sand-smugglers-to-be-seized/articleshow/83439723.cms||Ramashankar

The initiative has started bearing fruit in Bhojpur district where the administration has sought the support of religious leaders as well as youngsters. A large number of beneficiaries, including women and girls, from the minority communities are now arriving at the vaccination centres. During a recent meeting with priests, maulanas and pastors, the commissioner of the Ara Municipal Corporation, Vaibhav Shrivastava, requested them to dispel myths, rumours and misinformation regarding the vaccination drive. The religious leaders claimed that they and their family members had been vaccinated and promised that they would disseminate correct information among their respective communities. In a video message, M Hasnain, a religious leader of Ara, said, “The Covid-19 vaccine had no adverse effect on me or other maulanas I know. I, therefore, urge everyone to get themselves inoculated in order to keep others safe amid the pandemic.” Lending support to the vaccination drive, Sanjay Mishra, the main priest of the Aaranya Devi Temple, pointed out, “I received the first dose of the vaccine on April 24 and have not faced any health issues since then. Hence, I advise others to get inoculated as well.” Meanwhile, religious leaders in Saran have also appealed to their followers to come forward for vaccination. As many as 7,532 people received vaccine shots in the district on Thursday. A D Masih, the pastor of Cox Memorial Church, has been encouraging people to get themselves vaccinated as “this is the only way to protect ourselves from the deadly virus”. “A large number of people belonging to the Christian community have already taken both the doses,” he said. Maulana Nisar Ahmed Misbahi from Sahebganj, Mufti Mohammad Waliullah Qudir from Chhapra and Hazi Aftab Alam Khan from Barhampur also busted myths related to vaccination. “It is our responsibility to save ourselves and others by taking vaccine shots, wearing masks and keeping distance,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/religious-leaders-roped-in-for-covid-vaccination-drive/articleshow/83439624.cms||H K Verma

The unscheduled meeting between the two leaders created ripples in political circles. The two, however, tried to play down the meeting, saying nothing much should be read into it. “It was just a courtesy call. Tej Pratap reached my residence just to thank me for the good wishes extended to Laluji on his 74th birth anniversary,” Manjhi told this newspaper after his 40-minute meeting with Tej Pratap. Manjhi said he was very much with the NDA led by CM Nitish Kumar. “I am part of the ruling NDA. The meeting with Tej Pratap revolved around family matters,” the HAM(S) president said. While coming out of Manjhi’s residence, Tej Pratap told media persons that it was just his personal visit. “I had not seen him for long due to Covid pandemic. Hence, I decided to call on him,” he added. Tej Pratap said he takes lessons from senior leaders like Manjhi. “It helps me in shaping my future plans. I am in social life and meeting with seniors is nothing unusual,” he added. Before leaving for Manjhi’s residence, Tej Pratap had said the doors were always open for the former CM if he wished to part ways with the ruling NDA and join hands with Mahagathbandhan. To a query, the former health minister said Lalu’s health condition didn’t allow him to visit Patna. “He is under strict observation of doctors,” he said. The meeting, however, assumed significance in the wake of visit of VIP chief and animal husbandry and fisheries resources minister Mukesh Sahani to Manjhi’s house recently. Both Manjhi’s HAM (S) and Sahani’s VIP have four MLAs in the state legislative assembly. Sahani had endorsed the demand of extension of tenure of elected members of three-tier panchayati raj institutions. “There is something in the mind of Manjhi, which he doesn’t want to reveal it at this point of time. His son is a minister in Nitish Kumar cabinet,” said Pramod Kumar, a political observer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejs-courtesy-call-on-manjhi-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/83438954.cms||Ramashankar

His wife and former CM Rabri Devi, elder daughter Misa Bharti and her children were present on the occasion. A host of leaders, including CM Nitish Kumar, JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha, Union minister Nityanand Rai and HAM(S) president Jitan Ram Manjhi extended birthday greetings to Lalu. "Unhe to bhadhai hum har din dete hain (I extend my greetings to him every day),” CM NItish told reporters. Misa, who is a Rajya Sabha member, shared a picture on her social media platforms showing him cutting a cake at her residence in the presence of Rabri and close relatives. Lalu's both sons -- leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Tej Pratap -- also extended their greetings. Tej planted 74 saplings at his residence on the occasion. The RJD celebrated the occasion as ‘Sadbhavna Diwas’. Posters and banners with large pictures of Lalu were put up at different locations in the state capital. The poor and deprived were fed at Lalu community kitchens. A blood donation camp was organised in the RJD office to mark the occasion. A number of party workers donated blood at the camp, RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said. Lalu is staying in Delhi after granted bail in a fodder scam case. His visit to Patna was deferred due to his poor health and Covid guidelines. He was convicted in a fodder scam case in December 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-celebrates-lalus-74th-bday-as-sadbhavna-diwas/articleshow/83438870.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||Bank of Maharashtra plans to raise Rs 2,000cr via QIP||Mumbai: Bank of Maharashtra has decided to float a Rs 2,000-crore qualified institutional placement (QIP) of equity shares next month. The public sector lender has already received approval from its shareholders for the capital raise last year. Speaking to TOI, A S Rajeev, MD & CEO, Bank of Maharashtra, said that the bank had capital adequacy of 14.5%. Of which, 10.9% is the tier I and capital adequacy is good. “For growth purpose, we require capital as we are envisaging a credit growth of 16-18%. This means that advances will grow by around Rs 25,000 crore for which we require Rs 1,400-1,500-crore capital,” he said. The bank is looking at an issue of Rs 1,000 crore with a greenshoe option to retain an oversubscription of Rs 1,000 crore. “In addition to this we will be raising Rs 1,000 crore through additional tier I and tier II bonds,” said Rajeev. The bank’s stock, which was trading below Rs 11 a year ago, closed at Rs 27 on Friday. The bank has set aside Rs 750-crore Covid provisioning in March 2021 and it would not require additional provisions for stress in business due to the pandemic. The bank used Rs 508 crore of exceptional gain from recovery due to the restructuring of Bhushan Power and Steel to make this provision. “Our provision coverage is 90% and net NPAs are 2.48%, and our operating profit is close to Rs 1,000 crore per quarter, which will provide enough cushion for provisioning,” he added. In May 2021, the bank has seen a 98.5% collection efficiency indicating stress in 1.5% of the portfolio. “These are the loans that have been earmarked for restructuring. We are expecting Rs 1,500 crore of loans to be restructured of which Rs 400-500 crore have already been restructured,” said Rajeev. “Last year, we had recovery of Rs 1,800 crore from bad loans. This year we are expecting a recovery of Rs 3,000 crore of which Rs 500 crore we are expecting from fully written-off accounts, which go directly to the profit,” said Rajeev.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bank-of-maharashtra-plans-to-raise-rs-2000cr-via-qip/articleshow/83445146.cms||Mayur Shetty

In a circular issued to all department heads and nursing heads, the superintendent has said the Covid-19 treatment has been declared free for all by the state government and hence no one should be asked to purchase anything meant for the treatment from outside the hospital. This circular comes in the wake of an audio tape of a nurse leaked to the public which said that there is severe shortage of essential items, including gloves, in the hospital and hence the doctors and nurses are forced to ask the bystanders to purchase them from outside the hospital. The tape had created a big controversy as there were reports that the main Covid hospital in the district was running out of essential items needed for treatment. “Not even a single incident of people or bystanders being asked to purchase things from outside has been reported. Anyone found doing so will face action,” said the circular. Dr Sharmad has asked all department heads to take the stock of the essential items and place purchases order before the existing stock gets over. There should not be any laxity in maintaining the stock, he added. Meanwhile, health minister Veena George intervened in the issue and urged the Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd to provide the essential items to the hospital at the earliest. Based on this, gloves and other items were supplied to the hospital on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cant-ask-people-to-buy-items-from-outside-mch-chief/articleshow/83443741.cms||---

While Andhra Pradesh’s recovery rate stood at 93.99 per cent, 61 fatalities took the Covid-19 toll to 11,824 on Friday. As many as 8,239 new infections emerged from 1,01,863 samples tested in the past 24 hours ending Friday 9 am. The cumulative case load in the state increased to 17,96,122. A total of 11,134 patients recovered from the virus and were discharged from hospitals.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Not hiding deaths, says health department, explains data reconciliation||MUMBAI: After widespread criticism over the addition of thousands of “old” Covid deaths to the overall tally, the state health department on Friday defended itself, saying it is being transparent with data. In a process that started during the second wave since May 17, the state has so far added 13,830 past deaths to its cumulative toll of 1,06,367, including the single-day highest of 2,213 such deaths on Friday. On Thursday, it added 1,522 past deaths. In the 11 days of June, 10,617 ‘old’ deaths have been added to the toll. The state public health department issued a long explanation of how it gathers and “reconciles” data (see graphic) and rejected charges that the state was hiding Covid deaths. “Gathering information about the corona patient pool, their recovery and deaths is a huge exercise. The state’s communicable disease survey system has been working transparently to process this and there is no question of hiding any statistics,” said the statement. Stating that CM Uddhav Thackeray has directed that Covid statistics should be handled in “a very transparent manner”, health officials said at times, there are delays in processing data quickly due to technical difficulties. “However, regular follow-up is done with district and municipal officials to update it,” said one. While cities like Mumbai have an IT support team, most districts ask health staff, including doctors and nurses, to update the numbers on the government’s portal. Due to staff crunch and technical glitches, often a backlog builds and needs to be reconciled. The opposition has accused that a large number of deaths are being added in a staggered manner to ensure the case fatality rate doesn’t report a jump. “Reporting more or fewer Covid deaths is not a question of disrepute or prestige, but should be treated as an important link in the fight against the virus. So we have been repeatedly demanding transparency from the government,” said BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-hiding-deaths-says-health-dept-explains-data-reconciliation/articleshow/83447098.cms||---

The low pressure area is likely to become more marked in the next few days and move west-northwestward across Odisha. According to the India Meteorological Department, thunderstorms and lightning with heavy rainfall will occur over Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. Heavy to heavy rainfall would occur at a few places in north Andhra districts. Thunderstorms with lightning would occur at isolated places over south-coastal AP.

---||Patna||Monsoon to enter Bihar today: Met||PATNA: Southwest monsoon is likely to enter the state on Saturday and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast widespread rainfall in the state till June 15. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said pre-monsoon showers were witnessed across the state in the last 24 hours. The IMD has, in fact, issued an orange alert for Saturday and yellow alert for Sunday and Monday for thunderstorm with lightning along with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in the state. The orange alert issued by IMD stipulates that authorities should be prepared for extreme weather development, while the yellow alert means authorities should remain watchful. The expected showers as well as advancement of southwest monsoon in the region have been attributed to a low pressure area in northwest Bay of Bengal. As per a bulletin issued by IMD on Friday evening, the low pressure area is likely to move west-northwestwards across Odisha, Jharkhand and north-Chhattisgarh during next 3-4 days. The bulletin said an east-west trough was running through south Punjab to the centre of low pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal coasts. The east-west trough is very likely to persist during next 4-5 days. In addition, strong southwesterly winds are prevailing along the west coast. These conditions are likely to persist during next 5-6 days. Accordingly, the IMD has issued warning for thunderstorm with lightning at isolated places in the state on Saturday and heavy rainfall on Sunday and Monday. With regard to southwest monsoon, the IMD stated that it advanced into some more parts of north Arabian Sea and south Gujarat region, south Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal on Friday. “A cyclonic circulation is situated over west Bay of Bengal and it is expected to intensify further. Also, moist easterly winds are blowing over entire Bihar. Both these weather conditions are supporting the movement of monsoon current in the north- west direction. Accordingly, southwest monsoon is likely to enter Bihar through eastern parts of the state in 24 hours,” said Chandan Kumar, an official at Patna Meteorological Centre. If the prediction of weathermen turns true, then it will be one of the earliest onset of monsoon in the state in recent years. Monsoon is making delayed onset in the state in most years at least over the past two decades.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-to-enter-state-today-met/articleshow/83438678.cms||Piyush Tripathi

All those above 60 have taken both. Instructions have been given by the RKM headquarters to all its centres in Bengal to complete vaccination for monks and others who live on the different campuses by June 15, to coincide with the outer limit of the present restrictions. All 280 monks and brahmacharis of Iskcon Kolkata have also received their first jabs. On the Mayapur campus, the headquarters of the Iskcon order, 300 monks and brahmacharis have received their first jabs at two camps that were held on campus. The rest will receive their shots before June 15, it was said. The Kalighat Temple Committee, too, has made it mandatory for all priests, sevayats and workers who enter the temple daily for pujas and other work, to get vaccinated while Dakshnineswar Temple authorities are in talks with a hospital so that vaccination for priests and sevayats can be done by June 15. Dakshineswar Kali Temple trustee Kushal Chowdhury said negotiations have been carried out with the hospital that the temple has a tie-up with. “All our monks, brahmacharis and other inmates have been vaccinated. We have asked our other centres to complete the process soon. We have to spread the message of vaccination since this is the only way forward. The last camp was held on Sunday,” said Swami Suvirananda, general secretary of the RKM. In some other centres of RKM, too, like Mayer Bari at Bagbazar and Swami Vivekananda’s house on Vivekananda Road, all monks and inmates have been vaccinated. “Some have received the first jab while others have got both,” said Swami Jnanalokananda, secretary of Swamiji’s house. “We have ensured that all 80 monks and 200 sevayats of Iskcon Kolkata have received at least one dose. They will receive the second jab on time too. Though the temple is closed to the public at present, we have to continue with our puja and other activities inside. So we cannot afford to infect each other,” said Radharaman Das, Iskcon Kolkata vice-president. “In two camps at Mayapur, 300 monks and brahmacharis were vaccinated. Very few are left now and the process will be completed by June 15,” said Subrata Das, spokesperson of Iskcon Mayapur. Bidyut Haldar, vice-president of the Kalighat Temple Committee, said he had given instructions that no one would be allowed inside the temple even for essential work if they do not get vaccinated. “I can only talk about the priests and the sevayats, not the pandas who are not an immediate part of our system. For the second jab, I am trying to book slots with the KMC. Even this will be done on time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-priests-workers-in-temples-get-first-jab/articleshow/83443624.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

He visited the Mithapur area and reviewed a presentation on ‘Proposed facilities in Mithapur institution campus’ made by Bihar State Educational Infrastructure Development Corporation (BSEIDC) managing director Sanjay Kumar Singh at the administrative building of Aryabhatta Knowledge University located there. Being developed as Bihar’s first-ever education hub, the Mithapur institution campus is proposed to accommodate more than six premier universities/ institutions. Hailing the concept of Mithapur pond project inside the campus, Nitish asked the officials to build a common link road so that people from all proposed institutions could easily reach up to the pond. “Also plant maximum saplings around the pond,” he told the officials accompanying him. Nitish further asked Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh to shift the operation of all buses from the Mithapur bus stand to the new Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT). Sources said the Mithapur bus stand land has been allotted to Patliputra University for its new administrative campus. The district administration has already decided to shift the Mithapur bus stand to the ISBT by July 15. The CM also ordered for shifting of the power sub-station located near the Mithapur institution campus to some other appropriate location. Accompanied by deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad and chief secretary Tripurari Sharan among others, the CM earlier in the morning visited Mithapur area to have ground inspection of the campus and the redevelopment plan of Patna Junction under the Patna Smart City project. He also went to the Covid-19 vaccination centre on the AKU campus and inquired about the facilities. Urban development and housing department (UDHD) principal secretary Anand Kishor made a presentation on ‘Development of Mithapur area’ before the CM, who discussed the proposed subway to Patna Junction via multi-level parking. Later, Nitish told mediapersons that there was a proposal to build a multistorey building in the vacant place near Patna Junction to provide necessary convenience to the people coming to the railway station. The CM also said that he had asked the officials to make arrangements of food etc on the top floor of the existing multi-level parking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-construct-boundary-wall-around-mithapur-education-hub/articleshow/83439380.cms||---

Besides, the number of government and private universities, as well as institutions of national importance has also increased during the same period, he added. Jha made the observations with regard to Bihar’s achievements in higher education on the basis of the all-India survey on higher education (AISHE) conducted by the Centre for 2019-20. As to the postgraduate courses, the state had 1.20 lakh students enrolled, of whom 61,287 were boys and 59,654 girls, narrowing the gap over the last five years from 2014-15, Jha added. He said it was the result of various schemes that CM Nitish Kumar launched to promote girls’ education and also reduce the dropout rates among them. The schemes included provision of cycles and uniform, as well as the money for girl students who clear intermediate and graduate examinations successfully. Similarly, the number of government and private universities increased from 22 in 2015-16 to 35 in 2019-20. The state had two central universities and three institutions of national importance (like IIT, IIM, NIFT, etc) in 2015-16, but their number increased to four and five, respectively, by 2019-20. The state had 863 recognised colleges in 2019-20. They included 55 colleges for engineering and technology, 15 for medical studies and five for nursing studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/spectacular-achievements-in-higher-education-min/articleshow/83438805.cms||Abhay Singh

He said the Nitish Kumar-led state government was doing “injustice” to the beneficiaries of the quota policy under the influence of the saffron party. In a statement released on Friday, Tejashwi slammed Jaiswal over his critical observations made early this week after the announcement of the results of the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) examinations. Dr Jaiswal had even described Tejashwi as “ninth pass leader”. Tejashwi had questioned the policy to keep some of the candidates of the reserved category within the quota, even as the marks fetched by them was higher than, or at par with, the general category candidates, implying that 50% seats meant for the general category should have also gone to the candidates of the reserved category with the cut off marks higher than the general category. On Friday, Tejashwi said Jaiswal had a “dull-minded understanding of the reservation policy”. “The issue in hand was the ‘sanghi’ conspiracy to deliberately keep the meritorious students of the reserved category within their reserved quota. But Jaiswal read and interpreted it as some having problems with the reserved category students fetching good marks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-slams-bjp-over-quota-policy/articleshow/83439049.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Allahabad||Study debunks ‘UK theory’ that Covid risk higher in S Asians than Europeans||VARANASI/PRAYAGRAJ: An international team of scientists has contradicted the findings of a study carried out by the Max Planck Institute, Germany on a group of people comprising natives and Bangladeshi migrants in the United Kingdom (UK), suggesting that infection and susceptibility rate risk in Covid-19 pandemic is 50% in terms of South Asians as compared to only 16% in Europeans. The genetic variants responsible for Covid-19 severity among Europeans may not play a role in Covid-19 susceptibility among South Asians, the team concluded. To debunk the claim, the international team analysed the role of the DNA segment mentioned in the Max Planck Institute study and found that the ‘UK theory’ does not stand ground when the data in India and Bangladesh is analysed in three different time frames of year 2020. The Max Planck Institute scientists studied variations in a specific DNA segment in the UK group and found that modern humans inherited this DNA from Neanderthals and is strongly associated with severe Covid-19 infection and hospitalisation. They then suggested that the genome, responsible for severe infection of Covid-19, is present in 50% of South Asians and just 16% Europeans. The recent study conducted by a team of scientists from Switzerland, India and Bangladesh has concluded that the genetic variants responsible for Covid-19 severity among Europeans in fact may not play a role in Covid-19 susceptibility among South Asians. This finding has been published in the journal ‘Scientific Reports’, published by Nature, US. The team was led by director, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics & chief scientist, CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad Kumarasamy Thangaraj and Prof Gyaneshwer Chaubey of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi. “In this study, we have compared infection and case fatality rates with South Asian genomic data over three different timelines during the pandemic. We have especially looked into a large number of populations from India and Bangladesh,” said Thangaraj. “Our result reiterates the unique genetic origin of South Asian populations and we suggest a dedicated genome-wide association study on South Asian Covid-19 patients is the need of the hour in the Asian sub-continent,” said Prajjval Pratap Singh, first author of this study. “Due to the long-term and complex genomic history of South Asia, it is likely that we’ll always experience a variable degree of susceptibility for a disease. This study is consistent with our previous work on ACE2 gene which showed a strong genetic correlation with cases and case fatality rate in India in comparison to presence of ACE2 gene in Indian population,” said Prof Chaubey. The study also suggests that the genetic variants correlated with Covid-19 outcomes differ significantly among caste and tribal populations of Bangladesh. “Scientists working in the area of population studies should be more cautious to interpret their findings by differentiating caste and tribal populations, more explicitly so in the Bangladeshi population,” said Prof George van Driem of the University of Bern, Switzerland, a renowned linguist and co-author of the study. The study also suggests that the genetic variants correlated with Covid-19 outcomes differ significantly among caste and tribal populations of Bangladesh. “Scientists working in the area of population studies should be more cautious to interpret their findings by differentiating caste and tribal populations, more explicitly so in the Bangladeshi population. Apart from host genomics we should also focus on which variants are likely to escape the host defence of those already vaccinated,” said the director of the Institute of Science, BHU, Prof. Anil K Tripathi. “Apart from host genomics we should also focus on which variants are likely to escape the host defence of those already vaccinated,” said Prof Tripathi. Other participants of this study are Anshika Srivastava and Nargis Khanam from BHU, Varanasi; Dr Abhishek Pathak and Prof Royana Singh, Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU; Dr Gazi Sultana from Dhaka University, Bangladesh; Dr Pankaj Shrivastava, Forensic Science Laboratory, Sagar, MP; and Dr Prashanth Suravanjhala, Birla Institute of Scientific Research, Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/study-debunks-uk-theory-that-covid-risk-higher-in-s-asians-than-europeans/articleshow/83442426.cms||Binay Singh

Speaking to the media on Friday, Singhal said that about 625 hospitals served the Covid-19 patients during the peak stage about a month ago. “Even at the existing 454 Covid-19 designated treating facilities, about 13,500 oxygen and ICU beds combined are lying vacant. The number of unoccupied oxygen beds is more than that of occupied ones,” said Singhal. Singhal said that the health department has so far vaccinated about 1.28 lakh people, who fall under the category of young mothers having children who are less than five years old and foreign education/employment aspirants, in the last three to four days. “Of the 96,100 active Covid-19 cases as of Friday, nearly 71,200 patients availed of home isolation facility. As many as 15,951 are receiving treatment at various hospitals spread across the state. The admissions into Covid care centres are dipping with each passing day,” said Singhal. The principal secretary also added that the daily oxygen consumption has dropped to 370-380 metric tonnes from the peak 650 MT a few weeks ago. “Despite the Union government’s daily allocation of 590 MT to Andhra Pradesh, we are currently drawing only 420 tonnes,” said Singhal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cases-dip-170-covid-hospitals-denotified/articleshow/83442370.cms||---

An FIR was lodged with Warisaliganj police station two days back. The two cases within a fortnight has badly impacted the bank. All the 12 DBGB regional offices are on alert and asking customers to get their passbooks updated and report even a minute problem to the senior authorities. The fraud in Asha Parari branch of the bank in Buxar surfaced on May 31 after which an FIR was registered with Simri police station on June 3. Later, branch manager Dr Ravi Shankar Kumar was arrested from Patna on June 6. In Nawada case, managers Madhulika Rani and Yogesh Kumar besides cashier Vishal Kumar have been made accused. No one has been arrested yet. Bank sources said the trio have been suspended. “It was during a routine inspection that the fraud was detected. Money in two fixed deposits was found transferred into separate bank accounts,” a police officer privy to the investigation said. He said a thorough internal inquiry was conducted thereafter and several fixed deposits had been found diluted prematurely or after maturity and the money transferred to other accounts. “Preliminary inquiry revealed that the money was later rerouted to bank accounts of the accused staff,” he said. He said the bank vigilance authorities found that user IDs of the two accused managers and the cashier were used in fraudulently diluting the fixed deposits and transacting the money. DBGB general manager (inspection and audit) Achintya Kumar Ganguli on Friday said the inquiry was still on in the Asha Parari branch case. “Details about Warisaliganj fraud could be shared by Nawada regional manager,” he said. However, Nawada RM could not be contacted over the phone as he was on leave after his mother’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/after-buxar-rs-92-lakh-fraud-detected-in-nawada-bank/articleshow/83439675.cms||Debashish Karmakar

IT/ITES offices have been directed to work with only 20% workforce or with a maximum of 10 employees. Housing finance companies, non-banking financial companies and all insurance corporations are allowed to function with 33% workforce. Stalin said all shops permitted to operate should adhere to standard operating procedures. Hand sanitizer with dispenser should be kept mandatory, besides thermal screening equipment to check temperature. The managements should ensure that the staff and customers wear masks compulsorily. “All shops should function with no air-conditioning and not let in many people to maintain social distancing norms. Marks should be drawn for people to maintain physical distance when they queue up before shops,” the CM said. The state government also extended certain relaxations in the 11 districts where case load is still high. Export units and vendor units can operate there with 25% workforce, following standard operating procedures. Private security services, agencies for maintenance and upkeep of office, and housekeeping in residential complexes are permitted with e-registration. Passengers with e-registration will be permitted in rental vehicles, taxis and autos. Taxis will be permitted with three passengers and autorickshaws with two passengers. Self-employed electricians, plumbers, motor mechanics and carpenters can work between 6 am and 5 pm with e-registration. But shops in these categories will not be permitted to open.

Hand sanitizer with dispenser should be kept mandatory, besides thermal screening equipment to check temperature. The managements should ensure that the staff and customers wear masks compulsorily. “All shops should function with no air-conditioning and not let in many people to maintain social distancing norms. Marks should be drawn for people to maintain physical distance when they queue up before shops,” the CM said.

Self-employed electricians, plumbers, motor mechanics and carpenters can work between 6 am and 5 pm with e-registration. But shops in these categories will not be permitted to open. Cycle and two-wheeler repair shops, those selling agriculture equipment, pump set repair shops, optical shops and service centres shall operate from 9 am to 2 pm. Pottery and handicraft shops can function from 6 am to 5 pm. Meanwhile, condemning the state’s decision to open the Tasmac outlets, AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran urged the government to rollback the decision immediately since the outlets could become a possible Covid-19 spreader. In a series of tweets, hours after the government’s announcement, Dhinakaran said the move was against the state’s intention to save the people from the pandemic. “It is worse that the government like the previous regime does not care about the lives of the people but seeks to fill the treasury,” he said. Dhinakaran accused the government of offering Covid relief on one hand and snatching it through the Tasmac outlets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lockdown-extended-by-a-week-tasmac-salons-to-open-in-city/articleshow/83450998.cms||---

Elections are due in UP in February 2022. AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Owaisi has already joined hands with former minister Om Prakash Rajbhar-led Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) comprising nine smaller parties. However, after suffering a setback in rural local panchayat polls, even the BJP is trying to woo back Rajbhar-led Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) into the saffron partyled alliance ahead of 2022 polls, sources said. The SBSP and smaller parties have formed a morcha of nine smaller parties, including the AIMIM, and are trying to rope in other OBC, Dalit and minority leaders-led parties. Rajbhar was part of the BJP government and served as a minister in the state cabinet but came out of it following differences. AIMIM UP state president Shaukath Ali told TOI that the party has appointed presidents to all its 75 district units in UP and is working hard to strengthen its base ahead of the assembly polls. “We are working hard and would like to contest in at least 100 constituencies. But, a final decision would be taken by our party national president Owaisi,” he said. The AIMIM had drawn a blank in 2017 assembly polls though it entered the fray in 36 seats. Owaisi-led party, however, won 24 seats in zilla panchayats in the recently concluded rural local body elections. Political analysts said the BJP may have suffered losses in the panchayat elections but the party is not down and out. The AIMIM will divide the Muslim vote which will benefit the BJP, an analyst said. Unless the morcha of nine smaller parties manage to get the support of either the Samajwadi Party or Bahujan Samaj Party into an alliance, it would be difficult to beat the BJP in UP, a political analyst said. “They may end up helping the saffron party due to division of Muslim, Yadav and Dalit votes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/owaisi-led-mim-likely-to-field-candidates-in-100-up-seats/articleshow/83445498.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||Private hospitals upset over Goa government’s showcause notices||PANAJI: Private hospitals are upset as the government’s action of seeking an explanation from them over the delay in reporting Covid-19 deaths has shown them in a bad light even as they joined hands with the government in fighting the deadly second wave. A health official said, “They (private hospitals) ought to report not just Covid-19 deaths but the diseases that have been made notifiable under the Goa Public Health Act. The hospitals that have been served with notices should give their response within the stipulated period.” Since Monday, the directorate of health services (DHS) has added deaths reported late by private hospitals to the cumulative tally and has also issued them notices to explain the delay. In a statement, state president of the Association of Private Nursing Homes (APNH), Dr Milind Colwalkar said they are disappointed by the unnecessary criticism of private hospitals. “We have asked individual hospitals to respond appropriately to the showcause notices, but as APHN, we feel that this is a diversionary tactic to paint all private hospitals in a bad light.” The health official said they have gone by the rules in seeking an explanation, as all private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients ought to report Covid deaths and cases to DHS in time. The APHN president said if there was any attempt to hide the deaths, it will come out after the government inquiry, but as far as they are concerned, the error is only administrative. “There is nothing to be gained by the hospitals by not reporting the deaths. An error, if any, is of delay and we believe it is administrative rather than deliberate,” Colwalkar said. He added that the Covid treatment was thrust upon them (private hospitals) even as they were short-staffed and did not have the required infrastructure. “Suddenly, the hospitals had to make a huge investment to upgrade their infrastructure and recruit more staff and they did their best under the circumstances. Their efforts have certainly helped to bring down the mortality rate in the second wave,” Colwalkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/private-hospitals-upset-over-govts-showcause-notices/articleshow/83445671.cms||---

The BMC, meanwhile, started demolishing an adjoining ground-plus-three structure that had got damaged in the incident. “The structure was found to be dangerously tilting and therefore demolition is being carried out,” said a civic official, adding that residents were allowed to first collect their belongings. Shoheb Shaikh, a local, said: “With no alternative accommodation available, these residents have nowhere to go. And to make matters worse, monsoon has arrived.” The construction contractor, Ramzan Shaikh, who was arrested on Thursday, was produced before a magistrate’s court and remanded in police custody till June 16. Police have so far refrained from arresting the owner of the building, Rafiq Siddiqui, who lost nine family members in the crash. Police have learnt that Siddiqui's neighbours had alerted him about a large crack forming in his building after cyclone Taukte passed close to the city’s coastline on May 17. P-North ward corporator Vinod Mishra said Wednesday’s incident should not be called a building crash. “This is slum with several illegal constructions growing vertically. The BMC should have acted against them long back instead of waiting for such an incident to happen.” Officials said a survey will be carried out to identify dangerous structures in the area and demolish them in a joint operation with BMC and collector’s office officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/conduct-audit-of-malwani-structures-mumbai-police-to-pwd/articleshow/83445612.cms||---

Since the latest round of data reconciliation process began on May 17, the state has added 13,830 ‘old’ deaths to the tally. The daily deaths reported in the state rose slightly to 406 from 393 on Thursday, but new cases dropped to 11,766, The total caseload is now 58.9 lakh, while the total toll climbed to 1,06,367 from 95,344 on May 31. A senior doctor from the health department said the reconciliation is a standard process that needs to be done in many states and other countries as well. “Maharashtra’s case fatality rate is still low at 1.7% and that’s reassuring,” he said. In Mumbai, 721 cases were detected and 24 deaths registered on Friday, taking the overall tally to 7.1 lakh and toll to 15,079 since March 2020. The city’s positivity rate continued below 3% (2.7%). Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid task force, said instead of focusing on the number of deaths, “we should concentrate on death audit and identify the causes of deaths so that we can prevent any more deaths”. The second wave affected more than double the number of people compared to the first wave, and so deaths have been high. CM Uddhav Thackeray spoke to village heads from Marathwada and Vidarbha and asked them to ensure their villages remain Covid-free. He suggested that awareness regarding vaccination and other Covid protocols is done in local languages and through other traditional methods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-fris-record-2213-past-deaths-take-total-to-13830-in-25-days/articleshow/83447118.cms||Malathy Iyer

In ordering AIIMS to postpone the Institute of National Importance Common Entrance Test (INI-CET), a bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and M R Shah cited Monday’s announcement by the PMO about four-month postponement of NEET-PG examination for admissions to PG courses in government medical colleges. It was done to boost availability of medical personnel for fighting the pandemic. The bench said if the government thought it fit to postpone NEET-PG examination by four months, the decision of AIIMS to hold INI-CET on June 18 appeared arbitrary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/postpone-ini-cet-by-30-days-at-least-sc-tells-aiims/articleshow/83449980.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

While assaulting the girl, they shot two videos of their act. The videos have gone viral. The videos purportedly show the men trying to remove the girl’s clothes while hurling abuses even as the young couple keep entreating them to let them go. One of the men is heard saying that they will share the video on social media while the couple keep begging for mercy, asking them to delete the videos. This is the third such case reported in Bareilly zone where a girl has been assaulted for being in the company of a male friend or fiancé. The videos came to the attention of the police on Thursday. They managed to trace the girl to a village under the jurisdiction of Bhojpur police station. On learning about the assault, the girl’s father agreed to lodge a complaint. On the basis of a complaint, an FIR has been registered against the two men, who were identified during the investigation. Moradabad police has formed multiple teams to nab the duo. Vidyasagar Mishra, SP (rural), said, “We have booked the accused under IPC sections 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and provisions of the Pocso Act and IT Act. The girl’s statement has been recorded and her medical examination was also completed. The accused have been identified as Saeed and Arshad Ali and they will soon be behind bars.” A source said the two men had been captured and would be produced before a magistrate on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/two-men-sexually-assault-minor-girl-for-being-with-boyfriend-in-moradabad-make-video/articleshow/83460188.cms||---

CID narrated an instance of alleged stage-managing of the auction purchase of one of its assets in Mahbubnagar district. “They are using their benamis to purchase the seized assets through elements set up by them,” said CID SP Thota Srinivas Rao. He cited the recent instance of a former police constable participating in the auction of Agrigold assets and purchasing 156 acres of land at Midgil village in Mahbubnagar district at a price of ₹15 crore. The SP narrated the effort they made by verifying the financial status and past taxes paid by the constable. “We prima facie came to a conclusion that he was acting in collusion with, and at the behest of the errant management of the company,” Rao said. It was the company that arranged the money to regain its seized assets, the SP said. He filed this affidavit before a bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Amarnath Goud that was hearing AgriGold cases. One among them is a petition filed by B Narender Reddy, the former constable, who was urging the court to deliver possession of the land to him since he bought it in an open auction. CID was opposing this apprehending that this might be a benami deal organised by the management. Andhra Pradesh too has expressed its doubts over the auction purchase of a shopping complex belonging to the Agrigold company by a single bidder. The bench at one stage said it may not be able to monitor these things for a long time. AP advocate general S Sriram assured the court that both AP and Telangana states will move in jointly to resolve the issue once and for all. The case was adjourned to June 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/agrigold-still-trying-to-dupe-people-cid-tells-high-court/articleshow/83445604.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The meeting was presided over by AB Gyaneshwar, president of Boudha Bhikshu Sangh. Boudha bhikshus of Kushinagar, Varanasi, Sarnath, Sonouli and Sankisha attended the meeting. The bhikshus unanimously decided to demand land in Ayodhya from the government. Gyaneshwar said, “Because of the Bhoudh stupa at Ayodhya, the name of the city would become popular, especially among Buddhist countries, and will promote tourism. Besides, the ties between India and Buddhist countries will also be strengthened. We don’t want any dispute as we want only peace to prevail.” The impact of Covid pandemic on Boudha Vihar was also discussed and it was decided that after getting permission from the Archaeological Survey of India, the reclining statue of Buddha at Mahaparinirvana temple in Kushinagar will be polished with gold.

He has also posed a series of questions regarding the design of the project seeking answers from the authorities concerned. Prof Choudhary was also appointed as the expert member in Gomati riverfront committee and has 35 years’ experience in teaching river engineering to MTech students of Civil Engineering in IIT-BHU. He said that a mobile boundary canal of 45m top width and 32m bottom width and depth of 65 m and length more than 5 kilometre cannot bear the momentum and turbulence of flood water on the sand-bed of the Ganga on the opposite side of Varanasi. This canal on no scientific principles can be stable and will reduce down the depth of water in the Ganga. Further, the reduction in depth during the monsoon will cause the reduction in velocity which will ultimately cause the heavy siltation on the ghat-sides. Thus, the Ganga will leave the ghats,” he has opined. He said that the spur constructed on the Lalita-Ghat will deflect the flow from the ghats and will cause the reduction in depth and velocity of water. This will also cause sedimentation on the ghat. “Thus, the spur and the canal may change the crescent shape of the Ganga in Varanasi. Also, just as sedimentation took place at Assi Ghat and the Ganga left the ghat forever, similar may be the case for ghats up to Dashashwamedh,” said Choudhary. He added, “The river is a living body system. The anatomy, morphology and dynamics of the system must be known then only it should be handled”. How the UP irrigation department and experts associated with the project decided to design the canal on the sand bed of the Ganga? They need to answer certain questions, he said and wanted to know how the discharge in the canal on the sand bed was calculated, how the cross-section was decided and also how the slope was fixed. “As the bed is permeable with different sands, how seepage rate was calculated. As the canal falls in high flood-zone, how the stability of the canal has been decided,” he added. He further asked which hydrodynamic formula has been used in it, the top of the canal will be how much below the highest flood level, what will the impact of the canal on the sedimentation on the ghat-side, whether the canal will remain in flowing condition during dry weather period, if the canal will be non-silting non scouring type, if it is not so, in how much period it will be filled, what is the present cost of the canal and what will be its maintenance, who has designed the spur, and fixed the depth, width and the length of the spur, how the angle of the spur was decided, and what will be the impact of the spur in the downstream. However, irrigation department’s executive engineer Pankaj Verma clarified that this multipurpose project will reduce the velocity of the river water to avoid pressure on ghats due to which threat of erosion under their steps and historical buildings was increasing. “While creating a new canal it has been ensured that the actual stream is not shifting from ghats. Sixty percent river water will pass through the old stream on the left bank while the new canal on the right bank will have 40% water. The average depth of the river on the ghat side is 10m while the depth of the new canal is 7-8m. The cargo vessels on the National Waterway-I will also pass through the new canal. The project is being implemented at the cost of Rs. 11.95 crore,” he told TOI on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/river-scientist-questions-building-spur-canal-in-ganga-in-varanasi/articleshow/83443916.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||June 21-23 T’s tryst with waning of cases||Hyderabad: Here is some good news after facing months of pandemic’s second wave devastation. Health experts are hinting at total waning of Covid-19 positive cases in Telangana by June end. The experts also said that the current trend of positivity rate is indicating a clear pattern of waning of cases, which is likely to happen more or less at the same time predicted. The experts deduced their predictions based on two mathematical models. While the current daily caseload has dropped to 1,600-1,700 cases, the overall infection rate is also dipping. As per the parameters, Telangana should report around 500 cases daily to arrive at a stable trend or any further dip in the cases will indicate total waning of the virus. According to professor Dr D Narayana Rao, pro vice-chancellor, SRM University, Amaravati, waning of the cases can be defined as the date on which the number of Covid-19 cases has reduced to 5 per cent of the peak number of the cases during the second wave. “We are predicting that the total waning of the second wave in Telangana will happen on June 21. We have to factor in an additional three days before or after the original predicted date. But, looking at the current number of positive cases, the second wave will be waning around the same time (June 21),” he told TOI. For the predictions, the susceptible, infected and recovered (SIR) model was used by the SRM University experts based on the list of official number of Covid-19 cases released by the Telangana government. It may be recalled Telangana had reported the highest number of positive cases (10,122) in a single day this year on April 27. This was not only the highest cases recorded in the second wave, but also through the first wave and second wave of the pandemic. A team of IIT professors from Kanpur and Hyderabad, who worked out a mathematical model for the Centre based on susceptible, undetected, tested (positive) and removed approach (SUTRA) model, forecast waning of Covdi-19 cases in the state by June 23. Interestingly, the SUTRA model predicted this date for Telangana even before the second wave of cases actually began rising. Subodh Kandamuthan, professor and director of Centre for Health Care Management at Administrative Staff College of India, said that a significant factor in the second wave is that of positivie cases in Hyderabad coming under control quickly when compared to the first wave. “The biggest relief this time is that despite the daily testing of cases going above one lakh, the positivity rate has come down below 2 per cent. This clearly shows that the infection spread is very much under control. Covid-19 surveillance has helped break the infection chain successfully,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/june-21-23-ts-tryst-with-waning-of-cases/articleshow/83445714.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Allahabad||Uttar Pradesh: Now, postmen will update mobile no. on your Aadhaar card right at your doorstep||PRAYAGRAJ: In a major initiative that will particularly benefit rural residents, the postal department has decided to rope in a strong team of postmen to update the mobile number of residents or link the same with their Aadhaar cards. Now, the postman will be able to do this right at the doorstep of residents who had to stand in long queues at banks and Aadhaar correction centres for the same earlier. India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) has started rolling out this facility in all the branch post offices of Allahabad division of Indian Post from this month, informed senior superintendent of post (SSP), Sanjay D Akhade. The mobile updation service will be provided through the IPPB branch and more than 350 Grameen Dak Sevaks across Prayagraj and Kausambhi districts. This new service will especially benefit residents of villages whose Aadhaar cards often lack mobile numbers linked to them, and it’s a struggle for them to get details updated on the cards or procure a duplicate card in case of losing the original. As part of Child Enrolment Lite Client (CELC) services, IPPB offers Aadhaar services through banking service providers via mobile handsets in post offices and at doorsteps of clients. Developed by Unique Identification Authority of India, CELC service enables citizens to add/update mobile number with Aadhaar. It also helps in enrolling children below 5 years for issuance of their Aadhaar cards. Currently, IPPB is providing only mobile updation services for customers. It would roll out the facility of enrolling children below 5 years later, informed the SSP. Speaking on the initiative, Akhade told TOI, “Through Aadhaar, the government has been able to reach out to crores of people and facilitate delivery of direct benefit transfer under various schemes such as LPG-Pahal, MGNREGS etc into their bank accounts. Mobile updation is another significant customer-centric initiative from IPPB that will help the financially disadvantaged citizens in underbanked and unbanked areas of the districts. Now citizens will be able to access this important service through the strong and robust network of our banking service providers and post offices in the district.” IPPB has been established under the Department of Posts, Ministry of Communication with 100% equity owned by Government of India. It was launched by PM Narendra Modi on September 1, 2018. The fundamental mandate of IPPB is to remove barriers for the unbanked and underbanked, and reach the last mile leveraging a network comprising 1,55,000 post offices (1,35,000 in rural areas) and 300,000 postal employees across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-postmen-will-update-mobile-no-on-your-aadhaar-card-right-at-your-doorstep/articleshow/83442340.cms||---

The move is likely to affect 2-2.5 lakh students studying in various colleges affiliated to the university and will get the benefit of mass promotions this year. As a result, the university will be able to collect Rs 2-2.5 crore from the registration fees, said sources. Only those students who pay the registration fee will be eligible for mass promotion, sources added. “Last year, many repeater students or those who did not wish to take the exams were covered by mass promotions,” said Naveen Sheth, the vice-chancellor of GTU. “We wanted to avoid a similar situation this year and hence this decision was taken. We have not collected exam fees for the past two years due to Covid-19.” The Gujarat government had earlier this year decided to cancel university exams and grant merit-based progression to over 9.5 lakh students in second, fourth, and sixth semesters. The move does not cover medical and paramedical programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mass-promotion-gtu-to-take-rs-100/articleshow/83445706.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Cotton prices touch decadal high in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Riding on strong demand from domestic spinning mills, cotton prices have firmed up to reach a decadal high level. The demand from the international market has further supported the local prices of the natural fibre. The prices of Shankar-6 cotton, a benchmark variety grown widely in Gujarat, surged from Rs 50,500 to Rs 51,000 per candy (one candy is equivalent to 356 kg) in local market. These price levels are the highest in past 10 years, said cotton market stakeholders. “Increased buying from domestic cotton mills and demand from export market have pushed up cotton prices. Spinning mills are getting good margins following a robust demand for cotton yarn,” said Arun Dalal, a city-based cotton broker. According to a trader from Rajkot, cotton prices have jumped by Rs 4,000 a candy over the past two months and are unlikely to decline at the moment. Stating that domestic spinning mills are doing good business and they require good quality cotton, Nirav Patel, a cotton exporter and a spinning mill owner, said, “Given the strong demand for yarn, especially from the domestic market, the spinning mills can even afford to procure cotton at prices higher than the current levels. There is also a good demand for yarn from Bangladesh as well. With reduced cotton crop in Pakistan and Africa, the Indian cotton has been in demand in the international market through the current cotton season as Indian cotton prices remained largely below the international prices. “In fact, the recent surge brought Indian cotton prices at par with the international prices,” said an exporter. The export of cotton is expected to reach about 70 lakh bales in 2020-21 season as compared to 50 lakh bales shipped in the previous season, said exporters. With the current cotton season nearing its end, there is a limited stock available in the market. This along with a decline in arrivals of cotton in local mandis has further supported the cotton prices. According to the Cotton Association of India (CAI), Gujarat’s cotton output is estimated to be about 97 lakh bales in 2020-21 season, up from 95 lakh bales in the previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cotton-prices-touch-decadal-high/articleshow/83445663.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Kochi||Bio-weapon remark: Lakshadweep filmmaker Aisha Sultana faces sedition charges||KOCHI: Lakshadweep-based activist and filmmaker, Aisha Sultana, who was booked by Kavaratti police for making a comment that ‘a bio-weapon’ was used against the islands, said through an FB post that she would continue to fight for her land. She had made the controversial comment during a TV debate while talking about the change in the Covid standard operating procedure in the islands which had zero cases and the subsequent spurt in cases. The FIR was registered against her under Section 124 A (Sedition) and 153 B (Imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration). The activist had later clarified that she compared the administrator Praful Khoda Patel with bio-weapon and not the government or the country. “Only truth will prevail. The BJP leader who gave the complaint was a Lakshadweep native. When he is betraying the land he was born in, I would continue my fight for it. What those who betray us have and what we lack is fear. I raised my voice for my land and I wouldn’t go weak due to such attempts. My voice will be louder from now on,” Sultana wrote on her FB page on Friday. She had posted on Facebook on Tuesday that there was a campaign against her, trying to picture her as anti-national. “Everyone who has seen the debate would know that I used that word to denote Praful Patel. I felt that Praful Patel and his policies were like a weapon…I compared Praful Patel with bio-weapon not the country and government,” Sultana had posted on Tuesday. Kavaratti police registered the case based on a complaint by C Abdul Kader Haji, state president of the BJP, Lakshadweep. “Aisha Sultana, film director hailing from Chetlat island of Lakshadweep has seriously alleged in the channel discussion that the central government have used biological weapon against the people of Lakshadweep for spreading Covid-19. We, the state BJP, Lakshadweep, strongly protest against this anti-national act, which tarnished the patriotic image of the central government and the people of Lakshadweep,” the complaint read. The FIR reads that the investigating officer checked the video of the discussion on YouTube and found that she said that ‘The Centre has clearly used bio-weapon’. “….and the journalist who was leading the debate interfered and asked Aisha as a warning that what is the information that she has with which she can make a serious allegation that the government used bio weapon against its own citizens... She further said that how can you say there is no basis or evidence, the administrator has used a bio-weapon itself,” the FIR states. The FIR further states that the accused generated hatred and opposition towards the central government by falsely and with ulterior motives stating that the central government deployed coronavirus bio-weapon against the people of Lakshadweep. Meanwhile, a resignation letter surfaced on Friday in which at least 12 members of BJP from Chetlat island tendered their resignation from the primary membership of the party in protest against complaint filed by Haji against Aisha Sultana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/aisha-sultana-faces-sedition-charges/articleshow/83443914.cms||---

According to police, Ajay Singh with his two aides, Abhishek and Anchal, were about to loot the house of a local timber merchant when a team of cops reached the spot and asked them to surrender. It was 2.30am. The gang had parked their van outside. The house was locked and empty. The cops on patrol had earlier found the same van on another deserted stretch and became suspicious. Sensing a robbery, the cops moved in. They found Singh inside and asked him to lay down his weapons. Police claimed that Singh responded by shooting at them and then jumped over to a neighbouring house. The cops followed him. Fearing that police may shoot back at him, he "killed himself" on the terrace. According to police, Anchal managed to flee in the van. Abhishek was caught. Soon, Faridpur SHO Surendra Singh sent in reinforcements. Anchal was picked up and Singh's two aides are now in police custody. Two FIRs have been registered against the deceased robber and his two aides under sections of robbery and Arms Act. Singh's family, however, alleged that he was shot by cops. No official complaint has been lodged from their side as yet. On Friday, Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “Ajay Singh, a history-sheeter, shot himself with his country-made pistol after he was surrounded by police and couldn't escape. The team found him dead on the terrace of a house." "Circumstantial evidence suggested that he shot himself with his pistol. Later, we took the opinion of our field unit who conducted a 'gunshot residue' analysis through a ballistic kit. It confirmed that the pistol was in his hand when the bullet was fired,” the SSP added. Additional SP (Rural) Rajkumar Agarwal told TOI, “Ajay Singh had multiple cases of robbery and dacoity registered against him in Bareilly. There is a possibility that he took the step under the fear of an encounter. He had taken shots at the police team earlier and so more force was called in to catch him."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/fearing-police-encounter-robber-shoots-himself-dead-in-up/articleshow/83441573.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Pune: Frequent changes in norms, different curbs trigger confusion all around||PUNE: Citizens and businesses are in a state of confusion after going through months of lockdown and unlock phases, especially now with the district’s two municipal corporations — Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad — and the rural areas having different sets of curbs and relaxations under the five-level unlock plan based on positivity rate and oxygen bed capacity. Pune retailers claimed that ever since the unlock activity began last week, traders had been a confused lot. Sachin Nivangune, president, Pune District Retail Traders’ Association, told TOI, “Implementing authorities like the police on ground are confused, too. We have had instances this week when essential shops were asked to close before 4pm because the police personnel were not sure about the operation hours in the PMC (Pune Municipal Corporation) order issued before this Friday’s order.” He said with restrictions changing from Pune city to Pune rural areas, several markets fall in a grey zone — a part of the market falling in Pune rural limits and the rest in the PMC area. “This has caused confusion in operation of non-essential shops, which can operate in the PMC limits but not in Pune rural areas,” said Nivangune. Another retailer said, “The city’s positivity rate has fallen and hence, the curbs have been relaxed. But the authorities have clearly said restrictions could be re-imposed if the positivity rate started increasing/vacant beds started declining. Orders can change if things get bad, which would mean yet another cut in operation hours. Shopkeepers are no longer sure about the quantity of perishables to stock up as there is always a possibility of such items going waste if operational deadlines are reduced suddenly.” Fatehchand Ranka, the president of Federation of All Trade Associations of Pune, told TOI, “Non-essential shops are happy about the PMC’s decision to allow operations till 7pm. But there is a lot of confusion among shops in various parts of the district because the PMC is now at level-2, the PCMC at level-3 and the Pune rural at level-4 of the unlock. Restrictions differ from one portion of the district to another.” A source from the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA) said the PMC should clarify if dine-ins were allowed in restaurants on weekends. The last PMC order was clear on dining in restaurants being allowed during weekdays and only parcel orders on weekends. “Though Friday’s order did not specify anything on weekend operation guidelines for restaurants, a clarity should be given on this because patrons may want to know,” he said. A crockery shop owner from MG Road said, “Even after an announcement is made and news is forwarded on WhatsApp, I wait for the official PMC order and discuss with other shopkeepers in the area about what they plan to do before taking the decision to keep my establishment open till the new deadline. We don’t want to get into any arguments or hassles over what the latest regulations with the police.” Malti Joshi, a resident of Shivajinagar, said, “Though authorities are trying their best and locking and unlocking according to the spread of the infection, public in general has been having a hard time figuring out what is on, what is not, when and where.” (With inputs from Anjali Jhangiani)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/frequent-changes-in-norms-different-curbs-trigger-confusion-all-around/articleshow/83445739.cms||Neha Madaan

After conducting the Covid review meeting of Pune district, Pawar said the state government was working towards improving the vaccine supply and the situation was likely to be streamlined by August 31. On the ongoing vaccination drive, Pawar, who is also the guardian minister of Pune district, said the vaccination of the people with different physical abilities has started and steps have been taken to inoculate students heading abroad for studies. “The vaccination will gather more speed. But it depends on the availability of the vaccines. The Pune district administration is prepared to administer one lakh doses a day. It is likely that a large number of citizens will be vaccinated by August 31,” he said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that the deputy CM’s statement came after discussions with the Centre. “Even for the rest of June and July, we will get a good amount of vaccines — both Covishield and Covaxin. By August, we are likely to get vaccines from other manufacturers as well.” Deshmukh said in June, the district has so far received around 1.26 lakh doses of Covishield and 44,460 doses of Covaxin. “Besides gettng inoculated at the private centres, the vaccine beneficiaries have multiple options for getting the shots,” he said. A Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) official said on Saturday, 12 vaccination sites would offer the second dose of Covaxin to the 18-44 and 45-plus age categories. Covishield will be offered across 53 vaccination sites to the people aged 45 and above only. In the Pune civic limits, 16 sites will administer Covaxin to the second dose beneficiaries, As many as 53 centres will offer Covishield. Maharashtra hit the milestone of 25 million vaccinations on Wednesday, the highest by any state, retaining its top position in total doses administered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deputy-cm-says-infra-ready-for-1l-shots-a-day-in-district/articleshow/83445740.cms||Piyush Bhusari

By no means an easy task, say health department workers, who encounter a wall of opposition to getting vaccinated by people, many of whom believe in rumours like “different vaccines for different faiths are being administered”. To help dispel the misconceptions, DSP Chaurasiya has stepped in. “My help was sought after the vaccination figure remained as low at only eight jabs a day. We initially roped in help from the local corporator and other influential people but the result was not motivating. Then, I decided to go around in the field on an e-rickshaw to reach out to the residents in person and through the loudspeaker,” the CO (Kotwali) said. "There are several misconceptions about the vaccination and a lot of effort has to be put in to convince people to get themselves inoculated,” said the local ANM, Puja Devi. “Some believe in reports of different vaccines being used for people of different faiths. It is becoming really difficult to convince them,” she added. Administration is even trying to bring in people from the majority community to get vaccinated in minority-dominated areas to instill faith among them that all is well. When TOI spoke to a few members of the minority community in this regard, they were careful in expressing themselves. “I am quite healthy so why should I take the vaccine? I don’t think I need it,” said Farukh Ahmad, a rickshaw-puller residing in the Lisari Gate area. Another member of the community, Tasleem Ahmad, said, “I have lost my Aadhaar card and will not get the jab.” District surveillance officer, Dr Ashok Talyan, said, “The motivational level is low among the community. Despite trying very hard to convince them, not more than 20% of the target has so far been achieved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dsp-reaches-out-to-people-to-motivate-them-to-take-covid-jab/articleshow/83441640.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Hyderabad||Telangana government staff to get hiked salaries from July||HYDERABAD: It is official now. The Telangana government has issued orders implementing revised pay scales to all the state government employees. Separate GOs were issued on salaries, dearness allowance, house rent allowance, retirement gratuity, pension, additional quantum of allowance and salaries of outsourcing and contract employees on Friday. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had announced enhancement of salaries to the government employees by 30 per cent instead of 7.5 per cent recommended by the Pay Revision Commission (PRC), which would come into effect from April 1, 2021. He said the hiked salaries will be paid from June salary i.e July 1. The government said the monetary benefit of the revised salaries would be paid from April 1, 2020, but the arrears for the period from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, would be paid at the time of retirement of the government employee or to the legal heirs in case of demise of the employee. The arrears for the period from April and May, 2021, would paid during this financial year. The dearness allowance (DA) of 30.392 per cent as on July 1, 2018 would be merged in the pay as recommended by the PRC. The GO said the new salaries would be applicable to all employees of the state government except some categories such as teaching and other staff in government colleges, including medical colleges who have been drawing pay in the revised UGC/ICAR/AICTE pay scales. The house rent allowance would be paid 13 per cent to 24 per cent depending on the classification of the cities and towns. But, there would be no ceiling on the HRA. Adoption of HRA is similar to the recommendations of the seventh central pay commission at the rates of basing on classification for the cities and towns without any ceiling. Similarly, the retirement gratuity has been enhanced from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 16 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-staff-to-get-hiked-salaries-from-july/articleshow/83445748.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra government decides to scrap global tender for amphotericin B; no bidder steps up||PUNE: The state government has scrapped the global tender for procuring the key anti-mucormycosis drug amphotericin B in bulk for want of a bidder. The Maharashtra government had wanted to import over 60,000 vials of the drug through the tendering process. "The global tendering process did not attract a single bidder, hence it had to be scrapped. We are currently purchasing the drug on an ad-hoc basis as per the availability from domestic and foreign manufacturers," said Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana (MPJAY), a state-sponsored health scheme. The Maharashtra government on Thursday informed the Bombay High Court that of the 600 deaths due to mucormycosis till June 10, 82 patients had died in the past 36 hours due to shortage of amphotericin B injection. Observing that the high number of deaths was disturbing, the court asked the Centre to increase the allocation to Maharashtra and import medicines as domestic production was insufficient. 'The deaths need to be brought down. Altogether 82 patients have died within 36 hours. This is a disturbing figure and we have to save lives. Of the 23,254 mucormycosis cases in India, 25% are in Maharashtra, while the allocation of drugs is nearly 20%. This is inadequate and we do not want deaths for want of medicines," the bench observed. Covid-associated mucormycosis, primarily seen among many recovering from Covid treatment, needs extensive medical and surgical management. A patient could need multiple surgeries involving ENT, neurosurgery, ophthalmology. It usually starts from sinuses and can spread to the surrounding areas. The Maharashtra government capped the cost of 28 surgeries, usually needed for treatment of mucormycosis, last week to bring the treatment cost within the reach of patients. "Amphotericin B plays a pivotal road in arresting the spread of mucormycosis. Surgeries are only helpful in clearing the tissues, which are already damaged," said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi attached to the state-run B J Medical College and Sassoon hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-decides-to-scrap-global-tender-for-amphotericin-b-no-bidder-steps-up/articleshow/83445750.cms||---

The direction came about eight months after a committee to “rationalize” the border of the forest area was formed. The green tribunal has now given three more months to the panel’s nodal officer -- who is divisional commissioner of Meerut-- to wind up the process. And the UP government has been given three months to complete all the formalities from the date of submission of the panel’s report on the final boundary after the “rationalization”. Last year, the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) of the Union Environment Ministry had given a nod to the proposal of the Uttar Pradesh government to reduce the sanctuary area by half saying that it has now towns and agriculture fields which need to be excluded from the protected zone. The five-member bench has said, “We direct the commissioner, Meerut to ensure that the rationalization process is completed within three months and the report is submitted to the state government. Thereafter, the additional chief secretary, Forest and Environment, UP, may ensure that further action is completed within next three months. It is made clear that in case of failure, it will be open to either party to move the Tribunal after six months, seeking coercive measures against the erring officers.” In 1986, the government had issued a primary notification declaring Hastinapur forest area a sanctuary. However, no final government order notifying the 2,073 square-km area as a protected zone came from the government since then. Irked over it, the NGT had in May 2019 asked the forest department to explain to it the reason behind over 30 years of delay in proclaiming Hastinapur wildlife area as a protected sanctuary. The Hastinapur wildlife area is commonly referred to as a sanctuary and is spread around five districts-- Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Amroha, Hapur and Ghaziabad. But, due to lack of proper government notification on it, the area does not enjoy the protection needed to check poaching and various other threats to the wildlife. Human habitation and construction activities are not allowed in the protected area. The tribunal was responding to a plea filed by Centre for Wildlife and Environmental Litigation (CWEL) through its secretary Bhanu Bansal. The petitioner had 15 respondents in the case, including Union forest ministry, UP government, National Board of Wildlife, National Biodiversity Authority, Forest Conservator UP, DFOs of districts within which sanctuary falls, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ngt-gives-6-months-to-up-to-notify-hastinapur-wildlife-area-as-a-protected-sanctuary/articleshow/83441698.cms||Sandeep Rai

Amid a tussle between state and the centre over delay in release of funds amounting to Rs 682.07 crore (for financial year 2020-21), pending since December last year, has resulted in non-payment of second and third installment of 76,764 beneficiaries under the scheme, inducing a total liability of Rs 425.27 crore.The state’s chief secretary Niranjan Arya had written a letter to the centre last month (May) urging release of its share of Rs 682.07 crore for building houses, sanctioned in the year 2020-21, under PMAY-G.According to data shared by the state’s rural development department, of the 13.36 lakh sanctioned houses, construction of 11.44 lakh houses have already been completed (from 2016-17 to date). In 2020-21, of the 2.03 sanctioned houses, construction of 90,834 (44.73%) were completed.“There is hardly any progress in work under PMAY-G as we are yet receive funds from the centre, pending since December last year (2021). The centre is not releasing the amount as the record shows that while the state government has released Rs1,027 crore to the treasury (PD account), the amount has not been transferred to the state nodal account (money is transferred to the beneficiaries from this account),” said a senior official. “However, the state’s cash-strapped treasury has to distribute funds, depending on its availability, for running the schemes under all departments and other purposes.”“Because the money has not been transferred to the state nodal account, the centre doesn’t consider it released (to the beneficiaries). Hence, there is a delay in release of funds by the centre since December last year. Due to this delay, nearly 77,000 beneficiaries under the scheme are suffering,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pmay-g-beneficiaries-suffer-amid-centre-state-tussle-over-funds/articleshow/83434122.cms||Sidhartha Dutta

Locals kept referring to a ‘Sardar’ still missing, so firemen kept searching for a turbaned man. Later they learnt that Bhatia’s nickname was ‘Sardar’. “All residents had been accounted for by Thursday afternoon,” said a fireman. “But around 2pm, locals told us that ‘Sardar’ was missing so we resumed our search for a Sikh. While we had removed the debris of the ground-plus-three-storey building, the adjoining structure on which it had crash-ed was yet to be cleared.” Around 5.30pm, Bhatia’s body was found under a stairway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sardar-confusion-caused-18-hr-delay-in-finding-last-body/articleshow/83448808.cms||Richa Pinto

Ganesh Shetty, president, Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association, said, “The order of staying open till 10 pm on all days is a relief. Many workers of several eateries have gone back home. It will take a week to 10 days for them to get back to work. By the end of the week, about 80% restaurants should start the dine-in service.” Vedant Shinde, franchise partner, Bhujbal Bandhu Apulki, Kharadi, said, “The increase in timing gives a ray of hope that our business will revive. It will help us re-hire our staffers and allow us serve patrons after the working hours, when they would enjoy stepping out.” The possibility of night curfew was a concern though about how the eateries’ staffers would commute back home after work. Raju Mulay, who runs Raju’s Cafe in Wanowrie, said, “We have made provisions for our staffers to stay on our premises so that they don’t have to face any inconveniences while travelling. We are also calling back all the staff members who had gone back to their native places when the dine-in was restricted. As all our staffers are in the age group of 20-35 years, we have been waiting for the availability of vaccination slots for them.” Sandy Singh, partner at Euriska and Swing on Koregaon Park, said, “We expect the business to be better with the extended time. Our staffers would be quarantined on their return and vaccinated at the earliest. We are in the process of tying up with a hospital to get our staffers vaccinated on our premises if possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10pm-closing-time-rekindles-revival-hope-of-restaurateurs/articleshow/83445752.cms||---
---||Goa||Take cue from Gujarat, waive taxes for tourism sector: GCCI to Goa government||PANAJI: Goa Chamber Of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) has asked the state government to grant tax exemptions for the tourism and hospitality industry due to the lack or loss of business during the second Covid wave. GCCI wants the government to waive house tax, sanitation tax, trade tax, sign board tax and other fees applicable to resorts, small hotels, restaurants, bars, pubs, night clubs and shacks from April 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022. GCCI president Manoj Caculo has written to the state government saying that it will take at least a year for the tourism industry to recover and till then the onus is on the state to nurture and sustain the sector. “GCCI sincerely requests the government to come out with notifications and orders to waive the house tax, sanitation tax, trade tax, sign board tax till March 2022,” said Caculo in a letter to chief minister Pramod Sawant. Caculo said that Goa can take a cue from Gujarat that has already taken such a step to support the tourism and hospitality sector.  The tourism sector had started looking up around October after the first wave died down but the situation got worse from February due to the second wave. “With flights suspended and advisories from authorities of overseas countries against visiting the country, the industry is facing a grim situation the effect of which will be ravaging for the economy of the state,” said Caculo. He said that even if the pandemic is controlled, tourist will still not travel on account of the health risks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/take-cue-from-guj-waive-taxes-for-tourism-sector-gcci-to-govt/articleshow/83445806.cms||---
---||Pune||Shopowners in rural Pune disappointed with checks||Pune: Shopkeepers, traders and restaurant owners in rural Pune are disappointed with the administration’s decision to continue with the prevailing restrictions following a weekly Covid review meeting chaired by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Representatives of industrial organisations in rural areas said that they would wait and watch before deciding on their future course of action. According to a June 10 report tabled at the review meeting by Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao, the weekly Covid positivity rate of rural Pune has declined from 12.6% to 9.7% over the last two weeks. As such, it recommended rural Pune’s elevation to level 3 from the prevailing level 4 status, which would have enabled certain relaxations in curbs. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “Rural Pune’s Covid positivity rate is more than 5% and hence it falls under level-4 category restrictions imposed by the state government. People living in rural Pune will have to adhere to the current restrictions till a new order is issued.” As per the district collector’s June 6 order, all essential shops in rural Pune are allowed to operate from 7am to 4pm, while non-essential shops are not allowed to open. Hotels, eateries, restaurants are permitted to run parcel services only. “Covid has completely changed our financial equation. We can’t face further loss. Otherwise, we will have to shut the business,” said Sandesh Gore, who owns multiple electronics shops in Chakan and other towns in rural Pune. Rajendra Genjale, who runs hardware shop in Manchar, said, “Due to the closure, we have faced loss of Rs40/50 lakh business in the last two months. We were expecting some relaxations from the government so that we could reopen our business.” Narendra Gujrathi, president, traders’ association in Baramati, said, “Many traders are in financial crisis. If they don’t reopen their businesses now, they won’t be able to face further financial loss.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shopowners-in-rural-pune-disappointed-with-checks/articleshow/83445765.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||New orders keep audience away from theatres, cinemas for a while longer||Pune: Despite the eased restrictions to come into force from Monday keeping theatres and cinemas shut, operators of such spaces said that they had plans to resume welcoming guests back in a cautious manner. Operators’ plans remain fluid keeping in mind the previous unlock phase and the current graded unlocking protocol. That approach is despite the industry, crucial in generating thousands in employment for service jobs, as well as the artists, being bled dry due to the pandemic. With very few screenings and shows possible over the past year, many people have been rendered unemployed. “We are ready with our reopening plans and all safety protocols whenever the administration allows us to open but we will be cautious. Vaccinations have not been widespread and people still need confidence before coming back to movie theatres,” said the operator of a multiplex chain in the city. Theatre owners too say that they will tread the path of caution. Although, they said, they would have liked to use their spaces for a variety of other performances that need little to no audiences. “We are not planning any shows at our spaces now. We are a bit more cautious now than the last lockdown. As it is, the opening procedure this time will be a bit dynamic, as the picture may be fluctuating. If theatres were given permission to open, we would have allowed rehearsals, shoots, or some hybrid shows to take place, with most audience watching online and a very limited audience,” said Pradeep Vaidya, a partner at the experimental performance space The Box.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-orders-keep-audience-away-from-theatres-cinemas-for-a-while-longer/articleshow/83445758.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: BJP's Rita Bahuguna Joshi must have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar, Sachin Pilot on MP’s claim||JAIPUR: “She might have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar,” said former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Friday while refuting BJP MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi’s claim that she spoke to him over phone about joining the BJP. Pilot reached Delhi on Friday night and is expected to meet Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday. Amid reports of Pilot’s discontentment with the Congress central leadership, Joshi had told a news channel that she has urged Pilot to switch over to the saffron party. “I heard her claim that she spoke to Sachin. She might have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar. She doesn’t have the guts to speak to me,” Pilot told reporters during a Congress protest held in Jaipur against fuel price hike. Speculations over Pilot switching over to the BJP were rife when Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the saffron party in March last year and later when he revolted against chief minister Ashok Gehlot in July. Now, Jitin Prasada joining BJP has once again led to speculations over Pilot’s motives. While he voiced displeasure against an AICC committee sitting over his demands for 10 months, in refuting Joshi’s claim, Pilot has once again tried to put an end to such speculations. Staging dharna outside a petrol filling station in the city, Pilot targeted the BJP-led government at the Centre over inflation and hike in fuel prices. “Economic slowdown, inflation and unemployment have hit the country hard during the Coronavirus pandemic. People have lost jobs and labourers are not getting wages,” he said. “It is sad that lakhs of people died, dead bodies were thrown in rivers and every family struggled to survive the virus onslaught. And, in such a situation, the government is not taking any step to control inflation and instead, increasing fuel prices,” he added. The former deputy CM said, “Just as the prime minister had to roll back his decision on vaccination and announce free inoculation for all under pressure from the Congress, we will be successful in mounting pressure on the Centre over inflation and fuel price hikes too,” said the former deputy CM. Earlier in the day, Pilot reached Bhandna village in Dausa to pay tributes to his father and former Union minister Rajesh Pilot on his 21st death anniversary. MLA GR Khatana and local Congress leaders were with him in Dausa. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot and PCC chief and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra paid tributes to Rajesh Pilot on Twitter. Dotasra too will be in Delhi on Saturday, while going to Uttrakhand to condole the demise of AICC general secretary and Manglaur MLA Qazi Nizamuddin's mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rita-joshi-must-have-spoken-totendulkar-sachin-on-mps-claim/articleshow/83445771.cms||Bhanupratap Singh
---||Nagpur||Athawale for reservation to all economically weaker sections||Nagpur: Union minister of state Ramdas Athawale on Friday demanded reservation for all the economically weaker sections of society. Speaking to the media here, the Republican Party of India president said many minority castes had been demanding reservations for many years.Charging the Congress and NCP of often putting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray into trouble, the minister reiterated his advice to the latter to join hands with the BJP and lead their Mahagathbandhan for two-and-a-half years. “The MVA leaders have been pointing fingers at the Center on its failures. In reality, Maharashtra has got the maximum number of vaccines. Instead of pointing fingers at the Centre, its leaders should focus on inoculating all its citizens,” he said.Accusing the Maha Vikas Aghadi of being “anti-backward class”, the minister said the reservation for the Maratha community couldn’t be sustained in the Supreme Court as the government failed to properly defend it. “Granting reservation beyond 50% is possible by amending the Constitution of India, but it needs a lot of research and study. The cancellation of reservation in promotion for Dalits and tribals by the state government will affect many officials,” he said.Opposing the Shiv Sena’s demand to name Navi Mumbai airport after its founder Balasaheb Thackeray, Athawale said it was inappropriate to name every project after him. “Already, the government had named a slew of projects after him. The airport should be named after former MP DB Patil, who had been fighting for the people, instead of Thackeray,” he added.State RPI president Bhupesh Thulkar, spokesperson Rajan Waghmare, district president Mahendra Mankar and Balu Gharde accompanied him during the media briefing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/athawale-for-reservation-to-all-economically-weaker-sections/articleshow/83445769.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: No wari procession for second consecutive year||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday confirmed that the annual palkhi procession will not take place due to Covid-19 restrictions this year. However, 20 buses will be provided for a limited number of warkaris and the padukas of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram to travel to Pandharpur. This is the second consecutive year that the state government has not allowed wari procession due to the pandemic. Ajit Pawar said that the decision to restrict participation of devotees in the wari was taken unanimously at the state cabinet meeting. He said, “Permission is being granted for 10 palkhis to travel to Pandharpur in buses. The list of these palkhis has been finalized. The palkhis are from various parts of the state, including the palkhis of Sant Dnyaneshwar and Sant Tukaram. Also, a symbolic walk between Wakhri and Pandharpur will take place, involving a restricted number of warkaris. About 100 warkaris each at Alandi and Dehu will be allowed to remain present as the palkhis proceed to Pandharpur.” The annual palkhi procession sees participation by lakhs of devotees. It was scheduled to begin in the first week of July. Pawar appealed to everyone to cooperate and said that the decision was taken considering the pandemic. The health of citizens is a priority, he stated. Pawar added that a committee has been appointed to review the palkhi procession proposal and it had submitted a report to the government. Nitin More, president of Sant Tukaram Maharaj Temple Trust, Dehu, was disappointed with the decision. “It will hurt the sentiments of warkaris. We had told deputy chief minister Pawar in the last meeting that the wari is a century-old tradition and it should not break in the second consecutive year. The palkhi procession could be conducted with a limited number of warkaris, while following Covid-19 norms. We had also told Pawar that the palkhis will halt in open areas instead of villages or towns during the journey. The government should have paid heed to our demand,” More added. Vikas Dhage Patil, trustee of Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Temple Trust, Alandi, said, “We were expecting to get permission for the wari on foot as the Covid situation and awareness is better than last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-wari-procession-for-second-consecutive-year/articleshow/83445782.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Two youths die after superbike crashes into barrier on Sodala elevated road||JAIPUR: Two friends were killed after their speeding ‘superbike’ skidded near a sharp turn and crashed into the barrier wall of the Sodala elevated road Friday morning. The victims were identified as Nikhil Paliwal (25), who was driving the bike, and his friend Karishma Pareek (26) riding pillion. Both were natives of Nagaur and had been living in Jaipur for some time. The accident took place barely a stone throw’s away from the same spot where a speeding car had hit a 25-year-old constable aspirant, leading to his death, in November last year. As per information, at 5.45am, Nikhil was barreling through the deserted road when at a sharp turn his bike careened off the rumble strips, possibly due to excessive speed, and smashed into the barrier wall, just underneath the signboard cautioning motorists at sharp turns.Nikhil and Karishma were tossed up several feet high into the air before falling barely three-feet apart from each other. Both lay dead on the road while their bodies were completely mangled. Residents jogging alongside the stretch underneath the same road heard a loud thud followed in quick succession by the whirring of a bike engine. At 6.08am, the Sodala police station’s PCR vehicle with three cops arrived at the scene. Blood was streaming from Nikhil's head, while Karishma lay lifeless with her eyes wide open. Their clothes were stained with blood while the right arm of Karishma was completed twisted and lay behind her back. “Harrowing scene,” a constable told TOI, adding that the bike had struck a small box-sized stone, part of the barrier wall that was jutting out. SHO (accident) Shiv Dayal said it was to be confirmed if the duo was wearing helmets. The severity of the accident, however, indicated that it was unlikely that the two friends had properly strapped their headgear. “The wall was completely splattered with blood. Much of the bike’s front portion was destroyed while its rear end was surprisingly not damaged,” the constable said. The Sodala police summoned an ambulance and took Nikhil and Karishma to hospital. The doctors later declared them admitted dead. “Nikhil was carrying a wallet which had his Aadhar card, Karishma’s Aadhar card was in her purse,” an official said. Nikhil and Karishma’s family were asked to come to the hospital to take care of them. After they arrived at the hospital, they were informed of the tragedy. Nikhil lived with his family near Shivpuri colony in Jhotwara, as per information filed by the police. Karishma, on the other hand, lived near Kumbha Marg in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-youths-die-after-superbike-crashes-into-barrier-on-sodala-elevated-road/articleshow/83445794.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Want to do business? Get vaccinated or carry RT-PCR negative report||AHMEDABAD: Those wanting to do business, and are highly likely to come in direct contact with the public, will need to get vaccinated or get an RT-PCR negative report. The Ahmedabad district collector, in a notification issued on Friday, said that shop owners will have to produce either vaccination certificate or RT-PCR negative report to carry on with business. The notification stated that even rickshaw drivers, cab drivers, commercial drivers, security guards, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, technicians, pan shop owners, vegetable vendors and those running food carts are covered under this notification. The rules also apply to those employed at malls, shopping complexes, hotels, restaurants, hair salons and beauty parlours. Collector Sandip Sagale said, “These super-spreaders will have to take vaccination. Even the employees have to be vaccinated. If they do not have a vaccination certificate, they will have to produce RT-PCR negative report which is valid only for 10 days.” A senior official said that the move to get a new RT-PCR negative report after every 10 days is to ensure that vaccination in the district is increased and super spreaders get vaccinated. Officials at the collectorate said that this notification will only be implemented in the area outside the police commissionerate. Hence, traders in city areas are not liable to follow it. However, areas like Bopal and Ghuma which are out of the purview of the police commissionerate are likely to be covered under this notification. The notification has been issued under CRPC 144 and Gujarat Police act 37(4) and even under section 34 of the Disaster Management Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/want-to-do-business-get-vaccinated-or-carry-rt-pcr-negative-report/articleshow/83445774.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Opinion divided on children’s vulnerability in third wave||KOLKATA: The Centre issued guidelines for Covid management among children on Friday, but doctors remained divided on whether below-18 individuals would form the largest affected section in case a third wave of the pandemic hit India. The apprehension about children is owing to India yet to decide on below-18 vaccination. The proportion of children being affected so far had not been very different from young adults who had been vaccinated, some argued, adding most kids had a milder disease. Others agreed but said the percentage of children being affected had been higher in the second wave than that in the first. It would rise further in case a third wave came, they said. Assistant professor of Jagannath Gupta Institute of Medical Sciences and Hospital Kaushik Hazra believed “there was no justifiable evidence to suggest the third wave would affect the paediatric age group more severely”. “It has not happened in other countries. On the contrary, their symptoms have been mild and they are less likely to suffer from respiratory distress or pneumonia. This could be because they receive compulsory vaccines and their ACE receptor—the entry point for novel coronavirus—is not as conducive as that in adults,” said Hazra. He added kids’ symptoms were likely to be different but less fatal and identifiable, at least initially, and might include high fever, diarrhoea, cough and cold, appetite loss, body ache, weakness. But Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain warned the virus would target unvaccinated kids and teenagers teens in the next wave. “The best option is to get a vaccine for them at the earliest,” he said. He, however, agreed with Hazra that children might have some cross-immunity from their regular vaccines. “Some cross-resistance develops from other vaccines and many get their children inoculated against influenza. These may offer some resistance but it can’t be fool-proof,” he said. “But they are the only section yet to be vaccinated and they need to adopt all precautions.” More children might contract the virus but the severity could be less, felt CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “Just 2% of the affected in the first wave were children but the percentage climbed to 12% in the second. It will be more in a third wave but mild infection, which has so far been the case among children, will keep fatality in check,” said Dhar. But, he added, this could change if the virus acquired a different form that could harm kids. “It has not happened anywhere in the world and so, the fears are unfounded,” he said. Covid severity had been more, even leading to more deaths in the second wave, said paediatrician Shantanu Ray. “In May, I had at least a dozen children under my treatment, two of whom died,” he said. Consultant epidemiologist Aritra Das pointed out people across all age groups had been affected in higher numbers and more severely in the second wave. “Proportionately, their number could be higher in the third wave. A sizeable section of those above 18 would be vaccinated by September, after which the third wave is expected to hit,” Das said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/opinion-divided-on-childrens-vulnerability-in-third-wave/articleshow/83444010.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Both the civic bodies have formed flying squads to monitor traders and customers. These teams will intensify actions after Monday when more relaxations come into effect as per the new break-the-chain order. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said manpower will be deployed in a decentralised manner. The officials added that the PMC has delegated the power of taking action to the police. But some powers, such as charging fines and issuance of notices, have been bestowed upon the civic administration. “Since the introduction of the curbs, the flying squads have been formed under each ward office. They will take action in their respective jurisdictions,” said Madhav Jagtap, head of the PMC’s anti-encroachment department. He said 90 squads will operate across PMC areas. Around 550 staff members will be deployed for this. As many as 480 marshals have been appointed to ensure effective implementation of Covid preventive measures in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits.

Speaking to the media here, the Republican Party of India president said many minority castes had been demanding reservations for many years. Charging the Congress and NCP of often putting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray into trouble, the minister reiterated his advice to the latter to join hands with the BJP and lead their Mahagathbandhan for two-and-a-half years. “The MVA leaders have been pointing fingers at the Center on its failures. In reality, Maharashtra has got the maximum number of vaccines. Instead of pointing fingers at the Centre, its leaders should focus on inoculating all its citizens,” he said. Accusing the Maha Vikas Aghadi of being “anti-backward class”, the minister said the reservation for the Maratha community couldn’t be sustained in the Supreme Court as the government failed to properly defend it. “Granting reservation beyond 50% is possible by amending the Constitution of India, but it needs a lot of research and study. The cancellation of reservation in promotion for Dalits and tribals by the state government will affect many officials,” he said. Opposing the Shiv Sena’s demand to name Navi Mumbai airport after its founder Balasaheb Thackeray, Athawale said it was inappropriate to name every project after him. “Already, the government had named a slew of projects after him. The airport should be named after former MP DB Patil, who had been fighting for the people, instead of Thackeray,” he added. State RPI president Bhupesh Thulkar, spokesperson Rajan Waghmare, district president Mahendra Mankar and Balu Gharde accompanied him during the media briefing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/athawale-for-reservation-to-all-economically-weaker-sections/articleshow/83445777.cms||---

The BJP, though, with only five zila panchayat members has not lost hope as sources claim the party is in talks with several Independents who have potential to swing results in their favour. The Opposition now blames BJP for indulging in horse-trading to turn tables. "The party has been trying to claim zila panchayats chairman's post by all means. They did not announce the election date as the government is yet to get favourable feedback from the district," Rajpal Singh, district president of Samajwadi Party, said. Recently, Arun Chaudhary, husband of an independent ward member, was inducted in BJP despite a non-bailable warrant against him in an attempt to murder case. "He was on the run and suddenly turned up at the BJP party office. Was inducted in presence of senior members and now the complainant is being pressured to withdraw the FIR," Singh added. BJP, on the other hand, claims it has support of 25 members and will easily win the zila panchayat chairman elections. Party's general secretary for UP Sunil Bansal held a review meeting on Friday with zila panchayat elections as one of the important talking points. "Though BJP backed five members have won, we have support of 25 and we will easily win the elections," Mukesh Singhal, party's city president in Meerut, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/panchayat-chairman-polls-up-for-grabs-sp-alleges-horse-trading/articleshow/83441730.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Armaan Shaikh, 21, who has almost 2 lakh followers on Instagram, is seen pretending to shoot himself on the track with a gun, which was later found to be a cigarette lighter. This is the second time Shaikh has been arrested since the lockdown began in 2020 for performing stunts. “When the video went viral, we identified the stretch of tracks near Jogeshwari. We found Shaikh’s social media accounts and started checking his videos for leads to track him down,” said senior inspector Dattatreya Nikam, Andheri GRP. In a news channel report on YouTube, police found Shaikh and his friend, Arbaaz Khan, had been arrested at Vikhroli Parksite in 2020 for uploading a clip of standing on a motorcycle while riding. The GRP got Shaikh’s Ghatkopar address from the Parksite police. Shaikh got to know when the cops arrived, and fled. But the police kept a watch and eventually nabbed him. He has been booked for ticketless travel on railway property and not wearing a mask violating lockdown guidelines, besides other provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-influencer-held-for-stunt-video-on-tracks-near-jogeshwari/articleshow/83445802.cms||---

The AMC is preparing a detailed plan to give the jabs to vegetable vendors, and shop owners and their staff. These groups can become super spreaders as they come in contact with the general public. The comprehensive programme to vaccinate these groups will be launched first. Later, action will be taken against those who are found to be unvaccinated. An official in the corporation said: “The AMC is expected to get more vaccines by next week and hence a special drive will be initiated.” The official said that the vaccination rates among vegetable vendors and delivery personnel were the lowest and hence a special drive was required. Officials said that in the past the AMC had made testing compulsory for these groups. In the first phase, about 700 such people across the city were found to be positive among those tested. However, in October and November the number was not more than 200. Once these groups are vaccinated, they will be given identity cards which they will have to wear to let customers know that they are vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vax-drive-for-super-spreaders-in-city/articleshow/83445798.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: High court stays order cancelling appointment of spl teachers||AURANGABAD: The Bombay high court bench in Aurangabad has ordered an interim stay on the state government’s circular that cancelled permanent appointment of teachers under Inclusive Education of Disabled at Secondary Stage (IEDS) and reappointed them on contract basis. A group of teachers recently moved high court after the education department and zilla parishad CEO communicated the impugned (under challenge) circular to them. The bench of justice Vibha Kankanwadi directed the matter be placed before a division bench of HC and issued notices, returnable by June 18, to the ministry of human resources development, state’s principal secretary for school education and sports department, director of education (primary), deputy director of education in Aurangabad, Maharashtra Prathamik Shikshan Parishad and chief executive officers of different Zilla Parishads. “Till then, there shall be an interim stay to the effect and operation of the impugned communications until further orders,” the bench said. The petitioners have contended that they were appointed as Special Teachers on basis of the Government of India, Ministry of Human Resource Department's directives to the education secretary of Maharashtra government to implement the new IEDS scheme. In 2016, some of the teachers, including the present petitioners, had approached high court seeking various reliefs, including grant of permanency. Some of them were granted permanency prior to the writ petition and, as regards to others, it was pending. These writ petitions were decided on August 25, 2016 by the division bench of HC wherein the impugned orders passed by the director of education — withdrawing the approvals to the services of the petitioners — were quashed and set aside. The approvals granted to the services of the petitioners stood restored and consequential reliefs regarding the salary were granted. Lawyer S S Kazi, representing the teachers, argued that the state project co-ordinator of IEDS issued a circular on February 4, 2021 stating that these special teachers will henceforth be working on contractual basis. Accordingly, further orders were issued on March 16 and May 17. Kazi also pointed to the court that the Nagpur bench of HC has granted ad interim stay to a similar matter placed before it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-stays-order-cancelling-appointment-of-spl-teachers/articleshow/83439730.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Pune||Malls in Pune Municipal Corporation limits to reopen on Monday, no relief for PCMC, rural areas||PUNE: Malls can reopen from Monday at 50% capacity till 7pm in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas, while restaurants, bars and food courts will be able to serve patrons till 10pm at half their capacity. These relaxations would also apply to areas of the Pune and Khadki cantonment boards falling in the PMC limits but not to areas under the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune rural. The closing time for all essential and non-essential shops, places holding entertainment, political and social functions, and outdoor and indoor sports activities would be extended till 7pm from Monday. Restrictions on travelling without a valid reason would come into force after 10pm instead of the current 5pm deadline, said the order issued by Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Friday. The decision to offer more relaxations in the PMC limits was taken after deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar conducted a review meeting earlier in the day. He said the Pune civic areas warranted relaxations mentioned for cities categorised as level 2 under the state’s “break the chain” mandate because the PMC’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) was less than 5%. The relaxations would not apply to PCMC and Pune rural areas as their WPR was above 5%. The PMC, though, has not adopted all relaxations spelt out in the order for level 2 cities/districts. It has persisted with the Saturday-Sunday closure of non-essential shops, the only exception being liquor outlets which can operate till 7pm on all days. Kumar said, “We have issued orders according to the norms for level 2 areas with some restrictions. We want to tread cautiously. Pawar has already said the weekend positivity rate would be checked. If any sudden rise is noticed, we might have to revise the orders accordingly.” Kumar said the PMC’s positivity rate was 4.95% and its oxygen bed occupancy was at 23.33%, which led to the revision in restrictions. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that they would continue with the level 3 restrictions regardless of whether the positivity rate dropped below 5% or not until next Friday. “We will review the situation next Friday. Orders will be issued every Friday based on the positivity rate for seven days before that,” he said. The only relaxation offered by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) offered on Friday was allowing reading rooms, libraries and coaching classes for competitive exams to reopen at 50% capacity. Patil admitted it would be a challenge to keep a tab on vehicular movement in the PCMC after 5pm since traffic in the PMC areas would operate till 10pm and there would be cross-movement between the two corporations. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “The PMC’s order will come into force from Monday. We still have a day in hand. After discussing with different authorities, we will issue our orders on Saturday and elaborate on the night curfew hours and movement of people on roads. We will also discuss how to facilitate movement of people between Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, especially at night.” Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh said though the positivity rate in rural Pune had come down to 9.6% this week as compared to 13% the earlier week, no relaxation would be offered there, as advised by experts. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government on Covid-19, justified his recommendation to Pawar of not allowing further relaxations in rural Pune. “Covid-19 norms, like wearing face masks and social distancing, are not being followed properly. There is a threat of ‘reverse order’ impact, meaning Covid transmission can take place from rural to urban areas, if we lift/end Covid restrictions in rural Pune. Also, less than 10% of the population in rural Pune is fully vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/malls-in-pmc-limits-to-reopen-on-monday-no-relief-for-pcmc-rural-areas/articleshow/83445795.cms||Sarang Dastane

The commissioner was addressing a press briefing on Friday morning. City police on Friday also issued a public notice urging people to contact the city police if they have any financial or other complaints against the accused. Martin was presented in court and was remanded in judicial custody. He said that focus would be given to find out the means of the accused’s luxurious lifestyle, involving premium flats and multiple vehicles. Police had seized two cars and a motorcycle from the accused. The commissioner praised the cooperation of local residents at Mundoor and Thrissur City police in nabbing the accused from a very hostile terrain. He said that over 250 local residents, including civil defence volunteers, assisted the police in catching the accused. The commissioner said that a special drive would be launched by coordinating with all the residents’ associations in the district to collect information on possible suspicious activities like domestic violence or domestic abuses and to find if there are any victims unknown to police, like in this case. “Even in live-in relationships, violence can happen. We are getting reports of at least 10 domestic violence or rape cases on an average every month. In most cases, the victims are living with the accused, either in a marital relationship or live-in. We are going to give special focus to these cases. In this case, the victim was traumatised, harassed and threatened with dire consequences. What we saw was a very sadistic torture,” said Nagaraju. Meanwhile, women’s commission chairperson MC Josephine congratulated the police team for catching the accused within 24 hours after the interference of the commission. She, however, said that laxity by the police in investigating atrocities against women would give out a wrong message to the public. The police commissioner, however, rejected allegations that police sat on the petition for two months without doing anything and even let the accused flee from an apartment at Thrikkakara a day after the incident was reported. The commissioner said that so much resources were not used but the police did everything to be done legally. “We were already behind the accused. We collected his location and did everything to block his passport. We also got the bail application rejected. The focus and efforts increased when it became sensational, that we will accept. But we cannot accept the claim that we didn’t do anything,” he said. An assistant commissioner would inquire into the delay in alerting the senior officials about the grievous nature of the crime which was registered on April 8. He said that they were looking at a standard operating procedure to be followed in such cases so that such lapses aren’t repeated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/probe-to-focus-on-martins-income-source-luxurious-lifestyle-police/articleshow/83443969.cms||---

Anuradha Sahasrabudhe, director of Childline said many a times, despite the underage survivor of sexual abuse clearly giving statements about threat to their younger sisters if they continue to stay at home where the victim herself was abused, only the victim is taken to shelter leaving behind the others. She also cited cases, where police asked insensitive questions and delayed filing the first information report (FIR).City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta refuted the allegations about police lethargy and ignorance of law. “POCSO cases are taken very seriously by the police. In fact, they are taken on priority by the police. There have been three rounds of training for all police officers in this regard and there is no ignorance about the law among the force. Hence, all these allegations of police lethargy or ignorance in POCSO cases are unfounded,” he said.Demands were raised to appoint nodal officers for Childline in the police department, in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the education department.Grievances about delays in acquiring requisite funds were voiced at the meeting and solutions were sought. It was also touched upon in the meeting how Childline was not made a part of the task force constituted by the Women and Child Development Ministry despite it being mandated by law. Female constables were also requested at all police chowkeys/stations in Pimpri Chinchwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/insensitivity-in-child-abuse-cases-discussed-at-meeting/articleshow/83443955.cms||Ardhra Nair

Even though movement wasn’t restricted and curbs were being slowly relaxed earlier, the shutting of restaurants, gyms, and clubs had indeed sucked the social life out of Ahmedabad. So, as gyms, clubs, fitness centres, and restaurants resumed operations, sports enthusiasts and fitness freaks thronged these places while food lovers gorged on meals outside of home. Rajpath Club, which started functioning again on Friday morning in two shifts, saw footfalls of at least 350-400 persons in a single day. Karnavati Club attracted footfalls of some 350 persons till 7pm. “We will open up the card room, and carrom and chess areas from Saturday and come the weekend, footfalls are expected to increase,” said Jayesh Modi, vice-president, Karnavati Club. “We will ensure that all protocols and guidelines are duly followed.” Gujarat Sports Club is set to reopen on Saturday with all the amenities. Meanwhile, gym owners breathed easy as customers did not ditch them. “Most of our regular customers returned,” said a gym owner. “Those who resumed after the lockdown know the kind of precautions that need to be taken.” Restaurateurs pin hope on weekend Restaurateurs are hoping the weekend will serve good tidings. “Business has picked up well as people who were fed up at home did walk into restaurants. As did those intending to hold business meet-ups,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), Gujarat. Somani added: “We’re ensuring that all protocols are adhered to. We hope more people will come to restaurants over the weekend.” However, some confusion did prevail among restaurateurs as no decision regarding the issuance of curfew passes to restaurant delivery personnel has been announced. “We understand that takeaways are allowed till 9pm but there is no announcement on procuring curfew passes,” said Rohit Khanna, co-founder, Food Entrepreneurs’ Alliance, Ahmedabad. “We only hope that delivery personnel are not harassed while they do their job till midnight.” Life throbs again at gymsAn Ahmedabad-based entrepreneur, Shaishav Shah, had never missed his gym workouts for about eight years. However, repeated shutdowns of gyms since the pandemic — and the recent one during the second wave — left him disappointed. “I tried to manage without the gym during the closures but I was able to do only basic functional training,” said Shah. “I am extremely delighted that gyms are now open because exercise is part of my lifestyle and a sacrosanct routine.” Shah said he struggled during the session on Friday as he had to wear a mask. “I know how important it is to wear a mask,” he said. “I did feel claustrophobic but I still feel every single minute of the workout was worth it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/social-life-flexes-feasts-again-at-clubs-gyms-restaurants/articleshow/83445893.cms||---

The Delta variant is fueling the Covid-19 second wave in many parts of India including Telugu states and spurt in cases in some countries. While other variants mostly infect one person in a household, the Delta infects more than one. This explains why several members in many families were down with Covid-19 this time. The Public Health England has compared the transmission rate of the Delta variant in a household setting with that of the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), which is also a variant of concern. The Alpha variant was first discovered in the UK. Read AlsoTotal UK cases of Covid-19 Delta variant spike to 42,323LONDON: Total British cases of the Delta coronavirus variant of concern first identified in India have jumped by 29,892 to 42,323, Public Health England said on Friday, adding the variant accounted for over 90% of new Covid-19 cases in the country. The figure was a big jump on the 12,431 cases of“Overall, we found increased household transmission of Covid-19 associated with B.1.617.2 compared to B.1.1.7. These findings show households are important settings for rapid transmission of the lineage B.1.617.2. With household settings being an important factor in wider community spread, strategies to prevent transmission in these settings are vital to control the Covid-19 pandemic,” the PHE study released on Friday said. Read Also‘Covaxin shields against Beta, Delta variants’The indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin protects people against the deadly Beta (B.1.351) and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, more commonly referred to as the South African and Indian variants, a study has found.According to the PHE study, there is a 64% increase in the odds of household transmission associated with infection with B.1.617.2 variant compared to B.1.1.7. “This study provides early real-world evidence of the effect B.1.617.2 variant on household transmission. The findings support existing evidence that B.1.617.2 has a substantially increased transmissibility advantage over the B.1.1.7 variant,” the PHE researchers said. This study also found evidence of increased household transmission among households with an index case of Asian ethnicity,” the researchers added. They said households are high risk settings for transmission of Covid-19 and are an important factor in wider community spread. “By assessing the extent to which B.1.617.2 results in onward transmission to household members compared to B.1.1.7, we can assess the relative transmissibility of this variant, and provide information vital to the national and international pandemic response,” they added. The study found that the odds of household transmission was 1.66 among those with B.1.617.2 variant. While the wild strain of novel coronavirus dominated the wave I assisted by its mutants like N440k, the Alpha and Delta variants took the lead role during wave II. Luckily, vaccination protects from these variants. Even in case of infection, the severity of the disease and the need for hospitalisation do not arise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delta-variant-transmits-more-in-households/articleshow/83445855.cms||Syed Akbar

The survey revealed that 214 children were involved in waste collection, sorting, segregating and pushing waste cart at their parent’s place of work daily. Vinayak Mane (17), a Class XII student, goes with his mother to help her sort and segregate waste. “She is quite old and remains unwell. Hence, I go and help her out with work. My father is an autorickshaw driver, but he hardly earns anything. So, there is a financial crunch,” said Mane, who commutes from Pimpri to Sadashiv Peth for work every day. Om Dinkar (15), a Class X student, is taken by his mother, a wastepicker, to her place of work. “I attend online classes sitting on the side of the road while my mother goes about with her work. Due to traffic, I sometimes miss out on what is being said by the teacher. Then there is a network issue. On top of it, even when I complete the assigned work in whatever way I can, the teachers scold me for not doing the work properly. How will I tell them my problems,” asked Dinkar from Yerawada. Meanwhile, Atul Khude, a Class XII student, helps his wastepicker mother on days like Monday when her workload is heavy. “Since Sundays are off days, there is much work on Monday. My mother also feels that if left alone at home, I will move around with other children and thinks that taking me along with her is better,” he said. The survey was carried out by Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat (KKPKP) and Solid Waste Collection and Handling (SWaCH), a collective of wastepickers, in March, April and May this year. The aim was to understand the current situation of children of wastepickers and to explore reasons for children at work. The need for daycare facilities was the solution suggested by most parents. Rani Shivsharan, a wastepicker leader, said in a statement, “While we track the admission and reintegration of children in schools, we need also to put forth our demands before the PMC for daycare centres for children of informal workers who now are left with no option but to take their children to work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/214-kids-pick-trash-to-help-parents-through-hard-times/articleshow/83443946.cms||Ardhra Nair

Bhujbal said he will take up the issue during the meting of the disaster management authority on Saturday. “There are 10 auspicious days between June 16 and July 13, when the weddings can take place, of them five are on weekends. Also, there are no auspicious days till the last week of September. Hence, we want the district guardian minister to allow wedding functions on these five weekends,” said Sunil Chopda, the president of the association. “We will follow the guidelines set by the district authorities, but we want the government to take a call on allowing weddings on Saturdays and Sundays,” he said. Meanwhile, weddings halls and lawns have started receiving bookings for weddings with the presence of 50 people. According to the civic body officials, they have received around 10-12 applications seeking permission for weddings for June 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/plea-for-nod-to-weddings-during-weekends/articleshow/83440128.cms||Tushar Pawar

Appearing for the 1988 batch IPS officer, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani told a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian that cases were lodged and launched against Singh to “subvert” the HC order which directed a CBI probe against Deshmukh and that the former Mumbai CP was being harassed for blowing the whistle. The bench, however, said the CBI probe and inquiry against the police officer were separate cases. The hearing saw the court making sharp remarks against Singh for making the plea that the probe against him be assigned to CBI or some other independent agency. “It is very surprising. You served Maharashtra police for 30 years and now you are saying that you do not have confidence in your own force. It is a shocking statement made by you,” it said. On Jethmalani’s disclosure that Singh had been approached by Sanjay Pandey, acting DGP, Maharashtra, the court said: “If a person of the rank of DGP can be pressured, then there will be nobody who can’t be pressured. Please don’t tell make-believe stories.” It said a complaint once filed is like a bullet which when fired has to go to the target and it cannot be withdrawn. As Jethmalani pressed on making allegations against the state authorities, including the police and the government, for targeting him, the bench in a lighter vein referred to an age-old saying and reminded him that “those who live in a glasshouse should not throw stones at others.” Expressing reluctance to entertain the petition, the bench pointed out that a similar, if not identical, petition by Param Bir Singh was pending with the Bombay high court. The court also turned down his plea that no fresh FIR be filed against him and the bench said that such a blanket order could not be passed. Sensing the mood of the court, the former police chief decided to withdraw the petition to approach the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/please-dont-tell-make-believe-stories-apex-court-tells-singh/articleshow/83445860.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

In May 2019, BMC’s P-North Ward dashed off an ‘most urgent’ letter to the deputy collector (encroachment) about residents rebuilding illegal constructions and sought action to avoid any untoward incident. In September 2019, the BMC wrote a similar letter stating: “Since the dilapidated illegal structures are in Collector Compound...direct your staff for inspection and take action; if necessary, we will provide manpower and machinery...” BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said the structure that crashed on Wednesday was among the illegal constructions. “Initially, these were ground floor structures. Later, residents extended them horizontally and vertically... This is the result of a nexus between these agencies and netas who are nurturing these slums as votebanks,” said Mishra, who wrote to the suburban collector’s office about the issue last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-19-bmc-had-alerted-collector-of-dilapidated-illegal-structures/articleshow/83448903.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The arrested man has been identified as Ajay Kumar Sahu, from Rae Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, and his deceased brother was Vijay Kumar Sahu. The two men allegedly had several fights over family disputes, following which the murder took place. Police said they received a call around 1am from one Puneet Bhatia, who said that a man had killed his brother. A police team that reached the spot, a store of a building in the Nehru Enclave area, found one person lying dead in a pool of blood. The spot of crime was store in Nehru Enclave. “Ajay was found sitting next to Vijay’s body. We also found a few dumbbells lying on the floor, used to hit the deceased repeatedly on his head and chest,” said a police officer. Police probe revealed that the brothers were working for Bhatia as helpers in his stationery shop at Krishna Market, Kalkaji for the last 10 years. “Though both were brothers, they had different mindsets and temperamental issues. They had constant brawls between them over family issues,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-bludgeons-brother-over-family-row/articleshow/83445857.cms||---

While the daily cases in the rural parts of Kolhapur district remain constant. The Covid deaths are fewer in Kolhapur city compared to the rural areas. The civic authorities said the trend of daily cases is being closely watched. The authorities said tracing and testing of Covid patients has been increased. Nikhil More, the deputy municipal commissioner of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), said, “We have stepped up tracings of Covid patients, which is the reason for a slight increase in the daily cases. We are currently carrying out 4,500 tests every day and have a 12% to 14% positivity rate. We will start achieving the plateau phase and then in a week or so, the cases will reduce. However, it all depends on Covid appropriate behaviour followed by the citizens, which will help to contain the spread of the infection.” As compared to rural parts of the district, the movement of citizens is more in Kolhapur city. In the rural areas, however, people ignore Covid symptoms and get admitted to the hospitals late, which is one of the reasons many from rural areas succumbed to Covid. “We have started the drive of isolating suspected Covid patients with comorbidities. They are tested immediately and hospitalised on time, which is one of the major reasons for the low death rate in the city,” said More. On June 7, Kolhapur city recorded 317 cases and nine Covid deaths while the rural parts reported 1,052 cases and 35 deaths. The city and rural parts added 407 cases and 1,112 cases, respectively, on June 9.On June 10, the city registered 411 cases and four deaths while the rural parts added 1,088 cases and 32 deaths. The district reported 1,855 fresh cases and 29 deaths on Friday while 1,366 patients were discharged. The recovery rate of Kolhapur district stands at 87.44%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-registers-slight-increase-in-daily-infections/articleshow/83440123.cms||---

Justice Shircy V dismissed the plea after his counsel informed the court that Martin has been arrested. The plea was filed by Martin on May 26, after a sessions court denied him anticipatory bail. During the hearing on Friday, Martin’s counsel argued that the arrest made by police when anticipatory bail plea was pending was improper. However, the court said even though the plea was considered, no direction had been issued not to arrest him. The case relates to alleged rape and torture of a 27-year-old woman, with whom the applicant had a live-in relationship, after she questioned his relationship with another woman. She has also alleged that he cheated her of Rs 5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-dismisses-martins-anticipatory-bail-plea/articleshow/83443976.cms||---

On a complaint filed by Mandar Wadgaonkar, police have registered an offence of house break-in and theft against an unidentified burglar. As per the complaint, the suspect managed to enter the three-storey home by bending the tin roof on the top floor and stole gold and silver articles along with domestic gas cylinders and Rs 60,000 cash — all amounting to Rs 9.81 lakh. The house was closed for more than six months and the owner of the house is a Yoga teacher who now lives in Ratnagiri, a police officer said. Soon after the complaint was registered with the police, senior police officials, including ACP Deepali Khanna, of Bhadrakali police station reached the spot to check the modus operandi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-cash-goods-worth-rs-9-8l-stolen/articleshow/83439944.cms||---
---||Nashik||Over 470 past Covid deaths added in Nashik||NASHIK: The Nashik district has added 474 more Covid deaths over the past two days, taking into account the patients who succumbed to the disease since December but were not added to the overall death toll. On Thursday and Friday, the district reported 10 and 19 Covid deaths respectively for the day. Now, taking into account the past and daily deaths, the district has reported 5,587 deaths to the pandemic. District civil surgeon Ashok Thorat said many of the Covid hospitals have not updated the death toll, which was now under progress and that the number of the death was likely to be added to the tally in another couple of days. The increase in the death toll has raised the case fatality rate of Nashik district from 1.31% to 1.43%. “The deaths due to Covid have already been registered with the hospitals, where the people died. The death certificates have also been issued to them accordingly. However, the details of the person were not filled up on the ICMR portal for various issues – both technical and human. The same were now being uploaded,” Thorat said. Thorat pointed out that the delay in updating the deaths was because of several issues including lack of internet availability at some times, delay in getting the ICMR identification number of the deceased persons from the laboratories, limitations and failures of the facility app, lack of skilled manpower for data entry. Moreover, the hospital machinery was focused on uploading the details of the patients so that their treatment could started in time and resulted in delay in uploading the deaths of the people in the respective areas. Thorat further stated that while more death figures could be added during the forthcoming days, he has warned the hospitals against such delay in the future. “We have ordered the government as well as the private hospitals to upload the information on daily basis by deploying skilled man power to ensure that such delays are avoided,” Dr Thorat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-470-past-covid-deaths-added-in-nashik/articleshow/83440132.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Hyderabad||CCMB study on Covid susceptibility: Genetic variations between Europeans, South Asians||HYDERABAD: In an important research, the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) said genes play a role in Covid-19 susceptibility and that they vary from one population to other. Population-based genetic studies have revealed that there are genetic differences between Europeans and South Asians on Covid-19 susceptibility, the research said. Data also proved that several factors, including genetics, immunity and lifestyle contribute to Covid-19 susceptibility. A multi-national team of scientists, including those from the CCMB, analysed a DNA segment’s role in determining Covid-19 outcomes among the South Asian population. Dr Kumarasamy Thangaraj, director, Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) and professor Gyaneshwer Chaubey of Banaras Hindu University conducted the study. The study concluded that the genetic variants responsible for Covid-19 severity among Europeans may not play a role in Covid-19 susceptibility among South Asians. “With growing data, it is becoming clear that there are several factors that contribute to Covid-19 susceptibility. The CCMB’s expertise in population studies are proving useful in understanding these details of the ongoing pandemic,” said Dr Vinay Nandicoori, director, CCMB. This finding has been published in the journal ‘Scientific Reports’. In the study, the researchers compared infection and case fatality rates with South Asian genomic data over three different timelines during the pandemic. Scientists have especially looked into a large number of populations from India and Bangladesh. First author of the study Prajival Pratap Singh said: “Our result reiterates the unique genetic origin of south Asian populations. A dedicated genomewide association study on south Asian Covid-19 patients is the need of time for us in the Asian sub-continent.” The study also suggests that the genetic variants correlated with Covid-19 outcomes differ significantly among caste and tribal populations of Bangladesh. “Scientists working in the area of population studies should be more cautious to interpret their findings by differentiating caste and tribal populations, more explicitly so in Bangladeshi population,” said professor George van Driem, a linguist and co-author of study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ccmb-study-on-covid-susceptibility-genetic-variations-between-europeans-south-asians/articleshow/83445866.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Covid deaths not going down as fast as cases, pushing up CFR||MUMBAI: Though both Covid cases and deaths are on the decline in the state, the case fatality rate (CFR) is on the rise because fatalities have not fallen as drastically as the infections. Between June 1 and 11, the state reported a CFR of 2.41%, up from 1.45% in the first 11 days of May and 0.5% in the same period in April. Although cases between June 1 and 11 have reported a 76% dip compared to the same period in April, deaths have gone up 11%. Between May and June so far, the cases have dropped by 75%, but deaths by 63%. Officials said big cities like Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, which peaked earlier, have stabilised in terms of deaths, but smaller districts and towns are driving Covid deaths in the state. As Maharashtra’s various districts witnessed different peaks, the CFR is higher in June, suggesting that the state is still not completely out of danger. “Districts like Satara, Kolhapur and Ratnagiri are now adding higher deaths than Mumbai. Cases in these districts started surging later, so deaths are yet to stabilise,” said a senior official. Officials said they expect deaths to fall significantly too in the next two weeks as critical cases in the state are on the decline. Experts said that while CFR is usually considered over a period of time, CFR over a 10-day period too shows an increasing or decreasing trend. This calculation does not include the large number of deaths that have been added to the cumulative toll as part of the data reconciliation exercise as there is no clarity regarding the period in which those deaths have occurred. The reconciliation process will affect the overall CFR. Since May 17, the state has added over 13,000 deaths to the cumulative toll as part of the reconciliation process. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu from the Public Health Foundation of India said that adding five-digit numbers to the toll would definitely change the cumulative death rate. Many corporations and states have the tendency to add “old” deaths after the peak (of an epidemic or pandemic) is over. “But deaths cannot be hidden. Bihar was by court intervention required to carry out a data reconciliation exercise. Every state needs to do it,” he said. National Health Mission commissioner N Ramaswami said the death data reconciliation exercise would not impact the state’s cumulative death rate, which hovers between 1.7% and 1.8% at present. The state has declared over 1.06 lakh deaths so far, and adding another 10% wouldn’t change anything. “We are being transparent in data gathering and presentation so that we have the entire picture,” he said. Planning for the third wave, which many experts said is inevitable, would be more effective if there is appropriate transparency about the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-deaths-not-going-down-as-fast-as-cases-pushing-up-state-cfr/articleshow/83472238.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Nagpur||GMCH Nagpur one of 11 sites selected for real world study on vaccine efficacy||NAGPUR: There have been cases in the country in which people tested positive for Covid-19, and even hospitalized, despite taking one or both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. Several such cases were reported in Nagpur too. Now, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has decided to conduct a ‘real world’ study of vaccine efficacy to understand this phenomenon. This study is completely different from clinical trials. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are used to evaluate treatment outcomes while real-world data helps in understanding effectiveness and safety of the vaccine in everyday clinical practice. The data is collected outside of the controlled environment of conventional RCTs. Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Nagpur, will be one of the 11 sites for this nationwide study launched by ICMR through the National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai. The study will determine vaccine effectiveness in preventing severe Covid-19 infection. Dr Uday Narlawar, head of the department of preventive and social medicine at GMCH confirmed this TOI. “We will track nearly 260 citizens. Some will be Covid-19 positive people who were hospitalized after vaccination. The rest will be vaccinated people who have tested negative in RT-PCR test,” he said. According to experts, this research will determine if vaccine efficacy is influenced by factors such as age, prior Covid infection, number of doses administered and virus variants. Epidemiologist Dr Anand Thatte said that the study is important because there hasn’t been a real-world assessment of any of the vaccines yet. “Many doctors have tested positive despite taking both the doses. I think the study will help us to know whether the mutation was behind this or something else,” he said. Nagpur has been selected as a study site for a special reason. The second wave of Covid-19 is supposed to have started from parts of Vidarbha and Nagpur was the first big city to witness a major surge in cases and deaths in the second wave. The 11 other sites are from Rajasthan, Gujarat, Odisha, Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Nationally, the survey will track nearly 3,900 citizens. Of these, 1,300 will be Covid-positive people who were hospitalized after vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmch-one-of-11-sites-selected-for-real-world-study-on-vaccine-efficacy/articleshow/83445883.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Three arrested in ULC scam by SIT probing role of cops||MUMBAI: The special investigation team (SIT) inquiring into allegations of corruption against Thane police during their probe into the Urban Land Ceiling Regulation Act scam in 2016 arrested three people, including a former town planner of Mira-Bhayander and an architect. Retired town planner Satyavan Dashrat Dhanegao (54), ULC junior draftsman of town planning office Bharat Kamble (56) and assistant to architect Chandrashekar Limaye (55) were remanded in police custody till June 14 by a Thane court. The crime branch is looking for Dilip Gheware, assistant director in charge of town planning, Mira-Bhayander, who has not been traced. Officials said that they have sent summons to Gheware in his office as well as his residence, but he has not responded and his mobile phones too are switched off. The inquiry pertains to investigations carried out by the Thane crime branch in 2016. Several builders avoided surrendering excess land to the government by bribing government officials. They had obtained benefit under the ULC Act by showing residential plots as agricultural plots, according to the offence registered with Thane police. The fresh arrests come after the state ordered an investigation against IPS officer Param Bir Singh, who had probed the scam when he was Thane police commissioner, sources said. Police had earlier arrested 5 persons and had even filed a chargesheet in the case. Police said they have so far probed 5 land parcel surveys out of 17.  The state last month ordered an inquiry after builder Raju Shah wrote to the CM alleging that in 2016, while probing the ULC scam, ex- Thane police chief Singh had shown favours to many builders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-arrested-in-ulc-scam-by-sit-probing-role-of-cops/articleshow/83445915.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Raped by two call centre co-workers, girl kills self||VADODARA: A student of MSU who also worked at a call centre committed suicide on Thursday after she was allegedly raped by two of her colleagues. The girl was staying alone in Subhanpura after her mother died seven months ago and she reportedly did not get along well with her father. However, she hung herself at her father’s residence in a society in the Laxmipura area of the city. While police started investigations after registering the incident as an unnatural death found the statements out of place and informed doctors that the case looked suspicious. “It came to light that the girl had been staying alone away from her father. She came to her father’s residence only on June 8,” said police inspector R C Kanamiya, who is investigating the case. Meanwhile the father, who had been telling the police all along that he did not know the reason behind her extreme step, revealed that the girl had been raped. The police also found injury marks on the victim’s neck and hand as well as traces of semen on her. Based on investigation, police arrested two of her colleagues — Dishant Kahar and Nazim Mirza — who were working with her in a business process solutions company in the city on Thursday night. Cops unearthed the fact that the girl had been raped after the duo allegedly got her drunk. Cops said Kahar raped her in the presence of Mirza on Tuesday evening. According to case details, Kahar and Mirza came to the victim’s residence to meet her on Tuesday evening. At the same time, another girl Radhika (name changed) was present at the victim’s residence. She left the house initially and so did the two youths. However, a little later the duo returned to the victim’s residence with a bottle of liquor. It has been alleged that the victim was forced to consume liquor by the two after which Kahar committed the crime in front of Mirza. When another friend of the victim, Shivam (name changed), came to her residence, he saw her and informed the father who rushed to the place and took her to his residence. The father told the police that the victim had hung herself at his residence on Thursday morning and it was Shivam who informed him. When the father reached home, the girl was being taken to the Gotri GMERS Hospital where she was declared dead. “He (father) was aware about it, but did not do anything about it fearing that his daughter would get a bad name,” Kanamiya added. Police have recovered an audio recording made by the victim as well as a suicide note that she had left behind. The investigators are, however, tight lipped about their contents and said that this would be released only after investigations reached some stage. The rape and suicide victim used to play kabaddi when she was in school and sources said that she had represented the state too in the sport. However, details in this regard were not available.

The phone was allegedly given to him by BJP leaders along with Rs 2.5 lakh to make him withdraw his candidature. The probe team has also collected CCTV footage from the mobile shop at Neerchal from where the phone was purchased. It is learnt that police have identified the persons who purchased the phone. The team also recorded the statement of Sundara’s mother at their house at Vaninagar. She is also understood to have told the officials that BJP leaders had given them money. Earlier, Sundara had told police that local BJP leaders came to his house at Vaninagar, took him to their office at Jodkkal where he was threatened to withdraw his nomination in March. He had reiterated before the police that he was promised money and a wine shop at Manjeswaram if Surendran won the election. He added that Surendran called him and gave an assurance. According to Sundara’s statement, Rs 2.5 lakh and a smartphone was given after he returned home. Sundara named local BJP leaders Suresh Naik, Ashok Shetty and former Yuva Morcha state treasurer Sunil Naik for threatening and keeping him in wrongful confinement. Though police have registered a case only against Surendran under 171 B (bribery involving giving a gratification to any person with the object of inducing him or any other person to exercise any electoral right or of rewarding any person for having exercised any such right) and 171 E sections, more persons would be included and IPC sections dealing with abduction, wrongful confinement and threatening may be added later. Sundara had contested as an independent in 2016 assembly elections and secured 467 votes which saw Surendran losing the polls by 89 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cb-takes-sundaras-phone-into-custody/articleshow/83444014.cms||---
---||Delhi||How liveable is Delhi? Index to track all variables||NEW DELHI: The draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 is a vision document that lays down the roadmap towards a “sustainable, liveable and vibrant Delhi”. The document has also proposed a ‘Delhi Liveability Index’ for assessing the overall progress of the city in implementing the MPD, based on 20 key performance indicators (KPIs). Out of the 20, ten core KPIs contribute to the Environmental Sustainability Index, which includes reduction in air pollution and controlling water pollution, green cover enhancement, rejuvenation of water bodies, wastewater reuse, groundwater augmentation, reducing flood risk, reducing stress on landfill sites and converting waste to wealth and increasing share of renewable energy. Six core KPIs contribute to the Built Environment Index, which are seismic compliance, fire safety, more ‘small format’ housing, slum rehabilitation, apart from shift towards public transport and adoption of electric vehicles, which also contribute to the Environmental Sustainability Index. Four core KPIs contribute to the City Vitality Index. These are human development index, heritage conservation, vibrancy of public streets and participation of women in the workforce. The Delhi Liveability Index would be an overarching index, which will be computed by using the progress against all 20 indicators, for which baseline data has already been collected by Delhi Development Authority (DDA). DDA will launch an online citizen portal for providing information on a regular basis on the MPD 2041 and also respond to queries from citizens. An online dashboard with real-time analysis of data and reporting on various milestones and achievements may be included within the portal, the draft MPD 2041 proposes. The draft plan has proposed setting up three monitoring committees — Environmental Sustainability Committee, Built Environment Committee and City Vitality Committee – which will have representatives from concerned departments and civic agencies and shall be chaired by a senior officer from DDA. These committees will monitor the progress achieved against the three goals of the MPD, develop an annual progress report and report on an annual basis to a high-powered Apex Review Committee, chaired by the lieutenant governor. There will also be various coordination committees for multi-agency coordination, which will take stock of the progress, facilitate inter-agency coordination and address any hurdle for implementation. A data protocol will be defined to decide the process, particulars and periodicity of sharing of data by concerned agencies, to ensure collation required data for supporting plan monitoring. All the KPIs are quantitative and will be measured against desired targets for each five-year period between 2021 and 2041. The committees will set the targets within the first year of plan implementation in consultation will all agencies involved. A dedicated web portal will be set up by DDA for the agencies to upload the KPI data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-liveable-is-your-city-index-to-track-all-variables/articleshow/83445907.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai qualifies for L 2, but curbs to stay||Mumbai: The state’s review of Covid-19 indicators for this week has put over 50% of the districts in the Level 1 category, which allows for a near-total opening up. Although cities like Mumbai and Pune have bettered their performance and are eligible to go from Level 3 to Level 2 that allows further relaxations like opening up of malls and unrestricted shop timings, the BMC is not keen on easing restrictions. Civic chief I S Chahal told TOI the city will remain under Level 3 restrictions till cases come down to 100-200/ day. The Pune civic body has announced some relaxations applicable in Level 2 from Monday. Mumbai’s weekly positivity rate (June 4-10) was 4.4%, down from 5.6% (May 28-June 3), while the oxygen bed occupancy was 27.1%, making it eligible for an upgrade. In the MMR, corporations like Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli will continue to be in their current category of Level 2 and Level 3. Although KDMC is at the border of Level 2 and 3, the administration has decided to continue with the restrictions till June 20. Meanwhile, Palghar district, including the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation, will move from Level 3 to Level 2 from Monday, said district collector Dr Manek Gursal. The Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation in Thane district will also move from Level 3 to 2 from Monday. The Navi Mumbai civic corporation will continue in Level 2 as the oxygen bed occupancy is above 25%, but the positivity rate is hovering around 2%. Since last week, the Maharashtra government has started a 5-level staggered unlocking based on key Covid-19 indicators like weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds. These indicators are reviewed by the public health department every Thursday, and based on weekly performance, districts and big cities are upgraded or downgraded on the relaxation scale. Last week, there were 10 districts in Level 1; they have now gone up to 19 in just one week. “There is definitely an improvement in the Covid-19 indicators in the state. However, six districts from western Maharashtra and the Konkan still have a positivity rate of over 10%, and we have to ensure that cases are brought under control. Containment efforts should continue in these districts,” said a senior official. As far as the state is concerned, its weekly positivity rate has dropped to 5.8% and oxygen bed occupancy is 16.9% as against 25.9% based on the weekly average from May 28 to June 3. Also, the total number of beds occupied today in absolute numbers is only 20,167, down from 31,224 last week. As per the data, Kolhapur has the highest positivity rate (15.8%) and its oxygen bed occupancy is at 67.4%, also the highest in the state. Meanwhile, Gondia recorded the lowest positivity rate of 0.8%, while Wardha recorded the lowest bed occupancy level of 1.57%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-qualifies-for-l-2-but-curbs-to-stay/articleshow/83447448.cms||---

Two stalls in the market also suffered damage but no one sufeered injuries. Pune fire brigade brought the blaze under control within 20 minutes. “We suspect a short circuit caused the fire,” said fire officer Pradeep Khedekar. He added that the fire brigade received information about the fire at the market at around 12.30am. “Three fire tenders and a water tanker were immediately sent to the spot. Thick smoke was emanating from the roof of the 135-year-old structure. We used ladders and climbed on the roof with water pipes. We controlled the fire within 20 minutes,” Khedekar said. The officer said that empty crates of fruit kept in two stalls were destroyed in the fire. The firemen checked the wooden ceiling after dousing the fire. “We found old electric wiring and we suspect a short circuit may have caused the fire,” Khedekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/old-wooden-structure-gutted-in-fire-in-mandai/articleshow/83444001.cms||---

---||Trichy||Central districts surpass Tamil Nadu average in test positivity rate||TRICHY: Seven of the eight central districts have recorded an average test positivity rate (TPR) higher than the state average of 11.7% for the week ending June 9. What is comforting is that the TPR ranged between 11% and 12.7% in most of the districts on June 9, which were almost half of that registered in the early days of the month. Although positivity rates are expected to fall further, district administrations plan to intensify fever surveillance in rural blocks, enforce home isolation protocols stringently and ramp up testing. Perambalur and Ariyalur, being both geographically smaller and less populated districts, had 29.6% and 22.1% TPR on June 3 while Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur had 23.4%, 20.9% and 15.7% respectively. However, officials said fresh cases started declining from June 6. Apart from the lockdown, doorstep fever screening, identifying over 1,000 potential cases in each district, helped as an early intervention. While Thanjavur continued to test over 6,000 samples daily on most days, Perambalur was the only district to have tested less than 1,000. “We have been testing the primary and secondary contacts of people who tested positive. The public movement declined heavily after the lockdown, so it impacted the sample collection at random spots and fever camps,” a senior health official in Perambalur said. In Ariyalur, the district administration has been rejecting permission for home isolation and suggesting Covid care centres for those with mild infections. Officials were deputed even at petrol bunks to enquire with customers the reasons for refilling vehicles. “Social gathering is restricted and special teams were formed to avoid crowding. Unwanted travel within the district was the reason for the high positivity rate, we are at it to reduce the spread,” district collector D Rathna said. The districts have shifted the focus to rural and semi-urban parts now. Thanjavur, Karur and Tiruvarur have managed to reduce the TPR without reducing the sample sizes through micro surveillance. With 10.45%, Pudukottai has recorded the lowest positivity rate in the region. Deputy director of health B Kalaivani said: “Even when Covid cases were at the peak, Pudukottai reported an average of 250 on many days. This was despite no changes in the sample collection. We are collecting up to 2,500 per day, matching the testing capacity of our lab,” the official added.

---||Jaipur||‘Sodala elevated road has design flaws’||Jaipur: The elevated road at Sodala lacks several basic road safety parameters, making it prone to accidents. The road safety of ‘Elevated Corridor Ajmer Road Jaipur’ carried out by road safety auditors in November 2020 pointed out that the project lacks in basics like signages, speed calming measures, markings and design at some places is not appropriately leading to sharp curves. The report prepared by BL Swami, professor of civil engineering department, MNIT, who audited the road safety report for the JDA in November 2020, says that in the absence of advanced sign system, pavement markings, road studs to regulate and warn the commuters before entry to the elevated road corridor, gives an impression of a speeding road. “The absence of vital information at the beginning doesn’t give any signal or impression about the kind of road, especially to the first-time user. It is a very common practice which is missing,” said Swami, adding that crossing the Metro line from above creates an illusion making the patch highly vulnerable. “The road takes a sharp curve while the Metro goes straight on its path confusing the commuter, who is under the impression to follow the road or Metro line. The curve has to be straight by erecting an extra pillar on the right side to minimise the possibility of accidents,” said Swami. His observation says that speeding is a major issue on the elevated road which should be controlled by speed calming measures, signages and monitoring. “The commuter takes the advantage of the barrier or traffic light road by maintaining a high speed. Even heavy vehicles like buses and trucks were observed speeding more than the permissible limits, which makes it highly prone to accidents,” said Swami. The other members of the team include Dr Arun Gaur, Sudhir Kumar and Pankaj Dhemla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sodala-elevated-road-has-design-flaws/articleshow/83445999.cms||---

---||Madurai||No coercive steps for recovery of loans: Madras HC||MADURAI: A petition was filed before the Madras high court on Friday seeking to prevent coercive steps against farmers for recovery of loans borrowed by them from banks. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the prayer which was sought for by the petitioner, P Ayyakannu, state president of the National South Indian River Interlinking Agriculturist Sangam based at Trichy, is the matter of policy decision which is to be taken by the central government. If such a decision is taken, it would amount to postponing the recovery and consequently may result in waiver of the interest or penal interest recoverable during the said period. The judges observed that they are of the prima facie view that this court cannot issue any positive direction to direct the central government to take a decision in a particular manner. The judges said that they were informed that the chief minister M K Stalin has already spoken about the said issue and the matter is taken up at higher levels. Since the matter was brought to the knowledge of this court, the judges directed the central and state governments to place before this court the developments in this regard. In his petition, Ayyakannu had stated that while the farmers are suffering a lot due to monsoon failure, the Covid-19 pandemic has made them suffer more financially. Hence, he sought not to take any coercive steps against the farmers for recovery of loans borrowed by them from nationalised banks, private scheduled banks and private financial institutions. He also sought to postpone such recovery proceedings for two years owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/no-coercive-steps-for-recovery-of-loans-hc/articleshow/83444072.cms||---

Raut is accused of forging the commencement certificate of his Sai Shraddha building in Vijay Nagar, Nalasopara (east), and selling the flats. When a buyer complained to the Vasai-Virar municipal corporation on March 31, notices were issued, but he did not respond. The Tulinj police filed a case on Thursday on a complaint by civic officer Pradeep Avdekar. Raut has been booked for cheating and forgery and under sections of the Maharashtra Town Planning Act. No arrest has been made. Raut made news when he complained on May 24 that his cars, a Mercedes Benz and Toyota Fortuner, had been taken away by two inspectors working with then Thane police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The cars, he feared, were used in the murder of Hiren, whose stolen Scorpio led to the security scare outside the house of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. Hiren’s body was found in a creek in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builder-linked-to-hiren-case-booked-for-forgery/articleshow/83446008.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata star hotels bet on staycation to boost business||KOLKATA: Star hotels in the city are now betting on staycation to keep their business afloat in the pandemic. Most hotels have been witnessing a rapid drop in business in the past two to three months, when the second wave of the novel coronavirus peaked. They had, however, had a better time in December to February, after Covid cases declined following the first wave and travels picked up. But ever since the restrictions were imposed to tackle the spread of the virus and consequently, travel—both for pleasure and business—declined, star hotels in the city, including ITC Royal Bengal, Westin, JW Marriott, Lalit Great Eastern and Holiday Inn, have been hit hard. They are all now relying on staycation packages, trying to attract the residents of Kolkata with the offer of a luxurious, pampering vacation within the safety of their hotels within the city. Most of the guests, hotel officials said, were from the city and nearby locations, within “car-friendly distances”. A spokesperson for ITC hotels pointed out that domestic travellers were “indulging in safe city staycations or safestaycations”. As the name itself suggested, he said, people from within the city were expected to check into the hotel for a break from the drudgery of being confined to their homes, with nowhere to go. Also, travellers from different cities in India, largely those close to Kolkata and could be driven to by cars were also the target population. “Even in pre-Covid times, ITC Hotel staycations have been immensely popular, especially at ITC Sonar and ITC Royal Bengal. Requirement for safe staycation has increased manifold. Residents may want to take a break from their homes opt for a brand and location they trust,” the spokesperson added. Rishi Jain, director of Holiday Inn, said it was getting good response for its staycation packages. He claimed they were receiving more than 30% occupancy from these packages. “A lot of people are preferring to stay at our hotels for a few days to break the boredom at home. We are getting a lot of corporate clients who are utilizing their travel allowances by staying in luxury comfort. This, despite the fact pools and spas are now not operational owing to the restrictions,” he added. According to Jain, guests were being served food in their rooms as restaurants in hotels were also shut under the safety rules. The general manager of Lalit Great Eastern, Dilip Mishra, felt the packages and the business would gain momentum from July. “We have staycation packages but we have not received much response so far. Things may change once the restrictions are lifted. The wedding season will soon start and business will improve,” he added. Echoing him, JW Marriott general manager Sumeet Suri said that occupancy now was not very encouraging but July was likely to be better. “The wedding season and gradual unlocking will boost business,” he added. Subhas Sinha, general manager of Westin, pointed out that some people, who had got both the doses of Covid vaccines, were coming booking stays at their hotel. “People are getting bored at home. So, they are opting for a hassle-free break in five-star comfort at an affordable price,” Sinha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-star-hotels-bet-on-staycation-to-boost-biz/articleshow/83444461.cms||---

Therefore, speed guns will detect the motorists and the cop will relay the information to the cops posted on the other end of the road. They will stop and issue challan,” he said.Apart from speed guns, the Jaipur police said that advanced cameras and scanners that catch the registration number of speeding vehicles will be installed soon.The road with its menacingly narrow stretch and sharp cuts has long been a dreaded spot. It is also a favourite destination for youngsters to race through the road.A traffic cop who patrolled the area said after 11pm the road literally becomes a racing track.“You can nearby residents how they stopped using the lane (elevated road) after witnessing harrowing incidents. Heavily drunk youths play out loud music and celebrate birthdays on the narrow lanes, sometimes even parking cars near sharp turns,” the cop told TOI.The officials told TOI that apart from sharp turns, the elevated road has many electric poles on plinths which are jutting out of main barrier wall, “Sometimes these poles are situated just near sharp turns and vehicles can easily bump into them,” the cop added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/speed-guns-to-curb-repeated-accidents/articleshow/83446018.cms||---

To date, this ‘Covid War Room’ (CWR) team has resolved 1,107 requests for help and arranged over Rs 40 lakh financial aid, for patients and their families. Comprising ex and current students of the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-Hyderabad), the team came together in response to a deluge of appeals for crucial assistance for Covid patients during the second wave. “When I started, I wanted to save at least one life,” said the founder, Sriharsha Karamchati, an ex-student who is now the co-founder of Questbook. He created a technical ecosystem of support, through a volunteer army, and crowd-sourced data and funding. Recollecting the first request he received for funds, Sriharsha said that it was from a disconsolate daughter, who had already lost her mother to Covid-19 and needed Rs 1.5 lakh a day for her critically ill father. “Donate Rs 350 that you would spend on a meal’ was an Instagram post that touched hearts and by the next morning, donations started rolling in. ‘She could save her father for one more day’ was the follow-up Instagram post. By next day, we had Rs 6 lakh. Though her father couldn’t evetually make it, her words of gratitude touched a chord,” said Sriharsha adding that he was astounded by the impact that his Twitter, Instagram posts had. He was also pleasantly surprised by the number of people who turned up to volunteer. “I started with reaching out to close friends and put a request for volunteers on the IIITH Life Facebook page. The next day I had 250 volunteers. They were added to subgroups that catered to specific requirements — for medicines, blood, or bed for Covid and non-Covid patients. There are also dedicated teams for requests, resources and verification,” he said. The primary purpose of the team: To free patients’ attendants from worrying about logistics so that they can spend quality time with their loved ones. “My 11-month-old daughter tested positive for Covid-19 and we had no money for her treatment. The team came forward and raised Rs 2 lakh. She is now discharged and is healthy. We shall always be grateful to CWR,” said Yakobu K, a daily wage labourer.

---||Kozhikode||Tree felling: P Dhanesh Kumar reinstated in forest department’s SIT||KOZHIKODE: After forest department decision to drop Kozhikode Flying Squad DFO, P Dhanesh Kumar from the special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the illegal tree felling scam led to a controversy and put a question mark over the credibility of the entire investigation, the department reinstated the officer on Friday. Kumar – who had unearthed the alleged illegal activities conducted by the key accused in the case and also the lapses on the part of certain forest officials – is now back in the team with enhanced responsibilities. Principal chief conservator of forests (vigilance and forest intelligence) Ganga Singh had issued orders on June 9 appointing Kumar as head of one of the five teams tasked to enquire into the illegal tree felling in Thrissur and Ernakulam. On June 10, department issued another order dropping him as team leader citing administrative reason and appointed Punalur Flying Squad DFO Baiju Krishnan in his place. However, the department was forced to appoint Kumar and Kothamangalam DFO Aju Varghese in the SIT ‘to strengthen the supervision of the ongoing investigation process’. It is learnt that the decision to reinstate Kumar was taken following the intervention of forest minister A K Saseendran who had said that he was unaware of Kumar’s exit from the team. As per the new order, Kumar will assist the conservator of forests (I&E) Kottayam in monitoring the probe teams conducting investigations in Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Ernakulam. Kothamangalam Flying Squad DFO, Saju Varghese will assist the CF (I&E), Kozhikode in the remaining six districts. The decision to drop Kumar, who had in his inquiry report in February unearthed the alleged illegal activities conducted by accused in the Muttil case Roji Augustine, had raised doubts about the investigation process coming under pressure even before it started. Also, he was dropped on the day the accused Roji Augustine raised unsubstantiated allegations against him in an interview with a private channel. The inquiry report submitted by Kumar to the CF(I&E), Kozhikode had laid bare the collusion on the part of a senior superintendent in the South Wayanad DFO office in helping create a backdated duplicate copy of Form 4 pass for Muttil tree felling case accused Augustine. Also, his report had flagged lapses in granting Property Mark registration to Surya Timbers, the firm owned by Augustine. He had said in the report the lapse on the part of senior superintendent was not a casual mistake but due to outside pressure or threats. Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samiti had said that dropping Kumar from the inquiry team is a pointer to how the probe will proceed and what its outcome will be. “The statement by forest minister that the decision was taken without his knowledge is a disgrace. The officials who have been dropped are the most honest and able officers in the forest department,” said samiti president N Badusha. Meanwhile, the flying squad of the forest department from Thiruvananthapuram inspected the range office in Erumely in Kottayam as part of the investigation in Muttil tree felling case. The squad examined whether the office gave permission to cut trees from pattaya land. They examined records for the past one year. They are also examining the applications received by the office regarding this and the decisions taken on them. Erumely range officer Jayakumar said that no such permission was given from the office after 2017. He said applicants were personally informed about the rejection of applications. The inspection team from vigilance wing of forest control flying squad from Thiruvananthapuram was led by DFO A Shanavas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/tree-felling-dhanesh-kumar-reinstated-in-forest-depts-sit/articleshow/83444149.cms||---

He told reporters in Dindigul on Friday that Raju had claimed that all details of crop loans and agricultural loans were available online, but in reality, the former minister did not know the difference between computerisation and online transaction. “The primary cooperative banks have computers, but they are not integrated with the central cooperative banks, hence the question of online transactions does not arise,” he said. He said the loan waiver announcement was made on January 31, but there is information that it was given to those who had applied the day before the announcement, and this would be thoroughly investigated. Out of the 4,451 primary cooperative banks, there were many which did not have funds to provide loans, but there were records to show that loans had been given through them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/aiadmks-agri-loan-waivers-under-lens-min/articleshow/83444091.cms||---

Each of these children, who have been rehabilitated, further asked 10 children not to fall in this trap. Stationeries, play items, and health and hygiene kits were distributed by Chetna, an NGO, among these 500 children in seven slums in east and west Delhi to protect them from Covid-19 and give them educational opportunities. The settlements are in Old and New Seemapuri, Anand Vihar and Dilshad Garden in east Delhi and in Old and New Shakurbasti, Punjabi Bagh and Valmiki Camp on Lawrence Road in west Delhi. The pandemic has pushed scores of vulnerable children into child labour. A 9-year-old child at a slum in east Delhi said, “I am glad to take the oath today, I promise not to get involved in child labour and also protect other children. I will contact Childline 1098 if I see any such child.” Sanjay Gupta, Director of Childhood Enhancement Through Training and Action, said, “As schools are closed, parents have lost their job and the availability of social services have decreased, many street-connected children are pushed into work situation.

---||Delhi||Court denies bail to man who cheated ‘hapless citizens’||New Delhi: The act of cheating hapless citizens when they were already suffering under the wrath of the pandemic is grossly atrocious, inhumane and obnoxious, a Delhi court has stated while dismissing the bail plea of a man. The man was arrested for allegedly duping people on the pretext of providing them with Covid-19 medicines such as actemra and remdesivir. The order passed by additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana further highlighted that the accused, Sameer Khan, was reported to be the “kingpin” of a crime syndicate involved in cheating hapless citizens, who were “frantically looking for medicines during the present pandemic scare”. “The applicant/accused is alleged to be controlling the bank account where the cheated amount was received from the duped victims. Recovery of the debit card of the account along with the link of the mobile number of the applicant/accused with the said account number goes a long way against plea of false implications,” the order stated. Khan’s counsel Vaibhav Kumar contended that the allegation of the police did not have the constituents of cheating and neither was there dishonesty nor any fraudulent intention. He also argued that the prerequisites for commission of the offence of cheating were absent as no money was received in his client's account besides he wasn't even aware of any such transaction. He also stressed that Khan's name did not even feature in the FIR. Bail was also sought on the grounds of the poor health of Khan's parents, who were dependent on him. Additional public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed pointed out that a message/link for sale of Covid-19 medicines Actemra of Roche and Remdesivir of Cipla was doing the rounds on social media but when a preliminary enquiry was carried out, a “large-scale cheating and fraud” was found to be the motive behind it. The accused persons, he said, were accepting money in a bank account at Danapur, Bihar and the account holder was found to be Kishan Kumar and the contact number for the related transaction belonged to Khan. Therefore, it was the prosecutor's contention that the applicant had control over the bank transactions of the fraudulent sales. Approximately Rs 3.8 lakh was reportedly found in the bank account in question following transfers from various accounts, the investigation showed. The police had acted on complaints received on the cybercrime portal, and arrested a co-accused Vijay Benedict, who termed Khan to be the kingpin of the conspiracy. The court considered the nature of the offence and the seriousness of allegations, finding Khan's bail plea "bereft of any merits" while dismissing it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-denies-bail-to-man-who-cheated-hapless-citizens/articleshow/83446135.cms||Aamir Khan

The company, which has one of its main manufacturing units at Ahmednagar in Maharashtra, supplies plastic injection modules — for washing machines, air conditioners, and air-coolers — to a wide array of household consumer goods brands. It also takes on manufacturing for brands owned by prominent e-commerce platforms. “Despite having a washout in the first quarter of the precious previous fiscal, our toplines improved by around 10%, and our products business has contributed around 30% of our revenue. Markets fully opened around August to September last year, and there was substantial pent-up demand till Diwali. Given the current situation, we are both cautious and optimistic,” said Vikas Gupta, executive director of the firm. He said production in May was a “washout” as well, with the plant shutting down. Production resumed with eased restrictions from the beginning of June. Gupta added the plant has raised capital to expand its Ahmednagar premises, to build up more capacity for its expected demand in air conditioners. He added that due to the continued lockdowns and monsoon setting in, washing machines are the appliances seeing the most demand across India, while demand for air-coolers and air-conditioners has “tapered off”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pg-electroplast-cautiously-optimistic/articleshow/83444128.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

However, no district administration issued relief notification on Friday. Now, the notifications declaring some concessions from the Covid curbs are expected on Saturday or Sunday. With only 607 new cases reported and 1,502 patients recovering in the day, the Covid-19 situation continued to improve in the region. Total 26 Covid deaths were reported in the day. With more recoveries than number of new cases, the recovery rate continued to remain at 97%, which is better than both state and national average. Decline in new cases is significant for Vidarbha as it’s happening despite increased testing. On Friday, about 42,000 tests were done in 11 districts, including 12,000+ in Nagpur. On the other hand, the number of patients under treatment reduced to 10,619 on Friday. With majority of them in home isolation, the number of unoccupied oxygen beds in Vidarbha has increased significantly. Due to this, all districts are now eligible for elevation in the lockdown level tally. Only Gadchiroli and Akola are the two districts which missed the level 1 eligibility by a fraction.

---||Goa||At graduation, PG level, Goa has more women, but far fewer hostels for them||PANAJI: Around 60% of students enrolled at the graduate and postgraduate level in Goa are girls. Yet, in hostels attached to institutes of higher education in Goa, the hostel space available to girls is lower than the facilities available for boys. Similarly, actual occupancy of hostels by female students too is lower, as per the all-India survey on higher education (AISHE) 2019-20, released on Thursday. Academicians said that for a state with one of the best female gross enrolment ratios in higher education, there seems to exist a cultural reluctance to let girls reside in hostels. At the undergraduate level, 57% of students pursuing education through regular mode in Goa are girls. At the postgraduate level, this percentage is even higher, with 63.5% of the enrolment being girls. One would think this would automatically translate into a higher number of hostel spaces for girls. But the hostel beds available for females are lower by almost 1,000 as compared to boys, with 2,967 beds for boys and 2,059 beds for girls. It appears that hostel bed availability is linked to demand, as with 1,940 boys and 1,301 girls residing in hostels, female hostel occupancy is lower by more than 600 students. “There is some reluctance from families in letting female students opt for hostels,” said former Goa University registrar Vijayendra Kamat. “A lot of our local Goan students do not prefer hostels at all,” said one woman academic. Some even spend two hours travelling by to GU from as far as Quepem.” This is probably a cultural thing. Hostel culture is new in Goa. And a lot of the male students living in Goa are actually those from outside Goa,” said one woman academic. Academicians said that after upgradation of hostel facilities at Goa University, at least at the varsity level, the number of hostel spaces available for female students were on par or more than those available for male students. However, she said that the resistance to living in a hostel was more from families when it comes to female students in Goa. The cost of living in a hostel was high, and the preference from families to spend more on boys’ education also cannot be ruled out, she said. “Usually, a majority of students from the science stream stay in hostels because they have lab work to do. Staying in hostel allows one more time to be connected academically, and there is no exhaustion of long bus travels, but no matter how much I try to convince female students, they are not willing. Unlike in places like Pune, where even their grandparents have lived in hostels, in Goa, we have many first-generation learners. It is also a cultural thing that they feel safer if the girls stay home and travel for studies,” said the female professor. Academicians also said that across the country, rules tend to be stricter when it comes to girls’ hostels than boys’ hostels, which could also be one contributing factor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-grad-pg-level-goa-has-more-women-but-far-fewer-hostels-for-them/articleshow/83446126.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

They said that it is proposed to use CCTV cameras for effective imposition of fines on persons doing so. The BMC monitors the city through the several CCTV cameras located at various areas. BMC said that while regular cleaning of rain water channels namely nallas and rivers is done it is observed that these have plastic and garbage floating in the,. are being which hinders the flow of rain water. As per the municipal bye-laws, Rs. 200 is imposed on persons doing so. However henceforth this would be done more strictly. This move also comes in wake of the opposition making charges that cleaning of drains was not done which led to severe water logging in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cctv-to-check-littering-in-nullahs/articleshow/83447454.cms||---
---||Goa||As picnickers flock to Kurdi, government to keep eye on village||MARGAO: The “underwater” village of Kurdi in Sanguem, which is now turning out to be a favourite spot among picnickers, is now on the radar of the government authorities. Sanguem deputy collector Sagar Gaude along with mamlatdar Manoj Korgaonkar visited the village on Thursday and noticed visitors violating pandemic SOPs. They also found that unscrupulous revelers had left behind litter. As the village comes under the reservoir submergence of the Salaulim irrigation project and, therefore, comes under the jurisdiction of the water resources department (WRD), Gaude on Friday convened a meeting with WRD officials and sought a status report of the area. Taking cognizance of a commemorative event organised by members of a minority community in the village recently, a video clip of which has since gone viral, Gaude also directed WRD officials to submit a report on it. Police were also directed to conduct regular patrolling at the village to ensure that visitors don’t misbehave and that there are no attempts to incite communal disharmony. The WRD is expected to submit its report to the office of the deputy collector by Monday. The thrill of exploring an underwater village located amidst idyllic surroundings has been drawing hordes of visitors to the place for a few weeks preceding the monsoons. Concerned citizens have raised apprehensions over the safety of the vehicles using the roads and old unused culverts here. Locals also frequent the village once it reappears to go fishing in the waters using canoes. The fact that the area is not within the range of any mobile network adds to the concerns that communication could be hampered in case of any disaster. The nearest health centre and fire station are located 20km away from Kurdi. Residents of surrounding villages have also expressed their disapproval over the nuisance created by some visitors by leaving behind empty beer bottles and leftover food in the open. The Kurdi village went under water after it came under the reservoir submergence of Salaulim irrigation project over 30 years ago. Most parts of the village resurface for a brief while once the water level recedes during summer, before going underwater once the monsoons set in. The relics of the ancient Someshwar temple, and a RCC building that once housed a police outpost are some landmarks that bear telltale marks of the once bustling village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-picnickers-flock-to-kurdi-govt-to-keep-eye-on-village/articleshow/83446201.cms||---

A team of the Mundhwa police, led by assistant inspector Vijay Chandan, took the criminal, Yash Dadar of Wadgaonsheri, in custody after checking footage of over 100 CCTV cameras. Dadar, having six cases against him, followed the IT professional on a scooter and outraged her modesty. “During the questioning, Dadar revealed that he had stolen the scooter and followed the woman. He parked the scooter from where he had stolen it after the incident and went home,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/criminal-held-in-outraging-modesty-case/articleshow/83444151.cms||---
---||Lucknow||PM Narendra Modi lauded CM's steps to battle second wave: Uttar Pradesh government||LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday appreciated the measures taken by the UP government in battling the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, an official statement put out soon after UP CM Yogi Adityanath returned to Lucknow from the national Capital said. It added that Modi complimented the measures taken by the state government during his meeting with the CM. The meeting between Modi and Adityanath was held against the backdrop of wild speculation about the BJP leadership’s unhappiness with the CM and a plan to clip his wings. The UP government’s description of what transpired in the hour-long meeting was seen as a riposte to rumour mongers who have stoked murmurs of an “imminent” change in Lucknow, leaving BJP circles simultaneously bewildered and intrigued with their perseverance. CM meets President Ramnath Kovind at Rashtrapati Bhawan on Friday.Soon after the meeting, an obscure news site quoted “PMO sources” as saying that A K Sharma, the former bureaucrat who served in Modi’s office before being nominated as an MLC in UP, would be appointed deputy chief minister. When contacted, sources in the PMO slammed the claim as “fake”. During the meeting, Adityanath expressed gratitude for the Centre’s help during the peak of the crisis. He thanked the Centre especially for rushing stocks of oxygen on trains and aircraft. He told the PM that funds provided under PM Cares would help the state government in setting up oxygen plants in all districts. Adityanath’s engagements in Delhi, which included meetings with home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda, have been linked to the possibility of a ministerial reshuffle in UP. The presence of Anupriya Patel, who heads BJP’s ally in UP Apna Dal, in the meeting that Shah had with the CM, has been seen as a pointer to the expansion of the ministry, likely to be undertaken with a view to assuage the ally and accommodate claims from within. The official claim about the CM being complimented by Modi was also seen as a sign of Adityanath feeling reassured as BJP leaders are not expected to spin developments concerning the PM. The “change chatter”, which has buffeted the CM for some time, intensified during the second wave of Covid-19 infections. Statements by BJP general secretary in charge of party organisation B L Santhosh praising the state government for taming the threat brought no respite. During the meeting with Modi, Adityanath said the Centre’s decision to provide vaccines to the state would help speed up the vaccination drive which has been put into top gear with BJP’s organisational machinery helping the state government ramp up the massive enterprise. Adityanath also discussed development works undertaken by his government and projects which will get complete in the near future. He told the PM how his government tried to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoods by imposing partial curfews, instead of a complete lockdown. He informed the PM of the state government’s decision to swiftly implement the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana — entailing free grains up to 5 kg to the needy — till Diwali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-praised-ups-measures-to-battle-2nd-wave-up-govt/articleshow/83446162.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Bharat Biotech: Massive phase-3 Covaxin data taking time to process||HYDERABAD: Amid the row over Bharat Biotech not making its Covaxin phase-3 data public in June, as promised earlier, the company said processing of the data is underway and it will apply for full licensure after the final analysis data is available by July. Covaxin is the only vaccine to have conducted and completed one of the largest ever Phase-3 efficacy trials in India with 25,800 subjects, most other Covid-19 vaccines have only conducted immunogenicity studies and not efficacy studies in the Indian population, it said. Elaborating on the reasons for delays in revealing the final data, Raches Ella, head of business development and advocacy, Bharat Biotech, said in a tweet: “Ph-3 timelines and reasons to trust the process: the largest efficacy trial conducted in the developing world (sample size=25,800) with the last volunteer being vaccinated in mid-March, add two months (based on CDSCO/ FDA requirement for 2-months post dose-2 safety follow-up) and we are in mid-May with sufficient data for quality checks and analysis.” “Data captured thus far: each participant has 30 separate forms and with 25,800 participants, individual data points = 70.4 lakh. Quality (query) checks completed = 2.1 lakh. Thanks to the courageous investigators and field staff (350) ensuring compliance in the midst of the second wave,” he said. Ella also pointed out that to remain unbiased, Bharat/ ICMR cannot access any data. “Our service provider, IQVIA, has started the final statistical analysis. After submitting efficacy and 2-months of safety to CDSCO (July), it is expected to instantly reach a pre-print server. Peer review takes 2-4 months,” he said. Ella, who is also the project lead for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at Bharat Biotech, said that the nine publications on Covaxin are a testament to Bharat Biotech and ICMR’s scientific prowess. “The efficacy paper will be our 10th. If you are looking for Covid vaccine data generated in India, rest assured you will find only Covaxin…,” he said. The row was triggered by a Twitter spat between Raches Ella and Kolkata-based endocrinologist Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh over the latter’s study comparing immune responses of Covaxin and Covishield. Bharat Biotech went on to slam the comparative study as flawed. “This is not a peer reviewed publication, nor statistically and scientifically designed study, the study design and conduct reflect an ad hoc analysis, rather than a predetermined hypothesis,” it had said. “Further, the study was not registered on CTRI website, nor approved by CDSCO and SEC…Factually studies involving human clinical trials and human subjects should obtain their approvals,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bb-massive-phase-3-covaxin-data-taking-time-to-process/articleshow/83446174.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The posters demonstrate the open rift between the EPS and OPS factions. The ones which appeared in many parts of Tirunelveli district including Mannur two days ago blamed Palaniswami for the AIADMK debacle in the elections. They said his high-handedness and decisions without consulting O Panneerselvam cost them dearly and that the mantle should be handed over to OPS. A complaint has been filed against those responsible for the posters with the Tirunelveli police. On Thursday, some posters thanking the MLAs for electing Palaniswami as Opposition leader appeared at Thalaiyoothu in the district. Though they were in favour of OPS, there was no mention of names. Those in favour of EPS had the photographs and names of the functionaries. AIADMK sources said cadres loyal to the party are left confused due to such actions of their seniors. Meanwhile, posters hailing OPS as “protector of the AIADMK fortress”, were put up on behalf of Theni district fishermen’s wing of AIADMK on the Theni- Madurai road. They had photographs of late CM J Jayalalithaa, OPS, his son P Ravindranath, and member of the fishermen’s wing and former councillor Vaigai Karuppuji. The poster wars are expected to increase before the party’s legislative party meeting on Monday. AIADMK leader Bharani Sankaralingam, one of those behind pro-EPS posters, said some unwanted elements were trying to create a rift in the party, but that the cadres were ready to work under the leadership of the two leaders. Their poster also had OPS on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/eps-ops-posters-war-heats-up-in-southern-districts/articleshow/83444150.cms||---

The organ donation benefited six patients in Pune and Mumbai. “Relatives of 13 brain-dead persons have donated their vital organs so far this year in Pune. These organ donations have benefited 25 individuals suffering from end-stage heart, liver, kidney, lungs and bowel conditions,” said Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator, Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee. The 33-year-old donor was a voluntary social worker and worked as a technician with a private cable operator. “He hailed from Beed but had been staying with his wife, children, and parents in Pimpri for more than 20 years,” said Mayuri Barge, transplant coordinator at DY Patil Medical College in Pimpri. The man had been complaining of a headache for four days and collapsed while at home. He was immediately rushed to DY Patil Medical College and Hospital in Pimpri on June 6. “He was diagnosed with intracranial bleeding due to high blood pressure that had remained undetected,” Barge said. The man was declared brain dead on June 9. After counselling, the family consented to donate his vital organs. The man’s liver and two kidneys were transplanted into three patients suffering from end-stage liver and kidney diseases at DY Patil Medical College and Hospital in Pimpri. The organ donor’s heart benefited a 23-year-old patient at Jaslok Hospital and both his lungs benefited a 46-year-old woman at HN Reliance Hospital in Mumbai. The man’s small bowel gave a new lease of life to a 52-year-old woman at Jupiter Hospital in Pune. Last week, TOI had reported that the city has recorded the second-highest number of cadaver organ donations even as the pandemic rages on this year in Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-mans-organs-benefit-6-patients-in-pune-mumbai/articleshow/83444190.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Several residents took to social media alleging that “illegal construction of roads” in the seismic zone has made such instances more common. Abhai Mishra, a resident, said, “I don’t understand why roads are being built in the area when there are clear directions from the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) that there must be no construction of roads in the area between Tsong river and Sahstradhara river as the slope is too steep.” Talking to TOI, Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Srivastava said the debris from roads was being cleared by teams in coordination with the district administration. He added that the incident would be investigated by an additional district magistrate-level officer. Meanwhile, residents have urged authorities to shift them to safer locations ahead of the monsoon. Dinesh Singh, pradhan of Jhol village which suffered damage from the landslide, said, “Three families had to be shifted to the panchayat bhawan after the landslides. People are scared as only two hours of rainfall has wreaked such havoc. What will happen when the monsoon is in full force?” Subash, whose family was among those shifted after the landslide, said, “All our crops have been damaged. Our house has not suffered damage but we have relocated as we anticipate heavy rain in the days to come.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/landslide-cuts-off-5-villages-in-maldevta-muck-enters-homes/articleshow/83442234.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Threats and attacks are nothing new to DFO P Dhanesh Kumar||KOZHIKODE: When key accused in the tree felling scam, Roji Augustine levelled unsubstantiated, fake allegations against Kozhikode Flying Squad DFO P Dhanesh Kumar on live TV on Thursday, it was not the first time that one of the most-daring and courageous officers in the forest force was targeted. Kumar had faced worse, including physical assaults several times throughout his career right from ganja cultivators to elephant/tiger poachers and sandalwood smugglers. Speaking to TOI after he was reinstated in the SIT probing Muttil case, Kumar said he expected the timber mafia to target him after filing the inquiry report in Feb which revealed their roles including forgery and tampering of documents, which is a serious offence. “For me, it is not something new. Many have tried to finish me off in several ways all through my career. Levelling fake charges on TV was yet another attack. I have faced worse before,” he said. Kumar’s life was under serious threat after several interstate elephant and tiger poachers ganged up against him while he was serving in Chalakudy in 2006 as he nabbed poachers one by one. “We had arrested several most-wanted interstate poachers like Thattakam Davis who had killed 12 tigers in Karnataka and two in Kerala, Kunhome Varkey who had killed two dozen elephants. After the arrest of poacher Madhura Jolly, his brother tried to kill me. We became the prime enemy of poachers in entire south India. But the then vigilance director Upendra Varma, who was fond of conservation, directed police protection for me and my family which helped save our lives,” he said. In another lasting contribution to Kerala, Kumar singlehandedly helped the government reclaim over 7000 acres during his career, including the 6000 acres under ‘Operation Clean Nelliyampathy’ while serving as DFO there from 2007 to 2011. Kumar fought long battles in court and also dug through land records in sub-registrar offices to expose violations by around three dozen powerful plantations including encroachment, use of forged documents and lease condition violations. Also, he helped reclaim over 1,000 acres of EFL and vested forest land in eco-fragile lands in Wayanad, including Brahmagiri hills. But his battles against powerful mafias took its toll. His leg was fractured during an attack by ganja mafia in Attapadi. He was forced to keep his family away fearing attacks from the mafia. Also during his posting in Marayoor, he exposed interstate sandal smuggling mafia, with links to Andhra Pradesh. After he took on cinnamon bark poachers at Meppadi in Wayanad in 2005, he was attacked and had to be hospitalized and operated upon. He had to face physical assaults from mafia and quotation gangs while serving in Mananthavady and Marayoor. In 2007, he received the award for the ‘best wildlife management trainee on the Indian Subcontinent’ from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun and ‘good service entry’ award from forest department. Kumar was awarded chief minister’s medal by VS Achuthanandan government in 2007. He won the national level Sanctuary Asia Award in 2012 and Wildlife Service Award of Wildlife Protection Society of India for protecting Nelliyampathy hills. He said that his unending battles are led by a firm conviction that the battle to save forests and wildlife is a duty to be waged for the generations to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/threats-and-attacks-are-nothing-new-to-dfo-kumar/articleshow/83444232.cms||---
---||Madurai||Prices of building materials up 30%, upset home dreams||Madurai: Prices of construction material including cement, sand, blue metal and iron have increased by 30% in just two weeks, resulting in a corresponding increase in construction costs much to the shock of consumers. Many say they will not be able to complete their houses if this is the trend. G Annadurai of Gomathypuram who started constructing two additional bedrooms says a price rise of this scale is unprecedented. ``When I started constructing in March, I purchased a tonne of iron rods for Rs 58,000, but the same has gone up to Rs 74,000 on Friday. This will make it very difficult for builders like me,’’ he said. S Shankar of Vilangudi says he started construction of his 1,200 squarefeet house with a loan of Rs 50 lakh. “Now, even if I cut all establishment cost, it will cost me over Rs 80 lakh which is beyond my means,’’ he said. He points out that many like him would have to start repaying bank loans for homes that have not been completed, when the specified time for repayment starts. While building promoters who started projects have put them on hold, individuals who obtained bank loans are in dire straits. M Ganeshan had decided to start construction of his house in December 2019. He started work but it slowed down due to Covid. Realising that he would not be able to continue with the construction due to escalating costs, he tried to sell the incomplete structure, but was not able to find a buyer.  ``My estimate was Rs 50 lakh, and now with the bank loan I need to sell it for at least Rs 90 lakh,’’ he said. A Asokan of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam, who is into construction, says that an increase in cement price is always expected when a new government takes charge as there is a big lobby for it. ``But an increase from Rs 370 to Rs 520 in less than a month is way too much,’’ he said adding the government should take steps to rein in the prices. Another reason for the prices going up is stated to be the rising fuel prices. Engineer G Raja, a contractor, says builders were badly affected during the last lockdown but now the price of materials was making it further difficult for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/prices-of-building-materials-up-30-upset-home-dreams/articleshow/83444189.cms||---

The new drive, Tika Utsav 3.0, is part of the state’s target to ensure that every individual from eligible groups have received at least one dose by July 31. The drive will be conducted at 164 locations at the panchayat and municipality level, as well as 40 permanent locations by the directorate of health services. Sawant said that in Goa, 30% of those in the 45-60 age group haven’t yet taken even the first dose of the vaccine. “PM Narendra Modi has taken a decision to give vaccination free of cost to all above the age of 18, following which we started vaccination accordingly in the 18 to 44 age group,” Sawant said. “For all those in this age group, we will start vaccination from Sunday under Tika Utsav 3.0.” We will have it in gram sabhas and municipalities, and a timetable will be declared soon. Without creating a rush, they can walk in and receive their dose.” He said that the state plans to vaccinate up to 250 persons a day at each of the vaccination centres. “But we need your cooperation,” the CM said. “Citizens are requested to go to their own gram panchayat or municipality itself on the declared day of the vaccination in your area. Kindly do not rush to other panchayats for vaccination. There is no need to register, and you can walk-in and take the vaccination. The Goa government has set a target of giving the first jab to all in eligible age groups by July 30.” Addressing vaccine hesitancy, Sawant stressed that there is no way to defeat Covid-19 other than taking the jab. “Today, 70% of those in the 45+ age group have taken the vaccine. I request my Goan brothers and sisters: We have 87 vaccination centres, and they should visit the centres and take their first dose of vaccination at the earliest,” Sawant said. He said that for the new drive from Sunday, one need not belong to any priority group. “We were worried that a third wave will affect children more,” he said. “Hence, from the 18-44 age group, we gave first preference to lactating mothers, parents with children upto age 15, youth with comorbidities and seafarers. We have received very good response over the past eight days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/walk-in-for-a-jab-from-sun-goa-opens-vax-drive-for-all/articleshow/83446175.cms||---

Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said, “Since natural identification of the bodies was not possible as they were burned beyond recognition, we had to go for the identification based on DNA testing. The state forensic laboratory officials confirmed the identity of all the bodies following the tests.” He said, “A separate legal medical report would be given to district administration, which would forward it to the state government for giving compensation to the victims’ families.” Dr Ajay Tawre, the superintendent of the Sassoon General Hospital, said, “The bone and teeth samples of the victims’ bodies and family members of the victims were sent to the state forensic laboratory, which matched the DNA for identification. Based on the forensic report, the bodies have been handed over to the families.” The family members of the victims demanded quick investigation into the fire tragedy and compensation. Venkatesh Kawade, who lost his wife Archana and brother-in-law Sachin Ghodke, said, “Speedy investigation is needed to punish the culprit. Also, the state government should give us the announced compensation at the earliest to overcome the financial crisis.” Kawade, hailing from Solapur, conducted last rites of the bodies at his native place on Friday. Like him, all other victims’ families performed the rituals at their respective places. On the investigation front, Deshmukh said, “We have recovered DVR recording of the closed circuit televition (CCTV) cameras from the firm during the inspection. The footage clearly shows where exactly the fire broke out. This would help us establish further link in the investigation. Also, we are seeking help from professional fire engineer to understand the possible reasons behind the fire.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pirangut-fire-victims-kin-get-bodies-seek-speedy-probe/articleshow/83444186.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Lucknow||Catharsis, healing touch can bring back Covid orphans||LUCKNOW: Ten-year-old Vedika (name changed on request) lost her mother to Covid-19 earlier this year but she did not grieve, let out her emotions or talk to the other family members for several days. When taken for counselling, she told her psychologist that it would worry her mother if she cried. She said her mother was still around and called her at night. Finally, she let out her emotions in the form of tears but only in the third counselling session. Many like Vedika have lost one or both their parents to Covid-19 in such a manner that they could not even bid them farewell and find closure to the grief. These children are still struggling and so are their families which have no clue on how to deal with children stuck in such a situation. Recently, UP government initiated a policy to take the children orphaned during the pandemic under its wings and help them with education, money and accommodation at shelter homes. Experts believe the children’s wellbeing and growth depends on their psychological, social and holistic care, for which the entire society should come forward. “Earlier, there was post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but now there are instances of post-Covid stress disorder (PCSD) which is affecting all, especially children. Previously, the age at which one caught depression was 16 but it has now come down to 10-11 years. Keeping these factors in mind, the government should come up with psychological, social and emotional development of these children,” said counselling psychologist Neha Anand who is also involved with Mission Shakti and UNICEF. “Most children are in formative years and if their emotional needs are not fulfiled, their communication skills will get affected, their self-confidence will depreciate and they may become delinquent. Counselling should be the first step towards catharsis so that they start talking. Psychometric analysis should be done where clinical psychologists would come into play and if medication is required psychotherapy and psychiatrists should be roped in,” she added. She suggested a dedicated mental helpline for counselling of orphaned children. Member of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) Sangeeta Sharma said between May and June, CWC received around 65 phone calls from families requiring help in communication with orphaned children. “We need to understand that these children used to live with their parents so they need to be taken into a similar environment with kindness and politeness. They are victims of trauma and we could lose them if we put them in regular shelter homes,” she said. Sharma said the staff for these dedicated shelter homes should be chosen meticulously and trained in dealing with empathy. “They can’t take it as another job. Individuals from the society should also be allowed to interact with these children. Social workers, NGOs and activists who already work with children should be included in this network so that the transition for them is smooth and they can grow as well rounded individuals,” she added. UP State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UPSCPCR) believes that immediate counselling along with economic help is the way forward for children. “We have been discussing the role of psychologists, sociologists and counselling in our internal meetings. We will put up a proposal before district level committees for constitution of a panel for counselling,” said UPSCPCR chairperson Vishesh Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/catharsis-healing-touch-can-bring-back-covid-orphans/articleshow/83446180.cms||Yusra Husain

Sharing the daily vaccination bulletin in a press conference, AAP functionary and MLA Atishi stated that on Friday, 81,156 people got vaccinated, of which 50,196 were administered their first dose and 30,960 their second dose. Over 59 lakh doses of Covid vaccines have been administered so far and 45,17,647 are those who have received the first dose, she said, adding that “as more and more people get vaccinated, herd immunity will develop, which will stem the spread of coronavirus.” “Daily vaccination rate had declined tremendously during the two weeks when the government did not have vaccines for the youth. Now that Delhi government has received the vaccines, 263 government centres are operating at 100 locations where people from the 18-44 age group are being vaccinated. The number of centres is expected to increase in the next few days,” Atishi said. “Till Friday morning, Delhi had around 5.25 lakh doses out of which 15,000 doses were of Covaxin, which we are using as the second dose. Five lakh doses of Covishield are available. For those above 45 years, we are carrying out an intensive outreach campaign titled ‘Jahan Vote, Vahin Vaccine’ wherein our BLOs and our ground teams are going to each and every house and registering those who are 45+ but have not been vaccinated yet,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/30-of-delhis-population-has-got-at-least-one-vaccine-shot/articleshow/83444309.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Bhiwandi residents Alkesh Ansari (20) and Sohail Ansari (18) were arrested for mobile thefts by Narpoli and Kongaon police and were released on bail a few months back, said a police officer. Initial investigations showed that the duo would sell the stolen mobile phones and splurge on themselves, he added. The incident took place on Wednesday, around 8pm, when Kanmila Raising, a native of Manipur who worked in a spa at a mall, was headed home with a friend. The Ansaris followed the autorickshaw on their bike for some time, the police said. The pillion rider tried to snatch Raising’s phone near Teen Hath Naka in Thane, but as she held on to it, she fell out of the autorickshaw and sustained major injuries on her head. Her friend took her to a private hospital and then to Kalwa hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival. “Alkesh and Sohail briefly switched on the victim’s mobile phone and the police could track them within 24 hours of the crime and arrest them,” said an officer. The police said the duo had been thrown out of their houses by their families so they were put up in a lodge in Bhiwandi’s Mankoli area. Raising and her two sisters had recently moved to Mumbai from their tribal village 200km from Imphal in search of jobs. They were living in a rented place at Kalina. Ray, a cousin of the deceased living in Mumbai since 16 years, said the family is still in shock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/fatal-phone-robbery-in-thane-arrested-duo-was-out-on-bail/articleshow/83457187.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

---||Madurai||23 Lankan nationals held for illegally entering India||MADURAI: Sleuths from the ‘Q’ branch of the state police arrested 23 Sri Lankan nationals and an Indian agent who helped them illegally enter India here on Friday. The Lankan nationals – all men – are of Tamil origin who settled in Sri Lanka. Preliminary inquiries revealed that they had sailed from Sri Lanka in a small fishing vessel nearly six weeks ago. They reached Tuticorin district before heading to Madurai where they stayed in the Kappalur industrial estate area. The Q Branch personnel, who were monitoring them based on a tip, searched the place and surrounded them on Friday.  Police said that the men tried to travel to Canada through Kerala with the assistance of four agents. The Indian agent, who helped them, was identified as Kasi Viswanathan. All the 24 people were taken to the government hospital and tested for Covid-19 before being produced before the judicial magistrate – III in the Madurai court for remand. They will be lodged in the Puzhal prison where foreign nationals are lodged. Meanwhile, based on the tip by the Q Branch, the enforcement agencies in Karnataka on Friday detained 38 Sri Lankan nationals, who sailed to India and tried to sail to Canada from Mangalore. Search is on for three other agents and people who helped them in the act. It includes Dinakaran, a LTTE sympathizer and his son Ashok Kumar.

---||Hyderabad||Another six months to complete first dose of adult population in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Facing an uphill task of vaccinating hundreds of thousands, health authorities on Friday said Telangana will take at least six months to complete the first dose of its adult population. Telangana has now given around 76 lakh doses (both doses) and 61 lakh first doses to its beneficiaries. The cumulative doses given by state are less than first doses given by some big states. The health department has so far completed vaccinating 7.5 lakh people under high risk groups and has proposed to vaccinate another 35-lakh people in the next round,” an official said. Telangana has around 2.72 crore people aged over 18 years and the state is administering an average of one lakh doses. Considering that around 61 lakh took their first jab already, and another 2 crore people need their first jab, it would take around six months only if the vaccine supply is uninterrupted and daily one lakh quota is maintained, otherwise it can get even further delayed, officials said. The state is also far behind all southern states. All southern states have administered more than 1 crore doses and states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, West Bengal have given more first doses than cumulative doses given by Telangana. Looking at various third wave predictions, the state may fall behind vaccine drive by the time. Health department director Dr Srinivasa Rao said state has the capacity to vaccinate 10 lakh people per day, but everything depends on the supply from the Centre. Centre for Cellular Molecular Biology (CCMB) former director Rakesh Mishra said that it would be best if 70 percent of the population takes the vaccine jab completely to achieve the herd immunity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/another-six-months-to-complete-first-dose-of-adult-population-in-telangana/articleshow/83446189.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Bars in hotels, restaurants and clubs are out of business due to the lockdown. As per the order, the bars which have already renewed their licences for the current financial year as of June 11 will be eligible for the waiver. While the government will not refund the exempted money, the notification said the same will be adjusted for the licence fees for 2022-23. The hotel and restaurant industry has been demanding the waiver of the licence fees for at least for the first quarter as the establishments remained closed due to the state government’s lockdown guidelines. Ranvijay Singh, joint secretary of Hotel, Restaurants Association of Rajasthan, said, "While we are thankful for the relaxation, we would also like to draw attention of the government to the issue of penalty on short lifting of the liquor." The bars have to pay a penalty if they fail to sell 10% more liquor compared to the quarter in the previous year. Singh said since all the hotels and restaurants remained closed, there is no way they can sell 10% more liquor compared to the previous quarter. "We also request the government to waive off the penalty," added Singh. The industry had submitted a list of demands like refunds of pending SGST payments with the government, auto renewal of all licences and grant of industry benefits among others. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-waives-25-liquor-licence-fees-for-hotels-restaurants-bars/articleshow/83446187.cms||---

The duo bludgeoned the youth, Ashishkumar Gautam, to death after noticing him near their house in the early hours of May 17 and dumped the body. Following their arrest, the police on Thursday recovered his highly decomposed body from a secluded area near Ranjangaon. Inspector Sureshkumar Raut of the Ranjangaon police said Gautam worked in a timber shop in Ranjangaon. Around 5am on May 17, he had left the house and did not return. “After searching him, Gautam’s cousin filed a missing person’s complaint with the police on the same day,” he said. Raut said a case of abduction was registered later as the complainant suspected that someone might have abducted Gautam. “A special team of the local crime branch, led by assistant inspector Sachin Kale, was fanned to probe the missing person’s complaint,” he said. The police team got an information that a scrap dealer had reprimanded the missing person, Gautam, a few months ago because he suspected the latter was having an affair with one of his relatives. The team kept a watch on the scrap dealer. “The police then received a tip-off that the scrap dealer and his son had thrashed Gautam after noticing him peeping into their house in the odd hours,” Raut said. He said the police then took the scrap dealer into custody. “During the sustained questioning, the scrap dealer admitted that he had reprimanded Gautam as he used to talk with one of his woman relatives. He also revealed that in the early hours of May 17, he had noticed Gautam peeing into his house. Furious by this, he and his son bludgeoned Gautam to death and dumped the body,” Raut said. On Thursday, 35-year-old man mechanic was arrested by the Loni Kalbhor police on the charge of strangulating his ailing 67-year-old father to death and then slitting his throat with a blade in their residence in Uruli Kanchan on Tuesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/scrap-dealer-son-held-on-charge-of-murdering-youth/articleshow/83444274.cms||---

Officials said it is being used only for additional inputs. They could not confirm when it will be fully operational. The S band Doppler weather radar atop a building in Colaba’s Navy Nagar has not been operational since last month. An S band radar can track weather within a 500km radius, while a C band radar’s range is 250-350km. Dr Jayanta Sarkar, scientist and head (IMD Mumbai), said, “Certain parameters need to be checked before the radar is fully operational. Trial runs are on for reflectivity and velocity. We want to make it operational at the earliest.” Dr Sarkar said engineers were working on the Doppler radar and IMD is waiting for spare parts from Bengaluru. Due to the pandemic, there were hurdles in getting the C band radar at Jogeshwari operational earlier. The Doppler radar was installed following the July 26 deluge in 2005, when the city received 944mm of rain. Weathermen said for a city like Mumbai it was not enough to rely on one radar. “The C band radar needs to be calibrated as soon as possible. Like other instruments, calibrations play a very important role in radars, or you will see incorrect features in radars, which will affect real-time monitoring or associated forecasting. We need the S band too. C band radars have a smaller dish,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist who is a PhD student at Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-imd-begins-trials-on-lower-range-radar/articleshow/83446272.cms||Richa Pinto

Till Friday morning, the water supply was regularised for around 30,000 locals.” Locals have also alleged that water shortage is a perennial issue in Almora. “The district needs 16 million litres of water per day but we just get about 8-10 million litres of water. The residents deal with a water shortage all around the year,” said an Almora local wishing anonymity. When queried on the issue, Khati said, “The pipeline being used currently is 25 years old but we are laying a new pipeline to address the shortage in the water supply.” Meanwhile, traffic movements have also been disrupted on several routes in the district due to rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rain-spells-lead-to-water-crisis-in-almora-over-90k-people-impacted/articleshow/83442329.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar meets strategist Prashant Kishor, 3-hour chat fuels speculation||MUMBAI: Master poll strategist Prashant Kishor was hosted by NCP president Sharad Pawar on Friday for a long interaction that set off speculation about plans to rally the opposition under a common banner. The meeting comes against the backdrop of assembly polls in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu where regional parties dominated. Prashant Kishor has been credited with playing a key role in Mamata Banerjee and M K Stalin’s successful election campaigns. The interaction took place at Pawar’s Silver Oak residence in south Mumbai, with his daughter and MP Supriya Sule and his grand nephew and MLA Rohit Pawar in attendance. The discussion lasted three hours. Pawar’s recent efforts to take a lead for opposition unity at the national level against the BJP and his key role in forging the Maha Vikas Aghadi, a tripartite front of differing ideologies, lent an added context to the engagement. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said since the victories of Banerjee and M K Stalin, it has been confirmed that in days to come, regional parties will play a decisive role. “Pawar has embarked on a new mission, to unite opposition parties against the NDA leadership for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,” Malik said. “There can’t be a one nation one culture formula. India is multi-cultural and multi-lingual, we will have to mobilize the people to halt the progress of BJP,” he said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said he was not aware of the nature of discussions held by Pawar and Prashant Kishor, but he pointed out that the poll strategist has already announced that he is quitting this space. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said Congress had no comments to offer. “We feel that Congress under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi has already initiated a series of steps for opposition unity and the results will be seen in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections,” Sawant said. Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant welcomed the interaction and said the party would be “happy” if Pawar becomes Prime Minister. He recalled that Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray had extended support to Pratibha Patil in elections to the post of President “because she was a Marathi candidate. Saheb had said Maharashtra needs a regional leader at the national level,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-pawar-meets-strategist-prashant-kishor-3-hr-chat-fuels-speculation/articleshow/83446228.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Addressing the media on Friday, he said the demand from farmers in this regard had been a long pending one and talks were going on since 2017. “The order was issued in 2020 following complaints that the circular issued earlier was not providing the intended benefits to farmers,” he said. The minister said that the order did not allow felling of trees from all Patta land but allowed the same on land assigned under Kerala Land Assignment Rules 1964. “Revenue department issued the order when the demands came up before us and following the firm belief that it was a genuine demand from farmers,” he said, adding that the order was revoked after it came to notice that some persons were misusing it. The order issued by revenue principal secretary A Jayathilak dated October 24, 2020, allowed farmers to fell the trees which they had planted in the land assigned to them under Kerala Land Assignment Rules 1964 and the trees that have naturally grown in the land and also trees which were present on the land at the time of assignment, except sandalwood, if the land owners had remitted the tree value of reserved trees during the time of assignment. But there were complaints that the order was being misused to fell all trees from assigned land, including centuries-old rosewood trees which did not come under the order’s purview. Based on the complaints, Jayathilak issued a new order revoking the order of Oct 24 saying that it has come to the government’s notice that the order was being misinterpreted to fell even the trees reserved as per schedule while assigning the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/controversial-order-issued-to-help-farmers-ex-revenue-min/articleshow/83444315.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi’s first drive-in facility shut over new vaccination pricing||New Delhi: There will be no vaccination at Delhi’s first drive-in facility started by Aakash Healthcare at Vegas Mall in Dwarka from Saturday onwards. The facility has been shut owing to new vaccination pricing, the hospital said. “We were running two vaccination centres – one is a walk-in facility and another a drive-thru. All of our staff and resources will be diverted to the walk-in facility for vaccination and the drive-in facility will cease to function,” Dr Ashish Chaudhry, managing director of Aakash Healthcare said. The hospital was offering Covishield at the drive-in facility at Rs 1,400 per dose. “We had put up tents, installed air-conditioners and made other arrangements to make the vaccination process convenient. With reduction in vaccine price, running the special facility became unviable,” he added. While government hospitals offer Covid-19 vaccine for free, the government has notified that private hospitals will charge Rs 780 for a shot of Covishield, Rs 1,410 for Covaxin and Rs 1,145 for Sputnik V. These include taxes as well as Rs 150 as service charge. Many private hospitals have raised concerns that the service charge for vaccination capped at Rs 150 may not be adequate for them to organise sessions outside of hospital. However, the government has clarified, the ceiling may not apply to off-site camps. “Fortis healthcare has taken several initiatives to make vaccination available in residential areas and workplaces, providing ease and convenience to senior citizens and corporate employees. Unfortunately, the cap of Rs 150 will not cover the additional costs incurred for such off-site vaccination camps that involve substantial cost like ambulance, transport, extra staff and doctor,” the Fortis group said in a statement recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-first-drive-in-facility-shut-over-new-vaccination-pricing/articleshow/83444352.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Quirk of rule: Private SSC students could pass with Class V score in Maharashtra||Going by the rules introduced by the state during the pandemic years, students appearing for the SSC exam privately this year can pass with marks they had scored as far back as Class V. Since the state government has decided to evaluate regular students with 50% marks from Class IX and the remaining 50% from the current academic year, the issue of the Class IX marks for external students was raised. The state board has decided to tabulate the marks that these students scored in their last exam, from Class V to VIII. The marks scored by these students in their most recent exams will have to converted to 80% and the remaining 20 marks will be awarded based on the oral and practical exams that the schools will conduct for these external students, said officials. A majority of external students are dropouts. Often students migrate and do not enrol in schools in the new place, or encounter other circumstances hampering regular schooling. They are allowed to appear for the SSC exam at a later date by taking private coaching. Experts and educators said there was no comparison between the marks scored in Class V and Class IX. School principal of Indutai Pawar English medium school Latika Mane agreed, but pointed out it would help these students pursue further education. “A large number of students work during the day and study at night and have a poor history with education. Many teachers follow up with such students to bring them back to schools or convince them to appear for the SSC exam externally so that they pursue further education. The new rule will be helpful,” Mane said. Ashok Bhosale, secretary of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, said: “Their (external students’) marks for Class IX are not available as a majority of them drop out much earlier. For students who have appeared through regular schools in Class IX and decided to appear for SSC through Form 17 (as external students), the Class IX marks need to be converted to 80% from the Saral system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/quirk-of-rule-pvt-ssc-students-could-pass-with-class-v-score-in-maharashtra/articleshow/83447531.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Anil Kumar on Friday led demonstrations by party workers at petrol pumps across the capital to protest against frequent hike in fuel prices. Kumar said that the unchecked rise in the prices of petrol and diesel has boosted the prices of all essential commodities, burdening people with unbearable expenses, while they are already under tremendous pressure due to the pandemic. Kumar, along with AICC general secretary K C Venugopal and AICC in-charge of Delhi Shakti Sinh Gohil demonstrated at the petrol pump at Delhi Gate, near the Feroze Shah Kotla stadium. Other senior members at the protests were Pawan Bansal, Mukul Wasnik, Harish Rawat, former Union Minister and DPCC president Ajay Maken and former DPCC presidents J P Agarwal and Subhash Chopra. Kumar said a major chunk of the enhanced cost of fuel goes in excise duty and value added tax. If these were reduced, petrol and diesel could be sold at much cheaper rates in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cong-protests-at-petrol-pumps-across-city-over-fuel-price-hikes/articleshow/83446248.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Son rushes from Germany with oxygen aid, saves dad||LUCKNOW: Saurabh Singh (28) was in Germany when he received the news that his mother was Covid-19 positive and was gasping for breath with no bed available in any hospital. He purchased an oxygen concentrator and took the first flight home. After landing in Lucknow, he came to know that his mother had passed away and so he went straight to the crematorium where while performing the last rites, the news arrived that his father too was critical. Saurabh rushed home and used the concentrator in the nick of time to stabilise his father, who even today, a month after being discharged from the hospital, uses it regularly due to post-Covid complications. An engineer, Saurabh works in Germany. His sister Kashish (25) and parents—father Rabindra (56) and mother Sadhuri (55)—were in Lucknow. The ordeal of the family started on April 12 when Kashish tested Covid positive. She isolated herself at home, but after six days, her mother complained of breathlessness and father arranged an oxygen cylinder with the help of neighbours. “After waiting for eight days for the Covid control room to send a team for contract tracing and sampling, she called a private lab for the tests of my parents on April 20. However, the condition of my mother started deteriorating the next day,” said Saurabh. “We took her to the emergency section of a government institute where she was stabilised, but a ventilator bed for Covid-19 patients was not given because the RT-PCR test report was awaited. We brought her home and put her on oxygen support, but two days later on April 23, she turned critical again. The oxygen cylinder emptied too. We then went to various hospitals in a private ambulance, but could not find a bed and she died in the ambulance itself. A day later, test results showed that both parents were positive,” an inconsolable Kashish recalled. As Saurabh was on way to Lucknow with his wife, he was not informed about his mother’s demise. “I kept praying throughout the journey for the safety of my family, but after landing at Amausi airport, came to know that mother has left us. The oxygen concentrator I had brought could not save my mother’s life, but provided life support to my father. However, since beds were not available in Lucknow, we took him to Azamgarh travelling over 250km in an ambulance and got him admitted to a private hospital where we got a bed through a contact,” he said. Saurabh also got infected and remained isolated with mild symptoms in Azamgarh. After 13 days in ICU, Rabindra was discharged on May 7 and by that time, Kashish and Saurabh also tested negative. “While in ICU, I saw seven patients dying in the hospital. My thoughts turned negative, but I recalled that my wife and I had promised each other that if one of us does not survive, the other will remain strong for our children,” said Rabindra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/son-rushes-from-germany-with-o2-aid-saves-dad/articleshow/83446247.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Rs 31 lakh theft at IRS officer’s south Mumbai flat cracked, 3 held||MUMBAI: They wore masks, donned hats and even changed vehicles and routes to mislead the police after stealing jewellery worth Rs 31 lakh from the Peddar Road residence of an IRS officer attached to the income-tax as deputy commissioner, but three months later, based on technical and human intelligence, Gamdevi police cracked the case. Arun (31) and Umesh Mukhia (27) were nabbed from Bihar, while another accused, identified only as Gupta, who runs a restaurant near Nehru Nagar slum in Juhu, was arrested on Thursday. The Mukhias, who also live in Nehru Nagar, told the police that they had given the jewellery to Gupta and he had paid them Rs 3 lakh. Arun, who worked as a domestic help in another flat in the same colony, was among those questioned in the case earlier. He quit his job last month. The robbery took place in March when the family was not at home. Two thieves entered the Income Tax Colony through the rear gate and went to the flat through the duct area. They broke open the cupboard and fled with gold, silver and platinum jewellery worth Rs 31 lakh and cash Rs 40,000. After an FIR was lodged, a team led by deputy police commissioner Rajiv Jain and comprising senior inspector R G Rajbhar, officers Vijay Dandwate and Sharad Gare was formed. Investigators analysed around 4,000 mobile phones’ dump data and questioned 35-40 domestic help. While scanning CCTV cameras, police found that the masked robbers took a cab from Peddar Road, got off at Bandra, entered a congested lane and hired an autorickshaw. At Santacruz they got off, walked half a km and took another auto. They got off at Juhu and walked in the opposite direction of their chawl. The police scanned six-eight autos and enquired with bus conductors at Juhu depot—the accused had taken a bus from Juhu to south Mumbai on the day of crime. Police found that two tickets were bought from Juhu for Haji Ali junction. “The accused had got off two bus stops before Haji Ali and walked to Peddar Road,” said an investigator. With no major breakthrough, the police again began focusing on technical and human intelligence. They zeroed in on two numbers from the dump data. One of the numbers was active in the bus when the accused were going from Juhu to south Mumbai. A team then traced the Mukhias to Bihar. During questioning, Arun said he was first arrested in a theft case in Mulund when he was a juvenile. He was arrested in another robbery case a couple of years ago. The weapon used in the robbery, a revolver, was hidden in his room and one of his roo-mmates accidentally fired it. Arun was then also booked for attempt to murder. “We are verifying his claims,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-31l-theft-at-irs-officers-sobo-flat-cracked-3-held/articleshow/83446324.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Nagpur||45 days in hospital, 25 days on ventilator, 35-year-old woman wins fight for life in Nagpur||NAGPUR: The never-say-die spirit of a 35-yr-old Covid-19 positive woman helped her beat corona after 25 days on ventilator, and return home to her 5-year-old daughter. Swapna Rasik, a home-maker, fought the virus for more than 45 days, from April 24. Swapna’s both lungs were badly infected and her condition deteriorated many times during her hospital stay. Finally, she pulled through and was reunited with her family on June 9. “My daughter Lorina was my motivation, inspiration and source of energy to continue this fight for life,” said Swapna. “Every time I was about to lose courage to live, I used to think about her,” she said. Doctors who treated Swapna also mentioned that she used to speak about her daughter even when she was very serious. Swapna had tested positive for Covid-19 on April 19, in the middle of the Covid-19 peak. After taking medicines at home for four-five days, she finally got a bed at KRIMS hospital. By then, the infection had spread in both her lungs. Her SpO2 level was under 80% and was not recovering. “Despite oxygen therapy, her SpO2 was not improving. So, we were left with no option but to put her on non-invasive ventilator. This ventilator was used with 100% capacity for 25 days,” said Dr Parimal Deshpande, who treated Swapna. “It’s a rare case for sure. It’s difficult for any person to recover after spending 25 days on ventilator,” said Dr Deshpande. Pulmonologist Dr Swapnil Bakamwar said that despite such long stay in hospital, the patient remained safe from post-Covid infections like mucormycosis. “Judicial use of steroids and other medicines is the key to keep the fungal infection away. This case is evidence that proper treatment, coupled with patient support, can bring even critical patient back from Covid-19,” he said. Dr Ashok Arbat, who led the treating team, said that their only aim was to save the mother. “Young age and not having any major comorbidity worked in favour of Swapna. Her love for her 5-year-old daughter played a motivating role in her journey,” said Dr Arbat, adding that her family members and especially her husband Ashish, who works in a private company, were very supportive. After discharge, Swapna will be in home isolation for next seven days. Ashish said that the news of Covid-19 deaths were coming from all sides during that period and doctors had asked him to be mentally prepared to get any news about Swapna. “But her fighting spirit, our prayers and doctors’ skills saved my wife,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/45-days-in-hospital-25-days-on-ventilator-35-yr-old-woman-wins-fight-for-life/articleshow/83446286.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Lucknow||Lucknow University revises guidelines for selection of asst profs amid ongoing process||LUCKNOW: Candidates appearing for the post of assistant professor at Lucknow University will now have to qualify two more rounds—appear in a written examination and classroom presentation—before final selection. The executive council (EC) of LU on Friday adopted the new faculty recruitment guidelines sent by the governor and chancellor of state universities. However, there was confusion on whether the new rule will be implemented in the ongoing selection process for 180 teaching posts in various departments. Since hundreds of candidates have already applied for vacancies as advertised by LU as per old rules, many teachers raised questions whether the new norms can be introduced in the middle of the process and whether they are in consonance with the University Grants Commission’s norms. LU vice-chancellor (VC) Prof AK Rai said that the university has sought the guidance of the chancellor on this issue through a query. A final decision to implement new rules in the ongoing selections process will be taken after chancellor’s directive, he added. He said that other state universities have also raised some queries which are pending with the chancellor. Till now, selections of assistant professors were based on an academic performance index (API) calculated as per qualifications, degrees, research and experience of a candidate. However, the new guidelines have added two more rounds. Some changes in API have also been made. The new guidelines issued by the governor last month are based on recommendations made by a committee comprising vice-chancellors of five state universities. The aim of the new rules is said to make the selection process transparent and tough to ensure qualified teachers are selected. The rules, however, do not apply for selection of associate professor and professor. The EC has also constituted a 14-member committee to finalise the modalities for conducting the examinations of second- and final-year undergraduate and final-year postgraduate courses as per the state government guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-revises-guidelines-for-selection-of-asst-profs-amid-ongoing-process/articleshow/83446283.cms||---

The permission to set up pump stations will not be granted in a 50-metre periphery of schools, hospitals and residential areas. As per the new guidelines, retail outlets shall not be located within a radial distance of 50 metres from schools, hospitals (10 beds and above) and residential areas designated as per local laws. Moreover, no high tension line shall pass over the retail outlet. An official said, “After witnessing the negative impact of petrol pumps on environment, directions were issued. Adhering to it, the state has also issued the directions.” At the central level last year, an expert committee was set up on the directions of the NGT which is seized of a plea seeking a cap on the number of petrol pumps so as to avoid their adverse effects on environment . “The committee recommendation were followed in framing the guideline for the state,” said an official. Official sources said the state government also plans to curtail the powers of local bodies, including municipal corporations, development authorities, municipalities and others, for changing land use of plots. As per the proposal, the development authority will now have the power to change the land use for a maximum area up to 4,000 sqm. Earlier, the authorities had power to change the land use of plot size 6,000sqm. Similarly, the municipal corporations and urban improvement trust (UIT) will be allowed to change the land use of the plot upto 2,500sqm against the previous 5,000sqm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-petrol-pumps-in-50-metre-radius-of-schools-hospitals/articleshow/83446277.cms||---

---||Delhi||On higher bandwidth: A plan to take Delhi on digital highway||NEW DELHI: Universal broadband access to every home in Delhi and connectivity at speeds of up to 1 Gbps to all its citizens through Wi-Fi hotspots through a network of ‘smart poles’ across the city, infrastructure for 5G network, data centres — the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 has prepared a digital roadmap for the city. The draft MPD41 notes that digital infrastructure and services are emerging as key enablers to Delhi’s growth, with the internet driving the app-based economy and services. In 2019, Delhi had over 5.7 crore phone connections, of which 5.4 crore were wireless connections, apart from 3.2 crore internet subscribers. The draft plan states that Delhi needs to align its telecommunication infrastructure and targets to the National Digital Communication Policy of 2018 (NDCP) and the Telegram Right of Way Rules, 2016 (ROW). It, accordingly, proposes strategies for a digitally enabled and connected city. MPD41 notes that Delhi requires adequate infrastructure provisions to support higher service levels like 5G and above, full city fibre coverage and integration of the city’s digital systems with IoT (Internet of Things), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and Big Data, among others. The document suggests that ‘smart poles’ may be installed in public areas, which apart from acting as Wi-Fi hotspots, would also have CCTV cameras, air pollution monitoring sensors, telecom antenna, solar lighting, public address and messaging systems and emergency call boxes. This network of smart poles across the city will be connected to the digital systems of civic agencies. As per the 'perspective plan for infrastructure service for Delhi 2041' of Delhi government, which forms an annexure to MPD41, at present a rental model to provide free Wi-Fi to Delhiites has been adopted. As part of this scheme, around 4,000 bus stops will be covered with a per user data limit of 15 GB. By 2041, Delhi government can plan to cover the entire city with Wi-Fi, including access in all public vehicles and public places like schools, colleges, hospitals, etc., with the bandwidth at Wi-Fi hotspots of up to 1 Gbps per user. The government considers smart poles as the way forward to accelerate the growth. The draft MPD recommends that data centres may be set up to meet the need for data storage and server management and digitally unified command and control centres may be set up by the local bodies as key drivers for effective urban management, especially traffic, safety, disaster response, etc. The document also states that connectivity through fibre-optics is considered to be more efficient in terms of internet speed and reliability of services and ‘Fibre First Initiative’ of NDCP and regulations of ROW policy will facilitate augmentation of telecom infrastructure. The state government also plans to establish Delhi as a hub for cloud computing, data communication systems, services and content hosting and delivery, apart from establishing centres of excellence including in spectrum management, telecom security and next generation access technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-higher-bandwidth-a-plan-to-take-delhi-on-digital-highway/articleshow/83446332.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||Lucknow University Teachers’ Association locks horns with vice-chancellor over 4 posts||LUCKNOW: Lucknow University Teachers’ Association on Friday locked horns with the vice-chancellor on amendment in the university’s statutes for including “four new posts”. The executive council (EC) passed a resolution to include the posts of four deans — in charge of research, academics, recruitment, and admissions, in Chapter 11A of the statutes. It will now be sent to the chancellor Governor Anandiben Patel for approval. However, within hours, LUTA wrote to the chancellor, describing the move as one against the UP State Universities Act and requested her to reject it. “All academic posts are defined in the Act with transparent provisions based on seniority and qualification, but the new proposal, if approved, will concentrate powers in the hands,” said LUTA president Vineet Kumar Verma. LU VC Prof AK Rai had created these four posts in March last year and made appointments on them after getting the EC’s approval. It was also sent for the chancellor’s approval. Simultaneously, some teachers had written to the chancellor questioning its legality. Subsequently, the chancellor sent back the proposal, asking LU to specify under which provision of the statutes it wanted to include these. The VC said “We followed the law which allows the university to propose amendments in statutes after getting it passed from EC/academic council and consent of the chancellor. The move will decentralise the system, ensure coordination and effective functioning.” Verma said that appointments on these posts have already been made without taking qualification/seniority into consideration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/luta-locks-horns-with-vc-over-4-posts/articleshow/83446325.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: National wildlife board approves Laldhang-Chillarkhal road||DEHRADUN: In a meeting of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), chaired by Union minister of forest, environment and climate change, Prakash Javadekar, an approval was issued for the contentious Laldhang-Chillarkhal forest motor road in Uttarakhand. A communique from the chief minister’s office (CMO) on Friday confirmed this. Last week, TOI had reported that the state government had once again resumed work on the 11.5-km road, which had been riddled in controversy as a 4.5 km stretch on it, from Chamaria bend to Siggadi Sot, is ecologically-sensitive and the only wildlife corridor between Corbett Tiger Reserve and Rajaji Tiger Reserve. Meanwhile, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that the local people would benefit from the road and an elevated passage will ensure culverts are built for the passage of animals. “The length of the elevated animal passage would be kept at 470 meters and the height at 6 meters,” said forest minister Harak Singh Rawat who was also present at the NBWL meeting. The forest minister told the board that the Laldhang-Chillarkhal forest motor road had been there since 1980 and it “just needs to be strengthened and paved between Chamaria source and Sigaddi source.” Chief minister Tirath Rawat approved all seven proposals and divisional forest officers (DFOs) were asked to complete the work on these at the earliest.A park would be developed near Chandrabani Khalsa for Rs 15.8 lakh and a trek route developed on Kyari-Nag Tibba-Surkanda Devi route with Rs 10 lakh. An amount of Rs 10 lakh has been earmarked for beautification of Sanjay Jheel in Rishikesh to develop it as a centre of water sports. At the meeting, CM Rawat also directed the forest department to weed out harmful plant species like Latenas (locally known as Kuri) and plant local species of grass, bamboo and fruit plants, in order to build a habitat where wildlife would thrive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/natl-wildlife-board-approves-laldhang-chillarkhal-road/articleshow/83442468.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt announces high-level multiple agency probe||Thiruvananthapuram: Government announced a high-level probe into the Muttil illegal tree felling case in Wayanad. CM Pinarayi Vijayan said on Friday that a team of officials drawn from multiple agencies will conduct a probe. “The government is going for a high-level probe in this regard. A special team of officers from crime branch, forests and VACB will probe the matter. Government is in the process of completing procedures for launching the probe,” he said. Vijayan said that there was a large demand from the farmers in Idukki that they weren’t allowed to fell trees in their land. The government had taken some decisions in connection with the issue three years ago. He said that revenue department’s controversial order was taken on the basis of that decision. He added that since the probe is being launched, those who have sinned will have to bear the consequences and there will be no leniency. With regards to the photograph that was displayed by MLA PT Thomas, in which the CM is seen shaking hands with one of the key accused in the tree felling case, Vijayan said that it was not a private meeting between him and the accused person. He clarified that it was an event conducted by Deshabhimani daily, in which the accused also participated. Meanwhile, forests minister AK Saseendran gave some clarifications regarding the allegations that he had met the accused in the tree felling case. The minister, who admitted that he had met the accused, clarified that he had met them in connection with the launching of the Mango mobile phone project. He said the accused had approached him with the proposal for distributing mobile phones for students. But he had told them that he cannot decide such things. The photograph being circulated now is the one clicked when the accused submitted a memorandum to him then, he said. He said that the motive behind those spreading false allegations is to link the government with the illegal tree fellers since the tenure of the previous LDF government. He said that the information is that the tree felling happened in revenue land and not forest land. It is being probed whether forest officers have a role in this matter and those found guilty will be penalized, he said. As per the information placed in the assembly, illegal tree fellers, who misused a government order by revenue department, have felled 101 rosewood trees that are centuries old, approximately costing Rs 10 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-announces-high-level-multiple-agency-probe/articleshow/83444403.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Travel body upset as Goa government fails to recognise sector’s workforce as frontline workers||PANAJI: The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) is upset with the state government for not granting its request to declare the tourism workforce as frontline workers (FLW) for vaccination when some states have already done so. More than a month ago, the TTAG had requested the government to declare people employed in the tourism sector as frontline workers so that they can be vaccinated at the earliest, and ideally before the industry is allowed to operate. “Vaccination is the way forward as nobody can predict when the pandemic will end. But the government is yet to consider our request even as other segments have already been declared as frontline workers,” president of TTAG Nilesh Shah said. As and when tourism trades will be allowed to operate, even if it is in a staggered manner, he said, people will have to follow Covid-19 safety norms as the industry will not be able to go ahead without Covid measures. “We don’t know what is in store for us. We will have to do business with Covid around. It must be ensured that people take all measures in place because we have seen people flouting the norms,” he said. Since last year, the TTAG has been insisting people not wearing masks in public spaces be penalised. “Even as cases are falling it is not a licence for people to flout norms. If such behaviour is tolerated, in no time we will be back to square one,” Shah added. The yardstick for permitting the hospitality industry to open, he said, should not be that it will be allowed only when cases are very low. There won’t be an ideal situation. “Staggered entry could be allowed in clubs and casinos but the key is Covid appropriate behaviour. The industry will have to self-regulate, and deny entry to visitors not showing Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/travel-body-upset-as-govt-fails-to-recognise-sectors-workforce-as-flw/articleshow/83446405.cms||---

According to the latest health bulletin, these new fatalities pushed the death toll from Covid-19 to 24,772. On Thursday, the city had recorded 305 new cases with a positivity rate of 0.41% and 45 deaths. On March 8, Delhi had recorded 239 cases and on March 9, the tally was 320, according to official data. The national capital started the unlocking process from Monday after remaining under lockdown since April 19, in view of a massive surge in Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic. Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day death count had been spiralling up. On April 20, the city had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in Delhi since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22, the case positivity rate was 36.2%, the highest so far. The highest number of 448 deaths was reported on May 3. However, the number of cases has shown a downward trend of late. The positivity rate too has been shrinking in the last several days. In the last 24 hours, a total of 77,112 tests, including 56,000 RT-PCR tests, were conducted, according to the health bulletin on Friday. The total number of cases reported in the city so far stood at 14,30,671, while over 14 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. The city now has 3,922 active cases, the bulletin said. The number of people under home isolation is 1,236, it added. “The number of new cases has come down, which is good. But we cannot let our guards down yet. In fact, there is a need to emphasise on strict adherence to the preventive measures, most importantly wearing a mask, to avoid resurgence of the infection,” doctors say. The easing of lockdown restrictions in Delhi has brought the much needed-relief for businesses, with public movement also increasing. However, the doctors said it is important to spread awareness about the importance of continuing to follow Covid appropriate behaviour – for example, wearing a mask in public places and maintaining social distance – to prevent another peak in Covid cases and the repercussions thereof.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/238-new-cases-lowest-in-nearly-3-months/articleshow/83444402.cms||---
---||Delhi||‘System working’, HC closes Covaxin case||New Delhi: Observing that the system is now working and people will be able to get vaccine slots, Delhi High Court on Friday ended proceedings in a batch of petitions seeking Covaxin second dose jabs for the 18-44 years group. “They are trying their best, both the state and central governments have taken steps due to which grievances of petitioners have been addressed to a large extent,” Justice Rekha Palli noted while disposing of three petitions filed by recipients of Covaxin’s first jab who had moved the court after finding it difficult to get the second dose. The high court also took into account the development of June 5 when Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has directed that all private hospitals and nursing homes functioning as Covid vaccination centres for Covaxin will ensure that for the age group of 18-44 years, they will vaccinate only those eligible for receiving it as second dose during June or till further orders. Meanwhile, the standing counsel for Delhi government, Anuj Aggarwal, apprised the court that after 40,000 doses, now an additional quantity of 20,000 doses of Covaxin has been procured for the 18-44 years age group from a special quota to administer the second dose. “We are good with 1.5 lakh doses,” Aggarwal said, adding that as part of the scheduled supply for June, 29,800 doses have also been received on June 10 and the total quantity of Covaxin received till June 10 for 18-44 years age group was 89,800 doses. The government informed the court that the number of slots available had already been increased from 150 to 200 per day at every vaccination site in schools, and as per the CoWin app, 49,206 beneficiaries had been vaccinated between June 7 and 10 with the second dose of Covaxin at government centres. Noting the submissions, the judge said, “This in my view will take care of the grievances of the petitioners… No further orders are called for and the petitions are disposed of.” The court also recorded its appreciation for the stand and steps taken by the counsel of the Centre and Delhi government and also the petitioners in bringing these issues to its attention, where they sought directions to the authorities to urgently provide a second dose of Covaxin as their allotted time period for the second shot is about to end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/system-working-hc-closes-covaxin-case/articleshow/83444452.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Protesting for roads, Rudrapur MLA says ‘wish to self-immolate and burn all PWD officials along’||RUDRAPUR: MLA Rajkumar Thukral, while staging a sit-in protest at the office of the executive engineer of the Public Works Department (PWD) to push the demand for construction of roads in Rudrapur, said that he wishes to self-immolate and burn all PWD officials along. The BJP leader said that the construction of 40 roads in his constituency has not begun even despite the projects getting approval two-and-a-half years ago. On Friday afternoon, Thukral went to the PWD office with some of his supporters and staged a sit-in at the office of Manoj Rai, executive engineer of PWD, who was not present in the building at the time. Subsequently, Rai reached the PWD office and pacified Thukral telling him that a budget of Rs 11 crore has been released and the construction work for 34 out of 40 road projects will start soon. To this, the BJP MLA said, “Shall I commit suicide? ... I wish to self immolate and also burn you all by sprinkling petrol on you.” He added that he will start an indefinite hunger strike if the construction work doesn't start in a week. Earlier this month, Thukral had sparked a row after he said that the people of West Bengal will thrash CM Mamata Banerjee with shoes and throw her out of the state. He had made the remark in the context of the alleged atrocities against BJP party workers in West Bengal. Meanwhile, Jagdish Taneja, Rudrapur Congress president, said, “Thukral is losing his mental balance as we are approaching the assembly elections in the state. He is aware that dilapidated roads are going to be a major issue in the election and wants to show the public that he is concerned about development.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/protesting-for-roads-rudrapur-mla-says-wish-to-self-immolate-and-burn-all-pwd-officials-along/articleshow/83442517.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Addressing media after leading an NDA delegation to locations in Muttil where trees were felled, he questioned the silence of Wayanad MP, Rahul Gandhi over the issue and asked whether it was due to an understanding with the LDF government. He also took a dig at the CPM saying that those who had taken out protests to save Amazon forests two years ago are now helping to clear the Western Ghats. “What has happened is the gravest environmental exploitation in the history of state. Farmers and tribesmen were duped through the order issued in the guise of helping farmers. It is clear that the first Pinarayi government tried to help the timber mafia and not farmers,” he alleged. Muraleedharan said forest and revenue ministers of the previous government cannot wash their hands of the issue and added that the acquaintance of the key accused with the chief minister should be examined. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/scam-took-place-with-govt-help/articleshow/83444440.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh’s vaccination drive to hit top gear with new plan to reach out to recipients||LUCKNOW: With Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath setting big targets for vaccination campaign, the Uttar Pradesh government is set to come up with a revised programme to boost inoculations in the state. The new plan, called cluster approach to Covid-19 vaccination, aims at intensifying public mobilisation in small geographical areas. Under the new programme, the government plans to use electoral rolls to identify eligible persons and contacting them for vaccination which may come as a game changer. The step will be a major shift from the present approach of ‘people going to the health system rather than the system reaching out to the people’. The district magistrates across the state have already been informed about the cluster approach and a presentation on the plan was made by health officials in a meeting presided over by the chief secretary a few days ago. The draft of the cluster approach, pending for approval and formal issuance has been developed with the help of partners including UNICEF, WHO, Rotary, CSOs and NGOs. It envisages division of every development block into several equal parts for focused work and prescribes listing out of available resources like vaccinators and collates the requirement for staff like verifiers and data entry operators. Thereafter, the strategy prescribes formulation of micro-plans at sub-block level to saturate the unit in a prescribed time. Speaking on the use of electoral rolls, government sources said there would not be any coercion as vaccination was not mandatory but highly recommended. Advance planning and daily review for identification of left out eligible persons and use of communication teams to convince them would be the salient features of the strategy. The districts will be covered in a phased manner and those left out would be covered in mop-up rounds. District level officials will deploy additional vaccinators on Wednesdays and Saturdays. A communication drill will precede the actual vaccination campaign to mobilise people and motivate the reluctant ones. Essential arrangements related to adverse events following immunisation will also be in place. The steps aim at augmenting the existing recommendations made by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, besides promising to give a shot in the arm to UP’s pace of Covid-19 vaccination. As per available data, over 2.2 crore vaccinations have taken place in UP since the launch of the programme on January 16. Sessions have been organised for an estimated 125 days since then which translates into an average of 1.76 lakh vaccinations per day. According to experts, if UP wants to vaccinate its entire eligible population of 13.6 crore people by the end of the year, it needs to increase its daily capacity by nine times. Launching Mission June, the CM had instructed health department officials to ensure at least one crore vaccinations this month. In an interview to the TOI, the CM had said that provided UP gets ample stock, the state government would vaccinate 10-12 lakh people per day from July onwards. He also emphasised that people should understand that vaccine was the most potent tool against coronavirus, especially with the risk of a possible third wave of pandemic. The CM has also directed officials to make arrangements to vaccinate 10 crore people over the next three months which calls for a pace of vaccination which is way more than nine times of the present level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-vax-drive-to-hit-top-gear-with-new-plan-to-reach-out-to-recipients/articleshow/83446377.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Covid-19 has started infecting solid organs like liver, pancreas and gallbladder leading to hepatitis, pancreatitis and cholecystitis. And, doctors across the state are also seeing a rise in cases of intestinal gangrene, which is turning fatal. Doctors are reporting deaths due to this condition in elderly comorbid patients and in those where detections are late.  A greater number of Covid-19 recovered patients are coming up with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, acid reflux, vomiting and diarrhoea. “The virus enters through the epithelium of the intestine and infects hollow viscous and travels through bloodstream to infect liver, pancreas and gallbladder causing inflammation or swelling that leads to hepatitis, pancreatitis and cholecystitis,” said Dr Nitin Patel, consultant gastrointestinal surgeon at Parul Sevashram Hospital, Vadodara. “We have observed clotting within major abdominal vessels leading to ischemic colitis and subsequent gangrene of the intestine. Delayed presentation with comorbidities, old age and use of steroids has high chances of mortality,” he said.  Dr Pankaj Khandelwal, Vadodara-based gastrointestinal surgeon, “There were emergencies of pancreatitis, colitis and intestinal gangrene where we had to remove the gangrenous part of the intestine. Since, the numbers were more in second wave compared to the first wave, the cases were also more,” said “We had more patients with a lot of GI symptoms who were distressed by abdominal pain, significant acidity, stool disturbances, increased stool frequencies. It was a very huge number,” he said.  Surgeon and advisor for Covid-19 in Vadodara Dr Sheetal Mistry said that he had seen three cases of pancreatitis in the second wave. “Two of these patients had pancreatitis as a post-covid complication. The third case came without any history of Covid treatment. He was complaining of pain in the abdomen. We got a Covid test done and it turned out positive,” he said. Cases of Covid-induced cholecystitis and pancreatitis have been reported in Surat as well. Doctors have also come across conditions wherein a thrombosis develops in intestinal veins leading to gangrene in the intestine. “There are many cases of pancreatitis as well as cholecystitis which doctors in Surat have treated. It increases the hospitalization period of the patients,” said gastroenterologist Dr Pallav Parikh.

---||Surat||More population, still Surat gets same doses as Rajkot||SURAT: So far, 15.83 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in Surat city. This includes around 3 lakh fully vaccinated citizens. City health officials are aiming to achieve 100% vaccination of the targeted 33 lakh population (registered voters) in the next couple of months. However, officials claim that the target can be achieved earlier if more Covid-19 vaccines are made available to the city. The waiting period for those willing to take the jab can be reduced if more doses are supplied. Ahmedabad, with an estimated population of around 80 lakh, gets a daily quota of 32,000 doses. In comparison, Surat, whose population stands at roughly 70 lakh, gets just 20,000 doses on a daily basis. On the other hand, the estimated population of Vadodara and Rajkot cities are 25 lakh and 21 lakh respectively. Still, Vadodara and Rajkot each are getting 20,000 doses daily, same as Surat. City health officials have been regularly receiving complaints of non-availability of slots by applicants who are trying to book for vaccination since the last many days. The online booking process for the slots opens daily in the evening. With thousands of applicants lined up, the available slots are booked in seconds.  “The quota of 20,000 doses for Surat is insufficient since those willing to take the vaccine are high. Plus, we have the infrastructure to inoculate more people per day. In Rajkot, people willing to take vaccines are less than the number of available doses. Similar situation is witnessed in Vadodara on some days,” said a health official on condition of anonymity. In Surat, however, people have to wait for days to get vaccinated. “Since last month I have been trying to get a vaccination appointment for me and my wife. Unfortunately, I haven’t got an appointment till now. I need to visit an ailing relative in Delhi but I am delaying it since I am not vaccinated,” said Rahul Mehra, a marketing professional. “The supply of doses has been increased to 20,000, which was less early. We are utilising the total doses on a daily basis considering the high demand and in the next couple of months we will inoculate a total targeted population of 33 lakh,” said Banchhanidhi Pani, city municipal commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/despite-more-population-surat-gets-rajkots-doses/articleshow/83443619.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Three weeks ago, Sisaunda village, just 2km away from Dhaukharia, made headlines when a group of villagers jumped into the river to avoid jab. Similarly, many residents of Lisadigate in Meerut, locked their homes from outside to mislead health teams. Vaccine hesitancy is not only confined to the rural masses as there are many cases where even frontline workers like doctors and policemen sought inoculation certificates without taking the jab. “A government hospital surgeon contacted me four days ago. He wanted a Covidshield vaccination certificate without taking a shot. I declined his request. Many policemen have contacted us for certificates without inoculation,” said Urmila Mishra, an anganwadi worker in Lucknow. “Our teams face stiff resistance in rural areas. People bring lathis to threaten us,” she added Brijesh Kumar Singh, former gram pradhan of Dhaukharia (Barabanki) said, “Vaccine hesitancy is seen among those who are illiterate. We have inoculated ourselves to build confidence among local residents.” SDM Ramnagar (Barabanki) Rajiv Shukla said, “Initially, we faced difficulties in convincing people but with help of gram pradhans and local leaders we have formed committees to create awareness. People have gradually starting showing up at vaccination centres.” Circle officer of Meerut Kotwali, Arvind Chaurasia, whose video of convincing a septuagenarian woman to take jab went viral on Thursday, said: “Vaccination cannot be forced. Considering the sensitivity of the matter, we inform people about role models who have got inoculated, bust myths with the help of doctors and influential people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/corona-warriors-in-cities-too-gripped-by-vaccine-hesitancy/articleshow/83446418.cms||Arvind Chauhan

In the MMR, corporations like Thane and Kalyan-Dombivli will continue to be in their current category of Level 2 and Level 3. Although KDMC is at the border of Level 2 and 3, the administration has decided to continue with the restrictions till June 20. Meanwhile, Palghar district, including the Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation, will move from Level 3 to Level 2 from Monday, said district collector Dr Manek Gursal. The Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation in Thane district will also move from Level 3 to 2 from Monday. The Navi Mumbai civic corporation will continue in Level 2 as the oxygen bed occupancy is above 25%, but the positivity rate there is hovering around 2%. Since last week, the Maharashtra government has started a 5-level staggered unlocking based on key Covid-19 indicators like weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds. These indicators are reviewed by the public health department every Thursday, and based on weekly performance, districts and big cities are upgraded or downgraded on the relaxation scale. “There is definitely an improvement in the Covid-19 indicators in the state. However, six districts from western Maharashtra and the Konkan still have a positivity rate of over 10%, and we have to ensure that cases are brought under control. Containment efforts should continue in these districts,” said a senior official. As far as the state is concerned, its weekly positivity rate has dropped to 5.8% and oxygen bed occupancy is 16.9% as against 25.9% based on the weekly average from May 28 to June 3. Also, the total number of beds occupied today in absolute numbers is only 20,167, down from 31,224 last week. As per the data, Kolhapur has the highest positivity rate (15.8%) and its oxygen bed occupancy is currently at 67.4%, also the highest in the state. Meanwhile, Gondia recorded the lowest positivity rate of 0.8%, while Wardha recorded the lowest bed occupancy level of 1.57%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-districts-under-level-1-curbs-up-from-10-last-wk-to-19/articleshow/83446441.cms||Bhavika Jain

Hundreds of pilgrims will be given free food under the Sadavrat Project from June 14. Ambaji is the abode of goddess Jagadamba and devotees flock to the temple in thousands every year. Ambaji temple trust had started Ambica Bhojanalaya to facilitate Sadavrat, which is sponsored by Jay Jaliyana Foundation run by Jaliyana Sadavrat. The Sadavrat is planned for three months and will be run under the overall supervision of Banaskantha collector Anand Patel, who is ex-officio chairman of Arasuri Ambaji Mata Devsthan Trust (AAMDT), that manages the Ambaji temple. The AAMDT administrator SJ Chawda said that the temple trust used to provide food about 20 lakh visitors every year but at a token cost. “However, some donors came forward and proposed to manage and supply free food on behalf of the temple trust. Patel has decided to hand over the management of food to those donors,” Chavda said. “We want to continue the free food project forever. However, currently, the temple management has agreed to the project for three months on a pilot basis. A decision on continuing the project will be taken after reviewing its progress after three months,” said Chavda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/devotees-to-get-free-food-at-ambaji-temple-from-june-14/articleshow/83444825.cms||---

But now the deadline for the works will have to be extended,” energy minister Nitin Raut said on Friday. A decision has been taken in the cabinet that no more thermal power projects will be undertaken in the state. Therefore, the solar project will be given impetus and these projects will be implemented more in Marathwada and Vidarbha, added Raut. The minister said that to ensure seamless power supply, every consumer should pay power bill. “If unable to pay entire bill, consumers should pay them in instalments. But, there is less likelihood of waiving off the power bills,” he clarified. He also said that the central government should take a call about waiving off power bills. Due to changes in management in the last few days, the cost of power generation has been reduced by 25 to 30 paise per unit and the cost of power generation from thermal power plants has been reduced. Answering to a query, Raut said, “In the districts with more forests like Nandurbar, Gadchiroli, Palghar, electricity has not reached some places yet. This is being done through Rajiv Gandhi electrification scheme.” Raut said that the state is considering taking some concrete steps for bringing down the losses energy department which has been suffering from natural calamities like cyclones. He said that even the pandemic has had an impact on power companies. Clearing the state’s stand on the reports about MVA government putting the special concession granted in electricity rates to industries in Marathwada and Vidarbha, Raut said that it has not been withdrawn or stopped. “The difference amount is due for one month. However, a committee has been formed for examining whether only handful industries are getting the benefit of the concessional power tariff plan. The scheme is for all the industries and we are checking only if some of them are taking advantage of it,” said Raut, who was on an official tour to Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-moots-mega-solar-projects-in-marathwada-vidarbha-nitin-raut/articleshow/83440857.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Soot over central Himalayan skies up to 4.5 times higher than previously thought||NAINITAL: Black carbon levels over the central Himalayas have been grossly underestimated by at least four times, a new study by scientists from Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), IIT-Kanpur, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Delhi University has found. And this, the study published in Springer journal ‘Asia Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Sciences’ added, is heating up the atmosphere by nearly 25% more than thought and threatening Himalayan glaciers to an even greater degree than believed. “Black carbon concentration level is measured with an instrument called aethalometer. But corrections have to be made to the instrument for measuring the level based on location. We have now made a specific correction to the instrument. That is how we came up with the new figures,” said Manish Naja, head of the atmospheric science division at ARIES. The study calculated the average black carbon concentration levels between 2014 and 2017, and then compared that data with the revised figures based on the recalibrated instrument. So, if the average black carbon level for February was 900 nanograms (billionth of a kilogram) per cubic metre (ng/m3), the revised estimate is 2,700 ng/m3, three times higher. Similarly, for May, the older figure was 660 ng/m3, which jumped to 2460 ng/m3, a 3.7-fold jump. In July, the difference was a huge 4.5-fold — from 220 ng/m3 in the older estimates to 990 ng/m3 now. TOI had reported in the first week of April that forest fires had made black carbon levels shoot up six times from 2,000 ng/m3 to 12,000 ng/m3 — which might have been a conservative estimate, going by this study. Black carbon is the second most significant pollutant, after carbon dioxide, driving global warming. Because of the miscalculated black carbon levels, the impact on the atmosphere was also off. While average atmospheric radiative forcing (or heating) for the period was thought to be 31.7 watt per cubic metre (W/m3), the fresh calculations showed it has actually been 39.5 W/m3, nearly 25% higher. Black carbon is contributing to the melting of glaciers in two ways, according to Priyanka Srivastava, co-author of the study from ARIES. First is by raising atmospheric heat — a direct result of black carbon which, suspended in the air, absorbs heat. “It also accumulates over snow and glaciers. When the sun’s rays fall on the carbon, it absorbs heat which ultimately results in snow melting,” she added. Why are the Himalayas so vulnerable to black carbon accumulation? Naja said, “In northern India, a large section of the population uses wood and other high carbon-emitting sources as fuel for cooking and to keep warm. Forest fires in the region and crop burning, especially in the Rabi season, are also contributors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/soot-over-central-himalayan-skies-up-to-4-5-times-higher-than-previously-thought/articleshow/83442564.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: New Town residents write to cops, demand safety upgrade||KOLKATA: A citizens’ collective in New Town has written to the local police to implement more measures for the safety of the residents of the township after the shootout at Shukhobrishti in New Town in broad daylight on Wednesday. They have also said that the local residents are very anxious over the prevailing law and order in the township where petty crimes keep happening from time to time. Several residents are even suggesting measures to plug security loopholes on the township’s social media accounts. “We would like to draw your attention towards the anxiety fear among the residents of New Town over the prevailing law and order. Since it’s a developing township people from across the country are coming here to stay. The police must develop a mechanism so that antecedents of people coming here to stay are checked. We as local residents promise you of all help,” said a letter written by the New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity to the police. Before writing the letter, heads of several residents’ association held an informal review meeting soon after the shootout at Shukhobrishti on Wednesday. “The incident has shaken every resident of the township. Many families have made New Town their home for a better and safe quality of life but incidents like this strike fear in the hearts of the residents. Petty criminal activities also keep happening which is unsettling for us. We have requested the administration to make sure that the law and order in the township is improved so that the residents can live peacefully,” said Samir Gupta, secretary of the New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity. Several residents have suggested that the flat owners must meet the tenants before letting them in to ensure that the right person is taking the possession. Others have emphasised on a more robust tenant verification process involving the police. “There should be more police checkpoints in various parts of the township to keep a vigil along with more CCTV cameras at strategic locations. The existing police stations can be bifurcated for more police stations to improve patrolling and law and order activities,” said Abhishek Ghosh, a resident of Eastern High in New Town. Several complexes have their own set of rules for letting out flats which they are now reviewing. Almost 30% of apartments in the township are occupied by senior citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-residents-write-to-cops-demand-safety-upgrade/articleshow/83444519.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Lucknow||Most varsities to implement common minimum syllabus in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Over 50% universities in the state have agreed to implement the common minimum syllabus (CMS) in undergraduate and postgraduate courses in sync with the new education policy, 2020, in the new academic session from September 13.Of 15 universities, seven have agreed to adopt common curriculum and the process for adoption is underway at four universities. Two universities have agreed in principle, but not specified the timeframe for implementation. Lucknow University has decided on partial implementation. A status report issued by the higher education department shows that barring LUand DDU University, Gorakhpur, the process for adoption of a common syllabus is underway in 13 varsities, which have been virtually conducting Board of Studies (BoS) — the first gateway in each faculty for approval of course. The academic council of Agra’s Bhimrao Ambedkar University has approved the CMS and is awaiting a green signal from the state government. The university will initiate the process from academic session 2021-22. Batting for equivalence in academic standards in universities, additional chief secretary (higher education) Monika S Garg said, “We have finalised a common syllabus for 60 subjects. While 70% curriculum in all state universities will be common, universities can incorporate changes in the remaining 30%. They can also opt for the entirety of the curriculum.” As per the report, Chaudhary Charan University, Meerut, has conducted all BoS meetings and the academic council meeting is scheduled for June 15, when necessary approvals will be taken for CMS implementation from this session. Siddharth University, Kapilvastu is willing to adopt CMS from this academic session. At Kanpur’s CSMU, BoS meetings were held in an online mode from May 8-17. The proceedings will be taken to the academic council for approval. In the case of Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University, Ayodhya, meetings in 16 subjects are complete, while remaining BoS in 8 subjects are scheduled for June 11. The university will adopt CMS from this session. The process for adoption of common syllabus is underway at four universities, Bundelkhand University (Jhansi), Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University (Jaunpur), Jannayak Chandrasekhar University (Balia) and Sampurnanand Sanskrit University (Varanasi) with BoS meetings lined up this month. MGKV and Professor Rajendra Singh (Rajju Bhaiya) University, Prayagraj — have agreed to adopt the curriculum from 2021-22. While Lucknow University is divided over adoption, the CMS proposal is pending at DDU University, Gorakhpur. In the absence of directives from the vice-chancellor, DDU varsity officials are yet to act. At LU, three faculties — arts, science and law — have rejected CMS, while the education and commerce faculty have agreed to adopt a common curriculum. Garg said university can take another month to complete the academic and executive proceedings for adoption of the common curriculum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/most-varsities-to-implement-common-minimum-syllabus/articleshow/83446433.cms||Isha Jain

Speaking to media persons at Calangute on Friday, Lobo said that taxi drivers are the first contact with tourists at the airport or railway stations, and hence they need to be vaccinated by the time the tourism sector resumes. “I’ve been told that very few taxi drivers are coming forward for vaccination in Calangute and Candolim. In fact, they should have been the first to come. I urge all taxi owners and drivers to get themselves vaccinated,” Lobo said. “We’re all dependent on tourism and we need all stakeholders like watersports operators, shack owners and workers, everybody in the tourism industry, to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that we can restart the industry in October,” he said. He also urged all the youth working in the tourism and hospitality industry and those staying in the coastal tourism belt to also get themselves inoculated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taxi-drivers-must-get-jabs-soon-lobo/articleshow/83446452.cms||---
---||India||Assam Muslims have recorded sharpest fall in fertility since 2005-06: Govt data||While Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has called on the state’s ‘immigrant Muslim’ population to practise ‘decent family planning practice’, the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) of 2019-20 released by the Union health minister in December shows that this community has seen the sharpest fall in fertility since 2005-06. Muslims in Assam have recorded the most dramatic decline in fertility since NFHS-3, which was conducted 14 years earlier. While the number of children who would be born per woman — or the total fertility rate (TFR) — of the Muslim community in Assam at 2.4 is higher than the 1.6 for Hindus and 1.5 for Christians, the reduction in fertility among Muslims has been from 3.6 in 2005-06 to 2.4 in 2019-20, a drop of 1.3 compared to 0.4 among Hindus for the same period, although from a lower base. The TFR of 2.4 among Muslims in Assam is only a little over what demographers call replacement level fertility, or the TFR level at which just enough babies are born to maintain population levels constant. This is pegged at 2.1 and India’s overall TFR is 2.2. NFHS-5 data also shows that cultural and geographical factors as well as level of development are more important determinants of fertility than religion. Thus, in Bihar with poor development indices, the fertility rate of all communities including Hindus (2.9) is higher than that of Muslims in Assam and most other states. On the flip side of this, in Jammu and Kashmir, with high development indices and the lowest fertility rate among the eight large states for which NFHS-5 data has been released, the fertility rate of Muslims (1.45) is lower than the fertility rate of Hindus in any of the other states.  The TFR for Hindus too is low in Jammu & Kashmir at 1.32. Of the nine states in NFHS-5, the TFR is above replacement level in the Muslim community in just two states, Kerala (2.3) and Bihar (3.6), which are at two ends of the development spectrum. This shows that beyond just cultural and geographic factors, the level of development of a specific community is also a determinant of its TFR. In Kerala, despite its overall high literacy, the literacy of Muslim women is poor. Similarly, in Assam, Muslims are the most socio-economically backward religious community. The NFHS-5 state reports show that women in rural areas have higher fertility than their urban counterparts in every state including Assam. And Muslims in Assam are found in a greater proportion in rural areas where they constituted 36.6% in NFHS-5, than in urban areas, where they were just 18.6% of the population. Lower educational levels too have an impact. According to the NFHS-5 report on Assam, women with no schooling would have an average of 0.8 more children than women with 12 or more years of schooling. The 2011 census recorded that the literacy level of Muslims in Assam was 62% compared to 78% among Hindus and that barely 1.7% of Muslims were graduates or above compared to 5% among Hindus. A study by Dibrugarh University on the connection between education and fertility with reference to the Assamese Muslim community, published in March last year, concluded that the mother’s level of education affected fertility significantly and that fertility in Assamese Muslims could be brought down by improving the education level of the community, especially of the women. The NFHS-4 report on India examined the fertility rate of the different wealth quintiles (one fifths of the population) and showed that the section with the lowest income had the highest number of children at 3.2 and the richest had the least, 1.5. Thus, fertility is more about social determinants than just ‘population control Watch Adopt decent family planning policy: Assam CM appeals to minority community||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/assam-muslims-have-recorded-sharpest-fall-in-fertility-since-2005-06-govt-data/articleshow/83450140.cms||Rema Nagarajan

TOI had earlier reported that despite 82 ventilators being available with the government hospitals in the district, none of the lifesaving machines could be used during the peak of the second wave of the virus as the medical staff was not trained to run them. DM Haridwar C Ravishankar had said that ventilators were not used because of a lack of trained staff. “We are now training the medical staff to run ventilators. The district administration is conducting these training sessions in collaboration with AIIMS Rishikesh,” said the official. Meanwhile, locals have alleged that many patients lost their lives due to the ‘casual approach’ of the district administration during the second wave of the virus. “The government hospitals in the district received the ventilators before the second Covid-19 wave but the medical staff was not trained to use them. Consequently, many severely ill patients died due to a lack of proper treatment. Action should be taken against responsible officers,” said Sunil Arora, a Haridwar resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-admin-training-medical-staff-in-govt-hospitals-to-run-ventilators/articleshow/83442664.cms||MS Nawaz

This was the first time that such large number of vehicles were included in Aurangabad rural which otherwise had a total of 103 two-wheelers, including 69 defunct, and 132 four-wheelers, of which, 16 were defunct. These vehicles have been purchased from the funds provided by District Planning and Development Committee. Aurangabad rural is the first police unit in the state to have about 50 women beat marshals serving on field across 23 police stations in the district. Also, pink squad formed for responding to the complaints of crime against women, especially sexual or domestic, have been deployed at all the six sub-divisions. Each of these squads comprise about half a dozen police constables headed by an officer. In addition, seven jeeps granted by the director general of police’s office to Aurangabad rural under Maharashtra Emergency Response System (MERS) were also officially included in the force. These vehicles will be associated with the dial 112 emergency service which is being implemented across the country. After flagging these vehicles in the presence of ZP president Meenatai Shelke, district collector Sunil Chavan, Aurangabad range special IGP Mallikarjun Prasanna, district guardian minister Subhash Desai expressed confidence that Aurangabad rural police in general and women beat marshals in particular will continue to raise the bar with their selfless service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/women-beat-marshals-pink-squad-gets-vehicles-for-better-mobility/articleshow/83440922.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The forest department had declared the leopard as a man-eater as it could be seen loitering around the deceased’s body. “A team from the forest department tried to tranquilise the big cat but in vain. Thus, we had to eliminate the seven-foot-long leopard. It was active in the area for the last two months and had attacked another woman and a man before this kill,” said Hukil. In the last 10 years, Hukil has killed 41 leopards, including this one. “The population of leopards has increased in the hills in the last few years, leading to an uptick in man-animal conflict incidents,” added Hukil. According to the state forest department data, out of 15 human deaths in human-wildlife interactions till May this year, eight have been caused by leopard attacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-dept-eliminates-leopard-which-killed-a-woman-on-thursday/articleshow/83442670.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Private hospitals look at robust solutions to avert another crisis||New Delhi: The issue of shortage of medical oxygen in Delhi wasn’t limited to public hospitals. Top private hospitals were equally affected by the crisis when the Covid-19 cases peaked in the city leading to exponential increases in the number of patients requiring oxygen therapy for survival. However, when TOI spoke to various private hospitals on the steps taken by them to augment the infrastructure to ensure availability of oxygen in the eventuality of another peak in cases, it was found that most of them were still working on it. “We are in talks with several companies for the installation of oxygen generator plants. The work is in progress,” Dr DK Baluja, medical director of Jaipur Golden Hospital, said. Twenty critically ill patients died overnight at the hospital on April 23 amid a serious oxygen crisis. At least 12 Covid-19 patients, including a senior doctor, died due to oxygen shortage at Batra hospital on May 1. The hospital said it required 7,000 litres of oxygen daily. However, at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in April-May, they were facing a delay in the supply. “We are in talks with companies, both Indian and foreign manufacturers, for installing two oxygen generation plants with a capacity of around 5,000 litres each in the hospital. These things take time,” Dr S C L Gupta, medical director of the hospital. “Currently, we don’t have any shortage of the critical supply,” he added. Most hospitals in Delhi get liquid medical oxygen from private firms, mainly Inox, based in neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Dr DS Rana, chairman (board of management) of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said that they were looking at multiple options, including increasing the capacity of the storage tank, to deal with any future crisis. “We are in talks with the state government to set up large storage tanks of liquid medical oxygen within the city. It may take longer but will provide a long-term and robust solution in a crisis situation,” Dr Ashish Chaudhry, managing director of Aakash Healthcare, said. Narayana Healthcare and BLK super specialty hospitals are among the few private facilities that have installed the oxygen generation plants that were donated by France during the peak of the Covid crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/private-hospitals-look-at-robust-solutions-to-avert-another-crisis/articleshow/83470446.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Forest officials say while an initial inspection had found two trees that were felled, the numbers may be higher. A fresh notice with the exact number of trees felled will be issued by Saturday. No prior permission to prune or fell any trees was sought from the department, the officials add. Sharing photographs from the colony on social media, activist Vimlendu Jha had earlier stated that fully grown trees, including a gulmohar tree, had been completely hacked. Tagging the Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, he asked for strict action against the violators. “Trees are being completely hacked from the base and before and after pictures of the same trees are a testimony to that,” said Jha, founder of Swechha, an environmental NGO. TOI contacted locals who said the number of trees cut ranged from four to nine, including at least one gulmohar tree and two jalebi trees. “The trees are likely to have been cut during the lockdown period and we have recently noticed a number of trees to be missing,” said a local resident on condition of anonymity. The Mandakini Enclave RWA refused to comment on the matter. DCF (South) Amit Anand told TOI there was no permission to cut or prune trees. “We have issued a notice to the south corporation, which is the land-owning agency. During our first inspection, we identified two trees, which were felled. However, locals later pointed out to more trees that might have been felled and a subsequent inspection was carried out. The report should be out in the next 24 hours,” said Anand. The south corporation did not respond to TOI’s queries. Under the rules, a fine of Rs 60,000 per tree can be imposed for illegal cutting or felling of trees, Rs 20,000 for illegal pruning/headbacking of trees and Rs 10,000 for every tree found concretised around its base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tree-felling-in-alaknanda-forest-dept-notice-to-sdmc/articleshow/83444555.cms||---

Many educational institutions had to reduce salaries of their teaching and non-teaching staff and in some cases relieve them. These actions by the institutions created stress between the institution and the staff. With no solution, the staff members have approached the university. Vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said the varsity receives at least one complaint every day from staff members. Karmalkar said, “Salaries have been a major source of trouble between the educational institutions and the staff members and we are getting minimum of one complaint every day and these instances are rising. A majority of these complaints are coming from engineering colleges.” Educational institutions have remained shut since March 2020 and learning has been imparted through online mode for over one year. Registrar Prafulla Pawar said, “As a result of lockdown, the income was not compensated for many while a few lost their jobs. This posed a problem to the students’ community as their parents could not afford to pay the fees.” Many colleges also reported a delay in government aid. Principal of a college in the city said, “The collection from fees has been less than 50% and we cannot force any student to pay the fees except for sending them reminders. Some students have lost their parent, so in such cases we need to be sensitive. If the fees are not paid by a substantial number of students it is going to be difficult to operate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sppu-sees-rise-in-complaints-about-salaries/articleshow/83415369.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

This year, the MSME department has said the land under Kala Namak cultivation is expected to rise to 10,000 hectare. Additional chief secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal said that the rice has been covered under the state government’s one district-one product scheme which has seen farmers reaping massive benefits. As an example of the work done by the government, Sehgal said that a three-day festival had been organised in Siddharthnagar in March 2021 in collaboration with the export promotion department. The aim of the festival was to bring farmers and buyers on the same platform and create awareness about the health benefits of the rice. “As a result of this festival, farmers and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) started receiving more orders. The government provided FPOs and farmers with the facility to sell their produce through an organized supply chain management system, not just in the domestic market but across India. E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart are being used to provide a larger market to farmers and FPOs.” After the ODOP marketing team and the district coordinator of the Kala Namak cluster contacted Flipkart, the company took samples from four FPOs and had them tested in its labs. One sample passed muster. Subsequently, the Kapilvastu Kisam Nirmata Company Ltd got an order for 250 kg of rice at Rs 175 per kg. The remaining samples will be tested again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kala-namak-rice-gets-govts-push/articleshow/83446447.cms||---

Informing that only three-day stock of Covaxin and a two-day of Covishield was available for the said group, Atishi said, so far, only 30% of Delhi had been vaccinated. “But to get herd immunity of Covid-19, it is important to have 70% of the population vaccinated. While Covaxin doses for above 45 years are almost out, Covishield stock is available for 24 days,” she said. Speaking on Friday’s vaccination, Atishi said 78,628 people were vaccinated, of which around 60,000 got their first doses, while 17,800 received their second. “According to the current status, we have 52,87,110 doses for the 45 plus age group, in which 9,000 are Covaxin, which will last a day, so these are being used for the second dose. The Covishield stock for the said category will last for 24 days,” she added. For the 18-44 age group, 1 lakh doses of vaccines were available, including 33,000 Covaxin, which was being used to give the second dose. As many as 67,000 doses of Covishield are available for the said group, she added. “If we are to see the stock, Covaxin for youth will last for three days and Covishield for two.

However, Pune city is unlocking and moving from Level 3 to Level 2. Malls in Pune will be allowed open at 50% capacity but there will be restrictions on timings for shops, malls and restaurants. In MMR, Vasai-Virar and Mira-Bhayender will move up from Level 3 to Level 2 while Kalyan-Dombivli will remain at Level 3. BMC chief Iqbal Chahal said the city will remain under Level 3 restrictions till Covid cases come down to around 100-200 per day. “We still have around 700-800 Covid-19 cases per day. We are taking a very cautious and graded approach to unlocking in Mumbai so we don’t have to go back into lockdown. We will monitor the situation closely till the last week of June and then make a decision,” Chahal told TOI. The BMC late on Friday evening issued orders stating that given Mumbai’s population, topography and the number of people who travel in and out of Mumbai using local trains daily and IMD’s forecast of heavy rain over the next few days, Mumbai will continue to remain under Level 3 restrictions till further orders. While Pune city is unlocking, there are riders. Malls with 50% capacity can stay open till 7 pm and restaurants/bars till 10 pm. Shops can stay open till 7 pm but non-essential shops will be closed on weekends. Movement after 10 pm will not be allowed without a valid reason. Pimpri Chinchwad corporation will stay in Level 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-can-unlock-more-but-bmc-to-wait-pune-opens-up/articleshow/83446451.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police lens on 96-hour period before duo’s shift to complex||KOLKATA: Cops are seeking the guest list along with relevant IDs of all occupants staying at hotels and guest houses in New Town and surrounding areas to crack the 96-hour period — between May 22 and May 26 — the two slain gangsters and their accomplice had spent before they started staying at the New Town residential complex on rent. Cops said the information was crucial to them to find out if the trio had any other accomplice in Kolkata who may have come to meet them during this period. According to a senior officer in Punjab closely engaged in the investigation, the two gangsters had stayed for four days at some New Town guest house close to an under-construction Metro station. The other accomplice, Bharat Kumar who had taken the flat on rent faking his identity had put up at a star hotel, also in New Town, along with his wife. While the gangsters checked out on May 26 and began staying at the rented flat at Shukhobrishti, Kumar had extended his stay at the hotel till he left Kolkata on June 2, the officer said. “We are in the process of acquiring a list of guests who had been staying in the guest houses and hotels in New Town during these four days. Once we get the list, we will also seek CCTV footage of these four days from the authorities to see if anyone had come to meet them during this period,” said a senior police officer in Bengal. He added they were also scanning the CCTV footage from traffic cameras installed in New Town to track any unusual movement of the gangsters and their accomplice. A senior official of a star hotel in New Town confirmed that they have already provided their guest list to the local police station. Police said the gangsters and Bharat may have used fake identity at the hotels as well but with limited number of guests at all hotels due to the ongoing safety restrictions, it will still be easier to scan the list. Meanwhile, officers have found several fake ID cards and 70-odd plastic cards — like the ones where driving licence and PAN cards are printed — at the gangster’s rented flat. Police said the gangsters possibly used the plastic cards to print fake IDs like the one they used to buy a SIM card which is registered against a person named Akash Pal at Pingla in West Midnapore. A team of officers, however, couldn’t trace anyone of the that name in the mentioned address at the village. Scanning Jaipal Singh Bhullar’s laptop, police have found there were search queries made on distance of Bangladesh border from where the two were staying in New Town and other details of Bangladesh, raising suspicion on whether the duo were planning to cross over to Bangladesh and had chosen Kolkata as a hideout till the time they could manage a safe passage to the other side of the border. “We will question Bharat Kumar on this ground and will try to grill him further to know about Bhullar’s international associates,” said a senior officer in Punjab, under whose custody Bharat Kumar is now. A team of ballistics experts with forensic officials from different departments of physics, chemistry and biology also scanned the New Town flat on Thursday and collected samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-lens-on-96-hr-period-before-duos-shift-to-complex/articleshow/83444552.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Congress stages protest at petrol pumps in all 70 assembly constituencies against fuel price hike||DEHRADUN: Claiming prices of petrol and diesel had gone up by “43 times in the last three months”, members of Opposition Congress held protests at petrol pumps in all 70 assembly constituencies of the state, drawing vehicles by ropes and raising slogans against the BJP government at the centre and the state. While state chief Pritam Singh led the protest in Dehradun, district chiefs and senior members conducted it in other constituencies." “The steep rise in petrol and diesel prices has affected everyone as most things are linked with transportation. At some places, petrol price has crossed Rs 100 per litre and diesel has crossed Rs 90 per litre. As a result, prices of common necessities have also gone up, burning a hole in the pocket of the common man,” Singh said, adding the Congress will continue to hold protests until the government addresses the issue. Congress vice president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “The BJP should be making life easier for people during this pandemic but instead has made it harder for them. On one hand people are struggling to get treated for Covid-19, on the other hand they have to pay high prices for petrol, diesel and other products the rates of which are affected by transportation costs. This reflects BJP’s attitude towards the people, it is not bothered about sufferings of the common man.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/congress-stages-protest-at-petrol-pumps-in-all-70-assembly-constituencies-against-fuel-price-hike/articleshow/83442701.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: MSME units say unjustified price hike of 20-100 % of steel killing industry||LUDHIANA: In the last one year, steel manufacturers have suffered a big blow due to uncontrollable rise in the rates of steel. According to them, there has been 20 to 100% increase in the rates of different types of steel products since July 2020, despite a huge fall in the demand for steel. Maninder Pal Guliani, president of Ludhiana Beopar Mandal, said, “Because of the huge increase in the rate of steel raw material of different types, not only manufacturers of engineering goods but also small-time steel traders have been destroyed. The situation is such that the minimum hike is of 20% while there are certain items that have witnessed increase of even 100%. This month, the rate of HR coil is between Rs 70,000 and Rs 72,000 per tonne, which last year in July was about Rs 36,000. Similarly, the rate of wire rod is currently Rs 55,000 per tonne, which was Rs 39,000 in July 2020. Rate of TMT bars has shot up from Rs 42,000 per tonne to Rs 56,000 and that of round bars has shot up to Rs 47,000 from Rs 38,000 per tonne.” Guliani added, “Centre is responsible for this turmoil due to which the industry has suffered its biggest blow. We have written several times to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several Union ministers to take stock of the situation, but all in vain. It seems that the government itself is hand in glove with big private players, who have raised steel prices by more than 100% within a year and what is even more shocking is that even government steel producers are following the same path. It was only minister Nitin Gadkari raised the issue of higher steel prices, but the other government functionaries are mum.” According to Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India, “The central government, which is often propagating that it is the most industry-friendly government, has miserably failed on ground to take stock of the problems of the small industry. If this was not the case then the issue of incessant hike in the steel prices would have been resolved by now, as in the last 12 months we have been constantly pleading before the Centre to take notice of it.” Stating that due to lockdowns, the demand of steel raw material has fallen considerably, Bhamra said considering that, the manifold price hike does not make any sense. Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, said, “Due to the unjustified hike in the rates of steel, the cost of production of all engineering products, be it sewing machine parts, bicycle parts, auto parts or hand tools, has shot up by a huge percentage. But unfortunately manufacturers have not been able to hike the rate of the finished products due to sluggish demand and therefore we have been forced to absorb the increase ourselves. As a result of this, every single MSME unit is suffering huge losses and several units have closed down their operations temporarily. If the government fails to take steps to counter the situation, it is certain that a large number of factories will close down permanently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/steel-makers-say-unjustified-price-hike-of-20-100-killing-industry/articleshow/83442682.cms||Mohit Behl

Police said that the duo was living in the house and neighbours rushed to the spot on hearing Padmavathi’s loud cries. While Kesavan died on the spot, Padmavathi succumbed to her injuries at the Mananthavady medical college in the wee hours of Friday.

---||Lucknow||Fix power outages in Etawah, Mainpuri: Minister to officials||LUCKNOW: UP power minister Shrikant Sharma on Friday inspected power substations in Etawah and Mainpuri, the political bastion of Samajwadi Party, and told officials to address the problem of power outages immediately. The inspections came amid BJP government’s promise to provide power supply without any discrimination. BJP has often accused the Akhilesh government of restricting round-the-clock power supply only in a few pockets which were the bastions of the Yadav family. Sharma asked managing director of Dakshinanchal Amit Kishore to take stock of the power supply situation and see that complaints of consumers are addressed. The minister reached Karhal substation in Mainpuri and reviewed complaints registered on 1912, took stock of rural power supply roaster and maintenance of transformers. He expressed displeasure over pending complaints regarding transformer overloading which was leading to recurrent power outages. Sharma met residents of Saifai sub-station. He asked power officials to replace dysfunctional transformers so that the problem of prolonged power outages could be resolved. Sharma chose the occasion to hit out at the previous SP government, accusing it of not being able to meet the ever rising demand for power. He said that the BJP government has been wheeling in 23,000MW in comparison to 16,000MW during Akhilesh government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fix-power-outages-in-etawah-mainpuri-minister-to-officials/articleshow/83446455.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Two/thirds of 45+ population vaccinated in Kolhapur, positivity still rising||MUMBAI: Kolhapur has vaccinated 67% of its population above 45 years with at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the highest by any district, and it is intriguingly the only one to record an increase in the weekly positivity rate once again. Kolhapur is presently contributing to at least 12% of the state's daily fresh positive cases, although it has seen a marked decline in critical cases. A release by the public health department showed Kolhapur’s weekly positivity rate was 17% between May13-26 before dropping to 15.2% in the week ending June 2. This had made local authorities optimistic that the wave was finally ebbing, or that effects of vaccination could be kicking in. But the positivity started to rise again and was back to 16% between June 3-9. The district currently has over 17,000 active cases. Other districts with high positivity as well as high vaccination coverage include Sindhudurg and Satara. Sindhudurg, for instance, has a weekly positivity of nearly 12% and over 61% coverage with one vaccine dose. Six districts in Maharashtra have a positivity rate over 10%, but only two of these have poor vaccination coverage. Raigad and Ratnagiri that have a positivity of 13% and 14% respectively have vaccinated barely 32% and 38% with one dose. Local officials said vaccination in Kolhapur has picked up in both urban and rural areas. Over 8.48lakh of the 12.73lakh above 45 years have taken at least one dose. But the 18-44 age group is largely unvaccinated. Of the estimated 14-15 lakh in this bracket, barely 20,000 have got the first dose and less than 4,000 are fully vaccinated. Civil surgeon Dr Anil Mali said only a micro analysis could explain the reason behind new infections in Kolhapur when the majority of districts are seeing a decline. “What we know for sure is that the critical cases have reduced, and deaths are down by 50%. That’s mainly because of vaccination,” he said. The district has not seen any deaths in the fully vaccinated but there have been among those who took one shot. “Those deaths occurred within two weeks of vaccination though,” Mali said. As for rising cases, surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said Kolhapur was one of the districts that saw a late surge. Active cases here rose towards end of April. From 758 on April 1, it rose to 9,500 by May 1. The trend has continued until June 1 with active cases jumping 96% to touch 18,590. On Thursday, Kolhapur had nearly 1,500 in the state’s overall tally of 12,207, and 85% of them were from outside Kolhapur city. A senior doctor from the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical college said Kolhapur was a classic case to demonstrate why vaccine coverage has to be increased as quickly and as widely as possible across age groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-2/3rds-of-45-popln-vaccinated-in-kolhapur-positivity-still-rising/articleshow/83446464.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Mumbai||Form special police cell for medical negligence, suggests Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday told the Maharashtra government to consider setting up a specialised cell of police officers trained to handle complaints about medical negligence. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, hearing a clutch of PILs on Covid-19 management, were informed on Thursday that doctors working in Covid-19 wards had received notices from various police stations regarding complaints made by the relatives of patients over the line of treatment. An Indian Medical Association (Pune) doctor, referring to the tocilizumab shortage, said doctors should not be blamed for the state’s inefficiency to obtain essential drugs. The judges said doctors are already overburdened and their concern is that after treating patients they should not be attacked. “You can’t have a doctor with a mentally disturbed mind treating patients,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges observed that treatment of a patient is a question of interpretation by individual doctors and added that police officers must be educated about the law laid down by the Supreme Court on the filing of an FIR in cognisable cases. They said just as special branches for cybercrime and economic offences, the state should set up a specialised cell to conduct the preliminary inquiry on a complaint to decide whether an FIR should be registered or not. “It is an age of specialisation now,” said Justice Kulkarni. The judges asked the state government to take a decision and place it before the court at the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-form-special-police-cell-for-medical-negligence-suggests-bombay-hc/articleshow/83446553.cms||Rosy Sequeira

On Friday, shots of a different kind prompted them to queue up on the premises for safety from Covid-19 during a vaccination drive. Around 401 residents of the complex took the jabs. “An office space near the main gate was turned into the vaccination centre. Residents had registered for the vaccination a week in advance. All of them turned up,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the association. The vaccination drive was planned on June 4 and scheduled for Friday. “We did not have to change the day or the venue of the vaccination camp,” said a member of the organising committee. The housing society arranged the vaccination drive along with New Town Forum and News. Even after Wednesday’s shootout, the residents seemed upbeat about the vaccination. “In fact almost everybody was calling us to find us whether the vaccination camp would be organised after Wednesday’s incident. It shows that residents were really looking forward to the vaccination drive,” said Kanrar. Since Wednesday’s incident the housing society has turned into a fortress with guardrails being put up at different checkpoints and cops taking down the details of every vehicle entering the society. Cops were present at the vaccination centre. “We had informed cops in writing about the vaccination camp after Wednesday’s incident. Two cops were deployed outside the camp so that the residents would feel safe while coming here,” said Kanrar. Residents said they were relieved to know that the camp was not cancelled. “The incident has definitely scared all of us. We are relieved that we could still get the vaccination without stepping out of our complex. I was waiting for the camp,” said a resident, Sushmita Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-shot-relief-after-gunshot-trauma/articleshow/83444565.cms||Zeeshan Javed

For now, only fruit, vegetable vendors and coconut sellers are allowed to operate in the complex. General stores selling pulses and spices in addition to plastic items sellers are allowed to operate. Only 50 people at a time are being allowed to shop for perishables within the premises, provided they wear a mask. Only ten new customers are permitted inside for every ten customers that exit. “We are monitoring the number of shoppers allowed inside the complex, otherwise it will get crowded. Even the vendors have been asked to maintain social distance while operating. We have CCP inspectors and the police supervising the situation,” Panaji mayor, Rohit Monserrate said. Currently only two gates of the complex have been unsealed – one for entry and the other for exit. Thermal screening of vendors is done each day to ensure their temperature is in check. Shoppers can visit only till 2pm following which the cleaning and sanitisation activities are taken up by the corporation till 3pm. The gates are then sealed again. The stores that sell gadgets, mobile phones, clothes and other non-essential items have not been permitted to operate, for now. Even the flower sellers have not been permitted. There are about 80 vendors currently selling the essential items at the complex. “Hawkers are not allowed to sell essentials near the market complex and only those vendors registered with the CCP can operate within the premises. We are also carrying out raids to crackdown on unregistered hawkers selling their produce in Panaji, within the CCP jurisdiction. Outside the market complex we have allowed cold storage centres to operate to sell meat,” CCP corporator and Panaji municipal market committee chairman, Pramay Mainkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panaji-market-opens-after-a-month-entry-to-50-at-a-time/articleshow/83446565.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Shootout turns spotlight on laxity in tenant verification||KOLKATA: The New Town police encounter, in which two gangsters — who had rented a flat with fake IDs — were gunned down on Wednesday, has raised questions on the way police verification of tenants is conducted in the township. A large section of flat owners and residents in the Shukhobrishti complex, where the two lived for a fortnight, said that cops visited for the physical verification of tenants and merely collected a copy of the rental agreement with ID proofs of the tenants attached and handed it to the broker or landlord. “I have never seen cops visiting the complex to check whether the tenants, who booked the flats, are at all living or have let someone else to stay in their place. It’s also a common practice here to book a flat on rent and bring in other room mates, about whom none is informed. It’s a regular practice here in this complex,” said Durba Bhattacharya, a school teacher and one of the former residents of the complex. As per the general practice in New Town, prospective tenants are asked to furnish at least two photo ID proofs and relevant occupational documents like office ID card or trade licence number before the broker or flat owner. While brokers in most cases handle the transaction, they get the rental agreement format signed by the owner and the tenant and submit a copy of the same to the local police station and the complex maintenance office. “Cops stamp it and give us a received copy. We make further copies of the same and hand it over to the owner, tenant and the complex maintenance office. But cops seldom meet the tenants in person to verify their credentials or visit the flats later to check whether the flat occupant and the man in ID are the same,” said a property agent in the area. Bidhannagar Police officers admitted the laxity in physical police verification but cited issues like lack of manpower and resources in this regard. “We admit that we need to step up the physical verification of the tenants from now. There are some issues that hinder us to do so. But we need to overcome the problems and ensure that similar instances of criminals living with fake identities do not happen in the future,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. The issue of tenant transparency is raging in all complexes and residential areas across the city, including New Town where many tenants are students and techies from other states. The officer added that while physical verification of tenants is still possible, the verification of IDs often becomes a major problem. “To verify Aadhar cards, we need to write to UIDAI to confirm the credentials and it takes weeks for the results to arrive. In some cases, we directly coordinate with our counterparts in other states but the information takes time to channelize,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shootout-turns-spotlight-on-laxity-in-tenant-verification/articleshow/83444570.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Lucknow||BJP to rejig frontal, lateral units in Uttar Pradesh by mid-July||LUCKNOW: In a major move towards organizational revamp, UP BJP will reorganise and revive its frontal and lateral units before mid-July. The process has been delayed by more than a year and the party plans to do it on priority with not more than six months left for the state assembly elections. The multiple ‘morcha’, ‘prakoshth’ and ‘vibhag’ of the state BJP, which a senior party functionary said are like “lateral appendages or limbs” of the party, work to increase the party’s reach among specific communities and forward the ideology of the party, promote its good work and combat negative publicity. The teams that work in these units are appointed for three years by the state party president. The teams are reshuffled when the new state party president assumes office. The current state party president, Swatantra Dev Singh, was elected in January 2020. Party insiders said that revival of the units and appointments of new teams was delayed due to coronavirus and old teams were continuing. “It is the prerogative of the party president and assigning reasons to the delay makes no sense,” said a senior party leader. Now, BJP has set a deadline to reconstitute the units by July 15. There are seven morchas, 17 prakoshth and 28 vibhags of state BJP. Each has its role defined. The seven morchas work among youth, women, OBC, minority, SC, ST and farmers. Similarly, the prakoshth works with lawyers, weavers, cultural artists, fishermen, traders and other communities. The vibhag, on the other hand, includes the party’s IT cell, media cell, campaigns like Swachhta Abhiyan and Namami Gange, disaster management cell and similar others. Each unit has a full-fledged team with ‘adhyaksh’ and ‘upadhyaksh’ (president and vice-president), sachiv (secretary) and members at the state and district levels. The appointments will be done in phases. First, the presidents would be appointed and then the rest of the team. “Putting a full-fledged team on the job in these units proves that these units are significant. It is like extra hands that work for the party’s cause at the ground level,” said a party functionary. The party also rewards its workers by appointing them to these posts. Many party leaders at the national and state level have been active members of yuva, mahila and other ‘morchas’. Swatantra Dev Singh and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma were yuva morcha members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-rejig-frontal-lateral-units-in-up-by-mid-july/articleshow/83446461.cms||Neha Shukla

Each of them were provided a foodgrain kit comprising 4 kg wheat and 1 kg rice for free. The distribution started recently through over 280 centres opened in government schools and until now, 5,000 metric tonnes ration has been provided to people. The government has ordered another 5,000 MT ration for distribution among those who have not received the ration yet, Delhi government said in a statement on Saturday. The prospective beneficiary only needs to show their Aadhaar card and mention their contact number to get the free ration kit. “A large number of people turned up at several centres in excess of what was expected. But people should not be concerned. We have placed orders with the FCI for more foodgrains, which will arrive soon. We have taken note of all kinds of grievances reported by people. We assure you that things will be further streamlined in the coming days to make the entire process smooth and hassle-free. The Aam Aadmi Party government believes that ration is the right of people,” food minister Imran Hussain stated. The Delhi government’s scheme does not involve beneficiaries to do any pre-registration. For ration, people can simply walk in at the designated locations/schools where their details such as name, mobile number, Aadhaar, etc., will be taken and an SMS will be sent to those having a mobile number. Those without a mobile number will be provided a code (token) generated in the system to receive the entitled ration. The ration can be availed from 10am to 4pm on all working days except on gazetted holidays and on Sundays. Even those who do not have any ID proof/mobile phone, can get ration for themselves (one person). In the wake of the doorstep delivery of ration being put on hold, the food supplies and consumer affairs department has ordered distribution of ration under National Food Security Act and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, a food security welfare scheme, for the month of June in a phased manner. The distribution of specified food articles will be done manually at all fair price shops except Seemapuri where the distribution will take place through e-PoS on biometric authentication. There are around 17 lakh ration card holders in Delhi to which nearly 70 lakh beneficiaries are linked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-card-but-4-5l-have-got-ration/articleshow/83470468.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Child delivery’s records lead Delhi Police to one of the most wanted gangsters||NEW DELHI: Fugitive gangster Ravi Gangwal has been arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell after a six-month chase across five states.  The 33-year-old gangster was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000 on him in a case under MCOCA and was on the list of top 10 wanted gangsters of Delhi. Gangwal had managed to give Delhi cops a slip on multiple occasions since 2018. However, the Special Cell had been hot on his trail since last December and managed to arrest him from Jaipur three days ago. When a team led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan began tracking Gangwal last year, they had just one lead — a blue-colour Baleno car that he had been using. Raids were conducted in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Uttarakhand. As the cops mounted surveillance to track the Baleno with a Delhi registration, they found that it had been challaned by Rajasthan Traffic Police near Jaipur. A team rushed to Jaipur in February. Meanwhile, an informer tipped off Negi that Gangwal’s wife was pregnant and due for delivery soon. In May, police got a confirmation that she had delivered in April. The cell scanned through municipal records of Jaipur, Faridabad and Delhi, and found that the delivery had taken place in a hospital at Jaipur’s Vaishali Nagar. “The team made an extensive search and finally traced his Baleno after keeping a watch for weeks. A trap was laid and the accused was arrested around 11.30am on June 8 when he came to buy some household articles at a nearby market. He has been brought to Delhi,” said DCP Pramod Kushwaha. Gangwal, from south Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar, is accused in dozens of cases of murder, extortion, robbery and carjacking. In 2014, Gangwal and his aides had killed the sister of their rival, Ashu, while firing indiscriminately. In 2015, they killed Ashu in Tihar Jail using an improvised sharp weapon. In retaliation, Ashu’s henchman, Deepak Pandit, shot dead Gangwal’s aide, Ramakant. Gangwal, meanwhile, ran an organised gang in south Delhi with focus on settling property disputes, landgrabbing, extortion, satta and drug rackets, apart from managing the cable network in the area. He had gone underground since he was booked under MCOCA in 2018. Last August, Gangwal sent his shooter, Anil, to kill his rival, Prince Teotia, but the cell averted the shootout in the nick of time and caught Anil. A few months ago, Gabgwal’s henchman, Shahrukh, parted ways with him due to monetary differences and then gunned down one Kunal in Madangir on March 30 as a show of might. Gangwal ordered a retaliatory attack from Jaipur. His men caught hold of Shahrukh’s man Friday, Suraj Madrasi, and bludgeoned him with a hammer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/child-deliverys-records-lead-police-to-one-of-the-most-wanted-gangsters/articleshow/83444619.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops wait for NOC from Punjab to hand over bodies||KOLKATA: A three-hour post mortem headed by senior forensic sciences officials at RG Kar Hospital, which found multiple gunshot injuries on the bodies of the two gangsters that had punctured their vital organs, was completed by Thursday afternoon. However, the bodies couldn’t be handed over to the family members of the two men till late on Friday night. Gangster Jaipal Singh Bhullar’s father Bhupinder had arrived in Kolkata on Thursday itself and was seen making rounds of the RG Kar morgue and the New Town Techno City police station till late in the night. On Friday, Jaspreet Singh Jassi’s family and more friends and family members of Bhullar arrived, who also did the same but with little result. Cops said there was a delay in getting a ‘no objection certificate’ from Punjab police to hand over the bodies to the families and also because of the fact that a team of ballistics experts had to check and collect samples from the bodies on Friday as well. Cops, though, said that the families will be able to take the bodies back to Punjab on Saturday. “The cops made us sit at the police station for hours but couldn’t give any clarity behind the delay in handing over the body or at least a time frame by when we will get it. Jaipal’s father got sick and spent the day at a Gurdwara while we did all the running around but with little result,” said Narendra Pal Singh, a family friend of the Bhullars. The family members of Jaspreet Singh Jassi also wondered if efforts could have been made to arrest the duo rather than killing them. “Jassi was an exceptional footballer. We don’t know how he got involved in crime. We knew he was travelling to expand his business of used car sales. He hadn’t visited home in nine months, though,” said a family member. The autopsy team at RG Kar Medical College had three doctors from the forensic medicine department — Somnath Das, Somabrata Panja and Debasish Som. “We have also preserved DNA samples, viscera, particles from the stomach and other blood samples. Both the bodies had multiple bullet injuries,” said Somnath Das, the forensic medicine head. Doctors said the entire autopsy procedure was video-graphed as per National Human Rights Commission protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-cops-wait-for-noc-from-punjab-to-hand-over-bodies/articleshow/83444602.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Nagpur||Family planning comment for betterment of Assam’s immigrant Muslims: CM Hemant Biswa Sarma||NAGPUR: Assam chief minister Hemant Biswa Sarma, who is in the spotlight for his statement that immigrant Muslims of the north-eastern state should adopt family planning, said indigenous Muslims of Assam have always been better off as compared to migrants. The statement was particularly targeted at the immigrants, or the Bengali Muslims, who have large families to their own detriment. The family size of the indigenous Muslims is smaller like other Assamese, he said. Sarma was in the city for a visit at the RSS headquarters, where he held an over hour-long meeting with RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat before paying a visit to the Hedgewar Smruti Mandir at Reshimbagh. He clarified that no political issue was discussed, neither his recent statement. “As chief minister, it would not have been right for me to target Muslims in general. This has nothing to do with politics. The BJP as a party has been taking up the issue of increasing Muslim population on the state’s demographic profile on different forums. What is said is purely related to poverty alleviation of the immigrant Muslims,” he said. Assam has indigenous Muslims as well as immigrants who have come from unified Bengal and also Bangladesh in the 20th century. They are culturally different from the Assamese Muslims. The immigrants have huge families. The average number of children among the immigrants ranges from 6 to 12. Some have as many as 20. This thinly divides their land and income, which is the reason they have been asked to have a decent family size, Sarma said. As against that, the indigenous Muslims don’t have such issues. They have two to three children. Smaller families ensure better living standards for the Assamese Muslims, he said. Sarma said both Muslim communities are culturally different and there is rarely any mixing between the two. The state has 1.35 crore Muslims, out of which around 13 lakh may be indigenous, he said. Sarma said he was at the RSS headquarters with his family before he had become the chief minister. This was the first visit after assuming charge as CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/family-planning-comment-for-betterment-of-assams-immigrant-muslims-sarma/articleshow/83444652.cms||Shishir Arya

All the village offices will be converted as smart village offices in the next five years, he said in the inaugural address at the conference of all village officers in the state on Friday. The chief minister said that the village offices are the ones on which the public depends the most. Out of 1666 village offices, 126 have been converted to smart village offices while the work on another 342 are underway. He said that the attitude of the officials should also change. Revenue-based services are made available to the common man through village offices and officials at these offices should be willing to update and upgrade themselves. There has to be positive changes in all village offices, said the chief minister. The government is aiming at a corruption-free, efficient and people-friendly civil service in the state, he said. The chief minister said that in the next two years, an integrated land record portal that is based on CORS (continuing operating referral system) will be implemented in all the village offices. With this, all the services offered through revenue, survey and registration departments will be available through a single portal, he said. Revenue minister K Rajan said that the government’s plan to computerize all village offices and also make all public utility services available online for easy dispensation will be in addition to new buildings or premises for village offices and also technological know-how for the staff in these offices. The agenda of the meeting was to come up with a set of guidelines on how to implement the Vision and Mission 2021-26 programme of the government. The minister also said that corruption will not be tolerated at any cost. According to him, inconveniencing a citizen by asking them to come multiple times to get some work done also amounts to corruption as much as accepting money or a bribe in lieu of getting something done. The social welfare pension scheme that is being distributed by the revenue department will be made available online and a mobile app will be created to make land revenue tax easily payable online, he said. Close to 1,600 village officers attended this online session which was also attended by principal secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak, land revenue commissioner K Biju and other top revenue officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/services-of-village-offices-to-go-online-from-oct-2/articleshow/83444629.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||‘No quality education in Punjab govt schools’||New Delhi/Chandigarh: Raising strong objections against a report released by the central government that credited the Punjab government for hosting the best government schools in the country, deputy CM Manish Sisodia in a press conference claimed that it was an outcome of good relations between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh before the upcoming Punjab elections in 2022. Sisodia stated that crediting the Punjab government with having the best government schools in the country at a time when Punjab had seen the closure of more than 800 schools was a farce. Schools there are not up to the mark and some of them are functioning as alcohol factories, he claimed. “It is crystal clear that Captain Amarinder Singh has the blessings of Modi and the central government for the upcoming elections and we can consider this report as a gift to Singh,” Sisodia said. Sisodia said quality education and learning had become a joke in Punjab government schools. “The Centre has released this report to hide the inadequacies in quality education of Punjab. In the last 3-4 years, almost 800 government schools have shut down in Punjab, and have been given to NGOs or other institutions to function. Many children had to bear the brunt and parents had to transfer their children to private schools. In fact, a few government schools in Punjab were also found to be hosting alcohol factories on their premises,” the deputy CM said. He added that in a few days, the Centre would release another report claiming that Punjab government hospitals were the best in the country. Delhi BJP spokespersons Harish Khurana and Praveen Shankar Kapoor slammed the deputy CM for his remarks and claimed that he made baseless and misleading remarks. “Delhi’s education model is fake. The AAP government pushed out 15 lakh weak students of classes IX and XI out of the formal education network forcing them to opt for NOIS schooling instead of helping them improve during the last six years. The government must answer why 79% Delhi government schools don’t teach science denying society’s poorer section students opportunity to become doctors, engineers, etc.,” the BJP functionaries said. When the Centre’s report favours Delhi government, the AAP functionaries go out claiming credit for their work but why then they try to discredit its report which goes against them, they asked. Dubbing Sisodia’s allegation as “atrocious,” Punjab CM Amarinder Singh termed it a clear case of AAP crying foul in the face of its imminent wipe-out from Punjab in the 2022 assembly polls. He said the AAP leadership was so obsessed with electoral politics that it saw poll conspiracies even in something as basic as school education. “Come to Punjab and I will show you around our schools,” said Singh. “Your political dialogues cannot undermine this success,” he said, terming Sisodia’s comments as an obvious case of “sour grapes” since Delhi-NCR had scored a poor 6th ranking in the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-quality-education-in-punjab-govt-schools/articleshow/83470481.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

"The party has been regularly getting guidance of Amit Shah, a master of organisational functioning. It was under his leadership that BJP became a formidable force in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

Apna Dal, the OBC (Kurmi) dominant political outfit, has been with the BJP since 2014.

The CM also ordered to involve all the state government employees in the vaccination drive. “They should motivate a maximum number of people for taking the Covid-19 vaccine,” he said. Nitish further asked the health officials to run the vaccination campaign on a regular basis and use different mediums to educate people about its benefits. “You all should make micro-level planning at the panchayat level and ward level to ensure that no person is left without vaccination,” he said. The CM said people should be asked to get themselves vaccinated and ensure vaccination of each member in the family. The vaccinated people must motivate their neighbours for taking vaccines. “Though there has been a sharp decline in the Covid-19 cases in the state in the recent weeks, the health department officials should increase the rate of testing. People have now started coming out of home after the end of the lockdown. Hence, it is necessary to conduct Covid-19 test on all people,” Nitish said, adding, “The state government is taking all necessary steps to save people from the pandemic.” Nitish also said ever since the people of the state have given him opportunity to serve them, development works have been done in all sector across the state. “Special attention was given to the sectors like education and health. Besides the infrastructure development, several good works have been done in the health sector. Resultantly, the number of patients seeking treatment at the government-run health facilities has increased manifold,” he said. Earlier, additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit made a detailed presentation before the CM on the current status of Covid-19 infection and vaccination programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/6-crore-to-get-vax-shots-in-next-6-months-cm/articleshow/83441000.cms||Madan Kumar

He said, while people across nation were suffering, the central government was making it worse by adding GST on Covid equipment. “It is necessary to make Covid medical equipment, like vaccine, masks, sanitisers, thermometer, oximeter and other equipment. Expenses related to them have now been added to the monthly budget of people. They are waiting to see if the bill for a sanitiser or mask will remain Rs 500 or go up to Rs 550 with tax,” he added. Speaking on the possibility of a third wave, Sisodia said, “We can compare our Covid waves with the UK. As cases peak there, we can say that India will also see another peak. Keeping in mind the possible third wave, governments across the nation have started ramping up medical facilities. Private sectors have also been asked to invest in public healthcare. If a state government asks a private company to invest Rs 10 lakh in a hospital to increase its ICU hospital, does this mean that the hospital will get the full amount or will it receive a deducted amount after tax?” The deputy CM claimed that the suggestions were put across keeping in mind the rising Covid expenditure for people. “People want their governments to not make money out of this expenditure but help and support them by making the equipment tax-free. Many BJP members are against this move. The BJP-led central government showed their discontent against the state governments, which recommended masks, sanitisers, thermometers, etc, be made tax-free. GST council did not listen to any of us and has not accepted these suggestions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-bats-for-tax-free-covid-items-at-gst-meet/articleshow/83470493.cms||---

The body of Ranju Devi, 40, of New Samrat Colony, was found in four gunny bags at a plot in Kanganwal on June 8. Her hands and feet were tied up. Police said the woman had illicit relations with the man. Dalip Kumar, 45, a labour contractor, and his 19-year-old son who is a Class XII student were nabbed near Jaspal Bangar. A kitchen knife and a two-wheeler used to execute the crime have been recovered.  Additional deputy commissioner of police-II Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said, “Ranju had divorced her husband years ago and was living here with her 15-year-old daughter. Dalip and Ranju were in a relationship for the past 10 years. Dalip helped Ranju build her house. She was asking him to furnish it too. Due to the lockdown, Dalip was facing financial problems and could not help her. This led to frequent fights between the two. Therefore, Dalip decided to eliminate Ranju and took his son’s help to execute his plan.” “Dalip’s four daughters and wife work as domestic helps. They leave for work in the morning and return late in the evening. On June 7, Dalip called Ranju to his house. His son hit Ranju with a baseball bat and she lost consciousness. Thereafter, Dalip slit her throat with a kitchen knife. The duo wrapped her body in gunny bags and dumped it at the vacant plot,” he added. Sahnewal SHO sub-inspector Balwinder Singh said, “Dalip’s wife was unaware of her husband’s illicit relationship. Other than his son, nobody from his family knew that Ranju was killed at their house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/kanganwal-murder-solved-with-arrest-of-man-son/articleshow/83442852.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Enrolment ratio slightly up in Rajasthan, but still below national average||JAIPUR: Rajasthan has registered a little increase in the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) although it is still behind national average of 27.1%. In the recently published All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report, Rajasthan recorded an increase in the GER from 23% in 2018-19 to 23.9% in 2019-20. GER is a percentage of population in 18-23 age group enrolled in higher education. This can be seen as a big drawback in Rajasthan having 3,380 colleges. It means around 37 colleges per lakh population putting it at fourth position for highest number of colleges in India. Jaipur holds second position nationally with highest number of colleges. In the last three years, state government has opened around 80 government colleges across Rajasthan for accessibility of higher education to students residing in rural areas. Government has also allotted major portion of the budget to education. According to the report, female enrolment of 24.3% was slightly higher than male enrolment of 24.1% in 2019-20 session. This is higher than 2018-19 session when female enrolment was 23.1% while male enrolment was 23%. Higher education expert Puneet Sharma said, "Government has opened colleges in rural areas and now it is for the society to take initiative and send students to the higher education institutes. People need to take the initiative because unless the enrolment scenario in higher education changes, the overall development of the state is difficult." Another major setback for higher education in Rajasthan in the Gender Parity Index (GPI), i.e., a ratio of proportional representation of female and male in higher education which is below national average. In 2018, Rajasthan touched the GPI national average of 1, which went down to 0.98 in 2019-20. The national GPI was 1.01 this year. Rajasthan is suffering from poor pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) with more than 50% faculty seats in higher education institutes lying vacant. Government opening colleges without filling vacancies has impacted the higher education. The pupil-teacher ratio in Rajasthan has been one teacher on 29 pupils in regular and distant mode and 26 pupils in regular mode. In an ideal scenario, PTR should be one teacher on 20 pupils. This is above national average of 26 in regular and distant mode and 23 in regular mode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/enrolment-ratio-slightly-up-in-raj-but-still-below-natl-avg/articleshow/83446547.cms||---

A dog lover, Dey was on a mission to feed the stray dogs there as she feared that the animals would be starving after the cyclone. After the cyclone had converted Digha into a deserted town, Dey and three other animal lovers were relentlessly feeding around 150 stray dogs. Dey even risked her life to save a dog when she saw it was being swept away by a huge tidal wave. She also found several horses in a deplorable condition. The number of abandoned horses grew with each passing day. “A time came when we became tired feeding the stray dogs and abandoned horses and looking after their treatment as well. Many of the horses and dogs needed immediate medical attention. We did whatever we could as dog lovers who are trained to look after the needs of these animals,” Dey said. She added that she was fortunate to have her sister Dalia Gupta, also an animal lover, by her side in Digha. However, feeding so many dogs and horses wasn’t an easy task. As the stock of food was exhausted, Dey and her two others came back to the city last week for a day to raise funds and buy food for the animals affected by the storm. “We didn’t have the time to stay more than a day in Kolkata, thinking over the plight of the stray animals. We also needed to feed stray cats in large numbers two days after the cyclone had hit the city.

---||Dehradun||Beacons of Hope: From free food to medical supplies, how Covid survivors, after recovering, are helping others in need||Dehradun: Familiar with the struggles one deals with when being severely infected with Covid-19, several survivors in Dehradun are now helping pandemic-affected families access oxygen, injections, home-cooked food and other required medical supplies. Akruti Singh, a 19-year-old Dehradun-based student who is reaching out to Covid-infected people in need, told TOI, “When I contracted the virus, my oxygen level dropped to 50 and the pulse rate to 40. I was badly in need of medical supplies but there was a shortage in the market. Despite my relatives being medical professionals, my family faced a difficult time procuring necessary medicines. After recovering from the infection, I decided to help others going through the ordeal.” Akruti is now a volunteer of ‘Covid Task Force’, being run by her classmates. The group connects people in need with verified suppliers and also arranges medical essentials for them. Another Dehradun resident, Srishti Rana, is running a tiffin service from her kitchen for Covid-affected families. “All members of my family contracted the virus around the same time. It was a very difficult time for us as we didn’t have the strength to cook and our neighbours didn’t help us fearing they would catch the infection. There were times when we went to bed on an empty stomach. We survived that phase on our stock of packaged snacks. After recovering from Covid-19, I started a tiffin service for virus-hit people as I didn’t want any other family to go through the same trauma,” said Rana.  She is currently delivering lunch and dinner packets to approximately 60-70 infected households in Rajpur Road and Aman Vihar localities. She doesn’t charge for her service but some people pay her willingly. Utkarsh Dubey, a 26-year-old city resident and Covid survivor, has also launched a noble initiative. He arranges logs of wood and other necessary items for the cremation of Covid victims. “I lost my close ones and acquaintances to Covid-19 during the second wave of the virus. It was heartbreaking to see the bereaved families deal with the mismanagement at crematoriums. Thus, I decided to help out people carry out the last rites of their dear ones in a dignified manner.” By Ashita Kapoor||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/beacons-of-hope-from-free-food-to-medical-supplies-how-covid-survivors-after-recovering-are-helping-others-in-need/articleshow/83442903.cms||---

The CM presented PM Modi with two other books, a study by John Hopkins University and one on the suggested model of ascertaining Gross Domestic Product at district level. “The report, based on a study, highlights the UP government’s handling of the migrant crisis. Around 40 lakh people returned to the state during the first lockdown. Due to the efforts and vision of the CM, the state has earned praise from international community several times during the Covid-19 pandemic,” a government spokesperson said. “The report spoke about the crisis faced by migrants who depend on daily wages for survival. Coming to their rescue, the CM directed officials to provide transportation facilities, deliver ration kits, and run healthcare centres to prevent Covid outbreak. The government also announced schemes to provide free ration to migrants,” he added. He said the study on which the report was based, discussed how the ‘Yogi Model’ took care of migrants through a combined mechanism of Covid-19 prevention, sustenance for their families, employment arrangements along with skill mapping and other logistics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-gifts-books-on-states-handling-of-migrant-crisis/articleshow/83446555.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC keeps eye on pricing of off-site jabs by private hospitals||MUMBAI: Even as private hospitals await clarity on the pricing for off-site vaccination, the civic body on Friday said citizens can reach out to it with complaints of overcharging. Vaccinations saw a decline in the city on Friday, while Kalyan-Dombivli corporation cancelled its drive for Saturday and Sunday. Rain was believed to be the reason. The Union health ministry on Tuesday had fixed the rates that private hospitals can charge: Rs 1,410 for Covaxin, Rs 780 for Covishield and Rs 1,145 for every dose of Sputnik V. The price includes a 5% GST above the landing cost of vaccines and a service charge of Rs 150. The BMC said that people can write to complaint.epimumbai@gmail.com to alert about any instances of profiteering from vaccination. “Action will be taken if any hospital is found charging more than the prescribed rate,” the civic body said on Friday. Private hospitals have demanded clarity on whether the capping applies to offsite drives too, such as vaccination carried out at workplaces and housing societies, or it was only for onsite vaccination, meaning within the hospital premises. A hospital head said that many have put their tie-ups with corporates and housing societies on hold till there was clear communication from the Centre. Private hospitals in Kolkata have been told they can charge extra under the category of ‘value-added services’ for off-site drives. They have been told the service charge component will remain fixed at Rs 150, though. State as well as BMC officials said that there was no clarity on the matter yet. The drop in vaccination in Mumbai was, presumably, due to the rain. Compared to 69,713 who got vaccinated on Thursday, only 53,427 took the vaccine on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-keeps-eye-on-pricing-of-off-site-jabs-by-pvt-hosps/articleshow/83446568.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ITI admissions to be based on SSC results; no entrance test now||Students aspiring for a seat at Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) will not have to go through any entrance test for admissions to diploma courses. They can present their secondary school certificate (SSC) mark-sheet, and based on merit admissions will be done. Directorate of Vocational Education and Training (DVET), which conducts ITI admissions, announced that caste certificate, Aadhaar card and other documents should be ready. Every year, demand for ITI seats is very high and nearly two applications for every ITI seat run by the state government institute are received by DVET. ITI admissions coordinator Ashish Akhade said, “We will conduct an online centralised admission process. Students can process forms right from application to admission confirmation. We decided not to conduct an entrance test as admissions are tough, especially with government institutes.” DVET officials said ITI courses were popular as candidates have a high rate of job opportunities and fees are less; duration of courses varies from a year to three years. Last year, 4,000 extra applications were received by DVET, compared to the previous year. Director of DVET Yogesh Patil said “Since the past four to five years, the trend has been on high for ITI courses for various reasons including immediate job opportunities and short duration. The department has introduced many courses based on changing trends which includes robotics, agriculture and others which are also high in demand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-iti-admissions-to-be-based-on-ssc-results-no-entrance-test-now/articleshow/83447956.cms||Swati Shinde

The canal re-opened after 60 days of repair work on June 6 and is releasing black water.The canal provides water to 1.75 crore people living in 7,500 villages in 10 districts in the state who are in danger of drinking and irrigating their fields with polluted water.Ganganagar MP Nihal Chand has shot a letter to Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to intervene by taking action against Punjab for not addressing the problem for years. “I have been raising the issue for the past seven years, but to no avail. I have evidence that how Punjab has protected polluting industries which were penalised by the NGT for polluting IGNP,” said Chand. He added that tanneries in Ludhiana and Jalandhar release effluents into Budda Nullah which fills the IGNP that flows into the state. The matter has been raised in the parliament, but the Punjab government has not paid any heed to it, which shows their blatant disregard for the bilateral agreements with Rajasthan, said Chand, who expressed concern that the polluted water is likely to create health hazard among the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/filthy-water-continues-to-flow-into-indira-gandhi-canal/articleshow/83446563.cms||---
---||Delhi||New in nursery, but still stuck at home||New Delhi: Mohit Goel’s son was admitted to nursery class in a private school this year. As soon as he was admitted, the second wave of Covid hit Delhi and schools were closed for summer vacation. Now with the third wave being predicted, parents like Goel and others whose children were admitted to nursery in 2020 are a worried lot. “A child’s brain develops the most during the early years of life. But because of Covid, he is just confined to the house with me and my wife. I feel he is missing out on social interaction, developing cognitive skills, facing the public at large and many more skill sets that are needed for overall growth of the brain,” said Goel. His son is admitted to Bal Bharti School, Pitampura. Both Goel and his wife are working professionals. They have noticed their child throwing tantrums and crying when they are busy with their work. “Staying away from school will mean that the children will be devoid of holistic learning and grasping power abilities. Also, they don’t take parents seriously in comparison to teachers for learning skills,” Goel added. For every parent, keeping the child in front of the screen even for an hour’s class is a challenge. Shilpa Arora, a grandparent, whose grandson is admitted to a nursery school, says, “My daughter is somehow managing it. She has to sit along with him during the class.” Arora adds that activity classes and yoga helped the child cope with the online classes. Richi Verma, mother of twins, shares, “When the new academic year started in April, we expected that kids would finally get to go to school and meet their teachers and classmates. But then the second wave hit and now it appears that online classes will continue this year as well. Nursery kids have no idea what they are missing out on as they never got the opportunity to experience the school life.” “We are left with the Hobson’s choice of forcing our little ones to sit in front of a laptop for learning while they should have been experiencing and enjoying games, rhymes and social interaction at school.” Both Goel and Verma think the children are becoming overdependent on parents, which could turn into a cause for concern later. “Many kids have become unsociable and irritable. They are also becoming dependent on parents who are always there to help them with online classes. Through online classes, kids cannot develop an emotional connection with their teachers and peers. They will have to learn all these things once they step out in post-Covid normal environment. The transition won’t be that easy,” said Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-in-nursery-but-still-stuck-at-home/articleshow/83470497.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Delhi||An inclusive social infra with greater support for children, women and seniors||New Delhi: The draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 tries to put forth a vision for a more inclusive capital where all new schools will be integrated from pre-primary to higher secondary levels and will even cater to all requirements of children with special needs. Schools for children with special needs may also be permitted as standalone facilities. The chapter on social infrastructure also lays emphasis on early learning and child-care facilities to ensure holistic development of infants and toddlers and provide support to families, especially working women. The section covers a wide range of public and semi-public facilities, including health, education, socio-cultural facilities, safety and security infrastructure, communications and distributive facilities. For optimal use of space for social infrastructure, MPD 41 offers flexibility to develop social facilities as part of a built-up area through vertical mixing. “This will help create facilities in areas where adequate land is not available. Local-level facility plots shall be treated as ‘multi-facility plots’ that can be utilised for co-location of compatible facilities as per requirements. Such plots shall be allowed enhanced FAR to accommodate multiple uses.” The draft Plan goes on to talk of “ensuring facilities for all” with focus on children, women, elderly, people with special abilities and families from economically weaker sections. “All new facilities and public conveniences shall be designed to ensure accessibility and ease of use” while existing facilities may be retrofitted. It lays down a population-linked “hierarchy of social infrastructure” from local to city levels. At the local level, facilities catering to daily needs of local population will be adequately distributed for every 10,000 population size. Community-level social infrastructure will serve up to 1 lakh people, and at the sub-city level, larger facilities will serve up to 5 lakh population base. City-level infrastructure will cater to the city as well as the region. The draft also takes into account the emerging needs in healthcare services and also talks about care facilities for elderly, persons with disabilities, people with special needs and facilities for mental healthcare, de-addiction/rehabilitation centres and after-care centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/an-inclusive-social-infra-with-greater-support-for-children-women-and-seniors/articleshow/83444716.cms||Ambika Pandit

The accused at first sent friend requests to a few people. Later, he requested monetary help from them. ACP Chaudhary came to know about it on Friday, following which he informed the cyber cell of Ludhiana police and also uploaded a post related to it in his profile. ACP Chaudhary said, “I got this information from my friends on Friday morning that they have received a message from a Facebook profile which is created in my name. The accused is sending messages to them that I am admitted to hospital and need Rs 15,000 or Rs 20,000. The accused has also shared a number asking them to transfer the money through an e-wallet.” “Thankfully, all those who received messages, did not fall into the trap and understood that it is a fraud. As soon as I got this information, I reported it to the cyber cell and also updated a post on my genuine profile informing my friends about it. I have also upgraded the security of my Facebook profile,” added the ACP. The official said cyber cell has tracking the number used by the accused for transferring money. The number is registered in Jharkhand. Earlier as well several such incidents have been reported in the city. Especially during the lockdown last year, cyber fraudsters started creating fake profiles and sent messages to people claiming that they have lost jobs due to the pandemic and requested for monetary help. In September last year, a similar fraud happened with a city-based principal of a college. Someone had created his fake profile and demanded Rs 25,000 from his friend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/man-creates-fake-fb-profile-of-acp-requests-for-donations/articleshow/83442901.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Delhi||Work with states instead of abusing them: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: As the row over the plan to take ration to the doorsteps of the beneficiaries continued, the state government and the Centre accused each other of siding with the ration mafia. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday that instead of carrying the states along, the central government was busy abusing them. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia added at a press conference that BJP should be called Bharatiya Jhagda Party, criticising it for “ignoring” the demand of states for Covid vaccines, cancelling the Class XII examinations only when the Supreme Court intervened and opposing the AAP government move on the delivery of ration. “Today people want a central government that takes everyone along instead of fighting and abusing the state governments throughout the day,” tweeted Kejriwal. “The country will progress when 130 crore people, all state governments and the Centre together work like team India. So much abuse is not good.” This was in response to Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad alleging that Aam Aadmi Party was under the control of the ration mafia. The minister also took a swipe at the state government for planning doorstep delivery of ration when it had “failed to provide oxygen” to the people of Delhi. Sisodia, on his part, stated that the ministers of the BJP-led central government appeared to have no other work but to divert the focus of people and attack the West Bengal government, Jharkhand government, Maharashtra government or any other government led by the Opposition, all of which were actually doing good work. “It has become normal behaviour for the central government to slam 4-5 state governments every day. The only common thread running through oxygen management, vaccines, ration and Covid-19 management is BJP’s opposition and deliberate inaction,” said Sisodia. The deputy CM also asked, “It was only after the Supreme Court asked the central government to supply oxygen or face contempt that the Centre began helping states. Why didn’t the central government take any action on oxygen supply earlier?” As for the dilemma faced by several students, parents and state governments regarding the Class XII examinations, Sisodia said, “Many state governments as well as our nation’s children supported cancelling the examinations. But there were objections from BJP leaders. Why were the board exams cancelled only when the Supreme Court stepped in? The state governments had also appealed to the central government for adequate vaccines, but even here it turned a deaf ear to our requests. Instead, the Centre just slammed the state governments. It was again only when the Supreme Court intervened that the Centre woke up to our request for vaccines.” Sisodia wanted to know the Centre’s logic for blocking Delhi government’s scheme for the doorstep delivery of ration. “When CM Arvind Kejriwal asked why ration couldn’t be delivered to households when pizza could be, BJP leaders pounced on him and called him corrupt. What is wrong if a CM, who is an IIT graduate, promotes doorstep delivery of ration?” Sisodia said. “India’s people are tired of being led by a government that only engages in petty politics and slams state governments for doing good work.” The deputy CM went on, “Citizens elected Bhartiya Janata Party to power, but now we should simply call it Bharatiya Jhagda Party. All that BJP does is fight with people. I want to ask BJP leaders to maintain the party’s vision instead of solidifying its Bharatiya Jhagda Party image. Our citizens want a government that can collaborate with states and work for the development of the nation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-with-states-instead-of-abusing-them-cm/articleshow/83446574.cms||AlokKNMishra

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Jhunjhunu woman killed by son over mining of bajri||JAIPUR: A 60-year-old woman was mowed to death allegedly by her son and his aides involved in mining sand (bajri) from the disputed farmland in Udaipurwati area of Jhunjhunu district. The death of Sona Devi sparked protests in Kankariya village, with several locals demanding the arrest of her son Ratan Lal Saini and other accomplices. Sources in district police said that angry protesters tried to set a forkland machine on fire. An FIR was registered against Ratan Lal Saini, Balram Saini, and others at Khetri police station, based on a complaint submitted by Sona Devi’s elder son Shankar Lal Saini. According to SP, Jhunjhunu, Manish Tripathi, Friday’s murder was part of a protracted land dispute between two feuding brothers — Shankar Lal Saini and Ratan Lal Saini. The dispute aggravated in the past couple of days after Ratan Lal allegedly allied with Balram to extract bajri (gravel sand) from the land. “The land in question belongs to Ratan and Shankar’s father, Mukhram. The family alleged that Ratan had leased out land to Balram and they were also involved in extracting sand from the disputed property,” Tripathi told TOI. The verbal spats snowballed into a violent confrontation when Ratan allegedly ran over Sona Devi with a jeep. Shankar told Khetri police that he and his father Mukhram were also injured in the attack. “The FIR was registered against Ratan and his accomplices. For the past several days, the two brothers had been locked in the dispute,” said Khetri SHO Surendra Singh. Senior police officials of the district were sent to Kankariya village to pacify angry protesters. Sources told TOI that family members refused to cremate the body; however, officials said they are making attempts to speak to villagers in order to control the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jhunjhunu-woman-killed-by-son-over-mining-of-bajri/articleshow/83446570.cms||---
---||Delhi||Admissions dip, Ignou tries online steps||New Delhi: Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou) saw a drop of about 75,000 fresh admissions in the 2020-21 session, which was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Only about 7.3 lakh students took admission in the session as against about 8 lakh admissions that took place in 2019-2020. Calling the drop marginal, Ignou vice-chancellor Nageshwar Rao told TOI, “It could be just 2-3% lower and I strongly believe that this is a short-term phenomenon. I feel that the purchasing power of people would have been affected due to Covid. Ignou caters to people in the middle and lower-income groups and their income has been affected due to the coronavirus crisis.” The open university conducts admissions in two cycles—one in July and the other in January. While the drop in the number of admissions in July as compared to the previous year's corresponding cycle was around 10,000, it was 60,000 lesser in January. “Due to the pandemic, there was a lot of uncertainty among the learners about exams and classes. We managed to conduct examinations in February-March and even declared the results, but Covid deaths and other losses have affected many families,” said Rao. He added that for courses like masters of computer application and masters of business administration, the enrolment was not much affected. “The slight dip in enrolment could also be because now, there are more distance education options available. States like Odisha, Punjab and Kerala have got open universities. All other state open universities are also trying to increase their enrolment figures. These universities have an advantage that their study materials are available in local languages,” said Rao. Ignou's study materials are available only in English and Hindi. “Even in many of the Hindi heartland like Bihar and UP, open universities such as Nalanda Open University and others have come up,” he said further. However, with Ignou updating its syllabus of the undergraduate programme and now offering honours courses, students are showing interest. It also follows the choice-based credit system. “As one of the largest universities, we are trying all means to reach the learners. We have five channels and we put out their schedules on different social media platforms. We are also using Facebook to reach the learners and to disseminate information,” said the VC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/admissions-dip-ignou-tries-online-steps/articleshow/83470504.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Patna||Patna HC questions state on jump in Covid toll||PATNA: The Patna high court on Friday expressed serious concern over the sudden jump in Covid-19 toll from 5,424 on June 7 to 9,375 the next day and constituted a special bench to conduct detailed hearing on the issue on Saturday. The Patna high court generally remains closed on Saturday. The bench expressed dissatisfaction over the counter affidavit submitted by the chief secretary on the revised toll of 9,375. The court was also apprised that the Buxar toll had also increased from 83 to 180 on June 8 after scrutiny. “How did it happen? No one would have come to know about the total deaths had we not passed an order on it,” the division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar court observed orally when the new death figures were submitted before it during the hearing on Friday. The state government had conducted scrutiny of the Covid deaths on the high court order on May 17 after a large number of decomposed bodies were found floating in the Ganga near Chausa in Buxar district. The bench had directed the chief secretary to file a detailed reply on the deaths from Covid-19 or other reasons from March 1 this year and the government's methodology to ascertain that the deaths were due to the coronavirus. The court refused some more time to advocate general Lalit Kishore for hearing the case and observed that the issue was extraordinary. Kishore blamed the civil surgeons and panchayat secretaries for not providing accurate figures from districts. Kishore also submitted that departmental proceedings would be initiated against all those found responsible for not reporting the correct number of deaths from Covid-19. The bench also wanted to know how births along with deaths from Covid-19 and other reasons were made visible separately to common public on government portal. Development commissioner Amir Subhani appeared before the bench virtually and submitted that the Registrar General of India controls the entire matter and some designated authorities at state level are granted access to control the portal on which birth and death figures are uploaded. The court directed that a report on the matter be filed after a meeting with the authorities concerned to apprise how common people could see these figures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-questions-state-on-jump-in-covid-toll/articleshow/83441039.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Delhi||Delhi Skills varsity to admit 6k in first batch||NEW DELHI: Delhi Skill and Entrepreneurship University (DSEU) will begin the admission process for its first batch of 6,000 students by July 2021. The government clarified this on Saturday, as earlier they had said the aptitude test will be conducted in December-January. Given the current circumstances, this year instead of the aptitude test, the university has developed a merit-based selection process, which will shortlist candidates premised on their performance in (i) class XII (ii) vocational subjects in class X/XII (iii) extracurricular activities in the last 5 years. As per a new communication released by the Delhi government on Saturday the academic session will begin in September 2021. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “The university will go to schools to secure admissions of all those children who want to be involved in skill learning. DSEU will focus on conducting a 360-degree assessment. While most universities continue with their old practice of admitting students based on grade lists, DSEU will be the first university that will focus on the overall interest, talent, and mindset for entrepreneurship. Such practice is new in India but not unpopular abroad.” Out of the 6,000 students, 4,500 will study diploma courses and 1,500 degree courses. Sisodia interacted with Delhi government school principals, the vice-chancellor of DESU, Neharika Vohra, and MLA Atishi through a webinar on Friday. DESU will be offering 12 courses in digital media, business management, data analytics, aesthetics and beauty, and other subjects. Companies like HDFC Bank, Tata Consultancy, and Tech Mahindra, are the industry partners. “Universities like Oxford admit children based on conditions for them to complete courses and projects, not on their grades in Board exams. Similarly, our children now can be secure of the fact that they will get admitted into a university that will not stress on their grades but on their intent and their interest to study skills and become entrepreneurs,” said Sisodia. He added that the mission of the university would be to encourage students to become entrepreneurs. “Generic undergraduate courses do not encourage our students to become entrepreneurs. We cannot think that our children will study generic and archaic courses to be future-ready…Universities do not recognise the importance of skill learning and provide preferential treatment to those who have studied generic courses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/skills-varsity-to-admit-6k-in-first-batch/articleshow/83456458.cms||---

On Thursday, the Sunni Central Waqf Board had also filed a writ petition in the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court against the demolition of the mosque, said to be a century old, by the Barabanki district administration during an anti-encroachment drive on May 17. AIMPLB’s officiating general secretary Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, “The action taken by the district administration and police in the dark of the night on May 17 was illegal. The mosque was registered under the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board. The mosque was on waqf land, therefore, no magistrate or any other officer can take indiscriminate action. The waqf board was formed through the Waqf Act and its matters have to be taken up by the waqf tribunal.” “In March 2021, the additional district magistrate (ADM), Barabanki, had issued a notice to the mosque committee regarding the land. Against this notice, a case was filed in the high court. The court had granted 15 days’ time to reply (from March 18) which was submitted on April 1. Still, the district administration demolished the mosque,” he added. A day after the demolition, AIMPLB had demanded that the government should ensure that the rubble remains on the same land, no other construction is done at the site, guilty officials be suspended and a probe should be ordered under a high court judge. It added that the government should order reconstruction of the mosque and hand it over to Muslims. “The petition is in the name of AIMPLB and Barabanki residents Hashmat Ali and Naeem Ahmad and has been filed by advocate Saud Raees. The petitioners will be represented in the court by the head of AIMPLB’s legal committee, advocate Yusuf Machhala,” Rahmani said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aimplb-moves-hc-against-barabanki-mosque-demolition/articleshow/83446584.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Delhi||Project on CCTVs in EDMC schools stalled||New Delhi: The installation of CCTVs in 217 primary schools and public address systems in 232 schools of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has been put on hold and a war of words has broken out between AAP and BJP councillors over the issue. AAP councillors claimed they pointed out irregularities in the tendering process and pursued the commissioner, leading to the cancellation of the tender. The deliberative wing of the BJP-led EDMC, meanwhile, claimed that the tender was withdrawn on May 31 after they found that only one bid was received for the project. The project cost is Rs 36.4 crore and each camera will cost Rs 16,000 as per EDMC’s proposal. It included the supply, installation, testing, commissioning and maintenance of 5,000 CCTV cameras. BJP mayor Nirmal Jain said that the proposal was under consideration for a long time. “In February 2021, a tender for the cameras was floated in March-end. When we realised that there wa just one bid, a decision was taken to close the process after approval from the commissioner on May 31,” said Jain. “We fail to understand how AAP is taking credit for cancellation of the tender or blaming us for making changes in the tendering process to benefit one concessionaire.” He added that there were no changes made in the policy and neither was any changes made in the prices of projects. On Thursday, leader of Opposition in the House Manoj Tyagi had alleged that the BJP-led EDMC had made changes in tendering policy to benefit one contractor. “A tender was issued in 2020 over the same project and its cost was estimated at Rs 30 crore and solvency was Rs 14 crore,” said Tyagi. “The process came to a halt due to Covid and other reasons.” Tyagi claimed that when the process restarted in 2021, the deliberative wing intentionally increased cost of project and insolvency to Rs 36 crore and Rs 14.57 crore, respectively. “Now the changes have automatically paved the way for only one private concessionaire. We raised the matter in house meeting, commissioner and were waiting for formal approval before raising the matter in a press conference,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/project-on-cctvs-in-edmc-schools-stalled/articleshow/83444723.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||To tackle 3rd wave, Gujarat to double bed capacity to 1.1 lakh||GANDHINAGAR: The long queues outside Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad imprinted an unforgettable picture of the unprecedented demand for Covid beds in the city and state at large during the second wave. So, while preparing for the possible third wave of ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the state government has decided to double the existing number of Covid beds. Sources close to the development told TOI that the number is likely to rise from 60,000 to 1.1 lakh in the next few months. “More importantly, the number of ventilator beds will increase from 7,700 to 15,000. ICU beds will increase from 15,000 to 30,000. Thus, about 41% of the beds will have critical care facilities,” said sources. Acute shortage of beds in both government and private hospitals had forced many families across Gujarat to go to other cities for treatment as the massive second wave was 13 times higher than the post-Diwali surge. Senior health department officials said that all the new beds would have oxygen supply. “Having learnt from the second wave, we now know that the severity of the infection had increased oxygen demand manifold. Thus, preparations are underway to set up oxygen plants in all district headquarters and adding beds in the same proportion,” said an official. It’s also about prevention and detection, said sources close to the development. “The top brass has focused on expanding vaccination programme across the state to mitigate possible effects of the third wave. Today we are vaccinating about 2 lakh persons daily. On the other hand, RT-PCR labs will shortly increase from 52 to 100,” said sources. With focus on kids and teenagers as potential target for the third wave, the paediatric ICU and ventilators would witness an addition of about 25% of the existing capacity, said sources. The focus is also on human resources, said sources. “The existing planning aims at increasing number of doctors, nurses and other staff by at least one-and-a-half times while all vacant posts will also be filled up soon,” said a senior official. “Experts from the private sector will also be engaged if required. The current planning aims at tackling double the daily cases of the current peak of 14,605.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/to-tackle-3rd-wave-state-to-double-bed-capacity-to-1-1l/articleshow/83444720.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Delhi||Notice to private school over charging ‘wrong’ fees||New Delhi: Stating that a school has wrongly interpreted the Delhi High Court order on charging of the annual and development charges, a notice has been issued to a private school. The school has given 15% concession on the annual and development charges. However, the advocates who had challenged the single bench order on the same stated that the schools are to provide the 15% concession on the overall annual fees. The notice has been reportedly sent to Kulachi Hansraj School located at Ashok Vihar. Apart from it, another school, PP International School Pitampura, has also allegedly levied meal, transport activity charges even though physical classes have not yet started. In April 2020, following the first lockdown, Delhi government issued an order and prohibited private schools from charging annual and development charges. A single bench on May 31 allowed schools to charge annual and development charges for 2020-21 with some concession and also for 2021-22. This was then challenged in the court by Justice for All on behalf of parents and Delhi government. For this, a double bench passed an order that the concession should also be given for the year 2021-22. “The school has added IT charges, which actually is a part of the tuition fees. Some schools are also charging from April 2020 itself instead of the period following the lockdown. It is wrong on the part of the schools, especially during the time of pandemic,” said Khagesh Jha, advocate, Justice for All. The notice has asked the school to withdraw the circular, if not civil or criminal proceedings will be issued against the school. However, an official of the school said they have not received any notice. “The circular may be on the online portal, but since then we decided we will only take the annual and development charges.” According to Jha there are other schools as well who have been giving concession on annual and development charges and so they will be sending a notice to more such schools. The principal of PP International School, Deepti Bector, did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. However, a copy of the fee bill sent to a parent, a copy of which is with TOI, shows the different charges for the academic session 2020-21 session as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/notice-to-private-school-over-charging-wrong-fees/articleshow/83470508.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Goa||Goa: Following chaos at Quepem primary health centre, fish vendors shifted||Quepem: Fish vendors from Quepem were relocated to the market on Friday and henceforth will be allowed to operate from there. After the Quepem Municipal Council (QMC) shut the fish market during the lockdown, a few fish vendors had started carrying out business at various locations, but a majority of them shifted near the school. Later, these vendors were shifted near the Quepem primary health centre. However, on Thursday, a crazy rush was noticed on the Margao-Curchorem highway near the Quepem primary health centre (PHC) following which the civic body took the decision to relocate the vendors. When asked why the fish vendors and plastic sellers were assembled near the PHC, thus creating a chaotic scene, chairperson Suchita Shirvoikar had said that the market inspector had decided to place them there after a local councillor complained. Later Shirvoikar changed her statement saying that she, along with the councillors, had decided to change the location. “We have allowed them to do the business only on Thursday near the new location. Also, they will not be allowed to sit right near the primary health centre, let them sit at different places to avoid unnecessary rush,” Shirvoikar said. When contacted, one fish vendor said that the council must decide on where to place them and must also ensure crowd management. After the Quepem civic body shut the fish market during the lockdown, few fish vendors started doing business at various locations, but a majority of them were shifted near the school. Later, these vendors were shifted near the PHC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/following-chaos-at-quepem-phc-fish-vendors-shifted/articleshow/83446627.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC informs Bombay HC it has sought nod from Centre to give jabs at home||MUMBAI: The civic administration informed the Bombay high court on Friday that it was not the one who administered the vaccine at home to a senior politician in Mumbai and that it has sought permission on Thursday from the central government to conduct door-to-door vaccination for the severely ill and bedridden citizens or others who cannot leave their home due to any kind of disability. The high court asked the Centre if its no-door-to-door policy was a binding policy or not. “If Kerala is doing it ... why don’t you study the Kerala (door-to-door vaccination) model and if it appeals to you then allow other states to do it,” said the bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni. For the Centre, additional solicitor general Anil Singh sought time to reply and the high court posted to Monday a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in early April by two city lawyers, Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, for a policy to enable home jabs to the elderly aged over 75 and other specially abled and homebound people. The high court asked the ASG to advise the government to take some positive decisions so that lives are not lost. “You want people to come out and those who cannot come out, do not get vaccinated? This is the message being sent to the people,” the court said. On June 9, the high court said such a policy had an “element of discrimination”. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) gave the court a letter written by civic chief Iqbal Chahal on June 10 to Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare, citing the high court order of June 9. Chahal said that if permission is granted, the civic body is willing and requested the Centre to provide guidelines for conducting door-to-door vaccination. On Wednesday the high court had asked the BMC and the state to inform which of them had vaccinated the politician at home. On Friday, the bench said it “did not deliberately” put it in its order but again sought to know. Sakhare said it was not the BMC staff. The state’s lawyer had “no instructions” and said a week’s time is required. The bench asked incredulously: “A week’s time?”, and reminded them of the old saying ‘You show me the man, I will show you the rule’. To the special civic counsel Sakhare, it said: “Is it your contention that without the Centre’s permission you have never gone ahead with any decision?” The bench said in its review meeting municipal commissioner Chahal had said Maharashtra was the first state which was chasing the coronavirus. “Did he ask for permission from the Centre to chase the virus? These were innovations that you (BMC) thought of which you successfully employed and we were all very proud and happy that BMC has thought of them,” the bench said. In its June 9 order the HC had said “disclosures made by Kapadia throw up issues that the state, Centre and BMC needs to address”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-informs-hc-it-has-sought-nod-from-centre-to-give-jabs-at-home/articleshow/83446679.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Mask missing, several men admonished by city court||New Delhi: Handing out conviction for not wearing masks and violating Covid-19 guidelines in the capital, several men were “admonished” by a Delhi court after they pleaded guilty for violating the imposed law during the lockdown. “The convict states that he belongs to a poor family and is the sole breadwinner. He is also remorseful of his act and undertakes not to commit the offence in the future. Hence, a lenient view is prayed for. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, the convict is admonished under Section188 IPC... Since the accused was found not wearing the mask and violated the guidelines of Covid-19, hence this case,” held chief metropolitan magistrate Satvir Singh Lamba in one of the orders. Police chargesheeted these men, who were booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of IPC. The incident took place on April 19, when they were reportedly spotted without a mask during the lockdown. After examining the chargesheets, the court found a prima facie case under Section188 IPC against the accused and framed the charge to which they pleaded guilty and did not ask for a trial. The court, accordingly, convicted them for the offence, but noted that there was no injury or a victim in the case, and it didn’t require calling for a “victim impact report” keeping in mind Delhi High Court judgment in Karan vs State (NCT of Delhi). “Since the case has been disposed of at the initial stage before the commencement of trial, it can be deduced that there are no expenses incurred by the prosecution as accused has pleaded guilty early. Hence, this court does not see any justified reason for calling any affidavit from the prosecution in respect of the expenses incurred,” the order reasoned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mask-missing-several-men-admonished-by-city-court/articleshow/83470537.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Delhi||Around 200 trees failed to weather the storm in June||New Delhi: The increased frequency of dust storms in the last couple of weeks is taking a heavy toll on Delhi’s trees. According to reports from civic bodies, 26 trees were uprooted because of Thursday night’s windstorm. North Delhi Municipal Corporation reported 12 cases of trees being uprooted on Thursday night and South Delhi areas registered 13 such cases. East Delhi Municipal Corporation received one complaint each of tree felling and building portion collapse. As many as 171 tree felling cases were registered during the previous two dust storms and experts attribute it to increased concretisation around the base of the trees. On June 4, when Delhi was swept by thunderstorms and strong winds, 90 cases of tree collapse were reported by the city’s three municipal corporations. The north corporation had registered 67 tree felling complaints, the south corporation 11 and the east corporation 12. Several cases of large trees falling were also reported in central Delhi areas. On June 1, 81 trees had got uprooted with outer Delhi areas in North Delhi and parts of south Delhi like Najafgarh facing the maximum impact. According to the latest monsoon report issued by the north corporation, four cases of building portion collapse and 12 cases of tree felling were recorded on Thursday. Out of the 12 tree felling cases, maximum four were registered in Keshavpuram zone in places like Ashok Vihar, Paschim Vihar and Pitampura. Complaints regarding three tree felling cases were registered in Karol Bagh zone at Patel Nagar, Moti Nagar and Kirti Nagar. Two tree felling cases were reported in Rohini and one each in Azad Market, Civil Lines and Narela. Besides a park’s wall in Adarsh Nagar, two structures in Shadipur and one in Sultanpuri Balmiki Chowk collapsed. Maximum cases of tree felling were recorded in south Delhi areas.

---||Nagpur||GMCH’s ‘Munnabhai’ doctor even worked in Covid ward in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Siddhanth Jain, 22, who claimed to be ‘junior resident in medicine’, was in fact an imposter, masquerading as a doctor at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for the last two months. Jain, who was arrested on Thursday by Ajni police, had also allegedly worked at the Covid ward. A nursing graduate, Jain claimed before the police that he had been merely trying to practice his skills and also trying to fulfil his dream of becoming a doctor. GMCH authorities and police feel Jain may be concealing his ulterior motives behind posing as a doctor. The cops are also probing whether Jain got a number of patients admitted during the Covid peak by introducing them as his relatives. It’s likely Jain accepted cash from the patients to get admission in the hospital during Covid peak. Donning an overcoat like doctors, Jain would also wear a name plate with ‘MBBS’ embossed on it. It’s learnt he stays with his widowed mother at Mahal. His mother runs a tiffin service, it’s learnt. Police said Jain would walk into the wards and check documents of the patients and also diagnose them. “Jain would introduce himself as chief medical officer (CMO) to resident doctors and vice versa,” said senior inspector Vinod Choudhury of Ajni police station. “He was spotted collecting swabs at Covid wards, and also seen taking rounds too,” he said. Jain had come under suspicion as neither CMOs nor resident doctors could identify him or recollect seeing him in any classes or practical sessions. Police said Jain had managed to sneak away from the hospital after realizing he had been caught out. The GMCH authorities alerted Ajni police a couple of weeks back, following which his CCTV grabs were collected. Jain was trapped after he returned to the hospital on Thursday and was handed over to Ajni police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmchs-munnabhai-doctor-even-worked-in-covid-ward/articleshow/83444734.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra government sets up panel to fix responsibility in Avni killing case||NAGPUR: Five months after the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court slammed forest department for lack of accountability in the killing of Pandharkawda tigress T1 aka Avni, state government on Friday constituted a six-member committee to fix responsibility on those who violated the laws. In January, 2021, the high court had criticised the forest department for negligence in fixing accountability of officers who, prima facie, did not perform their duty properly in the Avni shooting. The unauthorized shooting of the tigress was carried out by private shooter Asghar Ali Khan on November 2, 2018. A PIL on the issue is pending in the court. The committee will be headed by APCCF Vikas Gupta, while DFO Shatanik Bhagwat will be member-secretary. Other members include Yavatmal deputy SP, director of Regional Forensic Laboratory, Nagpur, Tushar Bawne, assistant commissioner (animal husbandry), and JP Patil, law & judiciary department. This is the third committee to probe Avni killing. Earlier, hearing the PIL in January, Justice Sunil S Shukre and Justice Avinash G Gharote, who studied the inquiry reports of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and state committee, apparently found that there had been several lacunae in the investigation, especially on the part of the state government. The court had also observed that there were some officers from the forest department, who, prima facie, have not performed their duty and the department has made no inquiry into their negligence so as to fix accountability. The court had also said there was lack of clarity in the orders issued by the chief wildlife warden and chief conservator of forest (CCF), Yavatmal, regarding specific role, responsibility, and authority delegated. The reports state that there was lack of clarity in assigning local executive leadership of the operation to Pandharkawda deputy conservator, which was a major reason for the operational and other errors in decision-making regarding the execution of the order to capture T1 alive or dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-sets-up-panel-to-fix-responsibility-in-avni-killing-case/articleshow/83444722.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Delhi||No New Landfill, Focus On Local Handling Of Waste||New Delhi: With very poor community sanitation, consistently poor national Swacchta rankings and oversaturated landfills, Delhi has been a laggard in the management of the municipal solid waste. With this failure of Master Plan for Delhi 2021 in mind, the draft MPD41 wants no new landfill sites to be created and 'minimum waste localities' to be developed. With the aim of disposing of waste in a decentralised manner, the new plan is to repurpose the existing waste management infrastructure and treat the bulk of municipal waste locally, as close to the generation site as possible. MPD41 also encourages setting up of large composting farms in green development areas (GDA) to be created on the city’s periphery and using large parks for composting or biomethanation of wet waste at the community level. Delhi currently generates 12,350 tonnes of solid waste daily and this is expected to rise to 18,915 tonnes by 2041. Currently, of the total waste generated, only 85% is collected by the municipal corporations and much of it — 55% — ends up in the three overexploited landfills in Okhla, Ghazipur and Bhalswa. The draft pushes for the creation of minimum waste localities, where all wet waste is treated locally while the dry waste is sent to recycling centres and material recovery centres to be set up to replace large dhalaos. All new development under the land pooling scheme, regeneration schemes or GDA have to be minimum waste localities. The local bodies can now utilise portions of large parks for composting and bio-methanation of wet waste at community level. The plan is for a 200 sq metre area for every 10,000 population and material recovery facility of 200 tonnes per day for every five lakh population plus a large, automated recovery facility spread over 10,000-20,000 sq m at the city level. The waste management infra is to be repurposed and the existing dhalaos will be converted to material recovery facilities for waste segregation and recycling. Waste segregation, decentralised treatment and informal sector participation of waste pickers have already been mandated in the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016m but their implementation has been an uphill task. The oversaturated landfills have been the most visible sign of this failure. MPD41 clearly states that the existing landfills will be incrementally reclaimed as green/recreational areas and no new landfills will be created, except those meant for dumping of inert solids. The bio-mining and reclamation project is already under way at the landfills as per the National Green Tribunal’s suo-motu order in cognisance of a TOI report. The draft MPD41 proposes the creation of large composting farms in the notified GDAs and the adoption of incentives/ disincentives recommended by the National Resource Efficiency Policy, 2019, to minimise the environmental impact of municipal waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-new-landfill-focus-on-local-handling-of-waste/articleshow/83444794.cms||Paras Singh
---||Kolkata||Iskcon cancels Kolkata Rathayatra in 50th year||KOLKATA: Iskcon will not hold the Kolkata Rathayatra this year, cancelling the grand plans of the 50th-year celebrations. Holding such a road spectacle amid a pandemic was impossible and it would go against the safety guidelines, said the Iskcon Kolkata administration on Friday. Hence, Rathayatra would be cancelled, they said. Only a small, symbolic puja without public participation would be conducted on the Albert Road campus of Iskcon, off Moira Street, officials said. Iskcon had been planning the golden jubilee celebrations for the past seven years. The officials had charted new attractions to the familiar 9km ride of the three chariots to the Maidan, where they are kept for seven days before a return journey. The week-long fair and festivities surrounding the chariots were being re-designed to suit the golden jubilee celebrations. “Devotees from 150 countries were to participate in the Rathayatra this time, but everything stands cancelled now. We have informed our foreign devotees that now, they could participate virtually in the pujas, that will be scaled down and held on the campus,” said Radharaman Das, spokesperson for Iskcon Kolkata. The Iskcon administration is now arranging for a scaled-down celebration on campus, like last year. Smaller chariots will be pulled inside the courtyard of the Albert Road temple and the deities will be carried down from their original positions by monks to be placed in a room on the ground floor, where they will be worshipped for the seven days of the festival. “We will telecast the event live on Iskcon Kolkata’s official YouTube and Facebook page and there will be special virtual events because we have to bring the entire festival home to hundreds of thousands of our devotees across 150 counties,” Das added. A flying Hanuman, that had been designed in the US, was to be one of the main attractions of the Rathayatra. A mammoth, yet light-weight Hanuman was to fly atop the three massive chariots—Nandighosh, Taladhwaj and Devdalana—as they would wind through the routes on both the days of Shoja and Ulta Ratha, pulled by lakhs of people. “Our techie devotees in the US had developed this wonder but we will not be able to show it this special year,” Das added. Great care was also taken to repair the three chariots and their wheels, fitted with specially designed aircraft tyres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iskcon-cancels-kol-rathayatra-in-50th-year/articleshow/83444785.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

CCTV cameras installed at the spot have captured the incident. The injured are fuel station manager Sunil Kumar and employee Sushil. Their employer, Davinder Singh, said, “Around 5.15pm, three masked men came to the filling station on a bike. After getting their bike refueled, one of them went inside the office on the pretext of drinking water. Brandishing a country-made pistol, he asked the manager to hand over cash to him. When the manager refused, he thrashed him and made him open the cash drawer.” “The goon took out Rs 42,000 from the drawer and snatched Rs 11,000 and a cellphone from the manager. In the meantime, the other two accused, who were armed with sharp-edged weapons, thrashed our employee as he tried to stop them. The duo snatched from him a bag containing Rs 22,000,” he added. When the trio escaped, the employees called up their employer as well as the police.

The state government had placed a purchase order for 10,000 sachets of the drug in mid-May.The anti-Covid-19 therapeutic application of 2-DG has been developed by Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a lab of DRDO, along with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), Hyderabad. The drug comes in powder form in sachet, which is taken orally by dissolving it in water. It accumulates in the virus infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. As the number of active Covid cases has dropped to 9,023 in the state, there isn’t much requirement of the drug in the current scenario.“We haven’t started it (prescribing the drug) yet. We will start it on a trial basis within a week. We will see how effective it is and then start using it,” Dr Raman Sharma, professor, department of general medicine, SMS Medical College.Meanwhile, the state has also received 336 vials of isavuconazole injection, which is a substitute for liposomal amphotericin B injection — an investigational drug for the treatment of black fungus or mucormycosis.

The plant, when ready, will treat up to five tonnes of garbage per day and generate 250-300MW of electricity which will be used to meet the power needs of the plant. It will also produce manure as a by-product. After laying the foundation stone, Bicholim MLA and assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar said, “We hope that the project will be completed in the next six months. It would also provide electricity to the streetlights in the area.” The project would be implemented by a Pune-based company that will also take care of its maintenance for the next five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bicholim-to-get-rs-2cr-waste-plant/articleshow/83444797.cms||---

The group organised a three-day prayer called ‘Akhand Paath’ for the well-being and good health of all Goans at the Gurudwara Singh Sabha at Betim, recently. After the prayers, the group honoured the contributors and volunteers with the Goa Sikh Youth Covid Warriors plaque and the traditional ‘saropa’, a saffron scarf that is used to cover one’s head. Among those that were honoured were Aurturo D’Souza, who gave part of their premises in Santa Cruz to set up the langar sewa (community kitchen). “D’Souza offered a space in his house compound and this is where the community kitchen was set up. The proximity to the GMC was important as it was the major point of food distribution that had a lot of needy people coming by,” a community member Sukhvinder Singh said. The Gaur Army Football Fan Group, Rotary Clubs of Ponda, Porvorim, Panaji and Bardez coastal besides the Lions Club, Calangute were also felicitated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sikh-youths-honour-covid-volunteers/articleshow/83446769.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Lockdown spurs Mumbai to home in on purchase of larger living spaces||MUMBAI: Between March and September 2020, the kitchen almost became a bunker for Kashish Jain's mother. Having made her son’s clients laugh with her unintentional cameos in his video calls, she started to confine herself to the kitchen during his virtual meetings to keep herself from photobombing his carefully-curated white background in the living room where her TV sat. Frequently during those fraught months of the lockdown, Jain, a finance sector employee working from 9 am to 9 pm, would jostle for quiet in his cramped 1-BHK with his sister, a media professional. Their squabbles would send their mother scurrying into the kitchen. "But I couldn't expect the same from my father," laughs Jain, explaining partly what made the Byculla-based family decide to move into a 2 BHK within the same pincode. The drop in property prices and home loan interest rates lent an air of finality to the Jain household's search for breathing space. By the end of last year, his mother could watch TV in the living room by her husband's side, in a house that cost Rs 50 lakh less than its pre-Covid price. The claustrophobia of Mumbai's matchbox homes--a feeling amplified by lockdown-induced isolation and WFH--has spurred investments in bigger residential properties. “There were many who could afford a bigger flat pre-lockdown but were not serious about it, until now. The pandemic has changed people’s thought process,” said property consultant Himanshu Jain. Analysts said a bulk of sales in Mumbai over the past year pertained to upgrading for bigger homes. "Nearly 65% of the sales in Mumbai related to upgrades. In NCR, it was around 35%," said real estate entrepreneur Anuj Puri. Data gathered by Puri's firm shows that new launches and absorption in the residential sector in Jan-March 2021 surpassed that of Jan-March 2020 in seven leading cities of India, including MMR. Take Thane, for instance. "New constructions were not able to attract too many buyers in the pre-Covid era. But in the past six to eight months, 3-BHK or bigger apartments have sold off and there are hardly any good options left," said Jain. Work-from-home professionals are not the only buyers. Worli resident Jeenendra Bhandari found his children converting his work desk into their study desks during the lockdown. "Everyone thought the lockdown wouldn't last for more than two or three months, but we have now realised this is long-term. The children need their own space for online education," said Bhandari, who lived with his brother in a large joint family. His brother moved to a 3-BHK in the same complex last year with his spouse and kids. Some large families that have elders have also opted for bigger living spaces to include a 24X7 nurse who won't have to leave the premises during lockdowns. "There is great demand if apartments are available in the same complex or on the same floor. Buyers are willing to pay a premium," Bhandari added. The type of consumer, however, has changed. "Typically, small and medium sized business owners used to purchase bigger residential properties. This has been replaced by salaried professionals from industries that did not witness a reduction in financial inflow due to Covid," said Puri, adding that more millennials had turned buyers. In early 2000, developers had come up with the concept of an additional half-bedroom which could be used as a study or a pooja room. "People have woken up to this concept in the lockdown. An additional half-bedroom would be perfect for WFH professionals to have virtual meetings in peace or for children having online classes,” said consultant Sunil Bajaj who has been advising developers on resuming construction of 2.5 and 3.5-BHKs. In cities that are not space-starved, families have been investing in villas rather than apartments so that social distancing is feasible. An analyst predicts that real estate activities may experience a temporary dip due to the second wave of Covid. Meanwhile, Kashish Jain is enjoying the airiness of his room. "Now, I only fight with my sister about who gets to use the new laptop," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lockdown-spurs-city-to-home-in-on-purchase-of-larger-living-spaces/articleshow/83446757.cms||Nitasha Natu

On Friday, however, Delhi recorded yet another hot day with the maximum temperature recorded at 39 degrees Celsius. The southwest monsoon is likely to reach Delhi by June 15, 12 days before its usual date of June 27, India Meteorological Department officials said on Friday. IMD has forecast more rain in the early hours of Saturday, with showers expected during the day as well. Light to moderate rain has been predicted from Saturday to Wednesday, with a possibility of monsoon showers striking the capital during this spell. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, said Thursday night’s storm led to an extremely low minimum temperature of 20.4 degrees Celsius, which is eight degrees below normal. “We can expect more rain on Friday night and in the early hours of Saturday. Meanwhile, light to moderate showers along with gusty winds of 40 km/hr are expected on Saturday,” said Srivastava. Monsoon rains could also hit Delhi by next week, with the southwest monsoon currently progressing faster than usual. On Friday, the IMD said conditions were favourable for the southwest monsoon to advance into more parts of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and some parts of east Uttar Pradesh in the next 48 hours. “Further, the southwest monsoon is likely to advance over remaining parts of the country outside south Rajasthan and Kutch region of Gujarat during in the next few days,” the IMD said. Till 8.30am on Friday, Safdarjung — Delhi’s base station — had received 7.8mm of rainfall, while Lodhi road and Pitampura recorded 7.6 and 7mm of rainfall, respectively, during this period. Najafgarh was the city’s warmest location on Friday, with a maximum of 41.6 degrees Celsius. Lodhi road, meanwhile, recorded the lowest minimum temperature at 19.8 degrees Celsius. Delhi’s relative humidity continued to remain on the higher side, oscillating between 47T and 91% in the last 24 hours. Delhi’s air quality was in the ‘moderate’ category on Friday with an overall air quality index (AQI) of 145. Agencies forecast strong winds and rain to help the city air improve further in the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/monsoon-may-hit-delhi-12-days-early/articleshow/83444798.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Congress protests high fuel prices, demands rollback of taxes||PANAJI/MARGAO: Protesting the steep fuel prices, Congress on Friday demanded that the Centre bring down the rates on both petrol and diesel, even as it slammed the Narendra Modi-led government for “cheating and looting people”. State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that BJP charges Rs 93.8 for petrol which would cost Rs 35.63 per litre without taxes, while diesel, which costs Rs 38.16 per litre without taxes, is being sold at Rs 91.5. Congress organised a statewide protest at fuel bunkers as part of a national protest against the high petroleum prices. “BJP government came to power in Goa in 2012 by promising to cap the petrol price at Rs 60 per litre. It promised “acche din” to the people of the country after coming to power at the Centre in 2014. Unfortunately, both the state as well as the Centre, haven’t kept their promises,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat, said. At Santa Cruz, Congress functionaries rode in on a bullock cart with a person wearing a suit as a part of the nationwide symbolic protest. “Since the Modi government came to power in 2014, the central government has collected Rs 22.7 lakh crore while state governments have collected Rs 13.1 lakh crore through taxes on fuel prices,” said Chodankar. He pointed out that freight charges, customs duty, basic excise, special duty, agricultural infrastructure development cess (AIDC), road and infrastructure cess, state VAT and other charges are levied on petrol and diesel before it is sold at retail outlets. The North Goa district Congress committee protested at the Mapusa taxi stand while the South Goa district Congress committee protested at a petrol pump in Margao. “People are still reeling from the pandemic, they have no jobs. Now, when they have suffered the most, they have to suffer further due to the increase in the prices of diesel and petrol,” said Congress general secretary, Amarnath Panjikar. North Goa district Congress president Vijay Bhike demanded that the Centre sell petrol and diesel at a cost price of Rs 36 and Rs 38 respectively. Congress’ student wing, NSUI, also joined the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-protests-high-fuel-prices-demands-rollback-of-taxes/articleshow/83444781.cms||---

TK Baghyalakshmi, joint director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Tirupur, said following information received from police against Thanjai Clinic, a team of officials from health department, revenue department and Tirupur city police conducted an inspection on Friday. The team found that the clinic was treating Covid-19 patients illegally. Health department officials said the clinic was run by two doctors R Neelambal and N Jagadeesan and they had vacated the clinic due to the age factors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/private-clinic-treats-covid-19-sealed/articleshow/83444791.cms||---
---||Nagpur||High time authorities, research institutes turn focus on Covid-19’s other aspects: Nagpur bench of Bombay HC||NAGPUR: With Covid-19 cases going down across the state, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court asked government authorities and research institutions to turn their focus to other aspects of the virus. It included studying plasma therapy’s side effects on patients, including possible acceleration of its mutants, as published by University of Basel in Switzerland in its research papers. While hearing the suo motu PIL based on a TOI report on bed shortage, a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote directed National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) to submit progress report on its May 12 orders to explore the possibility of plasma therapy giving birth to new mutants. “As some respite has been provided to the community due to decline in active cases of Covid patients, some time has become available for all the authorities to make appropriate preparations to face another wave of pandemic, if at all it strikes the society. Therefore, it’s now time for the authorities and research institutions to turn their attention to other aspects of Covid,” the bench said. Requesting the Neeri director to submit his report before the next hearing on June 30, the judges hoped that he had already started conducting intensive research on the subject. “If he requires any assistance of this court or the government authorities, including from GMCH, IGGMCH and collectorate among others, he should inform the HC registry. If any such information is received by the registry, it would be appropriately dealt with by the registrar (administration) in association with registrar (judicial) immediately, and the report shall be submitted to this court.” Earlier, the judges granted permission to collector Ravindra Thakare to issue work orders to Noida-based W-2-E Engineering Private Limited for installing an oxygen generation plant (PSA) of 100 cubic meter per hour capacity at a cost of Rs1.74 crore at AIIMS. Govt must intensify efforts to tackle black fungus infection Stressing on the need to take more steps to tackle the infection caused by dreaded black fungus disease, which had taken many lives post Covid, the judges asked the state to intensify its effort in tackling it. The directives came after the government filed an affidavit on steps it had taken for tackling the infection. It included creating awareness about mucormycosis, taking steps for improving the standards of hygiene and cleanliness in hospitals, and providing incentives to companies for production and supply of vital drugs like Amphotericin B required for treating patients. Repair 130 O2 cylinders at earliest for Covid patients The HC directed the collector to repair 130 oxygen cylinders so that they could be used for Covid patients in the city. The orders came after his affidavit mentioned that out of 400 oxygen cylinders requisitioned from premises of a private company at Kamptee, only 200 are ready for use. “We direct the collector to immediately put these 200 cylinders in circulation. Out of the remaining 200, 70 cylinders are stated to be beyond repairs, but 130 could be put to use. The collector should repair them within two weeks,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/high-time-authorities-research-institutes-turn-focus-on-covid-19s-other-aspects-hc/articleshow/83444766.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Jaipur||Pvt univ waives off fees of students who lost earning parent to Covid||JAIPUR: Many education institutions are coming forward to provide assistance to people who have lost their parents during the pandemic. Earlier, many private schools in the city had taken this initiative and now, a private university has announced full scholarship for such students. Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ) has decided to offer full fee waiver as scholarship to its students who have lost their father or mother, who were the sole earning member of their family, due to Covid infection during the pandemic. The entire course fee will be offered as scholarship across all academic programmes for the remaining duration of study. By this, MUJ hopes to ensure that such students do not face financial difficulties and are able to complete their studies in time. Dr K Ramnarayan, chairperson of MUJ said, “MUJ always stands by its students and supports them in times of difficulties, and I am sure that this decision of MUJ will help our students financially when they are faced with sudden unfortunate demise of their father or mother, who were the sole earning member of the family, due to Covid.” Dr GK Prabhu, president of MUJ said, “By this decision of MUJ, our students, who are our partners for lifetime and are always at the core of thought process, will get the much required relief in this difficult time and would be able to continue their studies without any financial hardships.” He further added that this small gesture of MUJ will shape the students as a compassionate and caring member of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-univ-waives-off-fees-of-students-who-lost-earning-parent-to-covid/articleshow/83444777.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Higher seropositivity found in women||Ahmedabad: A major study across 12 major cities on self-referred individuals — who had walked into 2,200 private labs across the country for SARS-CoV2 antibody tests — has found that in Ahmedabad by December, nearly 48% of 7,900 individuals were seropositive for Covid antibodies. In Surat, of the 10,000 individuals tested, 33 per cent were found to have Covid antibodies. In all, some 4.48 lakh self-referred individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between June 12 and December 31, 2020. Researchers from the Centre for Global Health Research, University of Toronto, Canada, and those of Thyrocare Labs had conducted the study. Navi Mumbai-based Thyrocare conducts central laboratory testing from over 2,200 franchised collection centres in the all major cities in the country. The study also revealed that 31 per cent of these 4.48 lakh individuals were seropositive for Covid antibodies till December 2020. This meant that one-third of urban dwellers were exposed to the coronavirus, stated the authors of the research paper published in medRxiv. The researchers found higher seropositivity in women (35%) than men (30%) in all age groups. “Seropositivity has reduced in areas with higher childhood measles vaccination,” research added. By December, seropositivity was 41% in the 12 cities but with marked variation in monthly growth from July across the cities. “There was a steady increase in seropositivity in all cities, except in Surat, Vishakhapatnam, and Nagpur, which showed earlier peaks in August, September, and October, respectively,” the research paper stated. The study adds, “Delhi had two peaks of death rates and case rates, one in June and another in November, with seroprevalence in the self-referred population rising slowly till December.” It further notes that Pune’s case rate peaked in September, after deaths had peaked in August with seroprevalence in the self-referred population peaking in October. “Overall across 12 cities, about 43% to 65% of adults above age 20 experienced Covid infection in 2020. Pune had the highest rate at 69% to an improbable 97%, whereas Jaipur had the lowest at 11% to 15%,” the study says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/higher-seropositivity-found-in-women/articleshow/83444805.cms||Paul John

The Singanallur (investigation wing) police said S Senthilprabhu, of Ondipudur, had gone to the Gopalakrishna Perumal Kovil at Neelikonampalayam in the morning on the pretext of offering prayers. “He suddenly grabbed the gold coin weighing 2g that was kept by the side of the main deity’s idol and tried to escape. The temple priest raised an alarm and other devotees caught Senthilprabhu red-handed,” a police officer said. Senthilprabhu was handed over to the Singanallur police, who arrested him and seized the stolen property. Preliminary investigation revealed that Gopalakrishnan, who used to make a living by selling phenyl liquid cleaner across the city, had stolen gold ornaments weighing 5g from the Kannimar Karupparayan temple at Neelikonampalayam on Thursday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-steals-gold-coin-from-temple-held/articleshow/83444799.cms||---
---||Nagpur||India has only 491 PG seats in respiratory medicine||NAGPUR: The deadlier Covid-19 second wave is finally receding, but not before exposing lacuane in the healthcare system. Complications like post-Covid pulmonary fibrosis, especially among patients who required ICU care and mechanical ventilation during Covid-19 treatment, have highlighted the need for specialized pulmonary care in the post-pandemic times. Doctors said many lung-related complications need specialized doctors — pulmonologists, but this super specialty has very limited seats in the country and produces less than 500 doctors a year for the huge population of India. “Pulmonology branch was never in focus before the Covid struck. In fact, it has come into limelight with the pandemic only,” said pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, who is also national general secretary of Indian Chest Society (ICS). “Already less in numbers, pulmonologists are seeing many post-Covid patients who had no clue that they could have come to a lungs specialist earlier. People are unnecessarily continuing many drugs and lacking proper monitoring by a lungs specialist,” he said adding the country will need more trained pulmonologists in next five years. This is, however, hardly possible in the present scenario. There are only 491 seats of MD respiratory medicine available throughout the country. This number is very less compared to other specializations like medicine (3,188 seats), anaesthesia (2,463), obstetrics and gynaecology (2,013), paediatrics (1,672), and radiology (1,212). “In super specialty hospital at GMCH, we have only 4 PG seats for pulmonary medicine,” said Dr Sushant Meshram, head of the department. “Despite limited in numbers, my team used to treat about 150 patients during the Covid peak and saved many lives. Pulmonology as a specialization needs attention of the policy-makers,” he added. Dr Radha Munje, professor and head of the department of pulmonary medicine, IGGMC, said the specialization was restricted to TB treatment earlier and was neglected. “IGGMC also has only 4 PG seats for this subject. A nationwide reform to increase PG seats in this super specialty is crucial because all future pandemics will definitely be through airway route,” she added. Patients generally prefer to get treated in private set-up where pulmonologists are limited. As a result, they have to pay more. “Experts of respiratory medicine deal with whole array of disorders like asthma, COPD, pneumonias, interstitial lung diseases, lung cancer and tuberculosis. During the pandemic, we came across several examples in which ventilators were available, but they were useless as there were no experts to operate them,” said a member of state Covid task force, who happens to be a pulmonologist. Long term lung plan Covid-19 has made us understand the importance of lungs Pulmonary medicine is a subspecialty of internal medicine, now a super specialty It focuses on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung and respiratory tract Against 3,188 seats for general medicine, 2,463 for anaesthesia, 2,013 for OBGY, pulmonary medicine has only 491 PG seats nationwide With more patients reporting with post-Covid lung fibrosis, they need more specialists in future Now, the nation needs a major push to pulmonary medicine branch at PG level||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/india-has-only-491-pg-seats-in-respiratory-medicine/articleshow/83444813.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ludhiana||Rights commission orders for action taken report on FIR against 3 cops in Ludhiana||LUDHIANA: Family of custodial death victim and recovery agent Deepak Shukla is likely to get the action taken report on the FIR lodged against three cops on charges of contempt of court. The National Human Rights Commission has directed the Punjab Police to provide it. The commission has written to the additional director general of police (human rights), SK Asthana, who has directed Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal to provide the report to the complainant and inform his office about the compliance of the order. In August 2020, then SHO of Division 5 police station sub-inspector Richa Rani, then in charge of Kochhar Market police post Jaskaran Singh and then ASI Charanjit Singh were booked for contempt of court as they had taken Deepak back to police post and kept him in the lockup overnight despite the court orders of sending him in judicial custody. This FIR was lodged after six months of the incident. For nine months, Deepak’s family has been struggling to get the action taken report. They had approached the Punjab Human Rights Commission and also a local court for the report, but to no avail. On Wednesday, there was a court hearing in the case. The court had summoned and directed assistant commissioner of police, Civil Lines, Jatinder Kumar, who is investigating officer of the case, to submit the action taken report on June 11. However, on Friday, the additional chief judicial magistrate was on leave, so now the next hearing would be on July 12. Deepak, 26, had died on the night of February 26, 2020, and the family was informed the next day. The family alleged that the cops brutally thrashed him in the lockup and the next day he was sent to Ludhiana Central Jail, where he died a night later. “After a long struggle, we had managed to get an FIR lodged against the cops. They were suspended, but days later the top cop had reinstated the SHO. In September last, we had moved an application in a local court to get the action taken report on this FIR. However, the cops did not appear before the court. The court had summoned ACP Jatinder on March 2, but summons were not issued to him,” said Rakesh Shukla, paternal uncle of the deceased. He added, “We had to approach the National Human Rights Commission to get the report. Now, we hope to get it. The circumstances that led to Deepak’s death are still not clear. We have already approached the Punjab and Haryana high court to lodge a murder case against the cops. The judicial inquiry into the death had suggested that there was a need to investigate the role of police officials for mercilessly beating Deepak and demanding a bribe. But no action was taken on the report.”  ACP, Civil Lines, Jatinder said, “The investigation is on, therefore, the action taken report cannot be shared. Besides, I had gone to the court for hearing on Friday, but the judge was on leave.” The case The Division 5 police had arrested Deepak on February 22, 2020, for vehicle theft and he was produced before the court, which sent him in two days' police remand. On February 24, when Deepak was again produced before the court, it ordered his judicial custody. But the police took him back to the police post, where he was allegedly tortured and was sent to jail on February 25. The family then received a call that Deepak was unwell and had died. The kin alleged that the cops had demanded Rs 1.25 lakh from them for releasing Deepak and they had also paid them Rs 25,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/rights-commission-orders-for-action-taken-report-on-fir-against-3-cops/articleshow/83443133.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Minister B D Kalla accused of insulting senior citizens||JAIPUR: Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore on Friday accused energy minister B D Kalla of saying that elder citizens were ‘living on bonus’ so the children should be given priority in vaccination. Rathore quoted a video shared on Twitter to make the charge. In the video widely shared on the micro-blogging platform, Kalla is, however, heard narrating what a senior citizen apparently said on Covid-19 vaccination. "Who is given a vaccine first? The kids. But the kids are yet to be vaccinated (for Covid-19). They (Centre government) have vaccinated the elderlies first. I have heard an old man say that he is 80-85 years old leading a life of bonus and urged that the vaccine be given to his grandson or son, as it was important to save their lives. He said whether he dies of corona or survives, doesn’t matter but we should at least save the future generations," Kalla is heard saying in the video clip. The minister then goes on to criticise the Central government’s vaccination policy. "This vaccination policy is very wrong. The vaccine should be first given to the kids, then to youth and then to the old people," Kalla said. Rathore quoted the video and tweeted, "Elders are living on bonus—minister B D Kalla ji. Elders are the pride of the house and the risk of them getting infected by corona is also high, so it is our moral obligation to vaccinate and keep them safe. What message do you want to give to the younger generation by making such remarks for the elders?" TOI tried to contact minister Kalla for a comment, but his phone remained unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/minister-kalla-accused-of-insulting-senior-citizens/articleshow/83444796.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Now 50km from Kolkata, monsoon’s onset may just be hours away||Kolkata: Monsoon has arrived at Kolkata’s doorstep and could be hours away from descending on the city. Even as the city received a steady shower on Friday evening, the volume of rain during the day was not enough to declare the onset of monsoon, according to the Met office. The monsoon currents, however, have covered a large part of south Bengal and reached Canning, which is just 50km from Kolkata. But the city may receive just moderate rain over the next 48 hours, it was predicted. Even though Kolkata remained cloudy on Friday, rain was scanty till the evening. The Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) said heavy showers were unlikely since the low pressure over northwest Bay of Bengal — that has been triggering rain — remained to the far south of Kolkata and was unlikely to have an impact. “Monsoon clouds have arrived and covered most of south Bengal. We had expected the city to receive at least moderate rain on Friday till the low-pressure remained closer to the Bengal coast. But it remained dry for most part of the day, preventing the declaration of monsoon onset,” said RMC director GK Das. Monsoon currents reached Krishnagore, Malda and Canning on Friday. “With no new potent system in sight, Kolkata will continue to receive intermittent, light rain over the next 48 hours. But since it has started raining more heavily from Friday evening, monsoon may be declared on Saturday,” added Das. He added that early monsoon rain in Kolkata is referred to as ‘summer monsoon’ since precipitation is inconsistent and often scanty during the early part of the season in Kolkata. “June is often dry in Kolkata and there have been occasions when the mercury has shot past 35°C after the onset of monsoon. July is usually the wettest of the monsoon months in Kolkata,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/now-50km-from-city-monsoons-onset-may-just-be-hours-away/articleshow/83443137.cms||---

Sarpanch Caetan Da Lima, deputy sarpanch Maria Fernandes, secretary Ravindra Wadekar along with the local panch inspected the site on Thursday morning. Lima said that the owner had not sought the panchayat’s permission for the hill-cutting. “This is completely illegal and the panchayat will send the letter to all the departments concerned to initiate action against the owner, who had carried out hill-cutting just a few metres away from the PWD water reservoir.” Locals along with south Goa district Congress general secretary Ali Shaik and Guru Gauns had tried to halt the illegal hill-cutting activity fearing that the water reservoir constructed on the hillock a few meters away from the site may collapse during monsoon causing a landslide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hill-cutting-xeldem-pyat-urges-tcp-to-take-action/articleshow/83444806.cms||---

If the state government doesn't accede to our demand of revoking it, we will sit on a hunger strike in the days to come,” said Suresh Semwal, rawal (priest) of the Gangotri shrine. To recall, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, during a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) margdarshak mandal meeting at Haridwar in early April, had assured the seers that the state government will denotify 51 temples from the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act, giving control of the shrines back to priests from the bureaucrats. He had also promised ‘teerth purohits’ (priests of the Char Dham shrines) that his government will review the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Act of 2019, which brought the shrines under the control of the state government. Brijesh Sati, the spokesperson of Devbhoomi Teerth Purohit Mahapanchayat, said that the government cannot play with the emotions of priests by making false promises. “If the government thinks that they can keep us waiting, they are wrong. We won't give up until the Devasthanam Act gets revoked,” added Sati. Meanwhile, Vinod Bansal, national spokesperson of the VHP, told TOI that they support the demands of the priests. “We strongly feel that the CM should deliver on his promise. The priests should have control over the temples and not the government,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-temple-priests-launch-stir-against-devasthanam-board-wear-black-armbands-and-perform-pooja-at-shrines/articleshow/83441135.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Delhi||Why winter measures aren’t enough to clean up Delhi air||NEW DELHI: While the country had seen a drop in pollution levels last summer, following the complete lockdown as blue skies dominated the news, data from major cities this year showed despite the partial lockdown in place, pollution levels remained above Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and World Health Organisation (WHO) standards in a number of key locations. The analysis compiled by air pollution experts through the NCAP tracker found the top 10 most polluted locations across the country had an average PM 2.5 level reading between 99 and 120 micrograms per cubic metre. During summers, dust also plays a key role, pushing PM 10 readings up. Track the pollution level in your cityNCAP tracker data showed out of the 10 most polluted locations across the country, five of these were in Delhi, including Bawana, Mundka, CRRI Mathura road, ITO and NSIT Dwarka. The most polluted location was found to be the RIICO Industrial area in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, with an average PM 2.5 concentration of 120 micrograms per cubic metre from March till May, followed by Sector 62 in Noida, with an average concentration of 113 micrograms per cubic metre. Bawana in north Delhi was the third, at an average reading of 109 micrograms per cubic metre, data showed. NCAP tracker, a comprehensive review of India’s national clean air programme implementation and impact, was developed by CarbonCopy and Respirer Living Sciences to analyse air pollution data through the year. Experts and health professionals said the data highlighted that knee jerk reactions should be avoided during peak winter pollution months and instead action was needed throughout the year. “Air pollution isn’t a seasonal problem and hence mitigation requires long-term planning, which is missing even in the current clean air action plans for non-attainment cities. It is important to prioritise the problems, identify timelines and resources and set accountability. Everyone discusses high pollution levels during the winters and focuses on emissions from crop burning, but we need to look at prioritising and reducing emissions from transport, industry and so many other sources as well,” said Dr Sagnik Dey, coordinator of Centre of Excellence for Research on Clean Air (CERCA) at IIT Delhi. Dey said while in 2020, during the Covid-19 lockdown, pollution levels were at an all-time low, these were still three times the WHO annual safe limit of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. NCAP data from January till June, meanwhile, showed Ghaziabad to be the most polluted city, followed by Bhiwadi, Greater Noida and Baghpat. Delhi was ninth on this list. “Like in the winter months, air pollution will have similar effects on one’s health even in summers. High pollution levels may lead to increased instances of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergies, bronchial asthma, etc. The nature of the pollutants may have an impact and is something that must be studied by health professionals,” said Dr Arun Sharma, president, Society for Indoor Environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-winter-measures-arent-enough-to-clean-up-delhi-air/articleshow/83444914.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The yatra is scheduled to be held in the second week of July. Even as Jagannath temple trustees were upbeat over organizing the rath yatra, the state government reiterated on Friday that a decision to organize the yatra will be taken just prior to the event next month. However, sources said the government, which allowed religious places to be opened for worship from Friday, is inclined to organize the rath yatra despite the ongoing second wave of the pandemic and a possible third wave. “I came to worship at the Jagannath temple and also had lengthy discussions with the mahant and trustees of the temple. The state government will take a decision on organizing the rath yatra close to the date of event and after reviewing the pandemic situation,” minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja said on Friday. “We are in talks with the government. It is not just our feeling, but that of a majority of people that rath yatra of Lord Jagannath should happen this year. Our talks with the authorities will continue,” said Mahant Dilipdasji of the temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-treads-cautiously-over-jagannath-rath-yatra-issue/articleshow/83444831.cms||---

Shailesh Govind Ganpule, an assistant professor at the mechanical and industrial engineering department (MIED), was conferred the award in a ceremony held at the National Security Guard (NSG) campus in Manesar near Gurgaon. This was the second edition of the annual award by NSG and Ganpule was awarded in the "academic" category for developing an advanced version of a conventional military helmet which can protect against blast-induced traumatic brain injury. Speaking to TOI, Ganpule said, “At the time of a blast, the waves from the blast leave a pressure-like impact on the head beneath the helmet which causes traumatic brain injury. To address this problem, we have introduced a face shield, which can mitigate the effects of waves, focusing beneath the helmet and soft material with ability to slide between the head and helmet can help mitigate the rotational motion of the head. The technology works as active mitigation just before the arrival of IED-induced blast waves.” Ganpule, who joined the institute as a faculty member in 2016, said it took him around three years to develop the military helmet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iit-roorkee-prof-bags-nsg-award-for-blast-resistant-helmet/articleshow/83441151.cms||Tapan Susheel
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore schools told to gear up for next academic year||COIMBATORE: The school education department has directed the principals and administrative staff members of the government and aided schools to start preparatory works to commence the next academic year by visiting the schools from Monday. An official source said, “As the state government has cancelled the Class XII public examination in the view of Covid-19 pandemic, several procedures like calculating and preparing the certificates that are required for higher education need to be carried out. As the next academic year is about to commence, school managements need to carry out the admission process, and distribute notebooks and other government welfare schemes to the students. School campuses and classrooms need to be cleaned as well.” He said the principals and administrative staff members of all the government and aided schools were directed to visit the schools by adhering to the standard operation procedures from next week. M Ramakrishnan, chief educational officer, said, “From next week, we will also start admitting students to the Class XI and the classes are likely to commence from the third week of June.” A circular from the education department said the schools were allowed to increase the student strength in a class by 10% to 15%, if they receive more applications for a particular group. If the number of applications exceeds the additional 15% strength, it said, the students should be selected based on the Class IX marks. T Arulanantham, state auditor, Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers’ Association, said, “Earlier, the department had asked the school management to conduct an entrance examination, if the number of applications were to exceed the additional 15% strength and directed teachers to prepare a question paper with 30 queries. After objections from different quarters, the idea was scrapped.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/schools-told-to-gear-up-for-next-academic-year/articleshow/83444819.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ED raids TRS MP Nama Nageswara Rao in Rs 1,064 crore bank fraud case||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday conducted searches on the residences and offices of TRS MP Nama Nageswara Rao, his Madhucon Group of companies and Ranchi Expressway Limited directors in connection with Rs 1,064 crore bank fraud case. Nageswara Rao is the floor leader of TRS in the Lok Sabha. Searches began at 7 am at six locations, including Madhucon Infra office in Jubilee Hills and residences of Nageswara Rao, CMD of Ranchi Expressway K Srinivasa Rao and directors N Seethaiah and N Prithvi Teja, who is the son of Nageswara Rao. The ED is probing the case for money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The MP is a personal guarantor for the loans taken from various banks. The CBI first issued an FIR in 2019 and filed a chargesheet in 2020 against Ranchi Expressway and its directors. In the FIR, the CBI named Madhucon Projects Ltd, Madhucon Infra, Madhucon Toll Highways Ltd, auditors Kota and Company and unidentified officials of a consortium of 15 banks. Madhucon was given a contract to execute a road project pertaining to four-laning of 163 kilometre stretch on NH-33 connecting Ranchi with Jamshedpur. The project was awarded by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to Madhucon Projects Ltd in March 2011. Madhucon later floated a special purpose vehicle, Ranchi Expressway Ltd, for the project on design-buildfinance-operate and transfer model. The banks, led by Canara Bank, agreed to fund Rs 1,151 crore to Madhucon Group with a contribution of Rs 503 crore from promoters to execute the project. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), in its preliminary report, however, alleged that the promoters round-tripped Rs 50 crore, claimed Rs 98 crore towards maintenance, used Rs 94 crore of mobilisation advance and diverted Rs 22 crore and thus misappropriated Rs 264 crore. The CBI alleged that there was no progress in the project work and the loan became a non-performing asset in 2018. In January 2019, the NHAI terminated its agreement with Madhucon Projects and forfeited Rs 73 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-raids-trs-mp-nama-in-rs-1064cr-bank-fraud-case/articleshow/83444853.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

In one such case, the Rajkot city’s women’s police station helped resolve dispute between a couple through online counselling. According to S R Patel, police inspector at women's police station in Rajkot city, they received a complaint of a 35-year-old woman against her husband who lives in Viramgam town of Ahmedabad district a week ago. She had complained of marital dispute and harassment. “The woman currently lives with her parents in Rajkot. Since the husband could not come to Rajkot due to Covid-19 situation, we decided to counsel them online through video call. This is first time we used this method to clear the backlog of cases,” Patel told TOI. “Our approach was to clear their differences and reunite them. Both seemed satisfied after the online meeting. We will also hold a similar meeting with their parents in the coming days,” added Patel. The women's police station receives at least three domestic dispute complaints daily. “Unresolved applications were piling up as Covid-19 had restricted movement of applicants as well as police. So we decided to use technology to reduce our case pendency,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/women-cops-begin-online-counselling-to-reduce-case-pendency/articleshow/83445009.cms||---

The four councillors, Alinda Lacerda, Jackina Dias, Nandita Prabhudessai and Lourdes Fernandes, along with United Front of Quepem convenor and Congress ticket aspirant for the upcoming assembly elections, Altone D’Costa, Goa Pradesh Congress general secretary Subhash Faldessai and their supporters, marched to the municipal office aiming to gherao the chairperson and chief officer. However, neither were available to address their grievances. In the 13-member QMC, nine councillors, backed by BJP’s Chandrakaant Kavlekar, are part of the ruling council, while four councillors, backed by Congress, form the opposition. The four councillors told reporters that QMC had almost completed drainage cleaning work in the rest of the wards, but refused to carry out work in their wards. “People are asking us why the cleaning of the drainage system and clearing of roadside bushes has not yet been carried out, even though the monsoon has started,” Lacerda said, accusing the civic body of neglecting the wards of those in opposition. Councillor Prabhudessai said that during the recently held council meeting, the chairperson promised them that she would provide labourers from Monday onwards for drainage cleaning, but till Friday had not sent anyone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/drains-ignored-in-our-wards-claim-quepem-opposition-members/articleshow/83444818.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Patrol vans in place of kiosks, forensic training for cops to ensure better policing||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police brass has decided to ring in key changes in the force to increase its visibility and capability, both in maintaining law and order and solving crime. First, police kiosks that were introduced around a decade ago where policemen from the respective police stations used to initially sit to make the present felt at strategic locations will give way to more intense patrolling. And second, some officers in each police station will be trained in forensics so that they can handle crime scenes better and prevent loss of forensic evidence. The decision to do away with the kisoks that have been redundant for a few years now was taken at a meeting in Lalbazar on Monday. Police stations have been asked to identify kiosks that are no longer in use or not needed and submit the report to Lalbazar. While the kiosks that are on the main road near key intersections will be handed over to traffic police, others may be dismantled. However, those kiosks that are necessary as a deterrent against anti-social and criminal activity in some locations will continue to function. The absence of kiosks will be compensated by additional mobile patrolling on PCR vans and patrol bikes. According to an officer, several kiosks were not required now as many localities are under patrolling and monitoring through CCTV. “In addition to a locked and unused police kiosk sending the wrong signal to the public as though cops are not active, even if someone needs to be stationed, it can be done in PCR vans that can respond to a crisis quicker,” he said. At police stations, small groups will undergo basic training in forensics to ensure that no evidence gets damaged or erased due to negligence before the experts reach the crime scene. The decision to make cops forensic literate is part of the modernization programme. The Kolkata wing of forensic science is in charge of conducting examinations of Kolkata Police, Howrah City Police and Bidhannagar City Police. But due to acute staff crunch at present, attending incident spots promptly is not possible. Thus, preservation of evidence holds the key. Under the initiative, a senior officer of each division will select two officers from each police station who will then undergo a training session on how to collect evidence for forensic examination and how to preserve an incident spot before experts visit them. If required, officers will have to take photographs of the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/patrol-vans-in-place-of-kiosks-forensic-training-for-cops-to-ensure-better-policing/articleshow/83443139.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Grappling with financial constraints, these traders had to leave their rented accommodations since they could no longer afford the rent for their shops with practically no business. Many have switched to other jobs. Even truck drivers refuse to travel to Nepal due to the restrictions. Dipak Chakraborty, joint secretary of Panitanki Byabsayee Samity, who runs a cycle business, said that with the border being sealed for 14 months, just 50 out of the total 1,210 shops were doing business now while the rest had closed down. He rued that before the pandemic, he used to sell around 1,000 cycles a month but now the sale has come down to just four. the sealed checkpost“Panitanki market attracts 60% of its customers from Nepal and the rest from India. When trade was open between India and Nepal, each shop would earn around Rs 4 lakh a month. But now their monthly earning has come down to Rs 14,000. Shops are open from 7am to 10am and from noon to 3pm but there are hardly any customers. We hope that the border will be operational soon, otherwise our livelihood will be at stake,” said Chakraborty. Ashok Goswami, a cloth trader at Panitanki, said, “I had no option other than leaving my rented shop. There is no business as the border is sealed but the shop owner demanded full rent. Now, I have no earning and am dependent on my two sons.” The officials of the Indian Immigration Check Post at Raniganj said that traffic movement along the border came to a halt on March 21 last year while the movement of goods vehicles stopped on April 8 last year. Relaxation to goods vehicles along the border at Panitanki was given from May 8, 2020. A 96km stretch of the border in the region is guarded by 41 Battalion and 8 Battalion, Sashastra Seema Bal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traders-close-down-shops-near-sealed-india-nepal-border/articleshow/83443149.cms||Roshan Gupta
---||India||Experts question Covaxin’s high private market price as R&D was govt subsidised||MUMBAI: The pricing of indigenously-manufactured Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, which at Rs 1,410 per dose is almost double that of Serum Institute’s Covishield has raised heckles in the vaccine ecosystem. Covaxin is the most expensive jab in the private market and even higher than Sputnik Vat Rs 1145, which is at present imported from Russia. Experts have questioned the rationale of high prices of Covaxin since it is based on an established technology, is domestically-produced, and it’s R&D has been part-subsidised by the Centre. Other vaccines like polio and hepatitis B using a similar technology platform, are affordable due to large volumes and economies of scale, a strategy which should have been followed early-on in the case of Covaxin, they said. In the absence of a universal policy, the Centre should negotiate affordable prices for all vaccines in the private market to prevent profiteering, public health experts added. A questionnaire sent to Bharat Biotech went unanswered. The government invested in pre-clinical studies for Covaxin, and amounts totalling Rs 11 crore and Rs 35 crore were spent on clinical trials in Covishield and Covaxin respectively. In the case of Covaxin, intellectual property is shared by Bharat Biotech (BB) with Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology. “If a model of technology transfer and partnerships is followed, the volumes could go up, bringing down the cost for the manufacturer’’, an industry expert told TOI. Till then, there is a need for all vaccine prices to be capped by bringing them under the National List of Essential Medicines. “We must keep in mind Covaxin is a joint collaboration with ICMR, and it is surprising that the government has no control over the exorbitantlypriced vaccine. From initial funding by ICMR for clinical trials to a huge sum paid to Bharat Biotech to enhance manufacturing capability, Covaxin has full government backing. In this backdrop, there is no justification for this high price’’, Amulya Nidhi of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said. “Costs aren’t, but should be transparent, given the government has invested in its development. The expectations and announcements that it would be cheaper than bottled water have turned out to be cruel jokes. This is a vaccine based on old and well-known technology. If production costs were high, then the vaccine should have been manufactured by PSUs. The current price suggests that BB is making an extortionate profit’’, Murali Neelakantan, principal lawyer at Amicus said. Also, there’s a need for transparency in the cost of production, which does not exist in India. It appears that there is a huge profit margin in private vaccine prices, said Leena Menghaney, a lawyer working on public health. The Supreme Court in its recent order has asked the government to provide details of direct and indirect grants provided for research, development and manufacture of all existing vaccines, and future vaccines that it proposes to authorise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/experts-question-covaxins-high-private-market-price-as-rd-was-govt-subsidised/articleshow/83450863.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

In all, 1.35 lakh doses of vaccines were administered in Jaipur on Friday (including all categories). This was the record vaccination by any district per day in Rajasthan. Even as it was believed that it was the highest (per day vaccination) among all districts in the country, this fact could not be verified on Friday. On Friday, 4.98 lakh doses of vaccines were administered in Rajasthan, which was the second highest per day in the state. The highest number of doses administered so far in the state was 5.81 lakh per day (on April 7). “In all, 1.34 lakh doses of vaccines were administered on Friday for those belonging to 18+ category. All vaccinations in the district were done through on-the-spot registration. We had a target to vaccinate 1 lakh people,” said chief medical and health officer (CMHO-I) Dr Narottam Sharma. District vaccination nodal officer and additional district collector (IV) Ashok Kumar visited the vaccination centres and oversaw the arrangements at these centres. There were long queues at many vaccination centres even after 4.30 pm. More than 1.18 lakh people were vaccinated till 5.30 pm, read a statement issued by Jaipur district administration. However, in some vaccination centres people had to return home without getting inoculated as vaccines had already exhausted by 3.30-4pm. Some visited 3-4 centres, but couldn’t get themselves vaccinated. “We couldn’t get ourselves vaccinated as vaccines have finished at this centre. We got to know about on-the-spot vaccination a little while ago, that’s why we didn’t come in the morning,” said Shubham, who went to a dispensary at Ward No 56 near Tonk Phatak to get himself vaccinated. He came to the centre along with his mother and sister. According to one of the officials, 250 doses were allocated to this dispensary.

With around 100 houses situated nearly eight km away from Blavana Kadavu, which connects the tribal hamlets inside the forest area with the mainland, 150 residents of Kunchipara Colony have turned Covid positive forcing officials to shift all the patients, including their primary contacts, to Covid facilities in the mainland. The hamlet has a population of 360 residents. Poultry and cattle are left behind in the hamlet with no one to look after it. Alli Kochalankaran, leader of Kunchipara Colony, echoes the fear of residents over losing their properties to wild animal attacks when they are away from the hamlet. “Ours is a highly populated area. Only a few people are currently in the colony. As we face wild animal conflicts, our properties and farming are under threat. One of the main issues we face is feeding cattle, poultry and dogs when we are away from the colony. All houses own either cattle, poultry or dogs. We don’t know how to feed them as we are all away from houses. Our hamlet is hanging in balance. Our colony needs fumigation as all houses have Covid cases,” he said. After spending eight days in a Covid care facility in Kalamassery, Kochalankaran and his wife returned home on Friday evening by ambulance. Their daughter is still in a Covid facility. Kuttambuzha panchayat authorities and Kothamangalam revenue officials have apprised the district administration of the situation in the colony after shifting of the residents to Covid facilities. “Patrolling of forest watchers should be strengthened in nights until residents return home. Tribespeople know the methods to scare away wild animals when they are on the prowl in farmlands. As the tribespeople are away, the area needs protection,” said a revenue official in Kothamangalam taluk. Meanwhile, Malayattoor divisional forest officer Ravikumar Meena said that they would provide assistance to assuage the fear of people who have been currently lodged at Covid facilities. “I have not received any request from them till Friday evening. If I get it, we will check into it and address their fear from our side,” said Meena. Many houses in Thalavachapara hamlet also got empty after residents were shifted to Covid centres. Residents in Wariam Colony also face Covid threat as a construction worker, who used to engage in construction works in the hamlet, died of Covid two weeks ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-hit-tribal-hamlet-faces-wild-animal-attacks-on-homes/articleshow/83443172.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Private labs entrusted with Covid tests simply collected Aadhaar and mobile numbers to produce fake test results during Maha Kumbh to meet targets; Uttarakhand govt orders probe||HARIDWAR: Many of the almost 4 lakh Covid tests done by the state government during the recently-concluded Maha Kumbh in Haridwar may have been fake, a preliminary investigation by the health department has revealed. A source privy to the matter told TOI that the district health department in Haridwar had entrusted 22 private labs to conduct Covid tests of pilgrims coming for the Kumbh. “A preliminary investigation has revealed that many of the lab staff simply collected random Aadhaar IDs and phone numbers from people and issued fake test results in their names. This was apparently done to meet the testing quota since the high court had asked the state to conduct at least 50,000 daily Covid-19 tests in Haridwar during Kumbh,” the source said. After the matter came to light, secretary (health) Amit Negi ordered an inquiry in the matter. Haridwar DM C Ravishankar has subsequently formed a 3-member committee to look into the allegations. The committee has been asked to submit its report within 15 days. Mela health officer Dr Arjun Singh Senger told TOI, “We had hired 9 private agencies and a total of 2.51 lakh tests were done in the mela area in the one-month duration of the Kumbh in April. Of these, 44,000 were RT-PCR and 2.07 lakh antigen tests. The cumulative amount to be paid to the labs is Rs 9.43 crore for the testing.” The district health department also hired 13 labs for conducting testing during the mega festival. While the mela health office facilitated the tests within the mela area, the labs appointed by the district health department conducted the tests at district borders and within the city. Around 1.5 lakh such tests are believed to have been conducted by the district health department during the mela period. Haridwar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr SK Jha when queried about the matter, told TOI, “A total of over 4 lakh tests were done during the Kumbh by district and mela health department combined but I can’t say anything further in the matter as an investigation is going on.” Head of the inquiry committee Saurabh Gaharwar when contacted said, “We are investigating all aspects and will submit our report within the stipulated time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/private-labs-entrusted-with-covid-tests-simply-collected-aadhaar-and-mobile-numbers-to-produce-fake-test-results-during-maha-kumbh-to-meet-targets-ukhand-govt-orders-probe/articleshow/83441174.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Covid patients struggle for months to get back to normal||AHMEDABAD: Alpesh Jani (name changed), 54, was admitted to a city-based private hospital in December 2020. “A patient of diabetes and hypertension, Jani’s condition deteriorated over four weeks of hospitalization. He was given steroids, remdesivir, and even plasma therapy but nothing worked much as his condition did not deteriorate through medicines but did not improve either,” said his relative. “Due to his breathlessness, he was again admitted to Civil Hospital where he spent another two months, getting below 80% oxygen saturation occasionally. He was discharged in March, but even at that time, he needed 5 litres of oxygen per minute. Even today, he attends the physiotherapy and treatment to improve his lung health,” said the relative. Dr Kartikeya Parmar, in-charge of 1,200-bed Covid Hospital at Civil Hospital, said that about 20-25% of the patients requiring critical care have prolonged Covid-related illness. “Factors such as lung involvement, age and comorbidities determine the severity of the infection. Those with severe manifestation can take months to regain their pre-Covid lung capacity,” he said. City-based critical care specialists point at ‘long Covid’ phenomenon where the patients of Covid-19 need hospitalization not only for Covid-induced clotting or inflammation, but its impact across organs ranging from brain to kidneys. The addition of bacterial and fungal infections such as mucormycosis has made the post-Covid symptoms more complex for patients. Dr Manoj Singh, a city-based pulmonologist, said that the post-Covid care units are now working with several patients as the fresh cases have recorded dip. “Lung improvement can be achieved through medications and exercises,” he said. Experts said that several of the city hospitals have their non-Covid ICUs full with recovered Covid patients. “The viral infection is tricky as it can manifest itself in several forms over a period of time. While some report stroke due to clotting, some report fibrosis in lungs due to severe infection. Heart attack and kidney failures are also reported,” said a city-based intensivist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-patients-struggle-for-months-to-get-back-to-normal/articleshow/83444885.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Nagpur||All 45-plus inoculated in Nagpur district’s 13 villages||NAGPUR: Thirteen villages in Nagpur district have set a record of sorts in Covid-19 vaccination programme. At a time when 48% of the total 45-plus population in the district is yet to take the jab, all from this age group in the 13 villages have reportedly taken their first dose.  Chief executive office of zilla parishad Yogesh Kumbhejkar told TOI, “The feat could be achieved due to Vaccination In Your Village concept, which was launched with the help of gram panchayats, public representatives, anganwadi sevikas, public health centres (PHCs) etc. Special squads have been formed at every village to encourage all 45-plus to take the vaccine.” “These squads are also clearing doubts and misconceptions in the minds of the people about the vaccine,” he said. These 13 villages are from six tehsils. Highest number of villages, five, is from Katol tehsil — Gondikhapa, Khapa, Ghubdi, Kavdimeth and Mohgaon (Dhole). Two villages each are from Hingna tehsil (Deoli Peth) and Takalghat), Tarni and Paoni in Kuhi tehsil and Parsodi Dixit and Ranwadi from Narkhed tehsil. One village each is from Kalmeshwar tehsil (Dehegaon) and Saoli (Mohatkar) in Saoner. Around 1,700 villages are in 13 tehsils in the district. As per state government’s estimation, the district’s population is 52,72,665 . The government had estimated around 30% (15,81,800) of the total population in above 45 years age group. As per data of the state’s public health department, 8,22,775 (52%) people from this age group have taken the first dose as on June 10, leaving 7,59,025 (48%) yet to be vaccinated Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and ZP are running 221 vaccination centres across the district. Each centre can easily inoculate 300 in a day. Thus, total capacity of the centres in the district is 66,300 jabs a day. But the number of beneficiaries has declined to below 5,000 a in the district for the last few days. The numbers are, however, not increasing to the desired level despite the NMC continuing with the Vaccination In Your Locality and ZP’s Vaccination In Your Village for the third consecutive week. Meanwhile, NMC has continued vaccination of students who got admission in foreign universities. Twenty such students were inoculated on Friday and 96 on Thursday. The civic body had reserved two centres — Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR) and Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital — for these students for two days in a week — Thursday and Friday. The number of students vaccinated last week was 154 on Friday and 112 on Thursday. Thus, total number of beneficiaries has now gone up to 382. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “We have invited detailed information from those working in foreign countries, but staying here due to Covid situation. We will also begin their vaccination if they are about to return to foreign countries for job purposes.” The state government had halted vaccination of 18-44 group at government centres from May 12. Students going abroad and those working in foreign countries are mostly from 18-44 group. Prior vaccination has been made mandatory by several countries before allowing such people to enter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-45-plus-inoculated-in-nagpur-districts-13-villages/articleshow/83444911.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Jaipur||Padma Shri Dr Ashok Panagariya dies of post-Covid complications in Jaipur||JAIPUR: Internationally acclaimed neurologist and recipient of Padma Shri Dr Ashok Panagariya died after battling with post-Covid complications on Friday afternoon. After he was admitted to a private hospital in Jaipur, the family decided to take him home while he was on ventilator. He breathed last at 3.46pm. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje and state health minister condoled the death of the neurologist and termed it as an “irreparable loss” to the field of neurology. Dr Panagariya’s family members grieve at their residence in JaipurPanagariya, 71, was on ventilator support for the past three weeks at a private hospital where he got admitted on May 1 following post-Covid complications. His condition deteriorated in the past two days and he died on Friday at his residence. “On the request of his family members, he was discharged with ventilator support at 2pm. He died at home at 3.46pm,” said hospital sources. Panagariya had recovered from Covid but after recovering from the infection, he was suffering with many other problems. In view of this, he was admitted to a private hospital in Jaipur. He had a kidney problem. Dialysis was being done everyday. But his health continued to deteriorate and he was then put on ventilator support. He is survived by his wife, a son and two daughters. TOI spoke to Dr Dinesh Swaroop Mathur who had retired as professor of Rheumatology from SMS Medical College in 2003 and had been tutor of Dr Panagariya, who said, “He was a very bright student who did not believe in just learning what is written in the books. He was the first doctor from Rajasthan who had done DM in neurology from Rajasthan. He attained heights and success due to his sheer hard work and passion for his work.” After his retirement, he was offered a job with a package of Rs 12 crore annually, but he decided to continue his practice and denied this offer. Meanwhile, chief minister Ashok Gehlot also expressed his condolence on the demise. “It is a big loss for the state. During the pandemic, Dr Panagariya had rendered his services. This is also a personal loss since we had family relations,” said Gehlot in his statement. Former chief minister Vasundhara Raje termed the death of Panagariya as an “irreparable loss” for the state. The eminent neurologist received the Merit Award from the government of Rajasthan in 1992. He served as Head of the Department of Neurology at SMS Hospital. He was the SMS Medical College principal from 2006 to 2010. In 2014, he was felicitated with Padma Shri.

---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Schools told to gear up for next academic year||TRICHY: The school education department has directed principals and administrative staff of government and government-aided schools to start preparatory works to commence the next academic year by visiting their schools from Monday. A source from the department said, “as the state government has cancelled the Class XII public examination in the view of Covid-19 pandemic, several procedures like calculating and preparing the certificates that are required to pursue higher education and related works need to be carried out.” “As admission for the next academic year is about to commence, school managements need to carry out the admission process and distribute notebooks and other government welfare schemes to the students. School campuses and classrooms need to be cleaned,” the source added. “From next week, we will also start admitting students for Class XI as their classes are likely to commence from the third week of June based on government guidelines,” said M Ramakrishnan, chief educational officer. A circular from the department said that if a school receives more applications for a particular group than the permitted class strength, then the school is allowed to increase the cap limit by 10-15% and students should be admitted in the group of their choice. If applications for a particular group exceeds the additional 15% strength, then the student should be selected based on his/her Class IX marks, the circular added.  “Earlier, the department had asked the school management to conduct an entrance examination if the number of applications exceeds the additional 15% strength. After objections from multiple corners, they had cancelled the entrance examination and asked the schools to admit based on Class IX marks,” said T Arulanantham, state auditor of Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers’ Association. Sources from the chief education office said that schools may be reopened by mid July in case Covid cases come down significantly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/schools-told-to-gear-up-for-next-academic-year/articleshow/83444923.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation sets up task force on illegal constructions||HYDERABAD: To regulate unabated unauthorised constructions in the city, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has constituted a special task force (STF) to inspect all the ongoing constructions and initiate action, including demolition. The STF will also have powers to seal the buildings. The task force will have outsourced engineers from the National Academy of Construction (NAC), who will inspect the buildings periodically (every month) and submit a report to the zonal-level STF. Town planning officers will not be part of the inspections as they might collude with property owners. GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar has recently issued a note constituting the STF and guidelines. Official sources said there is a provision in the TS-bPASS (Telangana State Building Permission Approval and Self- Certification System) Act, 2020, to set up special teams to curb unauthorised structures. “The idea behind setting up the STF is mainly to stop illegal constructions in the initial stages and demolish them if the owners do not take permissions or violate the building rules. Special teams members, especially engineers, are being trained at zonal level on how to carry out inspections and write panchanamas. The teams will get into action in the next one week,” a senior GHMC official told TOI. The zonal-level STF will be headed by zonal commissioner of respective zones and superintending engineer of the zone and DCP (law and order) will be members and GHMC joint commissioner or deputy commissioner will be nodal officer on whose name notices will be served on owners of illegal buildings. The GHMC commissioner said ward-wise NAC engineers have been appointed for periodical inspections at least once in 15 days of each ongoing construction and send reports to the zonal-level nodal officer for action. Apart from this, there will be enforcement teams at the zonal level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-sets-up-task-force-on-illegal-constructions/articleshow/83444896.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Thane||Thane neta-babu spar, seek Maharashtra CM's intervention||THANE: Senior IAS official and former Thane municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal has written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray seeking action against Sanjay Ghadigaonkar , a former Congress neta, accusing him of vendetta politics and continuous harassment and also trying to physically harm him. The letter comes days after former corporator Ghadigaonkar had independently written to Thackeray seeking a detailed probe in all projects and functioning of the corporation during Jaiswal’s tenure. The submission of letters has once again exposed the simmering hostility between Jaiswal and few local netas even after a year and half of the bureaucrat exiting Thane to assume greater responsibilities in the Mumbai corporation and his subsequent transfer to the fisheries department. In his letter to Thackeray, the bureaucrat who is noted to have helped transform the cityscape during his five year tenure, has accused Ghadigaonkar of deliberately harassing him after he was disqualified and later barred from contesting polls for submitting fake caste validation certificates during civic polls. He also accused the neta of ‘supporting’ illegal constructions in the city and also misusing the RTI. “Ever since Ghadigaonkar lost his seat, he has been harassing me. The harassment continued with even after I left Thane last year. He sent a letter to the CM following which I have also sent my official complaint laying bare few wrongdoings by few politicians in Thane city. I now fear for my life and have accordingly approached the CM who is aware of my works done in Thane,” Jaiswal told TOI. Meanwhile, Ghadigaonkar, who had switched loyalties to the BJP and later returned to Congress, maintained there have been several irregularities in functioning of the corporation during the tenure of Jaiswal. “I have sought a probe in all the projects sanctioned and also in the mushrooming of illegal constructions during the period. The administration, police and certain netas were in cahoots and fully exploited the situation,” he told the media. It may be noted another corporator formerly with the Congress and presently with the BJP, Narayan Pawar, has alleged several crucial files from the town development office were being stealthily taken out of the corporation in connivance of few builders and civic officials and sought a probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-former-civic-chief-of-thane-says-neta-may-bump-him-off/articleshow/83448156.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore likely to enter green zone, thanks to strict restrictions||COIMBATORE: The number of daily Covid-19 cases in the district has more or less come down to the pre-lockdown days before the second wave. As per the data available with the directorate of public health, Thursday’s caseload of 2,236 was just 135 cases higher than the 2,101 cases that the district logged on May 7, when the state-wide lockdown was announced to contain the second wave. The difference is expected to dip in the coming days. The district would, however, land in the green zone only if the caseload falls below the May 7-mark by more than 100. At least 21 districts, including Chennai, Madurai and Trichy, have already entered the green zone after reporting a dip of more than 100 cases from the May 7 figures. The directorate of public health classifies a district into red zone if the caseload is higher than the May 7 figures by more than 100 and into white zone if the difference is less than 100. Presently, Coimbatore, along with Erode, Tirupur, Thanjavur, Nilgiris, Salem and Namakkal are in the red zone. While the district continues to report the highest test positivity rate in the state and remain in the red zone, there is no doubt that the cases are on the decline. The daily caseload had peaked to 4,734 on May 27, from 2,101 on May 7. In the runup to the peak, the district had logged 4,268 cases on May 24 and 4,277 cases on May 26. The curve has been on the decline since May 27. A health department official said, “We expect the curve to decline further and start reporting fewer than the May 7 cases soon, putting us in the league of districts that are in the green zone.” District collector S Nagarajan said in another clear-cut evidence of the declining trend, the war room was not receiving any emergency calls between 5am and 8am, and 11pm and 2am, for ventilator beds or oxygen. Dr S Raja, city health officer, attributed the rise in caseload during the lockdown to the industrial clusters. “After realizing it, the state government had ordered complete closure of all industries other than those under the essential services category. This helped keep both the industrial and family clusters in check. Many industry workers were infecting their family members and neighbours before developing symptoms.” With the lockdown restrictions likely to ease further in the coming week, authorities said the public should follow the Covid-19 etiquette to bring the curve down to the level of April 10, when the second wave officially began, and flatten the same. “This starts with wearing a mask in public places, maintaining extremely low crowds and social distancing at social gatherings and washing hands frequently,” Nagarajan said. He said they had intensified the door-to-door surveillance in both the urban and rural areas to detect asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases. “So that they can be isolated and monitored at the earliest, thereby reducing the chances of virus spread while ensuring their speedy recovery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dist-likely-to-enter-green-zone-thanks-to-strict-restrictions/articleshow/83444991.cms||---

On visiting the link ewaste.mcdservices.online, citizens can place a request and the corporation will collect the e-waste from their doorstep. “Following a request, a vendor will collect the e-waste and pay citizens as per the approved rates,” said an SDMC official. “The rates for electronic waste have been fixed by the civic body and can be seen on the website. The citizens will also be provided a certificate regarding the safe disposal of their e-waste by the vendor.” SDMC said it has partnered with RBH E-Waste Recycle Hub Pvt Ltd to dispose of old and unserviceable IT equipment from offices, RWAs, markets and those given by residents under its jurisdiction. The facility is an important step towards ensuring scientific disposal of e-waste, said a press statement. “As per the agreement, the concessionaire will purchase e-waste from the citizens and will ensure the disposal in a proper manner. Information about e-waste services has been uploaded on the website too,” the corporation added. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change has notified the E-waste Management Rules, 2016, following which SDMC engaged private concessionaires on the basis of open tender. E-waste includes electrical items like computers, transformers, fridges, switches, televisions, etc that have reached the end of their life, the SDMC official added.  “This will help minimise the practise of selling the e-waste in waste pickers. If not recycled properly, toxic chemicals from the garbage can cause massive damage to the environment,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/s-corpn-starts-online-facility-to-help-people-dispose-of-e-waste/articleshow/83445044.cms||---

The 250mm pipeline supplies potable water to Khadapabandh and surrounding areas. Staff of the public works division (PWD) immediately undertook repair work on the pipeline. It may be recalled that just a few months ago, a major pipeline was also broken by the sewage work contractor at Curti in Ponda. The contractor said he was unaware about the underground pipeline network and that the pipes were getting damaged due to the use of excavators for digging. Locals have now demanded that the water division sends an official during the time of digging to alert and guide the contractor about the underground pipelines. Work of laying of underground pipes of the sewage department is presently on across Ponda town and its surrounding suburban areas. At many places broken PVC pipes of natural gas are also seen inside the pits of sewage work. The ongoing work has also annoyed many people as most of the roads across the town are destroyed, Further, the pits filled by the contractors with mud are caving in with the first rain. Ponda residents have demanded that the sewage corporation should get its work completed as soon as possible as the PWD claims that road repair work cannot be taken up as the sewage pipeline work is incomplete, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sewage-contractor-breaks-water-pipeline-in-ponda/articleshow/83444948.cms||---

During his visit on Friday at the Candolim vaccination centre, Rane said he decided to specially come down to show his appreciation to the PHC staff and others who worked round-the-clock to lower the cases. “Initially, during the second wave, Candolim PHC area was one of the hotspots. Today, it’s come down to 2% positivity and the credit for this goes to Dr Roshan Nazareth, the health officer in-charge of Candolim PHC. There are some people who make the extra effort to make a difference, and hence I thought I should come here and show my appreciation to Dr Roshan and all those who have worked to bring down the cases at the PHC,” the health minister said. Minister for ports and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, who was also present, said, “At one point, Candolim PHC had the second highest number of cases in the state after Margao. The PHC staff and others worked hard to bring the caseload down to almost nil.” Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes, who was instrumental in starting the offsite vaccination centre for the PHC, said, “Candolim was going through a bad phase. We, through Michael Lobo, approached the chief minister and health minister and they immediately came to our assistance and started the vaccination centre. They said the village panchayat can take over the vaccination, and in a very short time we managed to bring down the number of cases.” Both Rane and Lobo urged people to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/candolim-phc-staff-worked-hard-to-bring-down-cases/articleshow/83446922.cms||---

The auction was scheduled to commence at 9am, but began only at 11.30am, causing disappoint to the bought-leaf factories, who were ready to sell the tea. Dhananjayan, president, Nilgiris Bought-Leaf Tea Manufacturers Association, said they had been facing the same issue at the Coonoor tea e-auction centre for more than a year. “Whenever the buyer’s schedule gets totally changed because of the delay, the seller is at the receiving end.” He said the Tea Board had changed the server provider for the five auction centres, including Coonoor, Coimbatore and Cochin, in the country last year. “Since then, there has been frequent disruption in the auction timing. We had made several representations to the Tea Board, but in vain.” Tea auction is conducted twice a week - on Thursdays and Fridays - in the Coonoor auction centre. “Two weeks ago, auction had to be cancelled. At the end of the day, suppliers are the most affected and they cannot make payment to the small tea farmers,” Dhananjayan said. Vairavan, chairman, Coonoor Tea Traders’ Association, said the Tea Board had upgraded the server for the five auction centres in the country. “The frequency of server breakdown has increased after that. Because of this, tea is unsold and stocks are piling up in the warehouse. We have written to the deputy chairman of the Tea Board to resolve the issue soon.” M Balaji, executive director, Tea Board (south) said, “It is a new system introduced last year. Maybe, load factor is one of the reasons for the disruption in the e-auction centre. There might also be other technical factors, which have to be identified. A new platform will be ready soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/technical-snag-delays-tea-auction-by-more-than-2-hours-in-coonoor/articleshow/83444937.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will be conducting the fourth national level serological survey in June to assess the impact of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic and plan measures for the future, the government said it may not be appropriate to depend only on the national survey, suggesting that states should conduct their own serological survey to be able to contain transmissions locally. “If we want to protect our geographies, we cannot depend on one national sero survey alone and will have to encourage states/UTs to do sero surveys at their levels also,” Niti Aayog memberhealth Dr V K Paul said. TOI reported on Tuesday that ICMR is set to start the fourth nationwide sero survey for Covid-19 in June with an expanded coverage of population above six years of age. It will also cover healthcare workers in district hospitals. It will be conducted in the same 70 districts where the first three surveys were done.

Of the 64,089 tests conducted during the period, 2,006 came positive. Weekly TPR of district was 17th lowest among 35 districts of the state. Occupancy of oxygen beds was 3.93% as on June 10 — 189 occupied and 6,177 vacant. Of the total ventilator beds, 89 beds were occupied and 604 vacant. Thus, 278 of total 7,059 beds were occupied and remaining 6,781 were vacant. As per the data released on June 4 for the period May 28 to June 3, weekly TPR of district was 3.86% and occupancy of oxygen beds was 8.13%. On June 6, Raut had allowed extension in timing of essential and non-essential shops till 5pm, and restaurants and bars till 10pm. He had then stated that further relaxations will be announced next week after reviewing the parameters. Sources from the NMC told TOI that despite TPR of 11.11%, Pune has decided to increase timing to 7pm . “In view of this, the civic chief here recommended extension in timings of essential and non-essential shops till 7pm. But Raut asked the NMC to wait for one more week,” sources said. Raut did not respond to TOI calls and message. Last week, Raut had said though district is eligible for total relaxations, unlocking will be done in a phased manner to prevent any rise in cases. To justify his decision, he cited massive surge in cases and deaths in the second wave after unlocking. The order issued by Radhakrishnan B made it clear that there is no change in level of restrictions in city decided on basis of oxygen bed occupancy and TPR. Disaster Management Authority has allowed Aadhaar card centres up to 5pm. Skill development classes like typing, computer institutes, skill development institute related to healthcare workers can function till 5pm with 20 students in a batch or 50% of capacity of hall, whichever is less, with interval of at least one hour in batches, the order stated. The NMC order has permitted dining in restaurants situated in malls till 10pm with 50% capacity. In last week’s order, these restaurants were given permission up to 5pm. But none of the restaurants reportedly reopened as customers visit only in the evening. Last week, the civic body had allowed outdoor sports activities but restricted indoor sports. There was strong demand from badminton players to reopen courts. Radhakrishnan said indoor sports activities will resume from June 14. “Amendment in this regard will be issued on Saturday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tpr-o2-bed-occupancy-drop-further-but-raut-says-no-to-extend-shop-timings/articleshow/83445065.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

TNHB will also construct a high-rise block (above 18.30m in height) on the same campus for the middle income (MIG) and low income group (LIG) categories. TNHB was earlier renting out 48 flats in Varaganeri near Palpannai (Chennai-Trichy NH and Thanjavur-Trichy NH intersection) to the public. With the structure stability deteriorating, TNHB proposed to demolish the existing flats and build a high-rise residential project with amenities like covered car parking, multiple elevators, power back up, green space for children and CCTV security. The HIG block with 14 floors will have 56 units, each measuring 1,500 to 1,575sqft floor area. All the units will have three bedrooms and are likely to be sold at Rs 69 lakh per unit. “Since our site is close to multiple national highways, markets and hospitals, the demand was overwhelming during our market research. The flats will be in premium standard, special attention is given to the quality of flooring and elevation,” a senior official with TNHB Trichy said. TNHB has also applied for administrative sanction to launch a high-rise residential tower each for MIG (14 floors) and LIG (13 floors) categories. A total of 192 units in three different categories will be sold to the public. “We will notify the sales soon. People can pay the project cost in instalments as the construction progresses,” the official added. The HIG project is anticipated to be completed before April 2023 while the LIG and MIG projects will take two years each to conclude once the work begins. TNHB is already constructing a separate high-rise project in Mannarpuram for state government employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tnhb-begins-construction-of-trichys-first-high-rise-apartment-for-high-income-group/articleshow/83445054.cms||Deepak Karthik

In the applications submitted to additional district magistrate (ADM), who is heading the panel, they alleged that the hospital management “murdered” the patients by cutting the oxygen supply. They demanded registration of a case under IPC section 302 (punishment for murder) against the owner of the hospital, Arinjay Jain. Meanwhile, a local human rights activist Naresh Paras has filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) against the hospital. The district administration has claimed that four Covid-19 patients of Agra district had died at the hospital on April 26 and three on April 27. However, TOI traced 10 families whose close relatives died at the hospital on April 26 and 27. Head constable Ashok Kumar Singh who lost his wife on April 26 said, “I have given a written complaint to the ADM seeking justice in the murder of my wife. The hospital owner should be booked for murder.” ADM Prabha Kant Awasthi said, “We have received seven complaints letters regarding deaths at Shri Paras hospital. All of these complaints received will be investigated. Health department team is investigating records of the hospital. Cause of deaths will be ascertained. There was no shortage of oxygen at the hospital.” While Paras said, “It is strange that even after three days of investigation, authorities have not been able to figure out how many people died at the hospital on April 26 and 27.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/7-families-come-forward-submit-complaints-against-shri-paras-hospital-owner/articleshow/83441234.cms||---

---||Kochi||No action yet on plaints of police torture of minor boys||Thiruvananthapuram: Almost a week has passed by after four underage higher secondary students were allegedly harassed physically by a few policemen of the Kattakada police station and the police department is yet to take any action on the issue. The only step taken so far is an internal inquiry conducted by Kattakkada DSP. According to sources, the DSP had found errors on the part of the cops while dealing with the boys. But, despite receiving the inquiry report three days ago, IG (South Zone) is yet to take any action based on its findings. When contacted, IG Harshita Attaluri said that she was waiting for some clarifications regarding the report. The alleged incident took place on Sunday and the parents of the four boys filed separate complaints before the DSP on Monday. Still, the police are yet to register FIRs based on these complaints. State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) chairman K V Manoj Kumar meanwhile said that he is yet to get a copy of the inquiry report despite sending mails to the state police chief.  “But even if the police authorities are trying to scuttle the case, the Commission will ensure justice to the boys and their families,” he said. The Commission had already seized a piece of evidence, a cable which the officers allegedly used to thrash the boys, when they visited the station as part of inquiry on Monday. Further procedures of evidence collection, including recording of statements of people involved, could not be done owing to lockdown restrictions, the Commission chairman said. Meanwhile, Kattakada DSP S Shaji visited the shop of one boys’ parents on Friday evening.  He summoned the boy to the shop and made some inquiries, including whether he could identify the officers on sight again and whether they were thrashed using weapons or by bare hands. This visit made the parents believe that the police have officially started the investigation. The DSP however told TOI that he just stopped to make some enquiries while passing by and it was not an official visit. The alleged incident took place at Anchuthengimood on Sunday afternoon. The boys claim that they had gathered outside a temple there for online studies as the network reception was poor near their homes. A police team that reached there questioned them for sitting there and took them to the station, accusing them of being substance abusers. They were released without any charges after the parents turned up at the police station. By evening, the boys complained of pain and uneasiness after reaching their respective homes. It was then they revealed that some police officers thrashed them using a cable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-action-yet-on-plaints-of-police-torture-of-minor-boys/articleshow/83443353.cms||---

The actor took to Instagram and other social media platforms to praise the boy and said that Venkatesh is truly inspiring. “Venkatesh walked barefoot all the way from Hyderabad to Mumbai to meet me, despite me making efforts to arrange some sort of transportation for him. He is truly inspiring & has immensely humbled me,” read Sood’s post. Sood asked his fans not to take trouble to meet him. “I, however, don’t want to encourage anyone to take the trouble of doing this,” his post further read.

Several captions such as ‘the real hero Sonu Sood,’ ‘Hyd to Mumbai’, among other were mentioned on the placard. The actor even shared a video of the boy on Facebook. Venkatesh, an intermediate second-year student, walked 700 kilometers to reach his destination. He even refused to take lift in between. It is said that Venkatesh hoped his hero could help him and his family amid pandemic. Irrespective of whether or not the actor helps him, Venkatesh wanted to meet, thank and show his love for Sood.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC for drastic steps to implement Building Use permission norms||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday frowned upon the authorities after the state government and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) expressed reluctance to act quickly to implement the Building Use permission norms and insisted to let them first focus on implementation of the fire safety certification. The bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia said that the authorities will have to deal with both the issues – BU permission and fire NOC – simultaneously and granted them four weeks “to place on record the Action Taken Report with regard to the issue of fire NOC in the buildings where valid BU permission is available and to work out a policy and plan of action with time schedule to address the issue of BU permission in the state of Gujarat”. Further hearing is posted on July 9. The HC was hearing a PIL filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal who sought implementation of fire safety norms after a fire incident killed eight Covid-19 patients in Shrey Hospital last year. He has been complaining about authorities’ negligence towards building bylaws and court directions issued in the past. The judges questioned the inaction by the authorities that allowed cropping up of illegal construction and insisted that the authorities will have to take “drastic steps” to permanently resolve the problem and stop ad-hocism. To this, advocate general Kamal Trivedi said that this would cause a large-scale sealing drive and demolition of illegal structure and this would cause “commotion” among people and the city of Ahmedabad could be the first place to face the problem. The AG submitted that the authorities be allowed to first address the issue of fire NOC and it would not be possible for the state authorities to resolve the issues of fire NOC and BU permission simultaneously. He said that the BU permission is a major issue and it would require more time to address it. The court questioned the government about its helplessness, about its inaction against the officials with whose “connivance and blessings” the illegal structures have cropped up. After the state government, the municipal corporations and municipalities too requested the court to grant them more time to deal with the BU issue and not to insist on dealing with both of them simultaneously. There may be lakhs of buildings without BU permission and taking action would take months. The judges got annoyed and said that under the garb of fire safety, the authorities would issue fire NOC to all buildings, which lack BU permission and the problem would never be resolved. They also said that such an approach would take another 20 years to implement the laws, as the authorities have already taken two decades but have not resolved the problem. The judges said that the government cannot keep its eyes shut to the problems and it will have to act to enforce law and make people feel that the law would not allow them to put up construction as per their wish. Looking at the problem, the judges also commented that the government may come up once again with an Impact Fee law to regularize unauthorised constructions. The government has twice in the past brought such a law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-for-drastic-steps-to-implement-bu-laws/articleshow/83445104.cms||---

Naresh Naagar, 47, a resident of Khokhra who works with NID for 19 years, said that he along with other five colleagues decided to go to Andaman and Nicobar in November 2019 for which he surfed on internet and found contact details of accused Vivek Lal. Naagar said that Lal demanded Rs 7.66 lakh for tickets of 20 persons including the NID staffs and their family members. He said that they paid Lal Rs 6.08 lakh between November 29, 2019 and January 2, 2020. Rest of Rs 1.58 lakh was supposed to be given when they would reach Andaman and Nicobar. Naagar said that their flight was scheduled on April 25, 2020 but due to the lockdown, it was cancelled. Later, Lal accommodated their trip in August but then also there was lockdown issue in Andaman and Nicobar, so their journey was cancelled again. After that, Lal neither returned their money nor accommodated their trip, Naagar said in the FIR. He approached police and filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust against Lal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nid-staffers-duped-of-rs-6-lakh-by-travel-agent/articleshow/83445172.cms||---
---||Trichy||Mass cleaning on in four Trichy wards with rampant littering||TRICHY: Following increasing number of complaints from the public on public littering, Trichy corporation has launched mass cleaning drive in four corporation wards. The move was initiated after the Municipal administration minister K N Nehru found piles of garbage in multiple vacant sites adjoining residential roads during an inspection in his constituency. Trichy corporation sources said the minister found littering to be high in the corporation wards 57, 58, 59, and 60 falling under the K Abishekapuram zone covering Woraiyur. The civic body has launched mass cleaning in the four wards by mobilising all sanitary workers of the wards in one particular ward each day. In the morning, sanitary workers will complete the doorstep waste collection. In the afternoon, the workers will remove the piled up garbage in identified vulnerable parts. “Workers will also sensitise the residents not to litter waste in public spots,” said R Vinoth, assistant commissioner. Vacant plot owners who have not fenced their properties will be alerted to clean the space. To cover the slum areas, the civic body has diverted pushcarts to collect waste where mini-trucks cannot access. In the coming days, officials have planned to cover the remaining three wards. “On a rotation basis, the wards will be made garbage-free,” the assistant commissioner added. Residents have sought mass cleaning activities in other vulnerable parts of the city too. Trichy corporation sources added that most of the sanitary workers were vaccinated against Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/mass-cleaning-on-in-4-trichy-wards-with-rampant-littering/articleshow/83445134.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Juvenile can file anticipatory bail plea: Gujarat HC||AHMEDABAD: In an important order, the Gujarat high court has held that a juvenile is entitled to anticipatory bail and can file an application directly for the same in courts. On Wednesday, Justice A Y Kogje granted anticipatory bail to a 17-year-old who was fearing arrest in a case of rioting and gambling by Sanand police. The judge said that the anticipatory bail application for protection of liberty of a juvenile is maintainable. The court observed, “The personal liberty of an individual is at the highest pedestal and the personal liberty of a juvenile cannot be considered to be anything lower. Right of an individual to a legal recourse is also fundamental for an individual and has to be so if not with more vigour for a juvenile.” After a few persons were arrested and then bailed out in connection with an FIR filed by Sanand police, the 17-year-old through his elder brother filed an anticipatory bail plea in the Mirzapur rural court. The lower court dismissed the bail plea by terming it not maintainable and cited an order passed by the Madhya Pradesh high court. The trial court had also said that a juvenile can seek such protection from the Juvenile Justice Board and upon denial, he can file an appeal in the court of law against the order of rejection, but the anticipatory bail is not maintainable. When the HC was moved for anticipatory bail through advocate Rashmin Jani, HC granted pre-arrest bail to the juvenile and observed that the lower court discussed nothing in its order as to in what manner Section 6(2) of the Juvenile Justice Act is attracted. The law uses word ‘apprehension’ which is at par with and synonymous to ‘arrest’, which is used in Section 438 of CrPC, which provides for anticipatory bail. After discussing provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, the court said, “The Act which is separately provided for the children is to act in the benefit of the children and cannot be understood to curtail the rights which are otherwise ordinarily available to the individuals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-juvenile-can-file-anticipatory-bail-plea/articleshow/83445145.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Renovated Hardayal library in 159-year-old building ready for readers||New Delhi: Almost two years after North Delhi Municipal Corporation decided to renovate Hardayal Municipal Library, the refurbished heritage facility was inaugurated on Friday by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. The library, located in Old Delhi’s Chandni Chowk in a 159-year-old structure, has around 1.7 lakh books, of which 8,000 are rare texts and 350 handwritten manuscripts. The project also includes restoration and digitalisation of rare books to preserve them for ages. This work, being carried out by Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA), will take another six months, said Rekha Sinha, secretary of the library management committee. The library, currently closed due to Covid-19, will open for the readers whenever permitted by Delhi Disaster Management Authority. Vardhan said the historic library had played an important role in promoting book reading culture. “After the renovation, this library has got a new look and we expect more and more readers will visit the place, read books conveniently,” he said. The rare books include History of the World (1677) containing maps of the whole world; handwritten Bhagwat Mahapuran (1800); Mahabharata translated in Persian during Mughal emperor Akbar’s rule; Quran Majeed (1928), the Quran written in Hindi; Prem Sagar, the first book written in Braj Bhasha in 1881; Gazettes from 1916 to 1992; and Bhrigu Samhita, a book on astrology. During a visit in September 2019, TOI had found the premises and books in a pathetic condition. On Friday, the building was wearing a brand-new look while books were wrapped and kept in racks. “The books will be arranged properly from Monday once their entries are done. Considering we have limited space left for keeping books after renovation and more space is given to the reading areas, the plan is to shift books with multiple copies and editions to other branches,” said Sinha. The library, which was established in 1862, was transferred to the municipality later and named after freedom fighter Lala Har Dayal, who was a resident of Old Delhi. The project was announced in September 2019, but it got delayed and the work finally began last June. “After several hurdles, we managed to complete the restoration work. The project has been completed in a year with an investment of Rs 283 lakh,” said north corporation mayor Jai Prakash. In this single-storey building, reading and news reading areas, computer room, staff area and book display space have been made on the ground floor, while provisions for reading, conference room and book display have been created on the mezzanine floor, added Jai Prkash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/renovated-hardayal-library-in-159-yr-old-bldg-ready-for-readers/articleshow/83445176.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Goa||As second wave ebbs, Goa disbands panel for emergency medical purchases||PANAJI: The government last week disbanded a joint purchase committee constituted during the first wave of the pandemic last year. The public health department, which issued the order, has directed the Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital and the directorate of health services (DHS) to henceforth make all emergency purchases pertaining to Covid-19 through the government e-marketplace (GeM) portal or by following the regular tendering process. GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar and director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa were among the members of the now defunct committee that had made all emergency purchases — including of medicines and other requirements — for both, the GMC and the DHS, over the past year. “Henceforth, even if it is an emergency purchase, both entities will have to follow the process outlined by the government,” a health official who confirmed the disbandment of the joint purchase committee, said. “The government felt that since we have passed the Covid-19 peak and there are no shortages as experienced earlier, purchases should be routed through the regular process. They (GMC and DHS) can plan and buy medicines and other requirements in advance.” Disclosing that there is a big difference in the rates quoted by suppliers enrolled on the GeM portal and by those who are not on it, the official said that even if emergency purchases are justified and are made without obtaining the concurrence of the finance department in order to avoid delays, trouble arises when fingers are pointed at them for bypassing the normal process. “It is better to avoid problems later when audit queries are received. There will be transparency. This was also the requirement of the finance department,” the official said and added that purchases through the GeM portal are in fact more expeditious, prompting many states to rely on it. “The portal offers transparency and the rates are competitive too. Goa perhaps is the only state that does not rely on the GeM portal,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-second-wave-ebbs-state-disbands-panel-for-emergency-medical-purchases/articleshow/83445214.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Tauktae as strong as 1998 cyclone’||AHMEDABAD: Cyclone Tauktae, which caused damage to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore in Gujarat alone according to the state government’s estimates, was as strong as the cyclone that hit Kandla in 1998. This was mentioned in a detailed report on Tauktae released by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday. The report also said that Gujarat felt its impact for about 24 hours. The report said that the cyclone was very rare as it caused adverse weather and damage across the western coast of India from May 14 to 18. The report termed Tauktae as the first cyclonic storm over the north Indian Ocean for 2021. Its track from Lakshadweep to Rajasthan was 1,880km long. “During satellite era (1961-2021), Tauktae was the most intense cyclone after Kandla cyclone in 1998,” the report said. “During this period, 3 extremely severe cyclonic storms crossed the Gujarat coast.” The report said that Tauktae had the same intensity as that of the Kandla cyclone of June 1998, at the time of landfall. Both had maximum sustained surface wind speed of 160-170 kmph gusting to 185 kmph at the time of landfall. “However, lifetime maximum intensity was higher in the case of Tauktae,” the report said. Tauktae, the report said, “had the maximum intensity of 180-190 kmph gusting to 210 kmph over the east-central Arabian Sea during early morning to afternoon of May 17.” Its progression was rapid as it gathered speed and intensity with favourable weather conditions. Against the average life period of 165 hours for tropical cyclones over Arabian Sea, Tauktae lasted for 129 hours. It moved with 12-hour average translational speed of 14.4 kmph against Long Period Average (1990-2013) of 11.8 kmph over Arabian Sea during the pre-monsoon season. The report noted a very accurate forecast by the IMD over the cyclone’s course that helped the states mobilize resources and reduce loss of lives. The impact of the cyclone gave very heavy rainfall across the western coast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tauktae-as-strong-as-1998-cyclone/articleshow/83445208.cms||Parth Shastri

Unlike 2020 which was marked by clean air and blue skies during the summer lockdown months, the metropolis and its surroundings have contributed not only more pollution hot spots this year, but experienced a rise in levels of atmospheric particulate matter, according to a recent analysis. Chakala in Andheri, Navy Nagar in Colaba, Nerul in Navi Mumbai, Mazgaon, Malad West, and Deonar are the six areas which figure in the list of top 10 most polluted areas in Maharashtra with very high levels of PM2.5 concentration in air (measured in micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3), according to the analysis based on the NCAP Tracker. Track the pollution level in your cityNCAP Tracker does a review of the national clean air programme implementation and impact assessment through which government aims to reduce particulate matter (PM) pollution by up to 30%. The tracker sources data from the Central Pollution Control Board. The platform has been developed by CarbonCopy and Respirer Living Sciences. In 2019, the Mumbai metropolitan region had three spots among the 10 most polluted in Maharashtra (Pimpaleshwar in Thane, Mahape in Navi Mumbai and Sion in Mumbai) and four in 2020 (Nerul, Bandra, Mahape and Sion). In Mumbai, experts with the pollution board say the reason for the city’s particulate load is vehicle pollution followed by dust and smog emanating from construction sites, waste burning (incinerators) and industrial emissions. Between March to May 2020, when a lockdown was enforced, even the most polluted locations had a PM 2.5 concentration of slightly over 25 ug/m3, which is the WHO’s daily safe limits. But in 2021, pollution levels have increased over the previous year as well as a year before. In 2019, six out of 10 most polluted locations in the state recorded PM 2.5 concentration of less than the CPCB-mandated 40 ug/m3 but in 2021, all locations on the list breached that mark. Dr Arun Sharma, president, Society for Indoor Environment, says, such high pollution could lead to increased instances of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergies, bronchial asthma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mmr-has-6-pollution-hotspots-among-top-10-in-maharashtra-study/articleshow/83445637.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Kochi||Youths turn barren land into a farm||Thiruvananthapuram: A group of childhood friends at Muthana in Chemmaruthy panchayat has started paddy cultivation in 12 acres of agricultural land that remained unused for the last 15 years. With an aim to protect the environment and to promote agriculture, this peer group of five youngsters had started planning to cultivate on the barren land, even before the pandemic. The youngsters working in varied fields include Premjith, a fire and safety personnel (abroad), Aarshan, a police constable at Anchuthengu police station, Shabu, a driver, Sureshkumar, an AC mechanic at a private resort in Kovalam, and Laiju, a lab assistant at a private engineering college in Thiruvananthapuram. With the Covid-induced lockdown, Premjith couldn’t return to his workplace and now he has decided to lead this initiative. Sureshkumar had also lost his job during the time of the pandemic. This has triggered the thought of reviving the barren land that remained unused for 15 years.  With the support of padasekhara samithi, Krishi Bhavan, and panchayat they managed to sow paddy crop on June 7. “The field lacked a proper irrigation facility. Somehow they recovered a stream that flows through the field. We have brought the initiative under the Subhiksha Keralam project. We aim to ensure self-sufficiency in food and to sell rice in the brand name Chemmaruthy. Earlier, our panchayat had produced parboiled rice in the brand name Chemmaruthy,” said Priyanka V, Chemmaruthy panchayat president. Of the 12 acres, cultivation in a portion is done by a group of women who were involved in daily wage works and works that come under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. “Besides us, we have many farmers with us to work in the field. Our first yield will be sold through Supplyco,” said Premjith. “We are proud of these youngsters who have come up with such a productive thought,” said Preethi R, agricultural officer of Chemmaruthy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/youths-turn-barren-land-into-a-farm/articleshow/83443542.cms||---

The two task forces will submit their reports in the coming days, based on which an SOP to vaccinate the marginalised, the homeless and those living in shelter homes will be framed. Each task force has sub-groups at the taluka level that are headed by the sub-divisional magistrate and can co-opt NGOs to help identify those who need to be vaccinated at the taluka level. The Union ministry of health and family welfare has formulated SOPs for Covid-19 vaccination of people who do not have any of the seven prescribed photo identity cards. “It is advised that identification of such persons is to be completed,” said North Goa collector Ajit Roy in an order issued to all the deputy collectors and deputy directors of the labour, municipal administration and panchayat departments and the Goa police. While the North Goa district task force will submit its report on June 15, the South Goa district task force will submit its report on June 20. South Goa collector Ruchika Katyal said NGOs can be co-opted by the sub-committees of the task force to identify those beggars, labourers and others who do not have any identification cards. prison inmates, inmates at mental health institutions, citizens in old age homes, people residing in rehabilitation camps who lack identification are also eligible for vaccination. Information regarding the identified groups and the number of beneficiaries to be covered must be collated at the state level and the government must issue clear instructions for implementation of these SOPs along with the district-wise estimated maximum number of doses to be administered using this special dispensation. On June 1, the consumer and civic rights group, Goacan, had written to director of health services Dr Jose D’Sa about the urgent need for a plan to vaccinate beggars and other marginalised sections of society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/task-forces-to-identify-those-without-id-cards-for-jabs/articleshow/83445311.cms||---

With Kolkata traffic police set to install 230 automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras in all major intersections in the city before the Puja, it hopes to curb traffic violations — particularly in the early morning, mid-afternoon and late night. The system will enable creation of a hot list to be tracked whenever the notified vehicle is on the move and warn policemen on surveillance. Also number plates of stolen cars can be fed into the system for auto detection. Such cameras are already installed on the Maa flyover and lead to traffic challans being generated automatically when cars violate the speed limit. They are also installed at Esplanade crossing, Hare Street-Strand Road crossing, Shyambazar five-point crossing, Howrah Bridge, College Street-M G Road crossing, Moulali-Lenin Sarani crossing, S N Banerjee-Rafi Ahmed kidwai Road crossing, AJC Bose Road-Camac street crossing, James Long Sarani and Ashoka Cinema Hall-DH Road crossing, Alipore Road and Chetla Central Road crossing. Altogether, Rs 6 crore will be spent on the gadgets. This will also take the traffic CCTV count to 1,850. The project that had been pending since February due to the elections was approved on Friday and will be executed before Durga Puja. “We had called a tender for 75 crossings that got stalled. We are now asking for such cameras at 40 additional crossings,” said an officer. The ANPR system serves four purposes — increase public confidence, increase the number of detected offences (both criminal and traffic related), reduce the occurrence of incidents, and reduces road traffic casualties. Police have already floated tenders and the bidders are likely to place their initial bids by the first week of July. The ANPR server will be capable of detecting vehicle type and colour, will be capable of license plate recognition and “no helmet” detection for motor bikes and will give 85 percent accuracy in the day and 65 percent at night, said police sources. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said the move is part of traffic cops to integrated policing. “The ANPRs will help us in tracking down vehicles faster. The older cameras needed some modernization. This will also help us cover a wider area,” said Sinha. Among the 115 proposed places where the Automatic Number Plate Recognition System (ANPR) cameras are Tea Board crossing on Brabourne Road, Strand Road and Auckland Road, GC Avenue and Bentinck Street, Chitpore Police station crossing, J M Avenue-Beadon Street crossing, C R Avenue and Muktaram Babu Street crossing, Little Russel Street and Middleton Street, Ripon Street-Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road, Maa Flyover, AJC Bose flyover near Camac Street crossing, Ballygunge Circular Road-Chakraberia Road, PC Connector-Kohinoor Market, PC Connector-Gobinda Khatik Road and Theatre Road-Loudon Street crossing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/230-number-plate-cams-at-115-crossings-before-puja/articleshow/83443575.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Aviptadil is a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) which, when administered, results in rapid clinical recovery in patients with severe SARS-COV-2 infection, it said. “These observations are based on results of multiple trials of Aviptadil against Covid-19 globally in patients with respiratory failure and the same have been submitted to DCGI for their review,” Biophore said. The company said it has successfully developed Aviptadil, for which it is backward integrated with in-house active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and will be starting commercial production immediately after it receives EUA. “Biophore has developed this highly complex peptide in a very short period, primarily due to the extensive focus of the company in prioritizing Covid-related products over the last one year. Aviptadil is a very promising treatment option for Covid, especially in severe hospitalized cases where trials have shown a high recovery percentage,” said Biophore CEO Dr Jagadeesh Babu Rangisetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/biophore-seeks-eua-for-aviptadil/articleshow/83445291.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The hi-tech meters will help citizens view and optimise electricity consumption real time at the click of a few keys. Adani Electricity had also announced in August last year that it has floated tenders and invited bids for installing smart meters in 7 lakh household and commercial units in Mumbai’s suburbs. BEST also plans to get such meters in near future for the island city. A key highlight of Tata Power’s new smart meter is that even if there are “physical restrictions” during Covid pandemic, the power firm will be able to provide billings which are based on actual meter readings. A Tata official said: “Smart meters provide meter readings to our billing system automatically, thus eliminating manual meter reading at site. So, you can say goodbye to hefty bills due to assessed/average monthly readings during lockdown.” Tata Power’s president Sanjay Banga said: “Mumbai customers had billing issues in summer of 2020, with hefty bills arriving at doorstep in June/July. It will be a thing of the past with smart meters which also enables customers with valuable data analytics tools.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-a-1st-7k-power-users-get-smart-meters/articleshow/83445326.cms||Somit Sen
---||Kolkata||Fake Covid reports: Health department alerts Kolkata cops||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police, along with the state police, has received tip-offs from the state health department on fake Covid reports that are being provided for Rs 5,000 per test. At present, the charge for RT-PCR tests at most facilities is Rs 850 with an additional service charge for home collection of swab samples. Investigating the case, cops have listed 30 suspects and asked patients to check ID cards properly before allowing collection agents into their homes. The state police has already arrested several persons on charges of either preparing fake Covid reports or charging much more than what is allowed. Police said several cheats have been found to be doubling up as collection agents, who claim to belong to reputable pathological labs. Even local police stations have been advised to make people aware of the fake Covid-19 test racket. The state health department has stepped in after requesting the police to stop the menace. It has urged people to conduct tests from verified labs and government facilities. “We have received complaints from patients who have been charged up to Rs 5,000 for a Covid-19 test,” said a senior doctor associated with Beliaghata ID Hospital. The cops cited an instance in Entally where 21 residents of a building got themeselves tested after a fellow resident died of Covid. A lab employee had collected their samples. The result declared all of them Covid negative although two residents displayed clear signs of Covid. When some of the residents scanned the QR code on the report to download the result, the reports turned out to be those of others from tests that had been conducted nearly a year ago. In another incident, a School of Tropical Medicine part timer staffer was nabbed for running a fake racket from Hooghly but targeting patients in Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-covid-reports-health-dept-alerts-cops/articleshow/83443615.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mayor gets earful from high court for ‘politics’ over building collapse||MUMBAI: Frowning upon comments allegedly made by Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar following the Malad building collapse, Bombay high court on Friday expressed its displeasure at being blamed by civic authorities for building collapses. “We are not going to tolerate politics over building collapses,” said Chief Justice (CJ) Dipankar Datta who led a full bench that extended all interim orders passed by courts across Maharashtra and Goa till July 9 or until further orders, whichever is earlier. Referring to the Malad incident, the CJ said it was made abundantly clear that municipal corporations/councils/ panchayats shall be at liberty to move court for demolition, if necessary. He said he was informed about the mayor’s comments on a TV channel. ‘This is not fair. You don’t take steps when required and thereafter you blame the high court. That high court has stopped us [BMC] from demolishing buildings,” said the CJ. The CJ said, while passing orders extending interim protection due to the pandemic, the civic authorities were granted liberty to move court for demolition of dangerous/dilapidated/unsafe structures. “We are available 24 x 7,” said the CJ. The judges also looked up a Marathi newspaper report that quoted Pednekar saying that when officials go to take action against illegal structures they are shown court orders and told due to Covid they should not act. “Our hands are tied. A definite decision is required in this regard,” she purporedly said. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, said Pednekar was questioned by the media about BJP accusing Shiv Sena of inaction against unauthorised structures. He said the mayor said the collector, the BMC and MMRDA must come together so that such collapses do not happen in future. He nevertheless apologised. “If you are on the right track and you have not said anything interfering with the administration of justice, you need not apologise,’’ the CJ said. The judges have sought the English transcript of the conversations of “what were the questions and answers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mayor-gets-earful-from-high-court-for-politics-over-building-collapse/articleshow/83448404.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Pune||ITI admission process to be based on SSC results this year||PUNE: Students aspiring for a seat at the Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) will not have to go through any entrance test for admissions to the diploma courses. They can present their secondary school certificate (SSC, Std X) mark sheet and based on merit the admissions would be allotted. The Directorate of Vocational Education and Training (DVET) that conducts ITI admissions has announced that the required documents like caste certificate, Aadhaar, and others should be ready. Every year, the demand for ITI seats is very high and nearly two applications for every ITI seat run by the state government institute are received by the DVET. Admissions coordinator at ITI Ashish Akhade said, “We will conduct a centralised admission process which will be completely online and students can process their forms right from application to admission confirmation. We have decided not to conduct an entrance test because the admissions are tough, especially with government institutes.” DVET officials said the reason for popularity and demand for ITI courses was due to the fact that the candidates have a high rate of job opportunities open once they are out of the course and the fees were less and also duration of courses varied from one year to three years. Last year, nearly 4,000 more applications were received by DVET as compared to the previous year. Director of DVET Yogesh Patil said “Since the past four to five years, the trend has been on high for ITI courses for various reasons including immediate job opportunities and short duration. The department has introduced many courses based on changing trends which includes robotics, agriculture and others which are also high in demand.” Courses in motor mechanics, electrician, tool and dye maker, refrigeration are in very high demand. The trend is noticeable since the seats for engineering courses have not found many takers. Many government ITIs have been sought-after and the cut-off has been above 90 per cent at the end of the first round of the merit list. Patil said the quality of education has been attracting the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/iti-admission-process-to-be-based-on-ssc-results-this-yr/articleshow/83445373.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The sex of the baby has not been determined yet. After the birth of two male chimpanzees, Anand and Vijay, in the mid-1990s, this is the first birth of a chimpanzee in captivity at the zoo in nearly 25 years. Both the newborn and the mother are healthy and safe and are staying together. The mother is feeding the baby and cradling it on her chest throughout the day, officials said. During the night, Gombe, the dad, is separated from the mother and the baby and is kept in isolation. The zoo managers had increased the quantity of diet for the mother after the birth of the baby. The zoo earlier had a male chimpanzee named Victor which was housed in the facility without a mate. In 1998, authorities had acquired a female Tuntun under animal exchange programme from Alipore zoo in Kolkata. The female was specially brought to Vandalur for breeding in captivity. However, Tuntun failed to breed successfully in captivity and could not deliver babies during its stay in the zoo, authorities said. Tuntun died at the age of 52 in September 2015. An intelligent animal, Tuntun was curious and communicative too during its active days in Vandalur, zoo authorities said. However, during its last days, Tuntun refused to eat food offered by animal keepers and its health deteriorated and it subsequently died. In the wild, the lifespan of chimpanzees range between 40 years and 45 years. In captivity, they can live for eight or nine more years, zoo authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/susie-gets-a-baby-city-new-chimpanzee/articleshow/83443710.cms||P Oppili

The desilting works were taken up in January 2021, and GHMC officials claim 94% works have been completed. The GHMC witnesses heavy rains and several colonies get inundated every year. Last October, hundreds of colonies were inundated and faced overflowing of nalas. While mayor Gadwal Vijaya Laxmi held a review meeting on desilting works a couple of days ago, city ministers Talasani Srinivas Yadav and Mohd Mahmood Ali held a review meeting on Friday to take stock of the situation especially desilting of storm water drains, nalas modernisation, removal of encroachments on major drains. Srinivas Yadav asked the officials to conduct a survey on encroachments all along nalas and lakes, so that they can be evacuated by rehabilitating them in 2 BHk houses. Further, the minister suggested to prepare a plan and prepare estimates for permanent solution to prevent inundation, instead of repeating the same works and wasting public money. He said GHMC should use latest machinery in desilting works where ever possible and minimize the deploying of man power, keeping in view of safety of workers. GHMC commissioner Lokesh Kumar informed that so far desilting works were completed in 256 drains at an estimated cost of Rs 44.45 crore with a target length of 221.04 km mechanically and 663.11 km manually (total 884.15 Kms). Till June 8, 830.4 km i.e 94% drains have been desilted—620.17 km manually and 209.86 km mechanically. The minister informed it was proposed to conduct a work shop on nalas improvement and development, to prevent encroachments so that a good environment conditions prevails and a liveable city for citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/race-against-time-to-desilt-nalas/articleshow/83445375.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC warns of tough action in case of ‘any more collapses’||MUMBAI: Observing that human lives are not cheap, Bombay high court on Friday directed a judicial inquiry to be held into the building collapse at Malwani, Malad (west), in which 12 people died including “eight innocent children”. The high court (HC) appointed former HC judge, justice (retired) J P Deodhar as commissioner of inquiry, and has sought a preliminary report from him on June 24. “Let us tell all [municipal] corporations. Any future incident of building collapse and loss of lives, we’ll come down heavily,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni warned. The judges said despite HC initiating suo motu PIL after the September 2020 Bhiwandi building collapse that took 38 lives, and several orders were passed, no positive action was taken by civic authorities to avert future building collapses. The judges noted that from May 15 to June 10 there were four incidents — the last two in Mumbai. “What is happening? How many lives will be lost?” the CJ asked. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, for BMC, said the Malad building was on collector’s land and it is the authority to take action on its land, as per a government resolution (GR). Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the GR does not curb the power of BMC to take action against illegal structures. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said 50-75 % structures on collector’s land in Malwani are unauthorised. The judges lamented the failure on planning aspects, saying people’s lives are being played with. “What impression is given to the entire country that this is happening in Bombay (sic) and adjoining areas! How many collapses have you seen in the entire country?” asked justice Kulkarni. The judges said it is for the BMC commissioner to bring accountability. “We are pained at this... This pain should also be felt by corporators and those manning wards. This is a man-made disaster. Every monsoon this has to happen,” said justice Kulkarni. The judges also said while they were thinking of Covid wards for children, “this collapse has taken the lives of eight children”. The terms of reference of the inquiry include whether the owner/ person responsible for construction of the building obtained a sanctioned plan from appropriate authority before constructing, and if action was taken for violations. Also, on whom can responsibility be fixed, who were statutorily responsible, to keep vigil and supervision of illegal structures in the area and “how many other buildings/structures in the area are illegal/unauthorised.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-warns-of-tough-action-in-case-of-any-more-collapses/articleshow/83445389.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 407 unsafe, shaky buildings identified for demolition||MUMBAI: Evicting residents from the over 400 unsafe and dilapidated buildings has become a major challenge for the BMC. In this year’s pre-monsoon survey, the BMC had identified 407 dilapidated buildings and listed them in the C1 category—it means they are unsafe for occupation and have to be pulled down. While 322 of these ‘dangerous’ structures are privately owned, 59 are BMC-owned and the remaining 26 belong to the state government. Illegal structures, including the building that crashed in Malwani’s New Collector Compound late on Wednesday, are not part of this list, said civic officials. Times ViewThe issue of dangerous and dilapidated buildings has been plaguing the city for several years now. Every year, these buildings crash and several lives are lost. Regardless of who owns the buildings, the BMC must step up to vacate and get these buildings demolished. The state government must issue fresh, clear orders fixing the responsibility of razing these buildings. If there is any litigation, then the BMC must work to get stay orders vacated.H-West ward, that covers Bandra, Khar and Santacruz west, has the maximum numb-er of dilapidated buildings (49), followed by N Ward (47), that covers Bhandup and Nahur. BMC officials said they have razed close to 150 unsafe and shaky buildings and cut electric and water supply in 112 structures. “But the demolition of 73 dilapidated buildings is pending as the residents have moved court. The structural audit reports of 18 other buildings have been sent to the technical advisory committee (TAC),” said a civic official, adding that 107 structures have been vacated and will soon be pulled down. “We are razing buildings that are not facing litigation or are awaiting TAC report. In cases where residents don’t cooperate after sending eviction notices, we have cut off their electricity and water supply. We will review the status of the pending cases and carry out the demolition by following due process of law,” said deputy municipal commissioner Sanjog Kabre. According to BMC rules, residents living in buildings that are over 30 years old have to carry out the structural audit. Those found to be in the C1 category and can’t be repaired have to be vacated. “However, after receiving BMC notices, many residents move court or appeal before the TAC to get the structural audit reports vetted,” said another civic official. “On many occasions, the BMC takes an undertaking from residents that they are living in the dilapidated building at their own risk and cost,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-407-unsafe-shaky-bldgs-identified-for-demolition/articleshow/83445484.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

A bench of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili gave this direction while hearing a contempt case filed by Mohammed Mahmooduddin Farooqi who has been fighting to get a job on compassionate grounds after his father died while serving the state as a school headmaster in 2002. The authorities initially cited underage as a reason but later sat on the representation that sought an exemption from this. They are yet to take a call even though Farooqi became a major long ago. The argument of the state counsel that the file is moving now did not go well with the court. The argument that Janardhan Reddy who held the school education secretary position earlier was not present and that he was made TSPSC chairman recently was not accepted by the bench. “He has to come to court to explain his past failures,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-summons-tspsc-chief-school-edu-secy/articleshow/83445409.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Pune||Maharashtra SSC: Std V marks count for external pupils||PUNE: Students appearing for the SSC exam privately this year can pass with the marks they had scored in Std V. A majority of these students fill Form 17 as they are dropouts and are given a chance to complete SSC by taking the exam externally. Since the state government has decided to evaluate students with 50% marks from Std IX and remaining 50% from the current academic year, the issue of the std IX marks for external students was raised. The state board has decided to tabulate the marks that these students have scored in the most recent exam given which could be from Std V to VIII, whichever is most recent. The marks scored in their most recent exams will have to converted to 80% and the remaining 20 marks will be awarded based on the oral and practical exams that the schools will conduct for these external students, the officials said. Experts and educators pointed out that students would have appeared for an exam many years ago and that there was no comparison between the marks scored in Std V and Std IX. Secretary of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Ashok Bhosale said, “The external students usually enrol for the SSC exam with the nearest school affiliated to the state board. The school incorporates the names of Form 17 students in the final list of SSC students that is sent to the board. However, their marks for Std IX are not available as a majority of them drop out much earlier. For students who have appeared through regular schools in Std IX and decided to appear for SSC through Form 17, the Std IX marks need to be converted to 80 % from the Saral system.” School principal of Indutai Pawar English medium school Latika Mane said, “A large number of students study at night, or are workers. The new rule is helpful.

Today, more than one in three students is enrolled in a private institute in an undergraduate programme in India; four years ago, it was one in five. The ratio tilts further in favour of private institutes as affiliating state universities have unaided constituent colleges which are largely private; similarly, the private professional education space is much larger at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Enrolment numbers in private institutes are increasing at the post-graduate and PhD level too. While some educationists lament the demise of public education, private edu-conglomerates keep growing, and in the process, pose a dilemma to parents: Should they trust a long-standing public institution to educate their children, or opt for a new-fangled fancy campuses? Former AICTE chairman S S Mantha said, “If you look at the top 50 or 100 private universities of India, they are innovating, experimenting, offering choice-based credit programmes and placing students in jobs. They have strong governance structures, their academic schedules are aligned to the calendars of foreign universities and industry placements. In case of public universities, admissions get delayed, and many a time, results are not declared in time. Often, students in public universities become one year junior to their own batch because of the delay in conducting exams or declaring results.” Mantha added that curricula not being updated, faculty positions lying vacant, and placements not taking place in public universities were other vexing issues. The All Indian Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) report states: “Enrolment in professional courses is more in private institutions than in government both at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The share of enrolment in professional courses is higher at post-graduate level than at undergraduate level; in private institutions, the share is much higher.” Executive director of PanIIT Alumni Reach for India Foundation, Kalyan Chakravarthy, said the government must realise that education is the real “jan dhan”. “Public higher education has not grown at the same pace as the population, and private players are growing faster. Education is a public good and the government has to stay involved and invested; it must increase capacity; quality and affordability has to be the mantra.” While there has been capacity increase in IITs, IIMs and AIIMS, new central and state universities offering other UG programmes should also grow hand in hand. “The next frontier in global leadership is of intellectual property and India, with its huge talent pool, must become a global leader in this through adequate investments in education and research in all emerging fields,” added Chakravarthy. Vidya Yeravdekar, pro-chancellor, Symbiosis International (deemed) University, felt that there was more accountability toward students in private institutions. “Despite higher fees, students are preferring the private sector as there is a definite return on investment,” she said. Private universities are also offering more professional, market-driven courses instead of the regular BA, BCom ones, and students see value for money, she added. Better campuses, better infrastructure, more international collaborations and a multi-cultural environment is a big draw for students and together they contribute to the growth in enrolment, said Yeravdekar. In the last two decades, a lot of private universities have come up in the country and most of them offer newer, innovative, market-driven undergraduate courses, which see more enrolment, said former Mumbai University vice-chancellor, Rajan Welukar. On the contrary, 20% of the total public universities offer only postgraduate programmes where enrolment is relatively low, he said. Private universities offer more flexibility, have robust student support services and therefore, students who can afford will prefer it over public universities, he added. “These new breed of universities also have good marketing departments, which helps in better collaborations with industry and international universities, whereas public universities are yet to pick up. They are faster in making decisions compared to public universities. Lack of Digitalisation and poor student support system also are drawbacks in the public education system,” said Welukar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/higher-edu-enrolment-at-pvt-univs-paces-as-public-varsities-fail-to-catch-up/articleshow/83447094.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The perpetrator, who was demanding the beheaded picture of Pandey’s uncle as a ransom, was also upset, claiming the man had raped his mother six years ago and also got him injured in an accident. Pandey, whose body was found in the early hours of Friday, was killed even as family and friends kept on negotiating with the abductor with a false hope. During one of the talks, Pandey was heard howling in the recorded audio clip, pleading to his mother Geeta and others to get him released while shuddering. After failing to convince Sahu, family and friends rushed to seek police help but by then, it was too late. Cops claimed that Sahu kept on negotiating by concealing the murder. City police chief Amitesh Kumar and different units of Nagpur police were engaged in searching for the abductor until he was nabbed at Borkhedi by a team of Sonegaon police. Family and police sources said separation from the woman prompted Sahu to plot the murder. Incidentally, it was victim Pandey through whom Sahu sent messages to his lady love, said a family member. Pandey was the girl’s cousin brother. The family, apart from objecting to Sahu’s relationship, had also decided to send the girl away. Sources claimed that the Pandeys had also confronted Sahu regarding the issue. Sahu abducted Pandey, a cricket lover, by luring him to play in a cricket tournament with a cash prize of Rs 50,000. Pandey, the second of the three siblings, was a student of standard VII. He was also popular in the neighbourhood as a singer. Pandey’s friend told TOI that he could speak to the boy till 7.11pm after which the cellphone was switched off. “Pandey first said he was purchasing a cricket ball and then Sahu stated that he was filling fuel in his bike. We were baffled as Pandey said he was in a forest and behind Sahu’s college and some stadium,” he said. Though Sahu’s accident was confirmed, there was a question mark over the rape allegations as the police could not find any evidence. Even Sahu’s family members sounded clueless. Police said Sahu, who made around a dozen calls to the Pandeys after the abduction, also derived sadistic pleasure while describing how he was torturing the teenager by gagging him and hanging him from the tree and leaving him gasping for breath. Even after murdering Pandey, Sahu kept demanding the beheaded picture of the teen’s uncle until he was nabbed near Borkhedi by a patrolling police team when he was heading towards a petrol pump by dragging his bike. It’s learnt that Sahu made a call to Pandey around 5pm, luring him to join the other boys from the neighbourhood for a cricket tournament. Pandey’s grandfather rued purchasing a cricket gear for the victim. He had also gifted his grandson a cellphone which turned out to be one of the reasons for his death. MIDC police, after registering a case of kidnapping and murder, also produced Sahu before the court which remanded him in custody till June 14.

---||Chandigarh||Man booked for sacrilege of bir in Haryana village||Kaithal: Police on Friday booked a man on charges of hurting religious sentiments allegedly for desecrating the Bir of Sri Guru Granth Sahib at a gurdwara in Paharpur village of Kaithal district. The accused has been identified as Mukhtiara Ram of Paharpur village. CCTV camera footage shows the accused entering the gurdwara carrying a stick and with shoes on. He lifts the sword kept in front of the palanquin of Sri Guru Granth Sahib and puts it back. The accused then moves inside and throws the ‘Chaur Sahib’ (whisk waved over the Guru) away, uncovering the Bir. He commits the sacrilege and immediately goes out of the gurdwara, closing the door. Officials of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee’s (SGPC) Haryana Sikh Mission reached the spot to ascertain the situation and lodged a police complaint against the accused. A case has been registered against Mukhtiara Ram under Section 295-A (Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Siwan police station on the complaint of Satnam Singh, on Friday. “At about 9.45am on Thursday, Mukhtiara Ram entered the gurdwara with his shoes and tore one ang (limb) of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. This has hurt our sentiments,” said Satnam Singh to the police. SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur took stern notice of the incident. “The police administration should take strict action to interrogate the accused so that forces behind the incident could be identified. Incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib Ji were continuously happening in the country and it was unfortunate that despite the arrest of the culprits, no concrete action was taken against them,” she said. Meanwhile, SGPC’s Haryana Sikh Mission in-charge Mangpreet Singh said, “A team led by SGPC pracharak Bhai Navneet Singh was sent to the spot at Paharpur village, which has sent its report. The holy Bir will be kept at Paharpur village till investigation is ongoing.” Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (HSGMC) president Baljit Singh Daduwal alleged that the accused, Mukhtiara Ram and his family are followers of Dera Sacha Sauda, headed by rape and murder convict Gurmit Ram Rahim and demanded addition of Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC in this case. Daduwal said, “HSGMC secretary Sarabjit Singh and member Bibi Baljinder Kaur Khalsa from Kaithal visited the spot at Paharpur village. Accused Mukhtiara Ram and his entire family are followers of Dera Sacha Sauda, Sirsa and he committed the sacrilege after entering the gurdwara with shoes. We demand addition of 120-B of the IPC to investigate the conspiracy behind this incident. Accused has been asked to commit such an act and main culprits should be brought to light.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/man-booked-for-sacrilege-of-bir-in-haryana-village/articleshow/83445408.cms||JK Singh

An analysis of the data collated from the state health department and one of the most polluted cities, Dhanbad, seems to cement this link, though no comprehensive study on the subject has been done so far. The experts now vouched for a scientific study to establish this link and safeguard the people. In Jharkhand, Dhanbad is the only district which has a real-time AQI monitor and was ranked among the most polluted cities of the country in January 2020 in the PM10 category. Dhanbad has also the highest Covid-19 mortality rate of 2.33% against the state's overall 1.4%. As of Thursday, 337 people have succumbed to the viral infection in the district which has a total of 16,149 infected cases. During the deadly second wave of the pandemic which arguably started on April 1 in the state, Dhanbad was among the worst affected with the mortality rate registered at 3.17% or 258 out of 8,115 infected patients died. In the first wave, the mortality rate was 1.47%, only second to East Singhbhum which recorded a 1.87% mortality rate. Ranchi, which also has a mortality rate of 1.85%, is also a highly polluted city. Commenting on the analysis, the director-general of Delhi-based public interest research and advocacy group, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Sunita Narayan, said, "Studies have shown that there is certainly a link between pollution level and the Covid-19 mortality rate as the virus affected the lungs, which are already compromised among people living in polluted areas." The CSE has done extensive study over the impact of pollution in different states of the country and pointed out that Jharkhand does not have real-time AQI data for most of its major industrial and mining districts. Environment activist and Jamshedpur (East) Saryu Rai has also been raising demand for the installation of real-time air quality monitors. “Jamshedpur is an industrial town but there is no device to monitor the air pollution. I have taken up the matter with the state government several times but to no avail,” he said. Currently, East Singhbhum ranks second in the Covid mortality rate at 2.01%. During the second wave, the Covid mortality rate was as high as 2.10%. President of the Jharkhand chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr Arun Kumar Singh, said a large number of people in Dhanbad are also found to be suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and the health condition of such people are grim when they are infected by Covid. Dr Singh, who happens to be from Dhanbad, said, "Apart from industrial pollution, all other types of pollutants from mining are hazardous for the lungs and Dhaband falls in the category of highly polluted areas because of mining." He admitted that the high Covid mortality rate of the district has links to pollution for a long time. Experts pointed out in industrial and vehicular pollution, the air has more of PM 2.5 polluting components while a comparatively bigger particulate matter, PM10, are higher in places where there is pollution from mining. PM10 is known to affect the lungs and bronchi, leading to asthma. Professor of pulmonary medicine at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Dr Brajesh Mishra, said the lungs of people living in areas polluted by industries and mining are mostly affected. “Usually, their lungs are compromised even at the sub-clinical stage and when they are attacked by the Covid virus, chances of the lungs' recovery reduce,” he said. Dr Mishra highlighted that the instances of COPD are more in mining districts of the state. “Though we don’t have the data or research to prove the correlation between pollution and Covid’s impact on lungs, both are known to damage lungs. So, the presence of one factor is liable to worsen the impact of the other,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/experts-spy-link-between-cov-deaths-and-air-pollution/articleshow/83455723.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: High fuel prices make Amreli farmers park tractor, bring out the bullocks||RAJKOT: Haresh Buhahad been cultivating his 80 bigha farmland with a tractor for nearly two decades now. This farmer of Savarkundla in Amreli district had packed off the traditional plough and hoe before shifting to the mechanical wheels around 15 years ago. But soaring diesel prices have applied brakes on Buha’s tractor forcing the tiller to retrace his steps to the conventional ploughing equipment. “Tractor has become unviable now. I need 3 litres of diesel per hour to use the tractor and for an average five hours daily, I have to spend around Rs 465 at the current rate of diesel. On the other hand, I spend only Rs 60 per day for the bullock,” Buha stated. Farmers turn to tractor for speed of work. The amount of work the machine can finish within five to six hours, it requires the animal two and half days to complete. The current price of diesel per litre is around Rs 93. Farmers across Saurashtra including Junagadh, Jamnagar, Dwarka, and Rajkot have turned to traditional farming methods. They allege that high diesel prices have pushed tillers a decade back in farming techniques amid the peak season of sowing Kharif crop. Buha is sowing groundnut and cotton. One among the group of nearly 10-odd Amreli farmers who have replaced their tractors with bullocks, Sailesh Kanani said, “The price of one bullock is around Rs 8,000 to 10,000. We turned to tractors for the cost effectiveness but now it’s proving to be a white elephant for us.” In one season, a farmer uses his tractor 20 times for sowing, weeding, sprinkling pesticides, and harvesting besides transporting labourers, seeds and equipment to the farmland. Pravin Patodiya of Sardharpur village in Jetpur taluka of Rajkot district had brought his tractor a decade ago to reduce farming input cost as well as to save time. Today, he is back on the traditional plough. “I need 200 litres of diesel for my tractor in one season. At the present rate of fuel, it’s better to pack up my tractor,” Patodiya said. “It’s a double whammy for us,” alleged Keshubhai Odedara, another tiller from Porbandar district who has returned to the original plough. “Traders who buy our produce also calculates transportation cost and now, he will pay less looking at the high diesel prices. The state and central governments have imposed high tax on fuel. If the government brings this commodity under GST, it will solve the problem,” Patodiya added. Chairman of Gujarat Kisan Congress, Pal Ambaliya said, “In 2014, diesel price was Rs 57.71 per litre. When the NDA government came into power, they promised to double farmers’ income and price of diesel was to be slashed to Rs 35. While price of crude has reduced in the international market, diesel is skyrocketing in the domestic market. We have demanded to waive taxes on diesel for agriculture use.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/high-fuel-prices-make-amreli-farmers-park-tractor-bring-out-the-bullocks/articleshow/83445049.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Ranchi||Honorariums of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research scientists put on hold after graft charge||SINDRI: The directorate of technology management of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has directed all the directors and heads of different CSIR laboratories to put distribution of honorarium among staff under any project on hold with immediate effect. This development came after an RTI activist and BJP leader Ramesh Rahi raised objections over honorarium worth crores of rupees being paid to the scientists working in Dhanbad-based Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR) over and above the salary they are entitled to. Complying with the directives, the management of CIMFR has asked all the scientists receiving the honorarium to refund it with immediate effect. According to reports, CIMFR has distributed Rs 17.89 crore as honorarium to the scientists providing technical services and consultancy on different projects from 2016 to 2021. Rahi has alleged that a lion’s share of the honorarium has been cornered by the institute director himself and a group of scientists close to him. The BJP leader in his complaint sent to the ministry of science and technology and the PMO has raised questions over the distribution of honorarium to scientists for providing consultancy services saying that they are being paid salary and other perks for the same job and has demanded a high-level inquiry into the alleged financial irregularity. When contacted, CIMFR director P K Singh refuted the allegation of any financial irregularity and said that the honorarium was paid to 553 scientists of the institute rendering their services to different projects as per the 2017 guidelines of the CSIR and the practice of paying technological royalty is prevalent all over the nation including in different IITs and IISc since long. “Since the CSIR is revising its guidelines which are to be notified shortly, we have been directed to put honorariums on hold. Ths is being blown out of proportion by some dissatisfied elements,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/honorariums-of-cimfr-scientists-put-on-hold-after-graft-charge/articleshow/83443724.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Greens rejoice, developers worry over new tree felling rules||NAGPUR: The state’s latest amendments in the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975, have brought cheers to environmentalists who feel that the new changes will help in conserving green cover and curb illegal tree felling. However, those in the construction and infrastructural development sector have raised concerns over various projects that are likely to be affected. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials stated that there was still no clarity on certain issues. With the amendments, the state has decided to accord ‘heritage’ status to more than 50-year-old trees. In case they have to be felled, then the number of saplings to be planted would correspond to the age of the tree. “Declaring trees as heritage is a move which has missed its deadline. Nevertheless, at least it has now got its rightful respect,” said environment activist Jaydeep Das. The new rules further state that for compensatory plantations, the number of trees that need to be planted should be equal to estimated age of the tree that is to be felled. Moreover, the plantations should be of at least six-to-eight feet in height and their survival has to be maintained for seven years along with geo-tagging. On this, Das said, “Thankfully, no one will now boast of planting 2-3 feet saplings in lieu of felling a 100-year-old tree as an achievement. Same rule is applied even for translocation,” he said. Welcoming the amendments, activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani said, “The maintenance of compensatory plantations should be under stricter control. There should be stricter punishment when they die beyond a ratio. Normally, survival rate of compensatory plantations would get forgotten after they were planted. It would just be done for the sake of statuary requirement.” The amendments will now be tabled in front of the legislative assembly for its approval, informed lawyer and activist Ankita Shah. “Amendments are undoubtedly good but the question is about its serious implementation. Also, who will do vigilance of the plantations?” she said. Founder of NGO Green Vigil Kaustav Chatterjee raised similar concerns. “The amendments are revolutionary and are highly appreciated, but they will be very difficult to implement. As it is compensatory plantation at ratio 1:5 is not being implemented, hardly anyone is coming back to the civic body to get back deposited amount against tree felling. Thus, expecting that common man will follow 1:50 ratio for a 50-year-old tree is highly optimistic. Area availability will also be challenge,” he said. On a positive note, Chatterjee added that the responsibility of Tree Authority has been redefined as along with giving permission for felling of trees, it now extends to ensuring plantation, survival and ensuring 33% plantation in urban areas. Those in the real estate sector have their apprehensions too. “Any move by the government to improve the forest cover and conservation of old trees is a welcome step, however, we need to understand that the norms shouldn’t be too complex to follow. Likewise, it should not delay the procedure, as with such lengthy requirements, chances of increment in delay and corruption cannot be ruled out,” said Tejinder Singh Renu, secretary of the Vidarbha Taxpayers’ Association (VTA). On whether the new rules will affect the proposed Inter-modal Station (IMS) at Ajni, NHAI project director Abhijeet Jichkar said, “Any amendments will come into retrospective effect from the date of gazette notification, which is not issued yet. Secondly, we have applied for tree felling with the NMC much before the state cabinet took a decision on Thursday.” Another project director NL Yeotkar also said that things are not clear yet. “I don’t think there will be a huge impact as NHAI mostly works outside urban limits. Yet, we are taking up transplantation and Miyawaki plantations wherever necessary, as proposed in the amendment.” A NHAI project director from the region, who did not want to be named, said, “While widening highways there are huge trees like neem, pipal, and banyan on the roadside. If these species of trees come under the jurisdiction of any municipal council and are declared as heritage trees, then road widening will be affected.” The official further pointed out, “Felling over 200 trees of 5 years age for road widening projects will now need an MSTA nod. If MSTA allows, local authorities will have the power to reconsider the decision. This will unnecessarily delay the projects.” Gaurav Aggarwala, secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers of India, Nagpur unit, said, “The decision to plant new saplings equal to the age of the tree is a great idea. This will help in betterment of the environment as on an average around 20-25% new saplings survive and become trees in the future.” HOW CHANGES WILL AFFECT... 1. IMS at Ajni Norm | For felling of more than 200 trees of age 5 years or more, case to be referred to Maharashtra State Tree Authority - In Ajni, over 4,000 trees are proposed to be felled for construction of IMS phase-1 Norm | Project should not be sub-divided into smaller parts to keep number of trees below the defined threshold - Internal presentation of NHAI reveals project to be carried out in 4 phases. It has not been made public yet. Activists say over 40,000 trees will be cut Norm | Alternate project design should be considered to ensure minimum felling of trees - Activists say alternate sites like Khapri were not explored Norm | A tree with an estimated age of 50 years or more to be declared as heritage tree - Most of the trees at Ajni are decades-old, were planted by the British 2. NHAI projects Norm | Number for compensatory plantation decided on basis of age of tree to be felled - There are huge age-old trees like neem, pipal, and banyan on the roadside that are to be felled for road widening Norm | If Tree Authortity allows, local authorities will have the power to reconsider nod for tree felling - Work might be delayed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-rejoice-developers-worry-over-new-tree-felling-rules/articleshow/83445457.cms||Manka Behl

Professor of pulmonary medicine at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims), Dr Brajesh Mishra, said the lungs of people living in areas polluted by industries and mining are mostly affected. “Usually, their lungs are compromised even at the sub-clinical stage and when they are attacked by the Covid virus, chances of the lungs' recovery reduce,” he said. Dr Mishra highlighted that the instances of COPD are more in mining districts of the state. “Though we don’t have the data or research to prove the correlation between pollution and Covid’s impact on lungs, both are known to damage lungs. So, the presence of one factor is liable to worsen the impact of the other,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/experts-spy-link-between-cov-deaths-and-air-pollution/articleshow/83443823.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Tirkey's mother Padmavati Oraon and father Devanand Tirkey met Soren around 1 pm. The meeting was facilitated by Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey. “Rupa's parents are of the view that she was killed. They were unhappy with the course of police investigation and wanted an impartial inquiry into her death by the CBI," Tirkey told TOI after the 90-minute meeting. Devanand showed video clips and photographs of her daughter's corpse to the CM, which he was carrying in a laptop. "The CM was not briefed thoroughly about the case by the cops and he was surprised to know many details," a member of the 11-member strong delegation which met Soren said on anonymity. “Rupa was like my sister. I assure you that an impartial inquiry will happen and the guilty will be brought to book,” Soren told Rupa's parents. Soren, however, talked the parents out of their demand for a CBI probe by stating that an independent inquiry committee, comprising a retired Jharkhand High Court judge, was constituted two days ago to probe the incident. Rupa, a 2018 Jharkhand Police Service batch officer, was found hanging in her quarters in Sahibganj on the night of May 4. Though prima facie it appeared as suicide, no suicide note was found from her lodgings. Padmavati had alleged foul play in her daughter's death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/deceased-asis-parents-meet-hemant-demand-cbi-probe/articleshow/83443800.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The rape survivor is a student of Class VI. Special Pocso-cum-additional district judge-1 Janardan Singh held the accused, Biswanath Bhuiya (26), guilty under Section 6 of the POCSO Act (committing aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and sentenced him to 30 years’ RI. The judge also slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on Bhuiya. "The case was filed by the girl’s father with the Bermo women’s police station on December 18 last year,” special public prosecutor S K Jha said. Jha said the crime took place at 2.30 pm on December 18 in Dhori forest where the girl had gone to collect firewood along with the wife of the accused. They were separately picking firewood when Bhuiya came and grabbed the girl. She resisted, but he overpowered and raped her there. He also threatened to kill her if she tells anyone about the incident. After returning home, the girl narrated her ordeal to her mother and when her father returned home from work in the evening, they went to the women's police station and lodged a complaint against Bhuiya.

Sources said the governor is likely to approve the names in a couple of days. The seats fell vacant following retirements of TDP’s TD Janardhan, Bida Ravichandra, G Samanthakamani and G Srinivasulu on Friday. SC, BC, Kapu and Reddy communities have been represented in the list. Koyye Moshen Raju worked as West Godavari party president. Although Moshen Raju expected to get the berth in SC quota in the first year of Jagan becoming chief minister, it went to another Dalit leader and former Amalapuram MP, Pandula Ravindra Babu, who joined party just before the last elections. YSRC general secretary (party office affairs) Lella Appireddy has been with Jagan since the launch of the party. He lost in 2014 from Guntur West and was denied ticket in 2019. Appireddy had served as district Youth Congress president and a PCC secretary. He was considered close to former chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy as the latter appointed him as agriculture market yard chairman. Thota Trimurthulu, a controversial Kapu leader from East Godavari, joined the party after YSRC formed the government. Despite objections from Dalit and BC leaders, Jagan rewarded him since he has strong following among Kapus. Ramesh Yadav had only aspired to become municipal chairperson of Proddutur in Kadapa district. With the party selecting B Lakshmidevi from weavers’ community, Yadav is now set for legislative council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-picks-4-names-for-legislative-council/articleshow/83441442.cms||Samdani MN

Although the chief minister had immediately tweeted to claim that vaccine wastage in Jharkhand was under 4.65%, the health department failed to come up with data to support the CM’s claim. Even on Friday there was no district-wise data available with the state health department to back their claim of 2.68% wastage data. Talking to TOI, the officer on special duty to state health department, Siddhartha Tripathi, said: “A total of 57,15,600 doses have been received by state health department; of which 47,32,426 doses have been administered to beneficiaries and a total of 1,53,494 doses have gone waste, which amounts to around 2.68% of the total doses.” The Centre had said that Jharkhand was one of the states with higher wastage percentage. On May 26, the Union government in its report had accused the state of wasting 37.3% doses which was immediately countered by chief minister Hemant Soren and state health minister Banna Gupta. However, when the state health department was asked to present the data, they couldn’t do it citing effect of cyclone Yaas. Although the state is yet to produce district-wise wastage figures, TOI accessed a report prepared by the districts in which Koderma and Gumla have shown negative wastage of 33.1 % and 19%. Total vaccine doses allotted to Koderma till June 9 was 1,15,300 units out of which 33,710 doses are left unutilised but instead of administering 81,590 the district has jabbed 1,08,611 persons indicating that 33.1% additional people got the shots in comparison to doses utilized. Similarly in Gumla, as against 1,78,300 doses allocated till June 9, as many as 55,120 doses are left. But instead of inoculating 1,23,180 persons, as many as 1,47,026 persons have received the jab. On being asked about this, Tripathi said: “It was due to the mistake of data entry operators who were punching the data at the ground level. We, too, were surprised with those figures but after we got it checked it was found that the entries were wrong. In our meeting with the Union health ministry on Thursday, we had requested them to allow us to make the necessary changes in the portal. Once we were provided the access to correct the wrong entries we collected the cumulative figures first and now sharing them with the media. We are correcting all such mistakes and once it is finalised we will share it again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-refutes-centres-claims-projects-vax-wastage-at-2-68/articleshow/83445790.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The villagers said they got the inspiration to strive hard and keep the virus out of their locality after listening to the appeal of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Maan Ki Baat’ over the radio to follow the safety protocols. Over the course of the next 15 months, Jharkhand and the entire country faced two deadly waves of the pandemic. However, the village, with its 30,000 inhabitants did not report a single Covid-19 case. Located on the foothills of Bamanway about eight kilometres from here, the hamlet is now setting an example in vaccination with most of its eligible population having taken their jabs so far. “Not only did Bocho not report a single Covid-19 infection through the entire pandemic, nearly all of its adult population has taken their vaccines,” Sadar block development officer Amitabh Bhagat told TOI. At a time when vaccine hesitancy is very high among Jharkhand’s rural population, Bocho’s success story serves as an inspiration. “Everyone in our hamlet observed social distancing and hand hygiene protocols diligently. Youngsters of the hamlet initiated door-to-door campaigns to create awareness in every household about Covid-19 guidelines and their importance,” Nidhi Kumari, a national-level basketball player who represented Jharkhand in the sub-junior national championships in Punjab last year said. Shankar Prasad, a farmer, said: “No officer or any one from the district administration set a foot in our village to create awareness. The locals did it themselves.” Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, the civil surgeon of Hazaribag, said: “As per our records, nearly 80% of all the eligible beneficiaries in Bocho village have got themselves vaccinated. Health camps and vaccination camps have always been well received by Bocho’s people and our health workers received cooperation from the people.” Notably, the locals of Bocho had resorted to agitation almost a decade ago to stop illegal stone quarrying at the foothills of Bamanway and were successful in repelling the illegal stone mafias from the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hbag-village-takes-pms-advice-keeps-virus-at-bay/articleshow/83445766.cms||Abhijit Sen

On Friday, the seven-day rolling average of daily cases fell below 1 lakh after 67 days to 95,101, which is marginally less than one-fourth of the 3.9 lakh count reached at the height of the wave on May 8. While the rise in cases during the second wave was extremely sharp, the fall so far has been equally fast. It took just 34 days for the seven-day average of cases to fall to a fourth of the peak, three times faster than the decline seen during the first wave of the pandemic. Deaths too have fallen to less than half of the peak count. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths dropped below 2,000 on Thursday and had fallen further to 1,920 by Friday. The peak toll was 4,040 recorded on May 16. On Friday, India recorded less than 85,000 fresh cases (with Jharkhand numbers yet to come in), the lowest daily case count in 71 days since April 1. The day’s death toll stood at 1,781. Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of fresh cases at 15,759on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-indias-2nd-wave-falls-to-one-fourth-of-peak/articleshow/83450914.cms||---

The accused were identified as Vinukonda Subba Rao and Siva Parvati, both residents of Shardanagar Colony in Guntur. According to Gudur police, the duo approached a woman claiming that someone had performed ‘black magic’ on her and they can conduct a cleansing ritual to cure her problems. Believing their claim, the woman allowed them into her home. At her home, the duo made the woman sit half-naked and worship with her eyes closed. During which time they clicked pictures and shot videos of her. They then blackmailed her for money and threatened to release the pictures on social media. The family submitted to the duo and gave them money, phones and gold. However, subsequently the family approached Gudur police. Cops then formed a team and traced the accused to Guntur and arrested them. Both accused were produced before a local court and sent to judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/two-arrested-for-blackmailing-woman-family/articleshow/83441450.cms||---

The well was found close to the King’s place atop Kondaveedu hill. It is 100ft in length and 25ft width. Kondaveedu Development Society convenor and historian Kalli Sivareddy said they found the new well while taking up developmental works on the hill top. “It was a new historical finding on the fort hill. The deep well was not similar to the wells dug in the region,” said Sivareddy. He said that deep well had the staircase to go down to the well to take water. He said that wells dug in the region would not have such a facility. He said that such deep wells were found in Amalapuram region and also called as Amalapuram Reddy wells. He, however, said that archaeologists observed that the deep well found at Kondaveedu might have been a work of either Reddy kings or Nizams who took over the reign after the fall of Reddy rulers. He said the front portion had a width of 15ft and backside was dug with 25ft width. He said that the staircase was dug in four portions with a depth of 35ft. He said that the deep well as located 200 meters away from the King’s place on the fort. “The well might have been a source of water for palace or the huge number of elephants owned by Reddy kings,” said Sivareddy. He said that Reddy rulers dug hundreds of wells on the fort to meet drinking water needs of the personnel on the hill top and also animals. He said that deep well was suitable to feed water to elephants and horses. Sivareddy appealed to the archaeology department to take up intensive search on the fort hill to unearth such valuable historical structures and preserve them for the future generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/14th-century-deep-well-found-at-kondaveedu-fort/articleshow/83441478.cms||Samdani MN

Paul also said that Bharat Biotech is expected to publish Phase 3 clinical trials data in about 7-8 days. “It (US FDA’s decision) has no impact whatsoever on our programme. "Our regulator has approved it. We have so much data on safety, we have so much data from Phase 3 that has been screened, seen by our own regulator,” he said. Dr Paul, who heads the expert group in vaccine administration, said the Phase 3 data to be published is beyond what has been shared so far with the DCGI (Drugs Controller General of India) based on which BB received the licensure. He said every regulator has its own mechanism and the nuances of scientific considerations may differ. “Every country has a regulatory system and some things might be common, others may differ. They (US FDA) have their own parameters and we respect that. Similarly, our regulatory system also takes decisions. Scientific framework is same, but nuancing is according to context,” Dr Paul said. “Scientific considerations are there… some differences may be there, especially in those countries where science is strong and for us manufacturing is strong. So, they have taken this decision and we respect it. We expect that our manufacturer will be able to comply with it by doing whatever needs to be done (to fulfil licence conditions),” he said. The FDA’s call will delay the launch of Covaxin in the US as the regulator has “recommended” Ocugen Inc, the US partner of the Indian vaccine-maker, to go for Biologics Licence Application route with additional data. While Covaxin is yet to be recognised by the WHO, the government said there has been a slight delay in it but the process is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/us-covaxin-move-wont-hit-our-vax-drive/articleshow/83450936.cms||Sushmi Dey
