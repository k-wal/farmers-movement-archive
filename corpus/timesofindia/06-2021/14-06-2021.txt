---||World||Israel's Lapid: From TV anchor to coalition architect||JERUSALEM: Yair Lapid, the architect of an improbable coalition that unseated Israel's longest-ruling prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, is a former opposition leader and television anchor. When Lapid founded his centrist Yesh Atid (There is a Future) party in 2012, some dismissed him as the latest in a series of media stars seeking to transform his celebrity status into political success. But his fiercely secularist party finished second with 17 seats in March elections, Israel's fourth inconclusive national vote in less than two years. He was mandated last month to form a government after the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, failed in his own efforts to build a post-election coalition. And after pulling off what many had thought was impossible -- cobbling together a coalition of bitter ideological rivals, ranging from right-wing religious nationalists to conservative Muslim Arab lawmakers -- Lapid's bloc was approved by the Knesset on Sunday. That achievement was all the more remarkable given recent intercommunal clashes between Jewish and Arab citizens, sparked by the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The coalition deal he brokered will now see Lapid assume the premiership only after a two-year stint at the top by his main coalition ally, nationalist hardliner Naftali Bennett. Despite having engineered the alliance, 57-year-old Lapid will initially serve as foreign minister. A former news anchor known for his chiselled good looks, Lapid is the Tel Aviv-born son of the fiercely secular former justice minister Yosef "Tommy" Lapid, another journalist who left the media to enter politics. His mother, Shulamit, is a novelist, playwright and poet. Lapid was a newspaper columnist who has also published a dozen books, and was a presenter on Channel 2 TV, a role that boosted his stardom. An amateur boxer and martial artist, he once featured on lists of Israel's most desirable men. Yesh Atid had claimed a surprising 19 seats in Israel's 120-member parliament back in 2013 polls, establishing it as a credible force in politics. The party joined the centrist Blue and White alliance formed in 2019 under the leadership of former military chief Benny Gantz. Blue and White then battled Netanyahu's right-wing Likud in three elections in less than a year. When Gantz decided last spring to enter a Netanyahu-led coalition, citing the need for unity as the coronavirus pandemic was gathering pace, Lapid bolted. He accused Gantz of breaching a fundamental promise Blue and White had made to its supporters: that it would fight to oust Netanyahu. In an interview with AFP in September, Lapid said Gantz had naively believed that Netanyahu would work collaboratively within the coalition. "I told (Gantz), 'I've worked with Netanyahu. Why don't you listen to the voice of experience... He is 71 years old. He is not going to change'," Lapid said. After exiting Blue and White, Lapid took his seat in parliament as the head of Yesh Atid and leader of the opposition. He described the short-lived Netanyahu-Gantz unity government as "a ridiculous coalition", in which cabinet ministers who disliked each other did not bother to communicate. He also predicted the coalition would collapse in December, which it did, amid bitter acrimony between Netanyahu and Gantz. Now, attention will turn to how far the even more unwieldy government engineered by Lapid can endure before ideological tensions boil to the surface. But it passed its first key test, gaining approval by the Knesset even after Netanyahu pulled out all the stops to try and thwart a successful confidence vote. And while he's the master behind the arrangement, Lapid has kept a low profile, presenting an even-keeled image of a man who aims to "unite" Israel. "The Israeli public deserves a functioning and responsible government which places the good of the country at the top of its agenda," he said in a statement prior to Sunday's parliamentary vote. "That's what this unity government has been formed to do."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israels-lapid-from-tv-anchor-to-coalition-architect/articleshow/83492957.cms||---

Invited to speak as the lead speaker in a session on ‘Open Societies’, Modi's references to cyber space can be read in the context of disinformation, commercial data theft and cyber attacks becoming a part of tactics employed by state actors. The leaders later adopted the ‘Open Societies Statement’ that hailed, among other things, freedom of expression, both online and offline, as a freedom that safeguards democracy and helps people live free from fear and oppression. “PM highlighted India’s civilisational commitment to democracy, freedom of thought and liberty. As the world’s largest democracy, India is a natural ally for the G7 and guest countries in defending these shared values from a host of threats stemming from authoritarianism, terrorism and violent extremism, disinformation and infodemics and economic coercion,” MEA’s additional secretary (economic relations) P Harish said at a press conference. Indian officials also said the G7 leaders underlined their commitment to a free, open and a rules-based Indo-Pacific and resolved to collaborate with partners in the region — another reference to the grouping’s intent to counter Chinese claims in the region.

Virtually addressing the G7 Summit, PM Modi highlighted India's civilisational commitment to democracy, freedom of thought and liberty. He said that India is a natural ally toHighlighting the non-democratic and unequal nature of global governance institutions, Modi called for reform of the multilateral system as the best signal of commitment to the cause of open societies. Senior MEA officials said after the summit that there was widespread support at the meetings for text-based negotiations on a proposal by India and South Africa for patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines. The waiver is expected to help countries like India ramp up vaccine production. Participating in another session on climate change, Modi highlighted that the planet's atmosphere, biodiversity and oceans could not be protected by countries acting in silos, and called for collective action on climate change. Speaking about India's unwavering commitment to climate action, he mentioned the commitment by Indian Railways to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. "He stressed that India is the only G20 country on track to meet its Paris commitments. He also took note of the increasing effectiveness of the two major global initiatives nurtured by India, ie the CDRI and the International Solar Alliance,” the government said, adding Modi also stressed that developing countries needed better access to climate finance, and called for a holistic approach towards climate change. Modi also called on the G7 to meet its unfulfilled promise of $100 billion annually in climate finance. “India has closely engaged with the UK G7 presidency, which is also holding simultaneously the co-presidency of the COP26 Summit, which will be held later this year to come up with ambitious targets for ourselves in the run-up to the COP26 meeting. Our achievements have been highlighted by the UK in the presidency statement they have released on the ‘Road to COP26’,” Harish said. Modi also highlighted the “revolutionary impact” of digital technologies on social inclusion and empowerment in India through applications such as Aadhaar, Direct Benefit Transfer and JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity. In his remarks, the PM underscored the vulnerabilities inherent in open societies and called on tech companies and social media platforms to ensure a safe cyber environment for their users, Harish said. “The PM's views were appreciated by other leaders in the gathering," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-natural-ally-of-open-societies-pm-modi-at-g7-summit/articleshow/83493984.cms||---

According to Public Health England, an executive agency of the UK government’s health and social care department, 63 genomes of Delta (B.1.617.2) with the new K417N mutation had been identified so far on the global science initiative GISAID. In its latest report on Covid-19 variants, updated till last Friday, India had reported six cases of Delta+ as of June 7.

Excerpts from the interview:Dr Vinod Scaria, clinician and computational biologist at Delhi’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said an important point to consider regarding K417N was “evidence suggesting resistance to monoclonal antibodies Casirivimab and Imdevimab”.

A small number of detected sequences had acquired the spike protein mutation K417N, it said. Scientists attribute the earliest such sequence to Europe in late March. Scaria said 127 sequences from Europe, Asia and America were now available in the public domain. Scaria pointed out that several genomes now available across the world were part of the AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1 lineage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-more-virulent-variant-of-delta-fuels-cocktail-resistance-fear/articleshow/83494277.cms||Syed Akbar

Modular hospitals will be built adjacent to an existing hospital building as an extension of operational infrastructure. A 100-bedded modular hospital with a dedicated zone of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) can be set up at an estimated cost of nearly Rs 3 crore in three weeks and made fully operational in 6-7 weeks. The project, initiated by the office of principal scientific adviser K Vijay Raghavan, will initially be implemented in state-run and philanthropic hospitals. These rapidly deployable hospitals are intended to plug a major health infrastructure gap in India’s fight against Covid, especially in rural areas and smaller towns. Read AlsoWHO blames India’s 2nd wave on premature opening up, social mixingThe World Health Organization (WHO) has, at the G7 summit in the UK, blamed the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India on the “premature” opening up of the society and relaxation of public health measures, as well as the emergence of new variants and unequal vaccine distribution.“Any government hospital, having basic facilities such as electricity and water supply, and oxygen pipeline, will be eligible to have a modular hospital attached to it,” Aaditi Lele, member of the industry-academia collaboration division in the principal scientific adviser’s office, told TOI. “We have been in touch with state governments to identify the requirement, specifically in states where a higher number of cases are reported. We have also reached out to multiple partners to execute projects through corporate social responsibility support.” The first batch of 100-bed modular hospitals will be commissioned in Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh); Amravati, Pune and Jalna (Maharashtra) and Mohali (Punjab), along with a 20-bed hospital in Raipur (Chhattisgarh). Bengaluru will have one each of 20, 50, and 100 beds in the first phase. Read AlsoWhy a lockdown should not last for the entire Covid waveNEW DELHI: What’s the best time to impose a lockdown? Data from different parts of the second Covid wave can help governments make better decisions in future. A lockdown has serious adverse effects on the social, economic and psychological well-being of people, so it should be applied only whenThese hospitals can last around 25 years. They can also be dismantled and moved anywhere in less than a week. The design and concept — called MediCAB Hospitals — is by Modulus Housing, a start-up incubated in IIT Madras. The company has started deploying MediCAB extension hospitals with the help of the American Indian Foundation. The government has also collaborated with Tata Projects Ltd to deploy modular hospitals at multiple sites in Punjab and Chhattisgarh. They have initiated work on 48-bedded modular hospitals in Gurdaspur and Faridkot in Punjab. Expansion of ICUs at hospitals in Raipur, Jashpur, Bemetara, Kanker and Gaurella in Chhattisgarh is also currently underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-50-modular-hospitals-to-be-set-up-across-india-in-3-months/articleshow/83494496.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||WHO blames India’s 2nd wave on premature opening up, social mixing||LONDON: The World Health Organization (WHO) has, at the G7 summit in the UK, blamed the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India on the “premature” opening up of the society and relaxation of public health measures, as well as the emergence of new variants and unequal vaccine distribution. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, told TOI, “The cause or evolution of this wave in India has been driven by a number of factors including the opening up of society, wedding season, religious ceremonies, a general increase in mobility and mixing of populations, and the emergence of the Delta strain, which is more transmissible and has more kinetic energy and is able to exploit opportunities in transmission. In effect, we have given the virus more opportunity and the virus has more capacity, and if you put opportunity with capacity together, you get the situation like you saw in India.” Ryan said the India’s pandemic impact continues to be “very severe”. “It may have left the global airwaves, but the people of India are still suffering greatly as the disease moves through more rural areas. We commend the health workers and the health system for all they are doing to save lives with an extreme lack of equipment and supplies in many places,” he added. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of Covid-19 response at WHO, blamed India’s deadly second wave on four variants of concern across the globe: Alpha variant, first identified in the UK; Beta variant, first identified in South Africa; P1 variant, first identified in Brazil; and Delta variant, first identified in India. “In addition to variants that have increased transmissibility, we have seen dramatic rise in social mixing. When you have increases in social mixing, even if it is small gatherings, you provide the virus opportunity to spread because people are spending time in close contact with one another. The third reason is relaxation of public health and social measures,” she said. “These are scientifically proven measures that can reduce infections and reduce transmission and save lives right now. The last is the uneven and inequitable vaccine distribution around the world. We need vaccines to reach those who are most vulnerable and those at highest risk of infection first.” Maria said all of these factors created “a very dangerous combination.” Her message to India was "to stay very vigilant and put everything we can at reducing transmission with all the tools we have right now including vaccines but not only vaccines.” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, “ The best approach in India is to not let your guard down and follow the comprehensive approach — strong public health with vaccination — but we are glad to see a downward trend of deaths and cases in the last three to four weeks.” He added the first phase of the WHO study into the origins of the virus was “not conclusive” and that the Wuhan lab leaks theory remained an open hypothesis on the table. “The origins study is something that WHO takes really seriously. We need cooperation from the Chinese side and we need transparency in order to know or find the origins of this virus because there were difficulties in data sharing, especially raw data, in the first phase,” he said, adding WHO is preparing the second phase of the study.

---||India||Covid-19: ‘Mass gatherings, virulent variants create perfect storm for virus to spread’||Head of the UN office for disaster risk reduction Mami Mizutori tells Pradeep Thakur Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:The World Bank estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country. All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters. The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time. How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India. Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers. The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme. Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe. With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals target?It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mass-gatherings-virulent-variants-create-perfect-storm-for-virus-to-spread/articleshow/83494806.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||World||With Biden’s backing, G7 leaders’ communiqué slams China on multiple fronts||In a rare move – and with the backing of US president Joe Biden - China was heavily criticised throughout the G7 leaders’ communiqué - condemned both for undermining the global economy and for abusing human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. “With regard to China, and competition in the global economy, we will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy,” the communiqué said. “We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. We are concerned by the use of all forms of forced labour in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labour of vulnerable groups and minorities, including in the agricultural, solar, and garment sectors,” it said. The G7 communiqué reiterated the importance of maintaining a “free and open Indo Pacific”, which is inclusive and based on the rule of law. “We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo and increase tensions,” it said. Biden said at a press conference on Sunday: “Last time the G7 met there was no mention on China in the communiqué and this time there is mention of China. The G7 explicitly agreed to call out human rights abuses in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang and to coordinate a common strategy to deal with China’s non-market policies that undermine competition and the G7 agreed to take serious action against forced labour in solar, agricultural and garment industries because that is where it is happening.” He said there was “plenty of action” on China, so he was satisfied. Explaining how he got China to feature so prominently, he said: “I laid out what I thought was the need for us to be consistent to protect our economies too and see to it that other struggling economies got help they need and not held captive by other nations.” “We are in a contest not with China per se, but a contest with autocratic governments around the world and whether democracies can compete with them in a rapidly changing 21st century and I think how we act and whether we pull together as democracies will determine whether our grandchildren look back in 15 years’ time and say, ‘Did they step up?’ ” “I think you are going to see this straightforward dealing with China. I am not looking for conflict. Where we cooperate we will, but we are going to respond to actions that are inconsistent. China has to start to act more responsibly and transparently in terms of international norms and human rights because transparency matters across the world.” He said he and other countries raised the issue of Covid origins at the G7. “Even the US intelligence agencies did not yet know whether the Covid virus originated in an “experiment gone awry” in a Wuhan lab,” he said. The communiqué calls for “a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 origins study in China.” President Biden met Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and UK prime minister Boris Johnson met in the margins of the G7 summit in Carbis Bay on Saturday when they agreed that the strategic context in the Indo-Pacific “was changing” and that there was a “strong rationale” for deepening cooperation between the three governments. They welcomed the forthcoming exercises in the Indo-Pacific by the Carrier Strike Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/with-bidens-backing-g7-leaders-communiqu-slams-china-on-multiple-fronts/articleshow/83495016.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||India||Covid-19: States came to each other’s rescue at the peak of oxygen crisis||NEW DELHI: The politics over oxygen supply might have raged fiercely but at an operational level, states rallied for one another as the country faced its biggest crisis of medical oxygen. Maharashtra sent oxygen tankers to Goa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to meet emergency requirements; Karnataka, in turn, spared tankers for Maharashtra and Telangana while Kerala shared oxygen with Tamil Nadu even when it was not getting its full share. “In the crisis, India reacted as one. One night, I called up the Maharashtra chief secretary asking for a tanker to Goa and he willingly did so. Similarly, Karnataka was in a serious state at one time, but when we requested spare tankers for Maharashtra and Telangana, they did so. There were no Centre-state issues,” convener of the empowered group on oxygen and road transport secretary Giridhar Aramane told TOI. On the response of major oxygen producing states such as Odisha, West Bengal, Gujarat and Jharkhand, Aramane said, “All of them were very supportive. Ultimately, everyone realises that either we survive as a nation, we swim or sink together.” There were several meetings convened by the cabinet secretary and some involving PM Narendra Modi to ensure that all resources to generate and transport oxygen were tapped. Kerala chief secretary V P Joy told TOI said the state decided to ensure oxygen tankers heading to other states run seamlessly and that the administration would not stock more than its requirement. “I was in touch with the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu. If people die in any other state, it’s nothing different from deaths here. We all needed to fight together as a nation. We set up two hospitals of 1,000 beds each at two centres where we have enough gaseous oxygen, but can’t convert them to liquid oxygen. This suggestion came from the empowered group,” he said. Speaking on the effort to coordinate oxygen supplies, Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said the state extended help to Goa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and received “generous help” from Odisha, Gujarat, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. During the last week of April, medical oxygen demand had touched an all-time high of nearly 9,000 tonnes a day. Responding to how the government plans to meet future requirements, Aramane said the installation of PSA oxygen plants would create capacity for generating an additional 2,500 tonnes of medical oxygen and the total capacity would go up to around 12,500 tonnes per day, instead of 6,000 tonnes last year. “This will be a permanent solution to the issue of medical oxygen,” he added. On demand in rural areas, Aramane said PSA oxygen plants can’t be installed at 50- or 30-bedded health centres. The supply will be through cylinders. He said last year the government procured around 7 lakh cylinders and distributed them in the country. “The available cylinders went up from 4.5 lakh to 11 lakh in the last one year. Another 1.27 lakh cylinders are being distributed to states and orders have been placed for 1.5 lakh more. Apart from cylinders, the government is also procuring oxygen concentrators for mild and moderate patients under the PM Cares fund. This will be useful in smaller locations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-states-came-to-each-others-rescue-at-the-peak-of-oxygen-crisis/articleshow/83495313.cms||Dipak K Dash

Sources said that five out of the six MPs barring the party chief Chirag Paswan have written to the Lok Sabha Speaker to recognize them as a separate entity. However, there is no official confirmation from the Speaker’s office or from the LJP. The five MPs include Chirag’s uncle Pashupati Paras, his son Prince Raj and three other party lawmakers – Chandan Singh, veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser, sources said. They added the split seems to be mere formality as the five MPs have claimed that they are the real LJP. “We don’t have any such report,” a senior LJP functionary said. Sources said the differences had cropped up in the party over likely inclusion of one leader from in the Cabinet expansion, which may happen at any time. While JD(U) has openly criticized the role of Chirag Paswan and will oppose any move by the BJP to include him in the cabinet, it may not oppose induction of Paras. Paras had created ripples just before the Bihar assembly election when he had praised Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and had praised his development agenda. There were speculations of the party getting split soon after the LJP failed to make a significant impact in the last Bihar assembly election in 2020 after it decided to go solo in the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/buzz-of-split-in-ljp-as-5-of-its-6-mps-revolt/articleshow/83495473.cms||---
---||Business||Users stuck as glitches plague new I-T portal||NEW DELHI: The new income-tax (I-T) portal launched on June 7, which promised to be a gamechanger, continues to be plagued by glitches. Taxpayers and tax professionals find that they are unable to log in, or if at all they do manage to log in, they are unable to carry out transactions—be it uploading a relevant form or replying to a notice from the I-T department. A day after the launch, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman took cognisance of the various grievances pouring out on social media and passed on the message to Infosys, the tech service provider. However, as of now, taxpayers find themselves in troubled waters. One of the most common and immediate complaints is that overseas remittances are held up because Forms 15CA and 15CB cannot be uploaded. The former is a declaration made by the remitter that tax has been deducted at source on payments made to the non-resident. Banks are now becoming more vigilant in ensuring that this form is received by them before remittance is made. Form 15CB is a certificate furnished by a chartered accountant that the provisions of the relevant tax treaty and the I-T Act have been complied with when making the overseas payment. Anish Thacker, president at the Chamber of Tax Consultants (CTC), says corporate entities are badly hit. “As Form 15CA cannot be uploaded, overseas remittances are held up. Corporates are being treated by the overseas party as defaulters and they are being subject to penalties for late payment and their reputation is at stake.” Ameet Patel, chairperson of the taxation committee at Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society (BCAS), rues that “taxpayers cannot reply to notices received from the I-T department. In some instances, if the reply is not received within a certain period of time, the case can become time barred. Owing to the non-functionality of the I-T portal, many such taxpayers will suffer penal consequences”. These are not minor glitches, but major issues that need immediate attention,” adds Patel. Taxpayers are currently facing a host of other issues as well. Patel illustrates: Newly incorporated companies or firms are not able to register themselves on the I-T portal. It is not possible to register the TAN number for filing tax deducted at source returns, digital signature certificate is not getting registered or updated. A tax practitioner who tried to register a corporate client, got a message saying: As you are a minor, you are not authorised under the law to register. Thacker says a parallel run of the old and new I-T portals for a month or two could have eased the issues which taxpayers are facing. A 998-page note on guidelines on how to navigate the new I-T portal has also raised eyebrows. All taxpayers, including the salaried (whose I-T returns for the FY 2020-21 are due in September) may continue to face a huge hurdle if the problems aren’t addressed. “Profile updation requires matching of Aadhar as well as PAN details and more often than not, mismatches are shown. For instance, if one word in the address is missing or spelt differently in one of the two identity cards then there will be a mismatch, which cannot be rectified on the portal. This means we have to either update our Aadhaar or PAN,” points out a chartered accountant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/users-stuck-as-glitches-plague-new-i-t-portal/articleshow/83495736.cms||Lubna Kably
---||India||As Jiyo Parsi scheme delivers, community sees record births||NEW DELHI: The work from home norm during Covid-hit 2020 delivered some good news for the Parsi community which saw a record 61 births, assisted through the Centre’s Jiyo Parsi scheme aimed at arresting a decline in the community’s numbers which added up to all of 57,000 in the 2011 census. Launched in 2013-14, the scheme, supported by the minority affairs ministry, has seen an additional 22 births this year with the total number of newborns now standing at 321 as of June. The gains seem small but are precious for the community that has contributed handsomely to Indian national life before and after independence. A fast dwindling population count that stood at 1.14 lakh in 1941 prompted the Centre to launch the Jiyo Parsi scheme in 2013-14. A year-wise break-up shows that while in the first year, 16 babies were born, the number rose to 38 the next year, went down to 28 in 2016 and then rose to 58 in 2017. It dipped to 38 in 2018 but grew to 59 in 2019 and 61 in 2020. The data regarding 321 children pertains largely to couples who benefited from medical reimbursements offered under Jiyo Parsi for medical interventions like fertility treatments, assisted reproductive technologies and counselling to seek medical help given the low birth rates in the community. “Going by the data, 2020 saw a new high and this, in a way, can be attributed to many couples starting fertility treatment during the pandemic as work from home gave them flexibility in working hours and made visits to hospitals and clinics less stressful. One saw couples taking this opportunity — of the entire family being together at all times — as a good opportunity to decide to start a family,” said Shernaz Cama, director of Unesco Parzor and national director of Jiyo Parsi scheme. She said the other reason for the increase in birth rates was due to changes in the Jiyo Parsi scheme in 2017. The HOC (health of the community) component took care of elderly dependants in a family and also brought in a child care scheme that helped couples with financial assistance. “In the medical category, we also included and ensured financial assistance would be extended for those who conceived through ART right up to delivery and discharge from hospital,” Cama added. However, the pandemic brought its own share of challenges. For instance, Cama said, a woman who conceived through ART tested positive for Covid-19 during her sixth month of pregnancy and was hospitalised for a few weeks. After treatment, she was advised rest and has now delivered a healthy baby. Shahnaaz Dalal, 29, from Mumbai, spoke to TOI about her journey. She conceived in the middle of last year and was supported under the Jiyo Parsi scheme which helped her tide through the tough phase and give birth to a daughter in March. Dalal said the work from home phase clearly helped her go through her pregnancy and post-birth care with much more ease. Cama said while the pandemic did put the brakes on offline advocacy activities, the Jiyo Parsi team went online organising seminars and holding telephonic counselling. How far advocacy has worked will show up only in the 2021 census. This will be an important milestone that will reflect any success in arresting or even slowing the decline in population. Studies conducted in the past to assess the reasons for the decline pitched a worrisome picture of there being an average of one child below the age of 10 in nine families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/as-jiyo-parsi-scheme-delivers-community-sees-record-births/articleshow/83495867.cms||Ambika Pandit

So, for months, Durga Sati, 32, Roshni Negi, 25, and Mamta Kanwasi, 33, had been preparing for the taxing trek. Last week, they became the first women guards to be deployed in the treacherous forests of the country’s second highest mountain, Nanda Devi, over 25,000 feet high. “We patrol the mountains to protect rare animals and plants. There is always the threat of poachers, even at these altitudes,” said Mamta. “We also check water sources and see if anything appears amiss from a security point of view. We have to ensure our territory is safe.” Their deployment came about with a chance conversation and initiative on their part. Women forest guards would usually go up to Laata, at 11,150 feet, but would be asked not to go further. “But we thought, if not now, when? We joined this service to serve our country and nature,” said Roshni. On June 1, they trekked to Bhelta (11,800 feet). Then, they went to Lata Khark (12,800 feet) and then, onwards to Jhandidhara (13,800 feet). They returned to Lata Khark, from where they went to Dharasi (14,500 feet), their destination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-a-first-women-patrol-nanda-devi-forests-at-14500-feet/articleshow/83495902.cms||Shivani Azad

Deaths from earlier days constituted half of the over 25,000 fatalities recorded during the last seven days, raising the week’s toll to the highest in three weeks. Maharashtra announced the highest number of backlog deaths, as many as 8,622, during June 7-13, while Bihar accounted for 3,951. On Sunday, Maharashtra added 2,288 old fatalities, its highest count so far. Last week, 21,074 deaths were recorded, of which at least 3,218 were old deaths mainly reported by Maharashtra. Backlog deaths are fatalities from past days that had remained unreported due to delays by hospitals or other reasons. While acknowledgment of these deaths is a welcome exercise that would lead to a more accurate assessment of Covid casualties, only a handful of states have done so as a matter of public record. These include Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, fresh cases continued to decrease sharply. There were just over 6 lakh cases recorded during the week, a 30% drop from the previous seven days, when the count was over 8.6 lakh. At the height of the second wave, India had recorded more than 27.4 lakh cases in a week (May 3-9). This means weekly cases have dropped by 78% to nearly afifth of the peak.The highest weekly death toll from the pandemic was 29,331, recorded on May 17-23. As expected, deaths peaked two weeks after the highest number of cases had been recorded. While daily deaths have continued to drop steadily since the peak, backlog fatalities have pushed up the weekly numbers over the past two weeks. On Sunday, India recorded 69,061 fresh infections, with data from Assam yet to come in till past midnight. The death toll was 1,590. On Saturday, the country had reported 80,627 new cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/weekly-deaths-up-19-half-the-toll-due-to-old-fatalites/articleshow/83495971.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

---||India||2-DG drug initially developed for cancer treatment, lures coronavirus by looking like glucose: Former DRDO scientist||NEW DELHI: Defence Research and Development Organisation’s drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which has been granted permission by drug regulator DCGI for emergency use as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe Covid-19 patients, was “initially developed to check the growth of cancerous cells”. As 2-DG’s defence mechanism to check the growth of cancerous cells was the same as depriving the coronavirus of glucose in infected cells, therefore the DRDO decided to perform clinical trials on this drug for Covid-19 treatment on the suggestions of its scientists after the regulator’s nod last year, a former senior DRDO scientist revealed. Explaining 2-DG’s defence mechanism, former DRDO veteran Ravi Kumar told TOI, “Coronavirus uses glucose in infected cells as an energy source to multiply. 2-DG lures the virus by looking like glucose, which the virus feeds on but gets weakened when it doesn’t get glucose for energy and thus the viral load gets reduced in patients after some days of drug intake.” In the 2-DG arm, a significantly higher proportion of patients improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence (42% vs 31%) by day-3 in comparison to standard of care, indicating an early relief from oxygen therapy/dependence. A similar trend was observed in patients aged over 65 years, an MoD statement said recently. Talking to TOI, Praveen Chandra, Medanta hospital’s chairman of interventional cardiology, said 2-DG has been tried till now on 15-20 patients in their hospital. “It has been quite good and improvements have been seen in patients after its second dose”, he said, adding, “We have given the drug to patients for 5-7 days and have not seen any side-effects in these patients”. It all started when the pandemic struck India early last year and PM Modi called for development of indigenous vaccines and drugs to check Covid-19. Two senior scientists of the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) of DRDO, Anant Narayana Bhatt and Sudhir Chandana, had then proposed at a DRDO meet, attended by its chairman Dr G Satheesh Reddy, that 2-DG, initially developed to check brain tumour, could be used for Covid treatment as the drug’s defence mechanism was the same, Ravi Kumar said. After their proposal was accepted, INMAS scientists conducted lab experiments with the help of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, and found that the molecule worked effectively against SARS-CoV-2 and inhibited the viral growth. Based on these results, DCGI permitted a phase-II clinical trial of 2-DG in May 2020. In the trials from May to October, the drug was found to be safe in Covid-19 patients, who showed significant improvement in their recovery. Phase IIa was conducted in six hospitals and Phase IIb (dose ranging) in 11 hospitals covering 110 patients. The regulator further permitted phase-III clinical trials in November 2020. The trial was conducted on 220 patients between December 2020 to March 2021 at 27 Covid hospitals and the data was presented to the DCGI. On May 01, 2021, DCGI gave the nod for its emergency use. DRDO, in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s Lab, thereafter started the commercial production of 2-DG, which is now priced at Rs 990 per sachet. To augment its production, DRDO has recently invited expressions of interest from drug-makers to transfer the technology for 2-DG’s mass production.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-dg-drug-initially-developed-for-cancer-treatment-lures-coronavirus-by-looking-like-glucose-former-drdo-scientist/articleshow/83496866.cms||Surendra Singh

The move to denotify protected forest land under Banshi Pahadpur block and hand it over to the department of mining and geology is part of a larger plan to allow regulated mining with minimal environmental impact and simultaneous afforestation. “In the 398 hectares that are to be diverted, we expect to develop about 70 mining blocks and auction those. We have already started delineating the area and aim to complete it by the end of this month,” additional chief secretary (mines and petroleum) Subodh Agarwal said. Agarwal said legal mining would not only smoothen supply of sandstone for the Ram temple, but also end law and order challenges caused by illegal mining. According to a letter from the Union environment, forest and climate change ministry, the state government needs to carry out compensatory afforestation across an area equal in size to the denotified forest zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eye-on-ayodhya-govt-clears-mining-in-forest/articleshow/83497070.cms||---

Quoting a 34 year-old SC judgment, the state government said, "This (Supreme) Court has no time today even to dispose of cases which have to be decided by it alone and by no other authority. Large number of cases are pending from 10 to 15 years. Even if no new case is filed in this Court hereafter, with the present strength of Judges it may take more than 15 years to dispose of all the pending cases." The state government said, "Despite the fact that a five-judge bench of the HC is hearing all aspects of the alleged post-poll violence in the State, under the guise of the instant writ petition, the petitioners have made omnibus prayers seeking transfer of investigation of all incidents of deaths to an Special Investigation Team and for monitoring of investigation of all incidents of attacks in the aftermath of the assembly elections in the State." "In other words, by way of the present writ petition, the petitioner are seeking to broaden the scope of the instant writ petition beyond the two victims involved, namely, Avijit Sarkar and Haran Adhikari; And in doing so is clearly attempting to undermine and overreach the jurisdiction exercised by the Calcutta HC," it said. Responding to the allegation of the petitioner Biswajit Sarkar, on which the SC had sought response after hearing senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani and advocate Ravi Sharma, the state told the SC that the petitioners, as kin of victims, have not been cooperating in the investigation and not permitting police to seize "incriminating material" from their houses. It said they are not submitting their mobile phones for investigation. It said the kin have not collected the bodies after post mortem and the bodies are being preserved in the morgue. "The petition is based on misinformation and falsehoods and has completely blown out of proportion the extent of post-poll violence that had occurred in West Bengal. Much of the misinformation is based on fabricated stories generated in social media by miscreants to create a state of panic in the State," it said. "The instant writ petition is also based on the false narrative that the state administration had been complicit in the incidents of violence or had stood as a silent spectator to such incidents. It was only because of the timely intervention of the state administration that the violence was nipped in the bud and the law and order situation was restored to normality in a short duration of time," the Mamata Banerjee government said. "The investigating agency was able to seize incriminating articles from the house of the victim, namely, bamboo stick, wooden plank, broken parts of computer and CCTV cameras, blood stained wearing apparels of victim's mother etc. after observing all legal formalities; But Biswajit Sarkar did not allow the investigating agencies to enter into his office in Kolkata to inspect the same and to seize the incriminating articles, if any, where the allegation of initial disturbance took place as per his complaint dated May 2," it said. The WB police said, "During the course of investigation, several attempts were made to collect and seize the mobile phone of the victim from the family members of the victim for the purpose of investigation but Biswajit Sarkar refused to hand over the same." Death of BJP worker Haran Adhikari was attributed to personal disputes between the victim and the accused. While the kin had accused 17 persons of causing murder of Adhikari, the police have arrested only three - Rashid Mallick, Samsuddin Mallick and Hanif Molla. The state said that the investigations are being carried out in accordance with law and that "there is absolutely no ground whatsoever for transferring the investigation in relation to the two FIRs to the CBI or any other investigating agency."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-cites-sc-pendency-asks-it-to-stay-off-post-poll-cases/articleshow/83497506.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The women cited the pro-active action taken by the Supreme Court in post-Godhra communal riots cases in Gujarat and sought a similar court-monitored SIT probe into incidents of gangrape and murders that went on with impunity for a fortnight in the state after TMC scored a massive victory in the assembly elections.

A house ransacked in political clashes in West Bengal (ANI photo)She said despite BJP winning from the constituency (Khejuri), a mob of 100-200 TMC workers surrounded her house on May 3 and threatened to bomb it. In fear, her daughter-in-law left the house the next day. On the intervening night of May 4-5, five TC workers barged into the house, assaulted her, tied her to a cot and then gang-raped her in front of her grandson, the woman alleged in her application before the SC. BJP workers and their family members crossed over to Dhubri in Assam after confronted with violence.She said that she was found by neighbours in an unconscious state the next morning and was referred to the district hospital. She alleged that when her son-in-law went to the police to lodge an FIR, the police refused to entertain. She said TMC workers used rape as a weapon to take revenge, humiliate and silence political rivals in the state during the post-poll violence.

Not merely the said crimes were facilitated by the inaction of the state authorities/police, but what was shocking is post crime humiliation that the rape survivors were subjected to, for their perceived audacity in reporting the crime," she said. "The perversity of the investigation as is being carried out by the local police can be inferred from the fact that while the rape was committed by five accused who were all named by the rape survivor, and when the rape is confirmed by a medical report, the police has deliberately chosen to name only one of the five accused in the FIR," she alleged and sought an investigation by SIT/CBI citing that the accused persons are members of the ruling party. A 17-year-old minor girl from the Scheduled Caste community too moved the SC seeking SIT/CBI investigation into her alleged gang rape by TMC workers on May 9 and shifting of the trial outside the state. She said that not only was she gangraped and left to die in the jungle after being dragged in there by TMC supporters, the very next day a TMC local leader Bahadur SK came to her house and threatened the family members against lodging a complaint. He threatened to burn their house and kill them if they did so, she alleged in her application in SC. She said she was being kept in a Child Welfare Home and her parents are not allowed to meet her. "Such has been the conduct of local police/administration that instead of sympathising with her and family members, the police is pressuring her family saying their other daughter may face the same consequences," she said and requested for an independent probe. Another women, Purnima Mondal, whose husband Dharama Mondol was killed by alleged TMC workers during the post-poll violence, told the SC that "such is the vengeful nature of the violence that that the applicant’s husband, who campaigned for BJP, was subsequently identified and assaulted with axes in broad day light on May 14. The present applicant was made to helplessly witness the assault on her husband and her brother-in-law, while she herself was being disrobed, grabbed and struggling to survive the rape attempt made of her body by two members of the same violent mob, which was led by a local elected representative. The applicant’s husband subsequently passed away on May 16." Purnima said, "The police was more concerned about pressurising the applicant and her family members into filing a weak complaint and finally succeeded in procuring such a complaint from the injured brother in law of the applicant. Chapra Police have lodged a complaint devoid of material details of the incident and suppressed the role of the elected representative, who was not only leading the violent mob which attacked the applicant’s family and gave orders to the members of the mob to attack and kill, applicant’s husband. It also does not take in to account or give any reference of the attempt to rape made on her body by the members of group which was led by the said elected representative, Kaalu Sheikh." "As the applicant was devastated after the incident, it was only after the cremation of her husband, that she went to the police station to make a detailed complaint but the police officer not only refused to record her statement despite she being an eye witness and a victim herself but also after abusing and threatening her forced the applicant out of the police station," she alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/horror-tales-emerge-as-bengal-gang-rape-survivors-move-sc/articleshow/83497596.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Kolkata||Desperate to resume operations, bars and restaurants pin hopes on government order in Kolkata||KOLKATA: A few prominent restaurant chains in the city along with several neighbourhood food joints have resumed operations even before the state issued an order on relaxations in restrictions that were put in place last month to rein in Covid cases. The development, food and beverage industry experts said, is a pointer to the desperate situation the sector finds after being battered by conditions that the pandemic had thrust on it. The Hotel & Restaurant Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), though, has advised its members to refrain from opening prematurely. A biryani chain with a pan-Kolkata presence, a heritage coffee shop on College Street, another cafe and restaurant chain in New Town and a resto bar on Camac Street are among the well known restaurants and pubs that opened last week following CM Mamata Banerjee’s televised comments during a discussion with the industry 10 days ago in which she had indicated the government’s willingness to favourably consider reopening restaurants for limited hours with certain riders. Three days later, some of these restaurants opened shop at 5pm. They are desperate, said sources. Many had even sent their service staff on leave without pay while others were paying a minimum wage to help them sustain through the difficult times. “We opened around four days ago and are operating at half the capacity between 5pm and 8pm as the CM had indicated. We are deploying those staff who have been vaccinated at least once,” an official of the biryani chain said. The cafe-cum-restaurant chain in New Town, too, has been serving food at the outlets since last Monday. “After government allowed restaurants to open, we have been open everyday from 5pm to 8pm,” an executive said. Government officials clarified no such order had been issued. A resto-bar on Camac Street had also opened shop believing the CM’s comments implied government nod. But Shakespeare Sarani PS stepped in and forced its closure. On College Street, a heritage coffee shop was ‘allowed’ to serve its dedicated customers by Amherst Street PS on compassionate grounds since the cooperative that runs the operations is suffering badly. Officially, though, cops have asked the employees to encourage takeaways. A prominent heritage restaurant on Park Street had also considered restarting operations but decided against it after fellow restaurants advised caution and Park Street police expressed objections in absence of a government notification. Nitin Kothari, who runs popular restaurants Mocambo and Peter Cat on Park Street, said he had no plans to open till a formal order was issued. “I have vaccinated all the staff who are in Kolkata. But till the order is issued, I will only do takeaways and home delivery.” “We also want restaurants, bars and nightclubs to reopen but with a proper government directive. As an association, we have categorically told owners not to do anything that goes against government directive. In the mean-time we will focus on vaccinating staff,” said HRAEI president Suresh Poddar. With cases declining further, Poddar hopes when the notification is announced, possibly on Monday or Tuesday, more relaxations will be allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/desperate-to-resume-ops-bars-and-restaurants-pin-hopes-on-govt-order/articleshow/83492474.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Karauli MLA Lakhan Singh, one of the six BSP MLAs who switched over to Congress in 2019, said on Sunday that cabinet expansion would improve the government’s efficiency. “Some departments are dependent on government officials now. If these departments get ministers, they would function better,” he said.  Five of these MLAs would meet in Jaipur on Monday. “Lakhan has sought cabinet expansion. When and how is the CM’s prerogative,” Rajendra Singh Gudha, another MLA, toldTOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gehlot-loyalists-too-join-chorus-of-cabinet-rejig/articleshow/83497895.cms||Bhanu Pratap Singh

Some time back, the chief minister had announced that the GER of higher education would reach 30% by 2030, but taking into consideration the latest figures, it does not seem feasible. It is true that a number of institutions of higher education have been opened in the state in recent years, but most of them lack sufficient infrastructure and competent teachers. Hence, they fail to attract students, academics said. Expressing concern at the sluggish growth of higher education in the state, the Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha pointed out that as many as 25 out of 38 districts in the state are educationally backward. With nearly 1,000 degree colleges located in different parts of the state, there are only seven colleges for every one lakh students, much less than in other states, he said. Sinha further pointed out that there is an acute shortage of good engineering and medical colleges and polytechnics in the state, compelling a vast majority of the youth to migrate to other states. To reach an all India level, the state needs additional 373 general colleges (arts, science and commerce), 236 engineering colleges, 139 medical colleges, 253 education colleges and 163 polytechnics. Besides, the university authorities would have to do away with their usual practice of disaffiliating degree colleges every now and then on flimsy grounds, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty among students, Sinha added. Patna College’s former principal Nawal Kishore Choudhary observed that the GER is quite low in Bihar simply because the prospects of higher education are quite bleak. As most colleges lack even the minimum basic infrastructure and qualified teachers, students refrain from joining these institutions. And, furthermore, the degrees obtained by them fail to fetch any jobs for them, he said. Chaudhary further said that for increasing GER, the government should open more colleges, especially for girls, in different parts of the state. In rural and mofussil areas, most guardians do not send their daughters to co-educational institutions. There should be greater emphasis on opening colleges in educationally backward regions, he suggested. Bihar State Higher Education Council (BSHEC)’s vice-chairman Kameshwar Jha, when contacted, pointed out the state’s GER would have shown higher percentage had the enrolment figures of 69 left out colleges been added in the survey. Efforts are being made by the government to raise the state’s GER up to the national average by the year 2025. Nearly 70% of the girl students drop out after passing intermediate examination. The present government has recently provided some additional incentives to the girls on passing the graduation examination, he said. Jha further pointed out that as there is no degree college in 113 blocks, Nalanda Open University is being requested to open its study centres, especially for girls, at panchayat community centres. The panchayat sabha bhawans would be fully equipped for imparting virtual classes to students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-higher-edu-ger-improves-but-still-below-national-average/articleshow/83490308.cms||B K Mishra

SuMo said out of those 152 selected candidates, 130 were from backward classes, 18 from extremely backward category, three from scheduled castes and one from scheduled tribes. A total of 710 seats were reserved. He gave credit for the selection of such candidates on unreserved seats to the NDA government’s different welfare schemes in the state. Taking a swipe at the opposition RJD for ignoring the interest of people belonging to the reserved categories during its rule, SuMo said the RJD even opposed the Bill for giving 10% reservation to economically weaker people from upper castes. He said a total of 1,465 posts were advertised for the BPSC examination and 270 of them were reserved for EBCs, 248 for SCs, 133 for BCs, 10 for STs and 40 for women belonging to backward classes. “This is the result of the NDA government’s schemes to uplift people belonging to the reserved categories,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/152-from-reserved-categories-qualify-on-unreserved-seats/articleshow/83490645.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It will issue equity shares and convertible warrants to Reliance Infrastructure, which will see its stake in Reliance Power rise to 38% from the current 9%. The boards of Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure approved the capital plan on Sunday. Reliance Power will issue 60 crore equity shares and 73 crore convertible warrants to Reliance Infrastructure at Rs 10 each, which is a discount to its last closing price of Rs 13 on Friday. The entire capital raised will be used to retire Reliance Power’s debt, which stands at Rs 25,000 crore. A week ago, Reliance Infrastructure had announced plans to raise Rs 551 crore from its promoters and international private equity fund Varde Partners. Reliance Infrastructure’s stake in Reliance Power will increase to 25% after the equity share issuance and will further go up to 38% on conversion of warrants into equity. Reliance Power’s board also approved two other fund-raising proposals — issuance of foreign currency convertible bonds and issuance of equity shares with or without warrants via qualified institutions placement (QIP).

One Jagdish Das of Waina village in Gandhar panchayat under Ghosi police station area of Jehanabad lodged an FIR with SC/ST police station against eight upper caste persons, including one Neeraj Kumar, for assaulting and abusing him by his caste when he had gone to a village shop to purchase some household items on June 9. When asked on Sunday, SHO Baleshwar Paswan said police were still investigating the matter to ascertain if the accused Neeraj was dead or alive. “I have come to know from media reports only that Neeraj is already dead,” he said. When contacted, panchayat sarpanch Siddhnath Sharma confirmed that Neeraj died of cancer around two years back. “He used to work in a factory in Delhi. After undergoing treatment at Safdarjung hospital there for a long time, he had returned home and died,” he said. The sarpanch alleged that the FIR was lodged to implicate a few upper caste people over a dispute. “The case is a fallout of torching an autorickshaw of one Santosh Ram of the village by miscreants on June 7 night. Santosh blamed his neighbour Mrityunjay Pandey for the incident and lodged an FIR against him with Ghosi police station,” he said. Sharma said some upper caste people assured Santosh next morning that he would be properly compensated for the loss. “However, Santosh started hurling caste-indicative abuses when two upper caste youths pounded on him. They were immediately stopped by the senior villagers,” he said. He said later in the night, Santosh’s associates intercepted the upper caste youths involved in the morning brawl and thrashed them after which both sides approached the police. When contacted on Sunday, Ghosi police station SHO Nikhil Kumar said village chowkidar Munarik Paswan confirmed that the accused Neeraj was dead. “We will share this information with the SC/ST police station,” he said. SHO Kumar said altogether five FIRs – one for torching of vehicle and two each by both sides for brawl -- were registered on June 10. “Several accused from both sides are evading arrest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dead-man-booked-under-sc/st-act/articleshow/83491373.cms||Debashish Karmakar

This follows 1.9 lakh Covid-related deaths since April 1, 2021, which is 17% higher than lives lost to the pandemic in the entire FY21. “Life insurers, while making Covid reserves last year, assumed 50–100% higher Covid-related deaths for FY22. Our analysis shows that reserves made by them can cover 1.5–2x the Covid-related deaths in FY21,” said a report by Macquarie. The 5-10 times increase in the number of death claims is based on enquiries with life insurance companies and industry bodies by Macquarie. The report says that worry for investors is there could be a significant impact on embedded value for life insurance players. The embedded value is a measure used to determine the worth of a life company that factors in future liabilities based on actuarial assumptions. Of the three listed life insurers – HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life, Macquarie Research has projected 2%, 3% and 4% impact, respectively, on embedded value should Covid-related claims for FY22 be four times of FY21. The balance sheet impact of pandemic deaths is protected to a certain extent from the reinsurance that a life company purchases. While reinsurers have committed to cover the policies already sold, they are being careful in underwriting new covers. Some reinsurers have withdrawn from providing covers, while others have raised their rates. “The bigger worry for us could be the possible impact on VNB (value of the new business) margins, as reinsurance companies bear the bulk of the pain since more than 70–80% of retail individual protection is usually reinsured. As a result, reinsurance rates could go up, affecting VNB margins,” the report said. “While near term outlook could be challenging, we are structurally positive on life insurance players and believe a 20% VNB CAGR (compound annual growth rate) is sustainable over the longer term,” Macquarie research analyst Suresh Ganapathy said in the note. The other impact of the pandemic is that life insurance companies out of concerns for employees’ health are going a bit slow on soliciting new business. At the same time, companies have been cautious in respect of prospective customers’ health.

The LLR hospital sources said that the injections had been removed from the store allegedly by its nursing staff. Principal, GSVM medical college, Dr RB Kamal while talking to reporters said a three-member committee has been constituted to investigate the whole matter. “The committee will probe and submit its report soon. We have directed the authorities concerned to collect the data of Remdesivir injection. The guilty will not be spared”, he said. Remdesivir injections, the sources said, were issued in the name of four dead persons, including a female Covid patient, who had died on May 22. “As per the prescription note issued by the doctor, the female patient had died on May 22, but Remdesivir injections were issued in her name on May 26,” the sources added. To recall, the crime branch of the police on April 30 had busted a racket and arrested four persons--two nursing staff of LLR hospital and a private hospital worker--who used to sell Remdesivir in the black market. Police had identified the arrested persons as Vikram and Chetansh Chauhan, both nursing staff members of LLR, Anshul Sharma, a private hospital worker and one Ayush Kamal.A police officer from the Kakadeo police station, as a decoy customer, traced Ayush Kamal, a blackmarketteer, hailing from Vijay Nagar area of the city. In the sting operation, the police officer managed to strike a deal with Kamal for getting a vial for Rs 30,000-Rs 35,000. Subsequently, the police arrested Anshul Sharma, an employee of a private hospital. During interrogation, Kamal had revealed the names of two nursing staff members of LLR hospital involved in the racket. He told the police that LLR nursing staff member Vikram used to steal Remdevisir injections from the hospital and sell them to his staff member Chetansh for Rs 10,000 each. From Chetansh, Anshul used to buy each vial for Rs 20,000 and further sell it to him for Rs 30,000-Rs 35,000 per vial. Police later arrested Vikram, Chetansh and Ayush, who confessed to their crime. Also, not very long ago, the commissionerate police had seized 265 Remdesivir injections from the possession of three people, including a Haryana resident in the South City area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/scam-in-llr-hospital-remdesivir-injections-issued-in-name-of-dead-patients/articleshow/83492165.cms||---

---||Kolkata||US-bound students can book visa interview slots from today||KOLKATA: A senior US diplomat on Sunday assured students who have secured admission in American universities that the US mission in India will accommodate as many visa applicants as possible in July and August to facilitate their travel to the country. The embassy will start giving visa interview slots to Indian students from Monday. Student visa applicants with a cancelled appointment will need to make a new one. The visa service, other than for emergency travel, has been shut since April 28. “We intend to start an intensive two months of interviewing student visa applicants on July 1. We will plan to open as many appointments as we can safely accommodate, based on local pandemic conditions across India. Student visa applicants do not need an expedited appointment to schedule their interview. On June 14, we will open July and August appointments for students,” US embassy minister counsellor for consular affairs Don Heflin said on Sunday. While assuring students that the US embassy and regional consulates will do everything possible to ensure students with valid travel requirements were not deprived of the opportunity, he clarified that US-bound students will not require any proof of Covid-19 vaccination to enter the country. “They will only need a negative report of their Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours prior to their departure,” he said. That will come as a huge relief to nearly 2 lakh students who travel to the US for undergraduate and post-graduate programmes annually, including a few thousand from Kolkata. Even last year, when the US recorded a 43% decline in new foreign students, over half the new ones were from India and China. In the Facebook Live interaction that Heflin had conducted on Thursday to address questions from US-bound Indian students, more than 16,000 people had participated, including many from Kolkata. Among the most frequently asked questions was when slots for visa applications would open and whether students will have to be fully vaccinated at the time of departure. However, Helfin pointed out that individual institutions may set their own requirement for vaccination and advised students to consult with the host institution to ensure compliance. “The US education system operates independently from the federal government. There are more than 4,500 accredited universities in the US that operate autonomously, and the policy adopted by one school for its students and teaching community may not be the same as that for another one,” he said. Bengal has relaxed the minimum time gap between two shots and named foreign-bound students on the prior-ity list. Apart from new students, Heflin clarified that students returning to academic programmes that resume on or after August 1 will be allowed to travel to the US up to 30 days before the programmes restart. “We recommend continuing students discuss specific resumption plans with their respective universities to develop a travel timeline,” Heflin said. Visa will, however, not be issued to parents or guardians at present as tourist visa remains prohibited following a Presidential Proclamation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/us-bound-students-can-book-visa-interview-slots-from-today/articleshow/83492942.cms||---

Inaugurating the programme organized by Centre of Science and Technology For Rural Development to remember the contributions of veteran CPM leader EMS Namboodiripad, through an online platform, Yechury said the advocates of neoliberalism vehemently opposes any welfare measures for providing relief to the poor sections. Neoliberalism also seeks to reduce wages, and aggravate exploitation and inequality. The need of the hour is to step up people’s purchasing capacity, but the governments led by the admirers of neoliberalism, are unwilling to take any measures in that direction, he added. Yechury alleged that the Modi government at the Centre was decimating the secularist foundations of the country and the federal character of its Constitution. The government is destroying the nation’s education sector. The utter failure of the government measures to contain the spread of Covid exposed the limitations of the neoliberal policies, he argued. Such crises can be contained only through government’s effective interventions. Kerala government had taken effective people-oriented measures. That is why the Kerala model had won global acclaim, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/yechury-hails-states-development-model/articleshow/83492985.cms||---

Most children are asymptomatic even if they have a close or household contact with a Covid-19 positive case. Early identification of symptoms is very crucial for initiation of effective treatment. Testing is recommended ideally for all the suspected cases to avoid transmission to other household members. If Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) is reported negative, RT-PCR should be done. If symptoms are protracted and RT-PCR is negative, CT chest may be done in exceptional cases. Mild disease has early signs with no fast breathing and spo2 (>95% on room air). Moderate disease has the presence of hypoxia (spo2 90%–94% on room air). Severe disease is pneumonia with hypoxia (spo2 <90%) in room air, increased respiratory effort, grunting, severe retractions, lethargy, seizures, severe diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Critical disease is a subset of severe disease with ARDS (respiratory distress syndrome), shock, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and acute thrombosis. Management of mild cases can be done on OPD basis or at home with breastfeeding infants. No antibiotics are required, and paracetamol can be taken in case of fever. Nasal saline drops in case of nose block, Multivitamins may be given but have no proven role. Danger signs include rapid breathing, SPO2 (<95% on room air), persistent fever, lethargy, drowsiness, poor feeding. If high grade fever continues for 3-4 days, it needs to be investigated for alternate diagnosis. So, CBC, CRP, URINE R/E, blood culture, chest x-ray, ferritin, D-Dimer or LDF is recommended, whereas mild cases with comorbidities may require admission in hospital for evaluation and treatment of their comorbidities. Severe cases require admission in Covid-19 ward/PICU/HDU. Special care needs to be taken for those having comorbidities like chronic kidney disease, congenital heart disease, chronic liver disease, neuro disability, severe malnutrition, current malignancy, immune-compromised state, diabetes type-I, patients on long term steroids and HIV patients. In fact, such patients need to be regularly in touch with doctors. Parents must be careful about children’s outdoor activities and restrict physical contact with any stranger. Infants must be handled with hand hygiene. Children must be educated to practice hand hygiene and usage of masks. Vaccines should be taken by parents. The children should be vaccinated (once it is medically allowed).

Due to the exponential growth in Covid-19 cases during the second wave, within in a short span of time, hospitals are now witnessing a spurt in post-Covid complications. Not only the widely reported post-Covid mucormycosis, patients are also complaining of various symptoms such as palpitations, difficulty in breathing, brain fog, pulmonary fibrosis, fungal and bacterial infections, heart attacks, psychosis, pneumonia, kidney issues, etc. Director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr K Rambabu, said Covid-19 patients need to closely monitor their health even after discharge, particularly severe cases, diabetics, and those who required steroids and/or oxygen support during their hospital stay. “People with long Covid are experiencing different symptoms, ranging from heart palpitations and body pains to giddiness, brain fog and heart complaints. The recovered Covid-19 patients can practise mild breathing exercises, as prescribed by the treating physician, to improve their lung capacity. The post-Covid complications were also observed in the first wave,” said Dr Rambabu. The VIMS director asked patients to continue Covid-19 appropriate behaviour even after discharge. “The patients can seek mental health support service, if at all required. A holistic approach is required for follow up care and well-being of all Covid-recovered patients,” said Dr Rambabu. Consultant pulmonologist at Seven Hills Hospital, Dr Vamsi Krishna, said that post-Covid complications are mostly seen in patients who recovered from the severe form of the disease. “We are witnessing cases of mucormycosis, fungal and secondary bacterial infections and respiratory failures in patients even after recovery from Covid-19. In any case, patients should seek immediate medical intervention,” said Dr Vamsi Krishna. Dr Vamsi added that complications depend on the body’s immune response to the inflammation caused by the disease. “Mucormycosis cases are also being seen in patients who used very mild doses of steroids and non-diabetics. Covid-19, in a few cases, would lead to elevated blood sugar levels. This can increase the chance of developing an infection in a few cases,” said Dr Vamsi. Andhra Pradesh has so far reported more than 2,000 mucormycosis cases. Due to the increasing number of such cases, particularly in Covid-19 recovered patients, the state health department has added black fungus (mucormycosis) treatment under the Aarogyasri scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/second-wave-ebbs-in-ap-but-post-covid-illnesses-swell/articleshow/83492982.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

They, however, rued the non-availability of the Covid-related medicines and black fungus drugs in the market and health facilities. Dr Bimal Karak, former state president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) and former PMCH superintendent, said there is an acute shortage of Amphotericin B and Posaconazole in the state while it is being sold on black market. “How a common man can buy a single vial being sold above Rs50,000 on the black market. The Centre has taken the right step by reducing taxes, but all the medicines on which the rates have been slashed are not available in the market and should be the major concern for the government,” Dr Karak said. IMA national president-elect Dr Sahjanand Prasad Singh said all the Covid-related and black fungus drugs are very important and the government is trying to make them available in the market. Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, former president of IMA-Bihar, said the government needs to focus on manufacturing and supply chain of drugs and and ensure their availability at health facilities. Saroj Kumar, a resident of Patel Nagar said the black fungus drugs are not even available at government health facilities. “One of my friends’ relative needed Amphotericin B injection and bought two vials on the black market. “The government should streamline the supply of essential drugs,” he said. State health minister Mangal Pandey said the drugs for the treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus will be available tax free to the people. He expressed his gratitude to PM Narendra Modi and the GST council, which on Saturday slashed the tax rates on drugs related to Covid-19 and reduce taxes from 5 to 0% on Tocilizumab and Amphotericin B.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-should-ensure-cov-drug-supply-to-hosps-say-doctors/articleshow/83489131.cms||Faryal Rumi

Around 20,000 weddings are scheduled in Krishna district this month and officials are strictly monitoring the process of granting permissions for the ceremonies. The wedding season means big business for textile and cloth stores, photographers, jewellers and bands. But the second wave had dealt a blow to those dependent on the ceremonies.

To add to this, the open university is all set to spread its horizon for inmates of 13 other jails of the state who would soon be able to take admission in different degree, certificate or diploma courses, run by the lone open university of the state. The only open university of the state is already providing admission to inmates of Naini central jail in its courses. Following the encouraging results, now the university has received a request from 13 more jails of the state for opening a study centre at the respective jails so that inmates of the jail concerned can also pursue higher learning and shape their future. “The university had received a request from Central and District Prisons Agra, Central Jail Varanasi, District/Division Jail Jhansi, District/Division Jail Azamgarh, District Prison Gautam Budh Nagar, District Prison Dasna Ghaziabad, District Jail Gorakhpur, District Prison Ayodhya, Central Jail Bareilly and Bareilly II, District Prison Meerut and District prison Fatehpur," informed the vice-chancellor of UPRTOU, Prof Seema Singh. Barring Fatehpur, the university has already opened the study centre at all the above-mentioned jails and soon the study centre at the jail at Fatehpur would be opened, she added. “The jail inmates of the above-mentioned jails can take admission in any of the courses as per their eligibility in the current session, the last date for which is June 30”, said Singh. It was in the year 2019 when UPRTOU had decided to provide the opportunity to pursue higher education to prisoners serving sentences for serious crimes in Naini Central Jail. They were given a 75 per cent exemption in fee too. After seeing the tendency of the prisoners towards studies, the university, while amending the decision, decided to give completely free education to the prisoners lodged in the jails of the entire state. Following the proposals that have come to the university to provide higher education to the prisoners of different jails, we have started the process and they can take admission in the new academic session, said the VC. Course material will also be made available to the prisoners at the respective jails after admission is confirmed, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/uprtou-to-offer-inmates-of-14-jails-across-state-the-gift-of-learning/articleshow/83492201.cms||---
---||Patna||JD(U) wants ‘respectable share’ in Union cabinet: RCP Singh||PATNA: Being the biggest BJP ally in the NDA, Bihar’s ruling JD(U) has once again revived its demand of “proportional representation” in the Union cabinet. Sources said JD(U)’s top leadership has conveyed to the BJP that CM Nitish Kumar’s party would join the Union cabinet only when it was offered a “proportional representation” in the Narendra Modi cabinet. JD(U) has 16 Lok Sabha members from Bihar. In 2019, JD(U) had refused to join the Modi cabinet after the BJP offered it only one berth as a ‘symbolic representation’ to its all allies. Then, the LJP having six Lok Sabha members from Bihar, had accepted the formula of symbolic representation and its founder (now late) Ram Vilas Paswan took oath as the cabinet minister. But Nitish, the then JD(U) president, declined the offer, saying the allies should be given ‘proportional representation’ in the Union cabinet. A senior JD(U) leader, who did not want to be identified, pointed out that the BJP has 17 members in the current Lok Sabha from Bihar and the party has five ministers (three cabinet and two state ministers) in the Modi government. “On the same pattern, the BJP leadership should provide at least five berths to JD(U) as it has 16 Lok Sabha members from the state,” he told TOI on Sunday. He said our leader Nitish Kumar always batted for “proportional representation” and never favoured “symbolic representation”. However, JD(U) national president and Rajya Sabha member RCP Singh talked about a “respectable share” in the Modi cabinet on Saturday when reporters asked him whether JD(U) would join the Union cabinet. “We are a part of the NDA. .....all constituents deserve a respectable share (in the Union cabinet),” Singh told mediapersons at the JD(U)’s state office here. When asked whether JD(U) would “demand” a respectable share for itself in the expected expansion of the Union cabinet, Singh quipped, “Where is the question of demanding? It is a matter of understanding. It has to be natural.” Sources said JD(U) wants at least four berths in the Union cabinet. “If it is offered four berths, leaders like RCP Singh, Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, Purnia MP Santosh Kushwaha and Rajya Sabha member Ramnath Thakur may get a chance to become the members of Modi cabinet,” another JD(U) leader said. On Sunday, RCP refused to comment whether LJP chief Chirag Paswan would be inducted into the Modi cabinet in the upcoming expansion. Some leaders from Bihar BJP may also be included in the Union cabinet. Speculations are rife about former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and state BJP chief Dr Sanjay Jaiswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-wants-respectable-share-in-union-cabinet-rcp/articleshow/83490538.cms||Madan Kumar

Deans of all faculties, student welfare, recruitment and heads of some departments are preparing the draft of the four-year UG courses which will be implemented in all streams – arts, commerce and science – from the next academic session which begins in September. LU has already modified its postgraduate courses as per the NEP. Like the PG courses, UG courses will be multi-disciplinary, allowing students of one stream to choose some subjects of another stream as a paper during the course. Besides theoretical and practical knowledge, vocational skills will also be imparted. There will also be the mandatory provision of internship. The course will have multiple entry and exit options for students. This means students can the exit the course whenever they like and enter again as per their convenience. A student completing a year will get a certificate, an advanced diploma after two years, a bachelor degree after three years, and a bachelor with research degree after four years As per the plan, the four-year UG course comprising eight semesters will be of 192 credits. Each semester will be of 24 credits. According to the University Grants Commission, a credit is 15 hours of theoretical and 30 hours of practical teaching. A credit is a unit by which the course work is measured. It determines the number of hours of instructions required per week. The content of the course will be decided later because at present there is dispute over implementation of the common minimum syllabus proposed by the state government. LU vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai said, “The entry and exit option will give students autonomy in planning their careers. For example, due to some unforeseen life event or financial or family problems, students, at times, have to drop out. However, under the new system, students will be able to continue studies despite a break. Students can also use the break for other activities like acquiring skills or to gain work experience.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nep-based-ug-courses-in-lu-from-sept/articleshow/83494677.cms||---

By month-end Ashapur railway overbridge, connecting the city with Ghazipur highway, will be opened for public. Besides, before the end of 2021, the Lehatara-Phulwaria-JP Mehta Intermediate College four-lane by-pass road and Babatpur-Kapsethi-Bhadohi highway will also start, giving the much needed relief to commuters. The work on three bridges on the Varuna and four railway overbridges, totalling Rs 320 crores, will also be completed by then. TOI on Sunday took stock of major projects launched to end traffic woes of the city. Officials said that problems of commuters, who have to travel miles on diverted routes to reach Ghazipur highway, would finally end by next month as the three-lane Ashapur railway overbridge at railway crossing number 20 has reached final stages. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “This railway overbridge had been sanctioned in January 2018 with a budget of Rs 50.17 crores. The work on the project is almost over and only finishing touches are being given. It might be opened for public use by month-end.” The construction work at Ashapur railway crossing was posing difficulty to people especially to drivers of heavy vehicles going towards Ghazipur highway. They had to take a long route via Sarnath to reach the Ghazipur highway. The four-lane Lahartara-Phulwaria-JP Mehta Intermediate College four-lane by-pass road, which was sanctioned in October 2017 to reduce traffic load on Andhrapul and Chowkaghat crossings by giving a direct connectivity to commuters between Kutchehri and Lehartara, Manduadih, Jagatpur and areas along the GT Road by curtailing travelling distance, will also be completed by December end. The project was facing issues in the land acquisition process. “Now, over 95% land issues have been cleared and the entire land would be acquired by month-end. The project would also finish by December end,” said the commissioner. The construction work on an ROB on railway crossing number four, costing Rs 88.46 crores, is over 47% complete, while about 80 per cent work has been done on another ROB at railway crossing number 5C on Lahartara-Phulwaria-JP Mehta Intermediate College by-pass road, totalling Rs 62.32 crores. Similarly, over 80 per cent work has been finished on a bridge on the Varuna, linking Konia Ghat with Salarpur road. The project, totalling Rs 26.21 crores, will be completed by September end after which the traffic load on Puranapul will reduce considerably, the commissioner added. Problems being faced by commuters on Babatpur-Kapasethi-Bhadohi road will also over by December end as construction works on four-lane ROB on Northern Railway's link No. 21A / 2T of Rs 38.11 crores and Kalikadham two-lane bridge on the Varuna of Rs 19.14 crores are nearing completion. However, wait for a smooth ride on Badauchungi-Ashapur road via Kazzakpura will take time as the work on railway overbridge on railway link number 23A on Varanasi city-Sarnath rail route is only 5% complete. This would complete by March 22 next year. This project had been sanctioned in February 2019 with a budget of Rs 62.79 crores.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/4-robs-3-bridges-set-toend-traffic-woes-of-city/articleshow/83491515.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The early arrival of southwest monsoon in Bihar has made the condition favourable for the farmers to sow paddy seeds. The department has set the target to distribute 1.13 lakh quintals of paddy seeds, including 10,000 quintals of hybrid seeds (DRRH3, DRRH2, 27P31 and Arize) and the remaining of open pollinated variety seeds (IR-64, Swarna MTU-7029 and Sabour Shree). Under its home delivery scheme, the districts have distributed seeds to 56,000 farmers against 1.60 lakh registration. So far, 26,000 quintal of seeds have been distributed to the farmers by the district agriculture officers since May 28. Aadesh Titarmare, agriculture director and in-charge managing director of Bihar Rajya Beej Nigam Limited, said the department has received 12 lakh applications from farmers for paddy seeds on subsidy. “The district agriculture officers would select the eligible candidates and then distribute the seeds accordingly. We have to achieve our target of seed distribution by June 30,” he said. Titarmare also said the department has decided to start the early sowing of kharif crops in order to give one month window before wheat plantation begins. “Earlier, we used to distribute seeds till mid-July. However, this time we will complete distribution by June 30. Due to late kharif cultivation, the farmers burned their crop residual to start sowing wheat on time. Analysing the climate fluctuations under our Climate Resilient Agriculture Programme, the department decided for early sowing to stop this practice of burning of crop residues,” he said. For the distribution of fertilizers, agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh would hold a meeting with the supplier companies on Monday. The state government would adopt zero-tolerance policy against overcharging and black marketing of fertilizers. The agriculture experts feel the farmers in Bihar would get good output in this kharif season due to early arrival of monsoon, widespread rain and early sowing of paddy seeds. Abdus Sattar, agro meteorologist at Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, said pre-monsoon showers have prepared the fields for cultivation of kharif crops as moisture level in the soil was good after May 27. “Due to good rainfall, farmers would not have to spend money on diesel to run water pumps,” he said. “At the university, we have prepared a model for rice cultivation and analysed that the early sowing of paddy seeds would benefit the farmers as they would get good return and their crop would be matured by mid-September. It would give them enough time for wheat cultivation in November,” Sattar said. As far as rainfall is concerned, Khagaria witnessed the maximum 47mm rain whereas Patna recorded 43.8mm downpour in the past 24 hours, closely followed by 18.8mm rainfall in Chappra and 14.6mm in Bhagalpur. Light to moderate rainfall occurred at many places over north-central and south-west Bihar and at most places over rest parts of the state during past 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/agriculture-dept-to-distribute-1-13l-quintals-of-paddy-seeds-by-june-30/articleshow/83490381.cms||Faryal Rumi

Domi Paswan, a resident of Nawada Bazaar locality in Banka district, had taken the body of his son, Mithilesh Kumar, to the Bhagalpur burning ghat after the latter died at a hospital here. The ‘dom raja’ and others at the ghat initially demanded Rs 1 lakh from the family to perform the last rites. They later settled for Rs 11,000. However, as Paswan was unable to pay even Rs 11,000, the family took the body to Kahalgaon in a three-wheeler and disposed it of in the Ganga. Owner of a timber shop at burning ghat in Kahalgaon, Dilip Kumar Singh, said the body tied with a banana tree was disposed of in the midstream of the Ganga. Deputy municipal commissioner of Bhagalpur Municipal Corporation, Satyendra Prasad Verma, said he has no information about the matter. “Proper arrangements have been made at the burning ghat. My cellphone number is also on display at the ghat. Nobody called me. We are gathering details and an inquiry would be ordered if needed,” Verma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/asked-to-pay-rs1l-man-disposes-of-sons-body-in-ganga-at-kahalgaon/articleshow/83490610.cms||Kumar Rajesh

---||Coimbatore||Lockdown in Tamil Nadu-hit industries in first gear||COIMBATORE: While the state government has allowed the export and auxiliary units, and industries producing essential items to operate with 25% workforce from Monday, industrialists are staring at challenges like constantly rising raw material prices, labour shortage and financial problems induced by the lockdown. A recent government order has allowed the export units, which have commitments or orders and their vendor units to function with 25% of workers in Coimbatore and 10 other districts, where Covid-19 cases are considerably high. The government has also permitted continuous processing industries and those manufacturing essential commodities to function by adhering to the standard operating procedures and other Covid-19 related guidelines. According to sources, at least 40% of the industries are likely to be resume operations in the district from Monday. M V Ramesh Babu, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia), said one of the major issues they were facing was soaring prices of raw materials. “Even during the lockdown, when most of the industries were not functioning and there was no demand for the raw materials, the price had gone up by 10% to 12%.” He said the steel price had shot up to Rs 80,000 per tonne from Rs 72,000 and was likely to increase further. “While accepting orders, industries agree to manufacture the items for a rate based on the prevailing price of raw materials. When the price increases significantly, industries incur losses,” he said. J James, district president, Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, said the price of raw materials like stainless steel rod, cast iron, brass, gunmetal and pig iron had increased by 60% to 80% in the past one year, while materials like plastic had become costlier by 150%. “For more than six months, we have been seeking the intervention of the Union government to control the price rise by forming a committee for the same. We haven’t received any positive responses so far. It is really disappointing,” he said. Pointing out that most of the guest workers had gone back to their native places during the lockdown, James said the industries were staring at labour shortage presently. “Since the government has allowed us to operate with only 25% of the workforce, it would not be an issue now. But when we start to operate in a full-fledged manner, labour shortage is going to hit us badly.” Expressing hope that most of the guest workers would return in another one and half months, the Codissia president said many of them had already started inquiring about reopening of industries to plan their return travel. K V Karthik, president, Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association, said they were also facing financial crunch. “Though we were not functioning for the past one month, we had to meet 25% of regular expenses like wages to the workers and loan repayments from our pockets. As a result, our fund flow is interrupted. We need capital amount to resume the business.” They said without the government support, it was impossible for them to survive the present situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lockdown-hit-industries-in-first-gear/articleshow/83494415.cms||Nivedha Selvam

This was evident when all the five MLAs of AIMIM led by the party’s state chief Akhtarul Iman met Osama Shahab, son of former RJD MP late Md Shahabuddin, at the latter’s Pratappur village in Siwan on Saturday. The AIMIM leaders had gone to Osama’s house to console the bereaved family members. However, they couldn’t meet Shahabuddin’s wife Heena Shahab due to traditional restrictions on meeting with outsiders after husband’s death for 40 days. The AIMIM leaders stayed with Osama for about an hour and discussed the political scenario in the state. After the meeting, Akhtarul told mediapersons that he has offered Osama to join AIMIM. “I think Obama and his mother Heena Shahab will take a decision in a few days. We have conveyed our leader’s message to the family,” he added. Akhtarul also lashed out at the state government for sending Shahabuddin from Bhagalpur central jail to Tihar jail in Delhi citing law and order problem as reason. The AIMIM leaders who met Osama included Amour MLA Akhtarul Iman, Jokihat MLA Shahnawaz Alam, Bahadurganj MLA Anjar Naimi, Kochadhaman MLA Izhar Asharaf, party’s state youth wing president Adil Hasan and Siwan district president Arif Jamal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aimim-netas-meet-shahabus-son-offer-him-to-join-party/articleshow/83490761.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||Bihar: Man & son held for killing 18-year-old neighbour in Vaishali district||PATNA: One Ranjeet Rai (50) and his elder son Vikash Rai (27) were arrested late Saturday night for allegedly kidnapping and killing their 18-year-old neighbour Mohammad Jasleem. They hail from village Panapur Gaurahi under Sadar police station area of Hajipur in Vaishali ditrict. Sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal on Sunday said both sides had a dispute as Jasleem’s mother used to keep goats and other animals on Ranjeet’s land. But preliminary investigation indicates that the youth might have been murdered for his alleged love affair with Ranjeet’s daughter. “Jasleem’s decomposed body was found from a canal located one kilometre away from the village on June 11. He had gone missing on June 9 night. However, family members had not reported the matter to police until the body was recovered,” he said. Dayal said Jasleem was a painter by profession. He said Jasleem’s father Mohammad Islam had lodged an FIR against Ranjeet’s younger son Akash Rai and one Bhola Paswan along with Ranjeet and Vikash for killing his son after calling him from their residence. “Bhola and Akash are evading arrest. Jasleem’s cellphone has not been recovered yet,” he said. Dayal said three days before Jasleem went missing, his father had filed a petition before the CJM court in Hajipur that they feared for their life from Ranjeet and his family. “Another angle in this case is that the petition was filed at the behest of one Prabhat Rai of the village, who had rivalry with Ranjeet,” Dayal said. Police will also investigate the murder case from this angle. Dayal said that police are awaiting the postmortem report of Jasleem to know how he was murdered. He said detailed investigation is required in this murder case for digging out the truth that who killed Jasleem and exactly for what reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/man-son-held-for-killing-youth/articleshow/83490819.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The researchers of M S University have developed a novel drug carrier that reduces the side effects of drugs, especially anti-cancer drugs consumed by cancer patients. The drug carrier not only ensures targeted delivery on cancerous cells but is also non-toxic making the medicines much safer for patients. The researchers of the chemistry department of MSU’s Faculty of Science have bagged Indian patent for their invention — ‘novel class of supramolecular compounds: compounds of formula (Ia) and formula (Ib)’. The drug carrier has been prepared from a compound which is also present in turmeric, the Indian spice known for its powerful medicinal values. “The drug carrier is synthesized from synthetic curcumin analogues. Curcumin is a naturally-occurring chemical compound found in turmeric. Being a curcumin analogue, the drug carrier is non-toxic and reduces the local toxicity of anti-cancer drugs after encapsulation,” said Dr Arpita Desai, who along with her PhD student, Priyanka Mathur, has bagged the patent. “It is a versatile carrier and is suitable for encapsulation of various types of drugs but specifically the anti-cancer drugs like methotrexate, flutamide, nilutamide, cis-platin among others. We have studied suitability of these anti-cancer drugs for their encapsulation in this drug carrier,” Desai said. The carrier provides sustained release of encapsulated drugs which further reduces the need for frequent dosage. “As pH of cancerous cells is lower as compared to normal cells, the drug carriers are designed in such a way that it selectively releases the drug to tumour cells rather than normal cells. Hence, the side effects of the anti-cancer drugs get reduced,” she said. Since a patent has been granted, the researchers will now approach firms so that the product can be commercially exploited and used in manufacturing of anti-cancer medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cancer-patients-can-hope-for-fewer-side-effects-of-drugs/articleshow/83492102.cms||Prashant Rupera

Over three lakh small and big traders have been severely affected in the Sangam city due to the lockdown and are seeking revival package and rebate in taxes to survive. Traders also sought a rebate in taxes from the state government as well as the central government claiming that their economic condition is in dire straits despite relaxation in the Covid curfew since June 1. Shushil Kharbanda, president of Civil Lines Vyapaar Mandal told TOI, “Traders community has not only faced huge economic losses in the second Covid wave due to the lockdown but there were many traders who tested positive for Covid-19 infection and spent money worth four to five lakhs for their treatment also”. He further added, "As all businesses, except those who are in the category of emergency services, were closed during the lockdown, the traders had to bear all financial burdens like shop rent, electricity bills, employees salaries, commercial tax etc. Once the lockdown was relaxed and shops were allowed to open from 7am to 7pm, the absence of customers has not only left traders puzzled but also compounded their woes. The traders' community is still facing the aftermath of lockdown. Kharbanda, meanwhile, said, "Traders dealing in cloths and footwear business were worst affected and suffered huge business losses during the lockdown. As the wedding season passed off without economic activities during the lockdown, traders dealing in footwear and cloths business are still finding it difficult to cope up with the existing expenses. “Our entire market was shut during the lockdown. We have our family liabilities to take care of and we have nothing to do to earn money” said a trader at the Civil Lines market adding that the nominal assistance the governments can do is provide an economic package to the traders who have suffered losses during the lockdown,” he added. “Last year, traders faced a similar situation and exhausted our savings to survive. Now, when things turned better after past August month, another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic this year hit the entire country and we faced one more lockdown with minimal savings,” said another trader. Traders associated with Prayag Vyapaar Mandal said, “In such crises, governments must come forward to help traders and pause the taxes at least for six months so that we can recover from the losses once the economic activities get better or back to normal." Traders' unions have, however, demanded that the state government allow the opening of shops from 9am to 9pm so that customers could arrive at markets during evening hours and help traders do brisk business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/traders-seek-economic-package-to-make-up-for-the-losses/articleshow/83490617.cms||---

It wasn’t a political prank, but the coming together of a peculiarly named couple whose wedding invitation drew the attention of many on social media. Socialism and Mamta Banerjee tied the knot at a low-key function after the news of them getting married went viral on social media. Tamil Nadu’s secretary of CPI presided over the marriage function. The groom is A M Socialism, son of A Mohan who belongs to a traditional CPI family, while the bride is Mamta Banerjee, daughter of K Palanisamy-P Neelambal from a Congress family. Only a few members of both the bride and groom’s family attended the marriage. Socialism married Mamta in the presence of his brothers, Communism and Leninism, and nephew Marxism. “We have received thousands of congratulatory messages from known and unknown people till this minute,” the couple said. “I started realising the power of my name only after ‘Didi’ became the chief minister of West Bengal,” Mamta said. “I named my sons Communism, Leninism and Socialism after many noted that communism died following the collapse of the Soviet Union,” said Mohan, district CPI secretary. Communism is a lawyer, while his siblings run a silver anklet manufacturing unit. “Me and my brothers faced a lot of humiliation because of our names during our school days,” said Socialism.

The complainant alleged that the man claimed he was a central government officer and he could get the license using his contacts. After taking money from the complainant, the man issued a fake license, the police said. The complainant’s father runs a shop in Kothrud and the family owns property in Beed district. When contacted, he refused to comment as the case is under investigation. Senior inspector Neelima Pawar of Shivajinagar police station said, “The victim had borrowed money from his father and sold a piece of land in Beed to collect the money for the liquor license. He had approached us about three months ago when we recorded his statement and started a preliminary inquiry into the matter. We have registered a formal FIR on Saturday.” According to the police, the suspect met the complainant in January last year and represented himself as an assistant commissioner with a central government organisation. The woman claimed she was the officer’s wife. Police said the victim met the couple after coming to know that the officer was in Pune and wanted to settle down in the city. “The couple told him that they wanted to buy a flat in Hadapsar and were in need of money. They promised to give him license of a liquor shop against the money,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/couple-cheat-kothrud-man-of-rs-40-43l-booked/articleshow/83494471.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Residential areas face flood threat from twin reservoirs||HYDERABAD: Residential areas of Bandlaguda, Asifnagar, Shaikpet and adjoining areas, located along Musi river, are likely to face floods this rainy season also if the authorities release excess inflows from Himayathsagar reservoir to the downstream in the event of incessant rains. Nine months ago, several houses were inundated and residents spent sleepless nights and were rendered homeless in flashfloods after the floodgates of Himayathsagar were opened to let out the excess water. Sources said the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is closely monitoring the water levels in the twin reservoirs of Himayathsagar and Osmansagar. “Based on the rise in the water levels, the HMWS&SB will swing into action to take precautionary measures to tackle the flood situation in coordination with revenue, police and irrigation departments and GHMC,” sources said. The flooding problem is partly accentuated by HMWS&SB drawing only a meagre quantity of water from both the reservoirs and depending more on Krishna and Godavari water supplies to meet city consumers’ demand. The full tank level (FTL) of Himayathsagar is 1,763 ft and the water level (as on Thursday) stood at 1,759 ft. Similarly, the water level in Osmansagar is at 1,782 ft (FTL 1,790 ft). “Currently, the board is drawing 5 MGD from Osmansagar and another 6 MGD of water from Himayathsagar as the entire city is getting Godavari and Krishna water,” an official explained. The HMWS&SB used to draw 25 MGD from Osmansagar and 15 MGD from Himayathsagar to meet the city’s drinking water demand. “We will use the water of these twin reservoirs only if Krishna, Godavari, Manjira and Singur sources dry up to cater to Greater Hyderabad and its peripheral areas,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residential-areas-face-flood-threat-from-twin-reservoirs/articleshow/83492977.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Trichy||Now, Gandhi market traders in Trichy plump for vaccination||TRICHY: The special vaccination camp organised for the vegetable and fruits traders in Gandhi market saw the traders with their families actively taking the jabs irrespective of age. Since the urban local body and district administration have informed that those who were vaccinated will only be permitted to resume business once the Gandhi market reopens, the traders volunteered to take the jab. The congested market was closed on May 15, and the retail and wholesale operations were moved temporarily to West Boulevard as the city started witnessing a sharp spurt in fresh cases. The cases began declining in the first week of June, and the traders’ associations started demanding to reopen the Gandhi market. However, the district administration said that no concrete decision was taken on reopening the market that attracts thousands of traders and workers from various parts of the state. The authorities have instructed the traders to get vaccinated against Covid-19 before demanding to reopen the market. The traders were indirectly told that only those who have provisional vaccination certificates will be permitted to resume business once the market reopens. “This has encouraged a lot of traders to get vaccinated. They took photographs, while getting the jab, as a proof,” H Ramachandran, a vegetable vendor in Gandhi market, said. The traders demanded the acknowledgement message in their mobile numbers after getting the jab. Close to 950 people were vaccinated in the Gandhi market special camp in the past two days, while hundreds of traders and families received the jab at their nearest vaccination centres across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/now-gandhi-mkt-traders-plump-for-vaccination/articleshow/83494463.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fresh inflows into major reservoirs likely in 10 days||Hyderabad: All major drinking water sources like Manjeera, Singur, Osmansagar and Himayathsagar are likely to get fresh inflows in next 10 days. These reservoirs along with water from Krishna and Godavari rivers meet the drinking water requirements of Greater Hyderabad and its peripheral areas. Officials said if the upstream areas record continuous rainfall over the next week, water levels in Manjeera and Singur will go up considerably. The water level at Singur currently stands at 1,707 ft (full tank level 1,717 ft), while in Manjeera, the water level is at 1,642 ft (FTL 1,661 ft). Currently, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) supplies 508 million gallons of water a day through these drinking water sources to meet the demands of one crore population in Greater Hyderabad and its periphery on alternate days. Due to heavy and excess rainfall during the last monsoon, all the drinking water sources were filled to the brim and the water board could easily supply potable water. As per the population projection, the board is supposed to supply 609 MGD daily, but due to lack of infrastructure like service reservoirs and water supply network, it could not ensure the supplies and stuck to 508 MGD only. There was a dip in water levels of Godavari and Krishna for eight months between October 2020 and till date. However, the water board said it is confident of managing the supplies for next two summers as well. The water board is also drawing 35 MGD from Manjeera and Singur to meet the demands of industrial and domestic consumption under Mission Bhagiratha to ensure potable water to every household.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fresh-inflows-into-major-reservoirs-likely-in-10-days/articleshow/83492979.cms||---

Although the bail applications of the two inmates were rejected by the court, the jailor misunderstood the documents and released the two. Sources said that Ariyalur police had arrested 30 people, charged with bootlegging illicit liquor, during the lockdown. While the advocates of five of the accused involved in the same bootlegging case managed to get bail for three from the Jayankondam court on Saturday, the sub-jail authorities in Jayakondam released all the five assuming that the bail was obtained for all those involved. Only after verifying the bail documents, the jail authorities found that two were released while their bail application was dismissed. A search for the two accused was launched. The two were arrested by the Ariyalur police near Kaikaati in Jayankondam on Sunday. In the inquiry conducted by the Trichy central prison authorities, lapses were found in releasing the inmates without securing bail. Subsequently, Natarajan, jailor of Jayankondam sub-jail, was suspended for negligence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/jailor-releases-two-inmates-mistakenly-suspended/articleshow/83494470.cms||---
---||Trichy||Rural primary health centres impress as 14,280 in Trichy take jabs||TRICHY: Better planning by health officials in rural Trichy has compensated for the hiccups and lapses faced in the vaccination drive in the city, putting the district only behind Chennai in the number of people who got the jab on Sunday. While the mismanagement continued in Trichy city, the drive was seamless in the rural pockets. In all, 14,280 people got the jabs in the district, the highest so far in a day, thanks also to the increased awareness about vaccination. As people were constantly sent away by UPHCs managed by Trichy corporation citing insufficient stock, a section of people preferred to get vaccinated in the rural PHCs with ease. “Since the UPHCs in the city were not responding and as there was confusion, our relatives told us that there was less crowd in the rural PHC. Two of my family members travelled to Keeranur and took the shots,” Krishna Kumar, a resident of Woraiyur, said. While there was no information on the vaccination drive from the city corporation, the district administration said all 18 UPHCs will vaccinate the public irrespective of age. Earlier, as the UPHCs were vaccinating only 45+, those below the age were unaware of the development. Similarly, the UPHC at Beerangikulam had remained closed for vaccination on Sunday. Instead, the health workers used the public park nearby for vaccination but there was no prior information to the public who returned after seeing the closed doors of the UPHC. Srirangam zonal corporation office that earlier sent people back citing insufficient stock, later invited people to utilise the opened vials. In rural Trichy, the health department utilised their stocks for all 14 blocks while an additional batch was given to Thuraiyur and Musiri. The utilisation of colleges and schools for the drive helped people to gather in significant numbers unlike in Trichy urban. “We are trying our best to avoid vaccinating people in the rural PHCs. Colleges and schools were preferred as RT-PCR sample collection is under way in PHCs. We are expecting a fresh dose of both Covaxin and Covishield on Monday and vaccination will continue,” a senior health official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rural-phcs-impress-as-14-3k-in-trichy-take-jabs/articleshow/83494467.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Trichy’s solar power generation waiting for Tangedco approval||TRICHY: Trichy’s first solar power park at Panjappur, the work on which was completed about six months ago, is yet to start electricity generation pending approval from the Tangedco. The smart cities mission project, which will reduce the operational and maintenance cost of Trichy Corporation by selling electricity to Tangedco, is idle at present and seems to be delaying the expansion plans. The plant was set up by the corporation under the non-conventional electricity generation proposal on the Trichy-Madurai NH near the sewage treatment plant at Panjappur spending Rs 13.50 crore. The work, started in December 2019, was completed in December 2020. The 2.4-MW power plant, having around 7,200 solar panels affixed on 1,440 foundations installed at a depth of 2 metres, will supply electricity to the Crawford substation of Tangedco. Even the subsurface transmission lines between the solar power park and the substation for a length of over 2 km was installed. While the facility was to start generating electricity by January 2021, sources confirmed that the park is idle, while the corporation is spending money for maintenance. For the purpose of cleaning the dirt accumulated in the panels, the civic body has dug four borewells on the site. The electricity generated from the 13-acre solar plant will be fed to the power grid. In return, the corporation will get equal compensation, while paying its electricity charge. The civic body sources said that they are awaiting approval from the non-conventional energy sources wing of Tangedco to start electricity generation. “Due to the pandemic, there was a slight delay in obtaining the approval. We are at it to start electricity generation,” an official with Trichy Corporation said.  Meanwhile, the delay in commissioning the solar power park also derails the progress of phase II of the solar power park proposed on the adjacent land. Around 26 acres of land was identified on the Madurai NH for the 7.2-MW expansion plant. Officials attributed the delay to the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-solar-power-generation-waiting-for-tangedco-approval/articleshow/83494442.cms||Deepak Karthik

The university failed on most crucial fronts such as academics and administration, said a report on the varsity tabled by CAG in the House on Thursday . KAU did not appoint ‘officers of the university’ in the prescribed manner. Teaching staff were nominated to these posts with full additional charge. These arrangements contributed significantly to KAU’s non-compliance with various University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations governing it and applicable guidelines of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the report said. The report pointed out that information furnished by KAU to the National Agricultural Education Accreditation Board (NAEAB), the accreditation agency for agricultural universities, during the accreditation process had factual inaccuracies. “It established a new College of Agriculture in Ambalavayal, Wayanad, without the minimum requirements prescribed by ICAR. The university’s integrated Master’s Degree Programme in Climate Change Adaptation instituted in 2010 was being run without any permanent faculty since the inception of the programme as it had not framed statutes for recruiting them,” said the report. The university did not comply with the relevant UGC regulations regarding the award of PhD degrees and recruitment of both regular and contract teaching staff. “The research product of the university, in terms of number and quality of research papers published in scientific journals by its faculty, were below the prescribed benchmark and this adversely affected its ranking by ICAR. Over a third of its faculty members had not authored or co-authored any research papers during the period 2014 to 2018,” it said. The popularization of new varieties of crops developed by the university was adversely affected due to non-initiation of measures to get these varieties notified under the Seeds Act, 1966. KAU had not taken measures to protect new varieties of crops developed by it under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act, 2001, said the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cag-flags-widespread-irregularities-in-kau/articleshow/83493032.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Although the hills were drenched with a few good heavy showers in May, the onset of the monsoon has brought cheer to the locals. With continuous rain throughout the day on Sunday, Ooty and its surroundings witnessed typical monsoon mist coupled with wind and cold. According to the horticulture department, it is to be observed to see the consistency of the rain pattern to establish it as a monsoon. While Ooty received 3.6mm of rainfall up to 4pm on Sunday, Naduvattam registered 10mm, Upper Bhavani 42mm, Avalanche 35mm, and Pandalur 25mm. The maximum temperature recorded in Ooty was 15 degrees Celsius. Heavy rain in May damaged a few farmlands with standing crops such as cabbage in Kotagiri and Coonoor taluks. “The rain will help in the process of applying manure in tea gardens and facilitate the land preparation work for the forthcoming autumn planting,” a horticulture official said. According to an official of the Ooty municipality, the previous showers in May and the onset of monsoon would facilitate the improvement of the water levels in the local reservoirs. Hence, the supply of drinking water in Ooty town will significantly improve. M Krishnamurthi, a farmer from Gudalur, said, “The rain would facilitate the paddy fields as well as tea estates in Gudalur and Pandalur areas.” However, J Murthy, a farmer from Kotagiri said, “Heavy unusual showers in May deterred us from harvesting. The ‘June-patta’ is getting postponed now.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/southwest-monsoon-arrives-in-nilgiris/articleshow/83494474.cms||---

Apart from these, Sangli, Jalgaon and Ahmednagar districts have also been randomly selected for the crucial exercise to test antibodies that determine past infection due to Covid-19. Beed district health officer Radhakrishna Pawar on Sunday said the sero survey will be conducted at 11 identified locations including rural and urban clusters and one state-run district hospital. “The periodic sero surveys, for which districts are selected randomly, are very essential to have a fine understanding of the spread of Covid. The crucial exercise cannot be completed without the support of the public. We appeal to the citizens from the identified clusters to join the survey without any stigma or fear,” he said. As per official data, Beed district will have a maximum of eight clusters from rural areas under the sero survey and two clusters from urban areas. Nanded and Parbhani districts will have eight clusters each from rural areas and two each from urban areas. The ICMR- National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) has been identified as the nodal institute to conduct the fourth sero survey in Maharashtra. The staff of the National TB Prevalence Survey will be participating in the sero survey among others. The sero survey involves testing of blood samples to detect the presence of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that determine a past infection due to Covid. “The sero survey is known to a section of the public. Anticipating resistance from some, especially those from rural areas, we have asked ground-level staff to carry out public awareness,” health authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-marathwada-dists-in-4th-sero-survey/articleshow/83487825.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After the party veterans and loyalists forum, now Bhadrachalam MLA Podem Veeraiah has written a letter to the party high command to appoint a president who has a track record of faith in Congress ideology and is loyal to the Gandhi family. Sangareddy MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy too has written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi not to delay further the appointment of the TPCC chief and give him an opportunity to lead the party to victory in 2023 assembly elections. “If not the TPCC president’s post, at least give me a working president post,” he said. The two MLAs are against A Revanth Reddy being given the top post in the state Congress. Though both of them refused to comment on their future course of action, sources close to them did not rule out the possibility of the two legislators quitting the party. On his part, party veteran V Hanumanth Rao wrote a second letter to Sonia Gandhi stating that the self-respect of seniors and loyalists of the Congress who have been working for decades would be hurt if a newcomer is given the TPCC chief’s post. “Don’t depend only on the report of AICC in-charge of Telangana, Manickam Tagore,” he urged Sonia Gandhi. An AICC leader did not rule out the possibility of a new TPCC chief being finalised this week or after the party leadership sets things right in Punjab and UP. If Revanth is not given TPCC chief’s post, he is tipped to be campaign committee chairman and lead the party in 2023 assembly polls in that capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delay-in-naming-pcc-chief-creates-rift-in-party/articleshow/83492986.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||More time for Huzurabad bypoll will help TRS settle: BJP||HYDERABAD: With a high stakes bypoll set to take place in Huzurabad, BJP’s state unit has started drawing up plans with the party’s national leadership. Earlier, the party had benefited from national general secretary Bhupender Yadav’s campaigning for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls. This time, national joint secretary (organisation) Shivprakash and other strategists who were active during the West Bengal elections will be directing party efforts for Huzurabad. This time, BJP will look to mainly focus on campaigning at the micro-level on the ground. Party sources believe the Huzurabad bypoll will take place around October along with elections in other states. While a by-election can take place within six months’ time, the saffron party’s think tank is of the opinion that having an early election can help the party. “More time (for the election) will give TRS time to settle. We want the election to happen when the heat generated through the resignation of Eatala Rajender is still on,” a top BJP functionary said. Senior functionaries of the saffron party were initially apprehensive about the Huzurabad bypoll as they felt the party had lost the momentum — gained through performances in Dubbak and GHMC — in the Nagarjunasagar bypolls. The Nagarjunasagar bypolls saw no party bigwigs campaign unlike the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls where even party’s national president came down to campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-more-time-for-huzurabad-bypoll-will-help-trs-settle/articleshow/83492990.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

It isn’t, however, known whether it’s a government or private job. Sowmiya, a BE computer science graduate, lives with her father, a retired employee of Aavin. She has two elder sisters, who are married off. Her mother had died last year. She had handed over a letter, along with the chain, to Stalin stating she couldn’t land a job and was struggling to run the family, as her father had spent all his retirement benefits on her mother, who died of pneumonia on March 12, 2020. Sowmiya had said she was donating the gold chain to the relief fund, as she did not have any money with her. Stalin read the letter and promised a job for her based on her educational qualification.

Recently, deputy chief minister Pawar had identified an alternate site, comprising seven villages in Purandar and three in Baramati. The state government submitted this proposal for the Centre’s approval, and sources in the loop said the airport was expected to become operational in under three years. “We are looking at February 2024. We are sure there would be no problems with land acquisition,” the source said. The previous, BJP-led government had approved moving the project to Purandar in October 2016, after attempts to acquire land in Khed failed due to protests by landowners. The then government had expected the airport to become operational by late 2020, before officials’ efforts were stymied by protests from landowners from seven villages — Pargaon, Udachiwadi, Munjwadi, Ekhatpuri, Khanauri, Vanpuri, and Kumbharvan. Last year, newly elected Purandar MLA Sanjay Jagtap had championed an effort to change the site, this time to the area covered by Mavadi, Pimpri, Rajuri, Naygaon, Rise, Pise, and Pandeshwar villages. Villagers from this site too are against the project. “Due to the pandemic, no government officials have come to our villages. We will not allow our land to be taken. We have formed a committee and have written to senior officials and politicians,” Mahesh Kad, resident of Naygaon, said. Landowners from the three villages in Baramati — Changurwadi, Bhondwewadi and Ambi — were also worried. “Ours is fertile land and we are worried about the future,” Akash Shelke from Bhondwewadi village said. Purandar MLA Sanjay Jagtap maintained the new plan was feasible. “I will soon share more details,” he told TOI. Sources confirmed that approvals were awaited from various ministries, including defence. It had taken more than a year for the previous site to be approved. Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited officials declined to comment, while aviation watchers expect the new development to delay things further. “With no timeline in sight, the project seems to be on the backburner. The new site may have been justified, but the project might face delays over political equations and the time-consuming approval process. Industry and commerce bodies — expected to act as pressure groups — seem unfazed. Looks like Punekars would have to wait for a modern, independent civil airport,” aviation analyst Dhairyashil Vandekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/purandar-airport-project-gets-feb-2024-deadline-experts-call-it-fantasy/articleshow/83494490.cms||Joy Sengupta

While the reduced number of fresh infections may help the city to remain free from future curbs, early signs also imply that compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour was becoming a norm for many considering that there has been no surge in daily cases even after almost a week of the unlock process, said the authorities. “Since beginning of the pandemic, there has been stress on Covid-appropriate behaviour to effectively combat Covid-19. Measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowded places and maintaining hand hygiene may look simple, but have very positive effect on arresting the spread of Covid-19,” Dr Neeta Padalkar, the health officer of Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, said. During the latest review, the municipal limits of Aurangabad were found to have Covid positivity rate of 2.24% and 22.19% occupancy of oxygen beds, which led to the lifting of pandemic-related curbs on June 7. Subsequent reviews are likely on every Thursday as announced by the district administration. Aurangabad city on Sunday reported only 14 new Covid cases, which is a record low in recent times. The sustained drop in daily cases had reduced the total number of active cases to 139 by Sunday. On the other hand, rural areas of Aurangabad district continue to show a relatively higher number of daily cases. The rural areas reported 80 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, taking the tally of active cases in Aurangabad district, including municipal limits, to 1,856.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-citys-positivity-rate-drops-to-0-6-on-sunday/articleshow/83487854.cms||---

The drop in the caseload has reduced the burden on the district administration to ramp up health infrastructure. As per the data available with the health department, the daily caseload had come down to 415 on Saturday from 584 on June 3, while the active cases had dropped to 3,700 from 4207 during the period. Dr P Balusamy, director of public health, attributed the dip in the caseload to strict containment measures. “We had cordoned off streets with three or more cases and deployed police personnel there to curb the movement of people and local transmission of virus.” There are more than 650 containment zones in the Nilgiris, where the district administration, in association with the revenue department, has ensured steady supply of groceries and vegetables. Balusamy said fever camps had helped identify positive cases in the early stages of infection. “Tracing of primary and secondary contacts of positive cases and isolating them had also helped curtail the transmission of the virus to a certain level.” Regular area-wise surveys had also yielded good results in the district. “Every volunteer was allotted 100 houses in an area, where one would visit the houses on alternative days to identify symptomatic people. More than 300 volunteers are involved in the door-to-door survey,” the official said. Health officials are, meanwhile, mainly concentrating on rural areas, Scheduled Caste settlements and areas where estate workers reside. Balusamy said 62 vaccinated people had tested positive for the virus in the second wave. “All of them were aged above 60 years and none of them required intense medical attention. Our priority is to inoculate the working-class people and the tribal population first. The vaccination drive is underway.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nilgiris-sees-30-dip-in-caseload/articleshow/83494493.cms||---

The judge is presently posted at Motihari in East Champaran. He had paid Rs28.5 lakh to Thakur after taking a loan and Rs1 lakh from his savings to purchase a 3-BHK flat for the upcoming project named Rameshwaram Apartment, which was being constructed at Patel Nagar under Shastri Nagar police station area in Patna. As per the FIR lodged by the ADJ against Thakur and his wife Shashikala Thakur on May 6, 2019 with Shastri Nagar police station, the possession of the flat was to be handed over to him in 2016, but the project has been incomplete since then. Arvind was arrested on November 14, 2019 and granted a provisional bail for four months by the Patna high court on December 18, 2019. Shastri Nagar police station SHO Ramashankar Singh said a subordinate court in Patna had issued an arrest warrant against Arvind for non-compliance of bail conditions around five months back after which he was arrested from Ranchi and brought to Patna. He said the high court had granted bail to Arvind on the condition that he would settle the matter with the ADJ till March last year. But it was not obeyed. “The ADJ later moved a subordinate court in November last year for violation of bail bond as he didn’t settle the matter after which an arrest warrant was issued against Arvind,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/builder-dupes-judge-of-rs29-5l-for-flat-held/articleshow/83490813.cms||Debashish Karmakar

---||Kochi||‘Successive regimes failed in revenue collection’||Kochi: The successive regimes in Kerala not only failed to collect what is due to the government in terms of taxes and non-tax revenues, but also witnessed a decline of revenue, said Prof KP Kannan, former director of the Centre for Development Studies (CDS), Thiruvananthapuram. Kannan was delivering a lecture on ‘Downside of Kerala Model of Development: Some Questions and Reflections’, as part of a lecture series on ‘Kerala Economy in Transition’, jointly organized by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT) and the Kerala Economic Association. “Kerala’s own revenue as a percentage of state income is declining. A 12.4% is the historically determined feasible limit for tax-income ratio, but during the current period of twenty years, we are not able to collect 3.5% of the state income. This has implications for the capital expenditure and several other consequences. During the last year of the LDF government in 2001, the revenue loss in absolute terms was Rs 2,163 crore, which was equivalent to 90% of the public debt of that year. That means, if you had collected that amount, there wasn’t need for that public debt that year,” Kannan said. “During the last year of UDF government in 2005-06, the revenue loss was 127% equivalent to public debt, and again the LDF government in 2010-11, it was almost 120% of public debt. Towards the end of the next UDF government, it was 93% of public debt and during the fourth year of the last LDF government, it was 120% of public debt,” he said. While talking about unemployment, another aspect of the Kerala model, Kannan said, “The unemployment rate among young (below 40 years) educated men is 15%, that of young and educated women it is 44%.” “High human development and high economic growth is led by the services sector, so you don’t have an impressive growth in the productive sectors that have an implication on employment. Despite this overall performance, employment has been and continues to be a major concern. In employment, the problem is not general employment, but the educated employment — [Kerala’s] has been a jobless growth.... Now, 94 lakh people are outside work and outside education, but not seeking work,” he said. The lecture was moderated by R Ramya, head, department of economics, C Achutha Menon Government College, Thrissur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/successive-regimes-failed-in-revenue-collection/articleshow/83493071.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Varanasi||German chemical being used to treat algal bloom in Ganga||VARANASI: To clean the Ganga water from algae, a German chemical has been arranged with the help of the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and a mega drive was launched at the ghats on Sunday. The drive aims to clean the algal boom in the river water, especially at the ghats where people throng for bathing on auspicious occasions, before the festival of Ganga Dussehra falling on June 20. The district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma told TOI, “We had forwarded a request to the NMCG New Delhi on Saturday to find a solution against the algal bloom in river Ganga in Varanasi. Taking a serious note of it the NMCG sent a consignment of 15 litre of German chemical, which can be mixed in 1,000 litre of water for treatment of algae in several square kilometre area.” With the arrival of this chemical, he said, experimental treatment of algae was done at Assi and Dashaswamedh ghats on Sunday morning. “After the confirmation of its effectiveness and also that it was harmless for aquatic lives we decided to use it,” he said adding, the strategy for proper utilisation of this chemical was also finalised as per which 10 tanks were loaded on boats to engage at ghats like Dashaswamedh and in downstream. The drive aims to ensure removing algae from river water at the prominent ghats by Ganga Dussehra, he said. The algae first appeared in the river around 20 days ago, which was initially examined by the officials of the pollution control board. Later, the DM constituted a team comprising of additional city magistrate (II), regional officer of UPPCB, assistant commissioner of police (Dashashwamedh), executive engineer of Bandhi Prakhand and general manager of Ganga pollution control unit to look into the matter, and submit a detailed report. This team submitted its report on Friday after conducting a survey from Varanasi to Mirzapur for three days. In the survey it was found that the algae flowed into the Ganga with the STP’s treated effluent through Basvariya drain and later grew further in the the Ganga. According to the investigation report, the 4-MLD capacity STP is based on conventional system. It seems that the algal bloom originated from the STP at Vindhyachal. The flow of water is minimum and the temperature is also conducive for the growth of algae in the river. Besides, the nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, urea and DAP coming from farming fields through drains significantly helped the algae to grow. The untreated waste waters from Mirzapur and Chunar also contribute to the algal bloom. The report recommneded the modernization of Vindhyachal STP and suggested proper maintenance of all the STPs and also to tap the drains including Nagwa/Assi, Khidkiya Ghat and Samne Ghat completely. The generated sewage should be treated at Ramna STP (50MLD) and Ramnagar STP (10 MLD). The construction of a new STP in Mirzapur, and maintaining flow in the river was also recommended, Besides, a study on the impact of algae on aquatic life by the experts of Banaras Hindu University was also recommended in the report.

The study, Wadettiwar said, is a must before deciding on appropriate levels of reservation among communities categorised as OBCs. “The cap on the reservation should be increased beyond current limits. The Parliament will have to make the decision to raise the 50% limit to accommodate all those who are deserving of reservation,” he said during a press conference held after talks with OBC leaders. Caste-wise data is available with the Centre. But the information has not been made available to the state, which is why community leaders have been calling for a separate census. Wadettiwar said the meeting with community leaders was called after political reservation was cancelled. Another larger convention has been scheduled for June 26 and 27 at Lonavala, involving more than 200 community leaders from all parties. Wadettiwar said the Centre should take the lead in resolving the reservation issue. If a favourable stand is taken, both Maratha and OBC reservations can be awarded an an appropriate manner, he said. As for Covid curbs, he said the stay may have to reconsider the current set of restricts if cases increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wadettiwar-calls-for-fresh-caste-census/articleshow/83494499.cms||---

The meeting at Faizabad Circuit House concluded late evening after Mishra along with Trust secretary Champat Rai and other members inspected the foundation and held a five-hour brainstorming session with engineers on the concoction of building material for rolling out the multi-layered foundation, which had been a sticking point for experts due to the inflow of Saryu water 120feet below. Trust secretary Champat Rai said, “We conducted a nationwide funds campaign straddling 5.3crore cities and villages comprising 11crore families and the Trust coffers are brimming with Rs 3,200crore till March 31 this year.” Rai said, India’s best brains from top engineering institutions have finalised the blueprint of the temple foundation and this includes retired director of IIT Delhi, B S Raju, Dr Sitaram of IIT Guwahati, director of NIT-Surat Prof SR Gandhi, Dr Gopal Krishnan of CBRI Roorkee, Prof Bhattacharya of IIT Delhi and Prof Manu Santhanam of IIT Madras. It took over two months to remove the debris from the foundation site — 50-foot deep, 400-foot long and 300-foot wide. After the sand and water was found, we began refilling, said Rai. Seven layers comprising 1.2lakh square feet of the foundation has been laid out and another 50 layers of 10-inch thick building material will be rolled out by October to firm up the temple base.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/indias-best-brains-hammer-out-ram-temples-foundation-blueprint-50-layers-to-roll-out-by-oct/articleshow/83494773.cms||---

Finance minister T Harish Rao said this at the inauguration of about 56 2BHK houses in Gajwel assembly constituency on Sunday. These 2BHK units were built at a cost of Rs 3.72 crore. Providing financial assistance for construction of 2BHK units is one of the 2018 election promise of the TRS government. The TRS in its election manifesto promised that financial assistance would be given to those owning land so that they can construct 2BHK units on their own land without waiting for the government to do it for them on government land. Harish also sought to assure the people that CM K Chandrasekhar Rao was committed to continuing all pro-poor and pro-farmer welfare schemes. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-aid-to-build-houses-on-own-land-soon-min/articleshow/83493070.cms||---

Congress floor leader in the assembly Bhatti Vikramarka on Sunday said that the Congress would do everything it can to stop the precious government lands from being put under the hammer. Stating that state debts have already reached Rs 5 lakh crore, Bhatti said that the TRS government would lead Telangana into a state of bankruptcy by auctioning the remaining government land. “The debts have increased so much that the state now needs to borrow more to pay interest on the already borrowed amounts,” he added. Bhatti demanded that the TRS government publish a white paper on the debts incurred so far, extent of land auctioned and those identified for auction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bhatti-urges-people-not-to-buy-govt-land/articleshow/83493069.cms||---
---||Lucknow||No hard bargain with BJP to remain in alliance: Apna Dal||Lucknow: The Anupriya Patel-led Apna Dal (Sone Lal) has dismissed speculations about party bargaining hard with the BJP leadership to keep the alliance intact in the run-up to UP assembly elections due next year. The Apna Dal (S) has been BJP's ally since 2014 Lok sabha elections when the saffron party began its juggernaut under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. “BJP se koi demand nahi rakhi gayi hai...mil ke chunav ladenge (We have not put forth any demand before the BJP. We will contest the forthcoming UP elections together),” said party's working president and Anupriya's husband, Ashish Singh Patel, while speaking to TOI. His statement was a strong pointer to the Kurmi-dominated political outfit, with a significant influence in Vindhya and east UP region, continuing its ties wit the BJP to take on the aggressive opposition in the high-stake 2022 UP elections. The development comes three days after Anupriya met senior BJP leader and Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi, stoking speculations about Apna Dal (S) putting forth hard terms before the saffron party, including a berth in the Union cabinet as well as in UP where cabinet expansion seems imminent after recent meetings of CM Yogi Adityanath with PM Modi, Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda. Apna Dal (S) stance also comes amid resurfacing of the feud within the Patel family with Anupriya's sister and Apna Dal leader Pallavi Patel reaching out to Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, in an apparent bid to frame up a new political alignment to trouble the BJP which seeks another term in office next year. In 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Apna Dal chief and Anupriya's mother Krishna Patel had merged her party with the Congress to contest as grand old party candidate from Gonda. The move, however, proved a failure as Krishna not only lost the elections but also had her deposits forfeited. Anupriya, who was a Union minister in Modi-1 government, turned out to be a gainer once again in 2019 parliamentary elections. While Anupriya won from Mirzapur, her party candidate Paukori Lal Kol won from tribal-dominated Robertsganj seat. This was a year after Ashish Patel got elected to legislative council with the backing of BJP in 2018. Apna Dal's political positioning has once again trained the political spotlight on the Kurmis which account for around 24% of the total OBC block. Both BJP and the Samajwadi Party have been vying for this vote bank. The saffron party made its intentions clear when it appointed Swatantra Dev Singh, a Kurmi, as UP BJP chief soon after 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The SP, too, has been banking on the image of its state president, Naresh Uttam Patel, a Kurmi, especially after the death of samajwadi stalwart and party's Kurmi face Beni Prasad Verma in 2020. BJP and SP bid to consolidate Kurmi comes in sharp contrast with the strategy of BSP chief chief Mayawati who recently expelled her party veteran Kurmi leader and party MLA from Katheri (Ambedkarnagar), Lalji Verma, on charges of anti-party activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-hard-bargain-with-bjp-to-remain-in-alliance-apna-dal/articleshow/83494721.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Lucknow||Class 10 student urgesPM to reconsider Boardexams cancellation||Lucknow: Aditi Shukla, a Class 10 student of St Joseph College, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to reconsider the decision to cancel Class 10 and 12 Board examinations. Taking a dig at students who feel sad on banning of mobile games and apps but celebrate cancellation of examinations, the 16-year old said such students should shun the internet and face the harsh realities of life. “You (PM Modi) have taken this decision considering the safety of students, but other options like online tests, examination in PPE kits or holding papers for a lesser duration can be explored. If there are no exams, students will start taking studies lightly,” the letter said. She said without experiencing Board examinations, it would be tough for students to crack competitive examinations. “Students who could not score well in Class 10 but are working hard for Class 12 are disheartened as they had promised their parents that they would improve their performance,” she said. “I want to do a ‘Mann Ki Baat’ on behalf of all students who are disheartened due to cancellation of examinations. I have written to the PM with the hope that he would revoke the decision,” Aditi told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/class-10-student-urgespm-to-reconsider-boardexams-cancellation/articleshow/83494638.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Galloping monsoon hits Uttar Pradesh, breaks decades old record||LUCKNOW: In one of the most rapid advancements in decades, the galloping monsoon currents arrived in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday, seven days ahead of the normal date, and in just 24 hours covered most parts of east and north UP and some parts of the west. While Lucknow received moderate pre-monsoon showers of about 10mm that made Sunday pleasant, the formal onset of the monsoon season is expected on Monday-Tuesday. In fact, the currents have reached the doorstep till neighbouring Barabanki and are set to storm into the state capital. Several districts received light to heavy rains on Sunday —Bahraich 66mm, Prayagraj 42.8mm, Sultanpur 36.6mm, Rae Bareli 28.6mm, Varanasi12mm and Gorakhpur 10.2mm. State Met director JP Gupta said a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal and a trough line — a stream of cyclonic circulations — over the state has made conditions favourable for further advancement of the monsoon into the rest of the eastern region of the state, including Lucknow, and some more districts in the west UP in next 48 hours. “Light to moderate rains can occur at most parts of the state till Wednesday. Rainfall can be heavy at isolated places,” he added. As on Sunday night, the northern limit of the monsoon was passing through Surat, Bhopal, Hamirpur, Barabanki, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Ambala and Amritsar. In the IMD map, the monsoon curve can be seen to have covered many districts in the east UP and that of terai region of the state till Bareilly. These currents have also moved into Uttrakhand, Himachal Pradesh and north Punjab and north Haryana including Chandigarh. However, south and central UP as well Delhi will have to wait for a couple days for monsoon showers. The monsoon touched the Kerala coast on June 3 this year, three days behind schedule, but thereafter raced through the country to reach UP on June 13 in just 10 days. This was the most rapid advancement in decades, at least in 15 years, records of which are available with TOI. Earlier, in 2016, the time span between arrival in India (Kerala) and UP was 11 days. Further, it is the second time at least in the past 25 years that the onset of monsoon has been so early. In 2008, the onset of was on June 12. Data also shows that whenever monsoon has arrived early, the state receives good rains in the season. On time for 2nd consecutive yearIt was the second consecutive year that the monsoon arrived earlier than the scheduled date. Till 2019, based on the 40-year study from 1901-1940, the normal date of arrival of monsoon for UP was fixed at June 15 and Lucknow June 18. However, last year, after studying the monsoon advancement pattern of 59 years from 1961-2019, these dates were revised to - UP June 18 and Lucknow June 23. The revision was done because it was seen that monsoon mostly arrived in UP and Lucknow in the third and fourth week of June. Interestingly, post-revision, the monsoon has ditched the new normal dates. Last year, the onset was on June 15 and this year on June 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/galloping-monsoon-breaks-decades-old-record-to-enter-up/articleshow/83494682.cms||---

In a tweet, the PM said, "Very good initiative", while tagging a news report on the Elderline project and CM Yogi Adityanath. PM's appreciation comes three days after he, during a meeting with CM Yogi, hailed the UP government's steps in battling the second Corona wave. The project, which was launched on May 14, received overwhelming response from the target beneficiaries during the ongoing pandemic. Very good initiative! @myogiadityanath https://t.co/Wl9thDO9Wk— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1623595022000Tweeting back his gratitude on behalf of the people of UP, CM Yogi said: "The Project Elderline takes inspiration from your all-inclusive mantra of Sakba Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'." "The helpline -- 14567 -- now receives as many as 80 to 90 actionable calls on a daily basis from various districts of the state ranging from Noida to Ballia," the report said. The toll-free helpline facility was made operational to extend complete support to the elderly citizens across all 75 districts. Uttar Pradesh became the first state in the country to extend emotional care and support, health and legal assistance to the elderly through the call centres which remain functional from 8 am to 8 pm. The scheme was launched in collaboration with the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment, and has effectively implemented the scheme throughout the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-lauds-ups-elderlineproject-for-senior-citizens/articleshow/83494851.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh bags Centre's Jal Jeevan Mission funds' biggest pie||LUCKNOW: A day after the Centre allotted Rs 10,870 crore to Uttar Pradesh under Jal Jeevan Mission (2021-22), the highest allocation to any state so far, the UP government on Sunday said, a comprehensive annual plan would be rolled out to implement the project, which entails tap water connections to all rural households by 2024. The amount is more than four times the allocation of last fiscal, when Rs 2,571 crore was disbursed to the state and nine times higher than the allocation in 2019-20. The significantly high allocation to UP comes ahead of the high-stakes UP assembly polls and a day after chief minister Yogi Adityanath met PM Narendra Modi, in what was seen as an exercise to hammer out the 2022 poll roadmap. UP Jal Shakti minister, Mahendra Singh, said the state government was overwhelmed by the Central allocation. “We would work in a planned way. A formal draft plan is expected to be chalked out this month,” he told TOI. He said, the state government was committed to work as per directions of the Centre to meet the target. Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, during his last meeting with chief minister Yogi Adityanath, had assured assistance to the state under the Jal Jeevan Mission. In Uttar Pradesh, there are 2.63 crore households in 97,000 villages, of which 30.04 lakh (11.3%) households have tap water supply. Only 5.16 lakh (1.96%) households had tap water supply before rollout of the scheme. In last 21 months, under Jal Jeevan Mission, the state provided tap water supply to 24.89 lakh (9.45%) households. Despite this, at least 2.33 crore households don’t have this facility, officials said. Last week, the ministry announced Rs 6,998.97 crore to West Bengal, the second highest allocation to a state under the project. Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have been allocated Rs 3,410 crore and Rs 5,117 crore, respectively. The north-eastern states have been allocated a total of Rs 9,262 crore. Maharashtra has been allocated Rs 7,064.41 crore, while Chhattisgarh got Rs 1,909 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bags-biggest-share-of-jal-jeevan-mission-funds-sets-2024-deadline-to-provide-tap-water-to-all-villages/articleshow/83494876.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Thane||To help children fight it better, KDMC plans ‘school isolation’||KALYAN: With health experts anticipating that the third wave of the pandemic may affect a lot of children, the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has come up with a unique initiative to make Covid-positive kids less anxious and emotionally stronger to fight the virus by isolating them at a centre in their schools instead of regular quarantine centres. Under its “My Student My Responsibility” initiative, the KDMC has decided to create isolation wards and Covid care centres at civic and private schools. If students test positive, the civic body will admit the patients in their schools with the consent of their parents. Given that children are more accustomed to the school environment and share a special bond with it, they are likely to be more comfortable recovering there rather than at a regular quarantine centre. KDMC commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi, who is the brain behind this concept, said that students have special relationship with their schools, and if they get treated at their schools they are likely to be in a better frame of mind and may recover quickly. To implement the same, Dr Suryawanshi has asked health officers to prepare a list of schools and get their details, like name of principals, their numbers and the number of students in each school. This will help understand the number of isolation and Covid care centres that need to be set up. A civic official said that if children in the age group of 8 to 12 years are found to have mild symptoms of Covid-19, they will be advised admission in the isolation ward/or covid care centre of their school. If required, and if there is facility allows, parents of such children can also be accomodated. The KDMC has also planned entertainment facilities for Covid-positive children in these centres. Beside, KDMC chief will also provide guidance to headmasters of all primary schools for safe quarantining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-to-help-children-fight-it-better-kdmc-plans-school-isolation/articleshow/83494539.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ashok Gehlot MLAs join chorus to demand cabinet expansion||JAIPUR: After MLAs loyal to former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot demanded expansion of the state cabinet, legislators close to CM Ashok Gehlot have now joined the chorus. Lawmaker Lakhan Singh, who represents Karauli seat and is one of the six BSP MLAs who switched over to Congress in September 2019, said on Sunday there should be a cabinet expansion as it would improve the government’s efficiency and would help work get done. “Some departments are totally dependent on government officials now. If these departments get ministers, they would function in a better way, there will be proper monitoring and development will take place,” said Singh. “Wishes of party workers who have pinned hopes on the government should be fulfilled,” he added. Five of the six MLAs would hold a meeting in Jaipur on Monday. Bharatpur’s Nagar MLA Wajib Ali, who is currently in Australia, is likely to connect through phone or video conferencing. “We all are with the chief minister. Lakhan Singh has sought cabinet expansion but when and how it should take place is the prerogative of the CM,” Rajendra Singh Gudha, another of the six MLAs who represents Udaipurwati seat in Jhunjhunu district, told TOI. Jhunjhunu MLA Brijendra Singh Ola was the latest among Pilot loyalists to join the chorus demanding cabinet expansion on Sunday. Ola said, "For five years, we struggled alongside Pilot. We went to farmers and common man and promised them that if the Congress government is formed, they will have a share in the power. The government was formed but now even the MLAs’ works are not getting done, what to say of the workers? We cannot remain silent spectators in the current political scenario." Sikar’s Srimadhopur MLA and former assembly speaker Deependra Singh Shekhawat, another Pilot loyalist, said, "An early decision on the demands (raised by Pilot supported disgruntled group) will be in the party’s interest. People are getting restless." Late night, MoS technical education, Subash Garg tweeted a verse in Hindi, “Ye mausam hi aisa hai, atur hain parinde, Ghonsla badalne ko. (This season is such, birds are eager, to change their nests).” A day earlier, MLA from the Pilot camp, Ved Prakash Solanki alleged that phones of some legislators were being tapped. Solanki, though, declined to name the MLAs. Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat targeted the Gehlot government with phone tapping charges on Sunday. “Many a times people have alleged that the present Congress government illegally taps phones of public representatives and uses these as a political weapon. Last year, CM said on the floor of the House that Rajasthan has no such tradition but later his minister admitted in the assembly that phones were tapped legally. Now again it has come to light that Congress MLAs recently complained to CM about their phones being tapped. Whether this is being done legally or illegally, the government and Congress should clarify,” Shekhawat said on Sunday. State transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said Solanki should disclose names of MLAs whose phones were being tapped. “If he discloses the names to the CM, the truth will come out. He should not talk like this (vaguely).” Khachariyawas added, “BJP’s problem is that a very senior RSS functionary has been caught on camera in a Rs 20-crore bribery deal. Phone tapping charges are being levelled to divert people’s attention away from the RSS man.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-mlas-join-chorus-to-demand-cabinet-expansion/articleshow/83494553.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

Of 25,928 beds in government hospitals across the state, 10,366 already have oxygen supply and the rest (15,562) will be converted to oxygen beds soon. “We have drawn up a proposal to convert the remaining beds to oxygen ones and set up liquid oxygen plants at government hospitals. In principle approval is there for creating additional storage capacity of 200 MT of liquid medical oxygen. Also, in principle approval has been accorded to install 132 PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen generation plants in government hospitals,” a health department official said, adding that currently discussions were underway. Meanwhile, state-run Niloufer Hospital, the nodal centre of Covid-19 cases in children, is gearing up for three new floors to double bed strength. The staff is currently undergoing a training programme at the office of the district medical education (DME). Standard operating procedures (SOP) and training modules, specially created for capacity building of treating doctors, nurses and Asha workers, are being followed. “SOPs are also being developed for spreading awareness in the community,” the official added. After an inspection of the hospital, it was decided to double the bed strength from the current 1,000 to 2,000. “The idea is to have an additional floor in each of the three buildings of Niloufer Hospital as well as an oxygen plant for the old building. It is likely to take two months for the process to be completed,” a source from the hospital said. “Apart from Niloufer Hospital, paediatric health infrastructure will be strengthened in teaching hospitals across the state. Nearly, 4,000 oxygen/ICU beds are proposed to be exclusively allocated for children in teaching hospitals, district hospitals, area hospitals in the state to deal with any surge in paediatric Covid-19 cases,” as per the plan document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/booster-shot-over-15k-govt-beds-to-get-o2-4k-allocated-for-kids/articleshow/83494545.cms||Amrita Didyala

A report was submitted to the government in 2013, but the Vigilance Establishment did not get the approval for prosecution which was finally granted this year. Former principal Wahid Ali, head clerk Avkash Saxena, assistant clerk Rakesh Kumar, junior clerks Rajeev Sharma and Sagar Rastogi, instructor Vinod Gupta, job beneficiaries Sanjay Kumar, Bhagirath, Veerpal, Pankaj Singh, Vishnu Kumar, Vipin Chandra, Krishna Awatar and Karan Singh have been named in the FIR. The accused have been booked under the charges of dishonesty, criminal breach of trust, criminal conspiracy and under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. A senior officer in the vigilance department said two vacancies for class four employees (sweepers) were created by the Directorate of Training and Employment which were advertised by the then principal, Wahid Ali, in September 2002. Two candidates were chosen but more recruitments were made at the behest of Ali. Similarly, in 2005, clerks and junior clerks were recruited without even informing the directorate and following the procedure. Ali regularised the jobs of nine guest lecturers, allegedly for personal gains, though regularization was disapproved by the directorate in March 2002. “It surfaced that not just the principal but lower clerks were also involved in regularization of jobs,” the officer said. He added that it surfaced during the probe that the principal and the staff were also involved in embezzlement of funds in 2002-03 and 2003-04.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iti-ex-principal-13-others-booked-forembezzlement-fraud-in-recruitments/articleshow/83494807.cms||---

This may lead to a rise in the number of cases if the home isolations norms are not implemented properly. The district already has the highest positivity rate (around 16%) and oxygen bed occupancy rate (68%) in the state. Around 3,800 patients are on oxygen support while around 270 patients are on ventilator support. As compared to other districts like Sangli and Satara districts, Kolhapur’s positivity rate has increased mainly due to neglect of the home isolation norms. Sangli and Satara district administration effectively ensured strict home isolation and shifted home isolated patients to quarantine centres when required. However, in Kolhapur district, the home isolated patients have not been shifted despite district collector Daulat Desai’s repeated appeals to the village and town level vigilance committee to set up isolation centres at the public buildings and shift the patient. Out of the 5,185 home isolated patients, 3,604 are in rural parts while 1,581 are in Kolhapur city. Minister Hasan Mushrif, who held a meeting with health authorities, said, “The administration needs to strictly implement home isolation norms. Patients not following guidelines is a threat to their family members and those coming in contact with them. For patients, who jump the home isolation, it becomes difficult to trace contacts. Special attention must be given to three tehsils — Ajara, Gadhinglaj and Chandgad — where the mortality rate is much higher.” In Kolhapur city, 41 oxygen beds of 370 are vacant while in the rural areas, of 2,223 beds, 440 are vacant. Meanwhile, Kolhapur district reports 1,586 fresh cases and 33 Covid deaths on Sunday. Solapur rural recorded 379 Covid cases and 17 deaths due to Covid on Sunday while Satara district added 856 fresh cases and 16 Covid deaths. Sangli district registered 812 Covid cases and 20 patients succumbed to Covid on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/in-kolhapur-district-41-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/83487936.cms||---

The villagers first saw the animal sitting near a sugarcane field in Kasarsai village, forest officials said. Paud forest range officer Popat Kapse told TOI, “We came to know about the animal’s presence after the villagers made a video and circulated it on social media platforms. Our staff and patrol team immediately visited the area and confirmed the presence of the animal through its pug marks.” The forest officials are not ruling out the possibility of the presence of a fully grown male and female leopard along with their two cubs in the area. “We had found two cubs in the sugarcane fields near Marunji village a few months ago. We released them in the same area to reunite them with their mother. The presence of one leopard family is often seen in our forest areas,” Kapse added. “The leopard(s) so far have killed goats, stray dogs and hens in the villages in Mulshi and Maval tehsils, but no incident of attack on a human being has been reported so far,” said Kapse, who, along with other forest officials, held a meeting with the villagers to hear their concerns on Sunday. Hanumant Paygude, a farmer from Nerhe-Dattawadi, said, “Eight hens, which were kept in a cattle shed, were eaten by a leopard last week. Last year too a leopard had targeted our hens. “ Kapse said, “A habitat of leopard is there in our range and hence we have told the villagers to take necessary precautions such as keeping domestic animals in proper cattle sheds, not roaming near forest alone at night, bursting firecrackers to shoo them away and visiting farms in groups for work in night. These measures would prevent the animal from entering villages and hamlets.” Kapse said, “Since they (animals) get adequate food and prey in the forest and nearby villages, they haven’t yet travelled to urban areas like the Hinjewadi IT park, which is located only eight kilometres away from the current sight.” Nerhe-Dattawadi sarpanch Dattatray Jadhav claimed that they are working in coordination with forest officials and creating awareness among the villagers. “We have also urged the forest officials to increase patrolling in the area. If such attacks on domestic animals continue, we have requested them to set up trap cages to catch the animals to prevent human animal conflict in the locality,” Jadhav told TOI. On placing of cages, Kapse said, “We will take a decision on this after having a discussion with the villagers in the next few days. We need to complete mandatory procedures before setting up trap cages in the area. We haven’t placed cages anywhere in these villages,” he confirmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leopard-spotted-in-villages-8km-away-from-hinjewadi/articleshow/83494504.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Lucknow||AAP & SP allege irregularities by Trust in land deal||LUCKNOW/AYODHYA: Pointing towards major irregularities in purchase of land by the Ram Temple Trust, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) have alleged that two private persons purchased a piece of land in Ayodhya for Rs 5.8 crore and sold it five minutes later to the Trust for Rs 18.5 crore. The land in question, approximately 1.208 hectare, was purchased on March 18 to expand the area of the proposed Ram temple, they allege. Both AAP and SP have demanded a CBI probe into the matter. Meanwhile, Champat Rai, the general secretary of the Trust, said that he would comment on the matter and charges against the Trust only after studying the documents. “We have been accused of many things over the past 100 years, including the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. We are not worried about allegations. We will continue to do our work,” he said. AAP MP Sanjay Singh and former SP MLA from Ayodhya, Pawan Pandey, presented the sale deeds of both the transactions before the media on Sunday. Talking to reporters in Lucknow Sanjay Singh said: “Gaata number 243, 244 and 246, located in Bagh Bijaisi, Pargana Haveli Awadh, Sadar Tehsil in Ayodhya district, worth Rs 2 crore, was sold by Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak to one Sultan Ansari and Ram Mohan Tiwari for Rs 5.80 crore at 7.10pm on March 18.” “Five minutes later, Ansari and Tiwari sold the same land to the Ram Temple Trust for Rs 18.5 crore of which Rs 17 crore was transferred by the RTGS. This is the only land anywhere in the world the value has gone up by Rs 5.5 lakh per second,” Singh added. The MP also pointed out that the witnesses in both deals were the same persons, Anil Mishra who is a member of the Trust and Rishikesh Upadhyay, the mayor of Ayodhya. “Another point to be noted in this deal is that the stamp paper for the sale of the land by Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak was sold at 5.22pm. On the other hand, the stamp paper on which the sale to the Trust is registered was sold at 5.11pm. Secondly, the Trust has to clear the purchase of land. How did it manage to pass a resolution for this transaction in just five minutes? Lakhs of people have paid towards the construction of the Ram Temple and this matter has raised very important questions over the dealings by the Trust,” Singh said, demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should order a CBI inquiry into the matter and ask the enforcement directorate to investigate this deal. Talking to reporters in Ayodhya, SP’s former minister and ex-Ayodhya MLA, Pawan Pandey, said that there was large-scale corruption in the purchase of the said land and demanded a CBI inquiry into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-sp-accuse-temple-trust-of-irregularities-in-land-purchase/articleshow/83494758.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Kochi||Kerala: In a first, tree fern named as flagship icon of a national park||IDUKKI: In a first, a tree fern has been selected as the flagship species of a national park in the state. Cyathea crinite, a species of tree fern will act as the icon of conservation in Anamudi Shola National Park in Idukki for the next 10 years. The new management plan for the protected area was approved by the state chief wildlife warden. Salish Menachery, wildlife assistant of Eravikulam National Park said Cyathea crinite is a rare and highly restricted endemic species. It grows in shaded banks along streams in evergreen and Shola forests (tropical montane wet temperate forests in high altitude between 1,500-2,200m above mean sea level) and is found in the Western Ghats and wet elevated zones in Sri Lanka. The habitat of this species is severely fragmented and it is included on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Mannavan Shola of Anamudi Shola National Park is one among the 15 locations where the species was found, said the official. Munnar wildlife warden R Lakhmi said there is a growing population of Cyathea crinita in Manavanshola area in Anamudi Shola National Park. “Normally, a major species in each park is selected for the management plan and it aims to give more importance to the conservation of the species. We can see the fern in most parts of the park. When approved, the management plan will intensify the conservation activities of the plant in the next 10 years,” she said. According to officials all protected areas have a flagship species as an icon of conservation which is mentioned in the management plan. The management plan was prepared by Munnar Wildlife Warden R Lekshmi, range forest officer Sameer M K, wildlife assistant Salish J Menachery and biologist Bhavdas, under the guidance of Anoop KR, field director (Project Tiger) Kottayam. Recently, the Galaxy frog (Melanobatrachus indicus) was selected as the flagship species in Mathikettan Shola National Park in Idukki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/in-a-first-tree-fern-named-as-flagship-icon-of-a-national-park/articleshow/83493104.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Agra||Over 3k death certificates issued in Agra in May, over 30 times more than last year||Agra: At least 3,596 death certificates were issued in Agra in May this year amid the second wave of Covid-19 as compared to merely 102 during the same period last year, according to data available with the municipal corporation. Meanwhile, the health department records show only 449 Covid-19 deaths in the district since March 2020. According to the records of the Agra municipal corporation (AMC), 70-80 applications, on an average, were received at the birth and death registration office during April and May 2021. Last year, this number was just 3 to 4. The AMC records suggest that 188 death certificates were issued in April and May last year. During the second wave of Covid-19, it rose to 4,591 in April and May this year. Senior councillor Ravi Bihari Mathur said, “Family members of several Covid patients who died in April were also infected. They were in home isolation and applied for the death certificates of their kin only in May. This is a major reason behind the surge in death certificates issued in May. Besides, many people didn’t apply for death certificates as well. The actual number of people who died is much higher than what the government records suggest.” According to an estimate, over 6,000 cremations took place at Agra’s five major crematoriums in April and May. Out of these, over 2,700 were at Tajganj crematorium. However, the health department records suggest only 242 Covid-19 patients died in the district in months of April and May. Chief medical officer of Agra district Dr RC Pandey said, “Since March last year, a total of 499 Covid patients have died in Agra district. Out of these, 87 succumbed in April and 155 in May. Covid cannot be the cause of all the deaths in the district.” On the other hand, Tajganj crematorium caretaker Sanjeev Gupta said, “We were overwhelmed with the sudden increase in the number of bodies coming here for cremation in April. Usually, 15 bodies were cremated here earlier every day. However, during the second wave of Covid-19, a total of 1,700 cremations took place in April and 1,028 in May. In the last two months, as many as 1,146 cremations occurred at the electric furnace, while 1,627 last rites were performed in the traditional way. Covid protocol was followed in most cases.” On April 28, overheating and too much load caused by continuous burning of the dead had resulted in a major disruption at Agra's only electric crematorium in Tajganj. All four platforms became non-operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-3k-death-certificates-issued-in-agra-in-may-over-30-times-more-than-last-year/articleshow/83490929.cms||Deepak Lavania

According to waqf board CEO, after the bifurcation of the state in 2014 and subsequent emergence of the Telangana State Waqf Board (TSWB), they found that the records pertaining to a lot of waqf properties had gone missing. “The records pertaining to the identified encroachments (2,186 in number) and subsequent eviction notices could not be traced till now,” officials informed the Telangana high court on Saturday. Terming the missing record as an utter negligence of the TSWB, they demanded high level inquiry into the issue and sought clarification from TSWB as well. But not everyone had this same view. “Isn’t the waqf board the main culprit? Haven’t officials said that members of the board were reportedly acting as middlemen in sale of waqf properties,” Syed Taraq Quadri, president All India Majlis e Inquilab e Millat, wondered . “It’s abhorrent that TSWB has a total staff strength of 398, of which 95 are permanent. Rest are contract workers, with only one surveyor for the entire state, when the requirement is 33 for 33 Districts. In contrast, TTD in Tirupati has 2,500 staff, in addition to 1,400 in Hindu Endowment Department,” he added. Syed Taraq Quadri told TOI that Waqf Board Record Room remained locked since 2017 and the key are with Hyderabad collector without any legal authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/activists-question-tswb-on-missing-waqf-property-records/articleshow/83494532.cms||---

Khorjuekar, the former block president of Siolim Youth Congress Committee, was cleared for the post by AICC interim president Sonia Gandhi, said state Congress vice president M K Shaikh. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat expressed confidence in Khorjuekar’s abilities to build consensus among Goa’s OBC community. “I am sure that he will reorganise the OBC department and make it vibrant. With his long experience in party organisation, Sandesh Khorjuekar will be very effective,” Kamat said. The OBC department is a key organisation of Congress. Goa’s OBC segment, which has 19 communities, comprises nearly 30% of the Goan population and forms a vital voter base for elections. The main task before Khorjuenkar will be to get as many political and social leaders from the 19 communities to back the party in the forthcoming assembly elections. Khorjuekar has been a member of Congress since 1999 and is involved in various social, sports and cultural activities. State president Girish Chodankar expressed happiness with the appointment of Khorjuvenkar as the chairman of the OBC department and offered full cooperation to build the image of the party among backward communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-obc-dept-gets-new-chairman/articleshow/83495620.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Eye on Ram temple, Centre clears sandstone mining in Rajasthan forest land||JAIPUR: The Centre has given in-principle approval to free up 398 hectares of forest land in the vicinity of Bharatpur’s Band Baretha Wildlife Sanctuary to mine state’s famous red sandstone and ensure a steady supply of the material to Ayodhya for the ongoing construction of a grand Ram temple. The move to denotify protected forest land under Banshi Pahadpur block and hand it over to the department of mining and geology is part of a larger plan to allow regulated mining with minimal environmental impact and simultaneous afforestation. “In the 398 hectares that are to be diverted, we expect to develop about 70 mining blocks and auction those,” additional chief secretary (mines and petroleum) Subodh Agarwal said. “We have already started delineating the area and aim to complete it by the end of this month,” Agarwal said. Agarwal said legal mining would not only smoothen supply of sandstone for the Ram temple, but also end law and order challenges caused by illegal mining. “Rajasthan, too, will get its due royalties if mining activities happen in a legal way.” According to a letter from the Union environment, forest and climate change ministry, the state government needs to carry out compensatory afforestation across an area equal in size to the denotified forest zone. The state government is also required to submit a detailed cluster mining plan, incorporating scope for common green infrastructure. On the possibility of a human-wildlife conflict due to the proximity of the Band Baretha wildlife sanctuary to the proposed mining zone, the letter to the principal secretary of forests recommends an integrated wildlife management plan and its precise implementation. The streams in the denotified zone have to be protected since the area is semi-arid. The state government has been asked to ensure that soil and moisture conservation schemes are undertaken on the banks of these streams. The letter also draws the authorities' attention to open-cast mining in the area over several decades and the resultant land degradation. “At least 10% of the District Mineral Foundation Fund should be used for tree plantation on the roadside and around water bodies, preferably in the Banshi Pahadpur area,” the letter states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-clears-sandstone-mining-in-raj-forest-area/articleshow/83494570.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Purohits flooded with requests for muhurats||HYDERABAD: With only a few auspicious days left for the marriage season to end, there is a mad rush for muhurats and wedding shopping across the state. Pandits in the city claim they have been flooded with calls for muhurats between June 20 and 29. After that, prospective brides and grooms would have to wait till August 12 to tie the knot. With predictions of a possible third wave of Covid-19 around September likely to sweep the country, many are looking for muhurats on June 20, 23 and 29 to complete the marriage rituals. There were auspicious days from May 12, but many deferred their wedding plans as lockdown was imposed in the state and marriages were permitted with restrictions. “Though many families at that time had fixed weddings, they dropped the idea due to lockdown and surge in Covid- 19 cases. Now, many are approaching us for muhurats, especially on June 20, 23,” SVK Sharma, a purohit from Chikkadpally, said. According to the Hindu almanac, good muhurats are available on June 16, 20, 23, 27, 28 and 29. After July first week, Asahadam (inauspicious month for Hindus) begins, where auspicious events do not happen. “I got requests for dates at least from 10 families this week. This could increase huge rush in weddings as usually at least three lakh marriages happen in the state this season ,” V Ramchandracharya, another priest, observed. As there were hardly any auspicious days between January 8 and April 22, many prospective couples were looking for muhurats this season. “ In the last week of April, we had performed the marriage of my sister with limited guests and no festivities. My another sister is keen on having an elaborate wedding, so we are looking at unlock procedures,” Sudharshan Reddy P, a software professional, said. Experts warn that whatever might be the unlock procedure, it is better to avoid huge gatherings. “We should adapt to the new normal, and try to be away from big gatherings unless it is very urgent and important,” Telangana Hospitals and Nursing Association (THANA) president Dr Kishan Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/purohits-flooded-with-requests-for-muhurats/articleshow/83494566.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur traders to reopen all shops from Tuesday||KOLHAPUR: The traders in Kolhapur city have decided to reopen the non-essential shops from Tuesday onwards. The Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, the apex body of traders, has decided to wait till Monday for the government to take the decision on their demand to open the non-essential shops that have been closed for more than two months now. Last week, the traders held a protest demanding that they be allowed to operate from Monday, however due to the high Covid positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy rate in the district, the administration had decided to keep non-essential shops shut. The district will continue to have level 4 restrictions from Monday onwards for over a week. Along with the essential shops, only a few other establishments are allowed to open. Sanjay Shete, the president of KCCI, said: “We have protested, we have also made petitions to the government to consider Kolhapur district as a special case and allow us to open non-essential shops. On Monday, we will meet deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and make the demand once again. If the government continues to be reluctant, we would anyway open the shops from Tuesday.” The traders in the city have been upset since the Covid positivity rate has not been dropping. They blame the officials. The traders had petitioned that since most of the patients in Kolhapur hospitals are from outside the district, the positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy rate seem high. If such patients are not taken into consideration, the positivity rate and oxygen occupancy rate of Kolhapur would drop. “The positivity rate for Kolhapur city is around 10% and in the rural areas it is around 15%. We will also seek the consideration of Kolhapur city and district as separate administrative units for calculation of both the Covid parameters,” said Shete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-traders-to-reopen-all-shops-from-tuesday/articleshow/83487989.cms||---

The businessman from Ghatkopar last week lodged a complaint with the crime branch that he had been receiving threatening calls from Fahim Machmach of the Chhota Shakeel faction of the Dawood gang. The Anti-Extortion Cell of the police last on Tuesday registered an offence under the IPC section for threatening of people and extortion at the Ghatkopar police station and took over the investigation in the case. Officials of the crime branch confirmed the development but refused to divulge anything as it could be dangerous for the victim and the investigation was at a crucial stage. The officials also refused to elaborate whether it was an extortion call for money or for settlement for a property-related dispute. Sources said that it was a VOIP internet call. They said the recorded audio call did not match with the voice samples of Fahim which the police have. The police have doubts about the call being genuine. There are theories that some local criminal might be trying to make a quick buck out of the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-businessman-in-ghatkopar-gets-d-gang-extortion-call/articleshow/83494580.cms||Ahmed Ali

Environmental clearances have been sought from State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority by the builders. The total cost of the projects for residential, commercial buildings and a few pharma industries in two months is Rs 10,976 crore. These are excluding the A category projects that went to the Ministry of Environment and Forests for environmental clearance. Most of them are high rise buildings and towers with a budget ranging from Rs 50 crore to Rs 500 crore. In April and May alone, around eight meetings of the State Expert Appraisal Committee were held on clearing the projects. TREDA executive president Meka Vijaya Sai said, “There was no negative impact on real estate in Hyderabad in April and May. But we have to wait and see the reaction of buyers at the end of the second wave. Those buildings with above 20,000 square metres have to go for EC from State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority. Due to work from home situation, people are looking for quality accommodation. Due to online classes and conferences for working couples, they need three or four bedroom apartments.” He added, “The builders are applying for permissions to start constructions in the presale projects where floor space index has been sold.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Medicine makers set to ramp up production||AHMEDABAD: The second wave of Covid-19 in Gujarat was all about queues – right from getting tested to finding an ambulance to getting a bed. But two things got added in the mix very soon – the relatives scurried for essential drugs along with oxygen for their relatives admitted in hospitals. Thus, when the announcements were made for remdesivir by a few hospitals, hundreds turned up in hope to get a shot at faster recovery. Learning from the experiences of the first and second wave, the state-based manufacturers are bracing up for the possible third wave later this year with increasing capacity and launch of new drugs. According to the figures provided by Federation of Gujarat State Chemists and Druggists’ Association (FGSCDA), at the Covid-19 peak in April, Gujarat required about 1 lakh strips of azithromycin, 70,000 strips of FabiFlu, and 30,000 strips of ivermectin. “During the second wave of the pandemic, we acted swiftly and scaled up our production capabilities for manufacturing and supplying FabiFlu (favipiravir), to meet the demand,” said a spokesperson of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited. The pharma major manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for favipiravir at its plant in Ankleshwar, Gujarat. The formulation (tablets) is made at the company’s plant in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh. After having received encouraging response from institutions for its antiviral drug Virafin, Zydus Cadila plans to scale up its production. Being a biological drug, Virafin takes 45 days to manufacture one batch. About 28,000 to 30,000 doses of Virafin were supplied in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medicine-makers-set-to-ramp-up-production/articleshow/83494595.cms||Kalpesh Damor

One more round of test would be conducted in the same area on Monday with a target of checking 500 more people who come in contact with more people during their routine work. The tests in the Cantonment Board Deolali (CBD) are being conducted by the health department of the Zp with an aim to trace Covid-19 patients. While the positivity rate is dropping across the district, taluka health officer Kailas Bhoye said the aim was to trace every possible person infected by the virus so that he/she is immediately brought under treatment and there is no further spread of Covid-19. In-charge of the antigen tests in Deolali Camp, medical officer Jayshree Patil, said 500 tests were conducted on Saturday and 422 were conducted on Sunday. “We have found only two positive cases through the antigen tests,” she said. Currently, there are only 20 patients admitted in the 80-bed Cantonment Board hospital of Deolali. Jayashree Natesh, medical officer of the Cantonment Board hospital, said the drop in number of patients is being observed from the last fortnight. Though the number of admission of Covid patients is less at the DCHC, the decision to close it down for Covid patients and re-opened for non-Covid patients lies with the district administration. Meanwhile, many shopkeepers said on Monday more people will come forward for the antigen test as lesser number of people came on Saturday and Sunday due to restrictions imposed on the weekend.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/antigen-tests-on-950-vendors-in-zp/articleshow/83488011.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The past two months witnessed half of the pandemic’s mortality and a major spike in active cases. Thus, what shape could the possible third wave take? Dr Jigar Mehta, a city-based intensivist, on Sunday said that the impact of several drugs on the patients during the second wave will determine the treatment protocols for the third wave. “Use of steroids and some of the antibiotic drugs is already under scanner or are out of protocol at national level. We may further see the revision to ensure that the patients have minimum adverse impact,” he said. He was speaking at a seminar on theme ‘Possibilities and Solutions: What we learnt from second wave’ organized by Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) and College of General Practitioners. The event witnessed participation of physician Dr Kamlesh Lala, infectious diseases specialist Dr Vipul Shah, KD Hospital COO Dr Parth Desai, director of IIPH-G Prof Dileep Mavalankar, pathologist Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, and paediatrician Dr Gargi Patel.

With no major hospitals around, tribals suffer a lot due to the pandemic virus. Hyderabad-based NGO Social Data Initiatives Forum (SDIF) has taken up the task of supplying oxygen cylinders and other emergency health care material and medicines to people living in the far flung tribal habitations of Telangana. SDIF has come out with a technology to identify Covid-19 patients in need of oxygen in tribal habitations and supply them with oxygen cylinders free of cost. The SDIF’s program integrates with Twitter API (application programming interface) and identifies tweets that have requests for oxygen. “The back-end team immediately calls those in need and arranges for oxygen,” said SDIF founders Azam Khan and Khalid Saifullah. The initiative has helped thousands of Covid-19 patients, especially in rural and tribal areas. “We tried to connect remote villages with technology and provided oxygen cylinders at their doorstep. We are assisting needy people all over India. We’ve already had setup oxygen banks in Hyderabad, Vikarabad, Kadapa, Guntur and Narayanpet. In other locations, we have identified NGOs providing oxygen. This network of NGOs is helping all, including people living in far-away tribal habitations,” Khan told TOI. There is no deposit for the oxygen cylinder and for white card holders, transportation and refill are free.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ngo-supplies-free-o2-in-tribal-thandas/articleshow/83494585.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: In 10 years, fire brigade got 3,000+ house collapse calls||MUMBAI: In the last one decade, Mumbai Fire Brigade has received 3,313 calls regarding a building or its parts having collapsed. More than 200 people have died in these incidents. While most of these structures were old and dilapidated, some were illegally altered or constructed. The highest number of house collapse calls (392) were received in 2019-20. This fiscal, till June, 72 such calls were received by the fire brigade. Any building, wall, hutment, boundary wall, slab collapse are reported as house collapse in fire brigade records; crashes due to fire are recorded separately. There are nearly 15,000 cessed buildings in the city which due to years of neglect and tenant-landlord disputes are at risk of collapse. Owing to policy failure and government apathy, the residents continue to live in these shaky structures as they fear losing their rights to their homes if they move out. For instance, 22 families from Kanaiya Bhuvan on Shraddhanand Road in Vile Parle (E) complained to the Prime Minister’s Office that in 2019, the BMC razed their building after declaring it dilapidated and unsafe for habitation and now they were homeless as redevelopment was st-uck owing to a dispute with the landlord. Many middleman-cum-builders have approached the tenants offering nominal amount to transfer their tenancy rights in their name. Utsal Karani, secretary of Janhit Manch, said there is a trust deficit between tenants, landlords and developers. “Landlords are looking for distress sale and tenants are reluctant to move out of their dilapidated homes as they know they will never get a reconstructed home. The government has done nothing to promote decent housing especially in the suburbs,” Karani said. Activist Chandrashekhar Prabhu said research shows that when such a redevelopment project is executed by a private developer, all original tenants are never rehoused in the new building. “Earlier, there was at least a semblance of fairness as consent of 70% of tenants was required to carry out redevelopment. Now, the consent strength has been brought down to 51%, yet tenants do not agree for redevelopment preferring to stay in old and dilapidated buildings.” The redevelopment policy has, in fact, brought a windfall for developers and politicians who help in evicting tenants, Prabhu claimed. In the last 30 years, around 2,000 buildings have been rebuilt by Mhada and 2,000 by private developers. “There are 15,000 old and dilapidated buildings in the island city and the pace of redev-elopment shows it will take 200 years for all of them to be redeveloped. The scheme, in its pr-esent form, needs to be scrapped and a pro-people scheme needs to be framed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-in-10-years-fire-brigade-got-3000-house-collapse-calls/articleshow/83494587.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Navi-mumbai||Choked Panje wetland: Maharashtra CM responds to activists’ plea||NAVI MUMBAI: Responding to the plea of green activists about the choked Panje wetland, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray has asked the urban development department to look into the issue of flood threats and malaria faced by several Uran villages as there has been a failure to clear water blocks at the wetland despite the National Green Tribunal order, nearly two months ago. NGOs NatConnect Foundation and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan have drawn the CM’s attention that Cidco is yet to implement the NGT’s order to clear the five water blocks to Panje wetland. This inaction will cause floods as the heavy rain water is not being allowed to flow downstream, the mail to CM and environment minister Aditya Thackeray stated. “The CMO has responded within two hours of receiving mail from us,” said NatConnect director B N Kumar. Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary of Urban Development-1, has been asked to look into the issue. “Some people are being misled to believe that the clearance of water blocks at Panje will cause floods. Free flow of water does not cause floods and Uran taluka did not have any history of floods for nearly two decades prior to February-March 2019,” said Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, who had petitioned before the NGT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/choked-panje-wetland-maharashtra-cm-responds-to-activists-plea/articleshow/83494598.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Goa||Goa: New fish species in Zuari piques interest of scientists||PANAJI: The finding of three uncommon fish species in the Zuari bay recently - two of them new records - has sparked curiosity among scientists and others, as the marine biodiversity hotspot continues to be a rich source for research. An unique spectacled fish, Istigobius diadema, was found by G B Sreekanth, the fisheries scientist at Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Old Goa, while sampling the fishermen’s catch at Cacra recently. The second one, a peculiar cube-shaped yellow fish, Lactoria cornuta - pet keepers will surely grab it for their aquariums - was netted by a Siridao fisherman Yogesh Santondekar near the Vasco coast. “Both these fish have unique features and are new records for Zuari. Box fish was recorded earlier by us in the coral reef at Grande island while sand goby is a marine fish,” Sreekanth said. The third fish that generated interest on a social media group was the finding of surgeonfish (Acanthurus dussumieri) at Sao Jacino island. “Fishermen do catch it once in a while, but I have seen it for the first time,” Silvestro D Souza, a chef who documents fish species for taste and other aspects, said. ICAR’s ongoing documentation in Zuari, Mandovi and Tiracol estuaries has recorded more than 350 species due to the participatory approach of fishermen from Cacra and other areas. “We would be spending thousands of rupees in fish survey expeditions, but here the fishermen provide us with unique fish samples or we sample their catch - without any expenditure,” Sreekanth said. Zoological survey of India had recorded 52 species in fresh and estuarine waters of Goa in 1972. NIO and fisheries department followed in inventorizing fish species and ICAR in exploring Grande island’s coral reefs, Zuari bay and inland waters. “ICAR is mandated to research coastal resources along the Indian coast. Our fish resources assessment in Goa’s estuaries is useful for stakeholders such as fishermen, fisheries department and others for conservation and management work,” ICAR director Parveen Kumar said. The scientific community’s data sharing with stakeholders is important, Goa State Biodiversity Board member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam said. “When all stakeholders, fisheries, biodiversity board and other organisations work together, they complement each other’s work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-fish-species-in-zuari-piques-interest-of-scientists/articleshow/83495740.cms||Paul Fernandes

Later, at night Rabari lodged a complaint at Rander police station against an unidentified car driver. Police said that CCTV cameras captured the incident and also the registration number of the car. Based on the car’s number, they could track down Patel and nab him on Sunday. During interrogation, Patel told police that he got scared when he was signalled to slow down. “The accused is making up a story that he got scared, it is very evident in the footages that he deliberately ran over our staffer,” said a police official.

He was 76 and is survived by 39 wives and about 200 children and grandchildren who live in ‘Chhuan Thar Run’ or Abode of the New Generation at Chhuan Thar Tlangnuam village in central Mizoram’s Serchhip district. Sources said Ziona, who was the leader of the ‘Chana sect’, was brought to the hospital around 3 pm on Sunday but doctors on duty failed to revive him. He had severe case of hypertension and was a diabetic. Ziona, popularly known as ‘hotupa’ (leader) by members of the sect, was born on July 21, 1944. He married his first wife, Zathiangi, in 1959 when he was 15 and his second wife in 1968 when he was 24. His last marriage was in 2004 to a 25-year-old. In spite of many of his daughters having left his place after their marriages, Ziona’s four-storey home with its dorm-like rooms has 162 people living in it. Mizoram CM Zoramthanga condoled Ziona’s passing away. “With heavy heart, #Mizoram bids farewell to Mr Zion-a (76), believed to head the world’s largest family. Mizoram and his village at Baktawng Tlangnuam has become a major tourist attraction in the state because of the family. Rest in Peace Sir!” Zoramthanga tweeted.

The sect was founded by Khuangtuahthanga and used to be popularly known as ‘Khuangtuaha Pawl’ before it became ‘Chana Pawl’ after the death of the founder as his younger brother took over. Khuangtuahthanga drew the ire of the Hmawngkawn village headman and the British government for his unique take on the Bible, resulting in his eviction from the village. Ziona’s son Nunparliana (60) has two wives and 13 children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/married-to-39-patriarch-of-worlds-largest-family-dies/articleshow/83498242.cms||---

One of them leaves behind a 3-year-old son. The family’s message to others: "Don’t repeat our mistake. Get timely treatment."Janko Rani, 55, of Bahopur died at the Ludhiana civil hospital on May 27, while her 31-year-old daughter-in-law, Amritpal Kaur, died on May 29 at Rajindra Hospital in Patiala. "The survivors include my father, 55-years-old Des Raj and my 3-year-old son, Ravneet Singh. My brother is abroad, while my sister is married. My son keeps asking us where his mother and grandmother have gone, and we don’t have an answer," said Lakhvir Singh, 31, who works as carpenter and owns about 2.5 acres.He said: "After losing two members of my family, I implore people to get timely treatment and follow the Covid protocol. Keep your masks on. Things turns bad with my wife and mother all of a sudden. They showed fever and breathlessness, and when they tested positive, I took my mother to the civil hospital, where she breathed her last."Lakhvir took his wife to a private hospital in Machhiwara and from there to another private hospital in Nawanshahr before shifting her to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, where she died eventually after her oxygen saturation level dropped to 70. Asked if anyone from the health department had visited the family since the death of two members, he said: "No one from the administration came to ask about us. Even the health department officials sent no one over to sanitise the house even after two deaths.Lakhvir Singh doesn’t expect any compensation from the government. He had an arranged marriage four years ago. Social activists of the area advocate that the family that had lost loved ones to Covid-19 be compensated. "Firstly, they had to pay hefty bills to the private hospitals and, on top of that, suffered the pain of losing members of family. So, it is important for the government to compensate these families on humanitarian ground, so that they don’t have to face financial issues in the coming times," said social activist Shiv Kumar Shivly. He said many families in the city had lost their only breadwinners and their members were left to fend for themselves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/keep-masks-on-says-family-that-lost-both-its-women/articleshow/83491157.cms||Shariq Majeed

The medical college was to be affiliated to Mumbai-based autonomous educational institute — College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) — and the NMC had planned to start the PG medical college from this year. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said they have already paid the inspection fee to the CPS and they were expected to conduct an inspection in March. “We also had plans to recruit the staff for the medical college in April and May, and start the admission process in June. But the second wave of Covid pandemic affected our plans,” said Jadhav. “Now, there has been a significant drop in new cases of Covid-19. But experts have projected the third wave of Covid pandemic. Hence, we will start the process after Diwali if there is no third wave of the pandemic,” he said. The NMC will get around 60 trainee doctors in different specializations. Earlier this year, the general body of the NMC had given its approval to the proposal of the civic administration to pay the inspection fee amounting to Rs 12 lakh to the CPS. “The experts from CPS will inspect Bytco hospital for inspection for the proposed PG courses and suggest changes or measures to be taken by the civic body at the Bytco hospital,” an NMC official said. Earlier, there were plans to run a new Bytco hospital through a private medical outfit. But Jadhav, who took charge in August last year, cancelled the decision of the privatization and decided to run the hospital by the civic body itself to provide better services to the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-hits-nmcs-proposed-pg-medical-college-hosp/articleshow/83488095.cms||Tushar Pawar

The positivity rate had touched 8.7% at the beginning of May, dropping to 7.2% in the second week and subsequently dropping to 5% towards the end of May. “The drop in the last 12 days has been the fastest, going from 4% to 1.4% in a short time. It is well within the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommended positivity rate of 5%. While this is a good thing, the only concern right now is that the drop is due to the ongoing lockdown. Once the lockdown is lifted, maintaining the same positivity rate will be key to controlling the spread. Nevertheless, following Covid-19 protocols is essential at all times,” said a health department official. The case positivity rate is an indication of the viral spread and a positivity rate below 5% is considered to be good. The state conducted 1.6 lakh Covid-19 tests per day on average during the first ten days of this month with 22,059 samples returning positive — translating into a positivity rate of just over 2% during that time. The case positivity rate for GHMC stood at 1.75%. Currently, Warangal Rural — at just over 4% — has the highest positivity rate in Telangana while Adilabad with 0.52%, has the lowest case positivity rate in state as per official records. Officials expect positivity rate to dip further over next one week.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fee committee missing even after 3 months||MUMBAI: Three months after the term of the committee of the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) ended, the state is yet to form a new one. The is likely to affect the fee fixation process of private professional colleges for the upcoming academic session. The process takes over three months every year, however, it has been stalled since March 18, after the term ended. Colleges, too, are unable to submit their applications for fee revision due to the lockdown. The state’s FRA regulates fees for private unaided professional colleges as per the provisions laid down in the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational (Regulation of Admissions and Fees) Act of 2015. While the process starts around November, by March fees of most colleges are fixed. This year, the dates for submitting fee proposals had to be extended several times on account of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns. “College offices were shut for a long time and many were working with skeletal staff throughout the year. It has been difficult for many to draw the balance sheet, so they have sought extension,” said a principal. A university official said the process of appointment should have been initiated before the chairman’s term (retired HC judge MN Gilani) was coming to an end. A government official said the FRA chairman will be appointed in a week or two. Till March 18, the old committee had fixed fees for over 70 law and more than 100 pharmacy colleges for 2021-22. Several colleges opted for ‘no upward revision’ this year. As per the data released by the FRA in March, 95 colleges did not hike fees for both 2020-21 and 2021-22. And 929 colleges, including 797 technical ones, 117 from health sciences and 15 from agriculture-related courses, did not hike their fees for the upcoming session – 2021-22. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said the fees for the coming year needs to be fixed before the admissions commence. “Though admissions are delayed, students choose private colleges based on their fee structure. There should be a committee in place to address grievances at all times,” said Shenoy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fee-committee-missing-even-after-3-months/articleshow/83494623.cms||Yogita Rao

In a widely-circulated video, shot from the outside of an iron grill gate on the campus in Bijnor’s Kirathpur area, the Dalit man can be seen lying inside with his clothes sullied in blood. The women teachers, who were standing near the unconscious man, can be seen arguing with his agitated relatives who were on the other side of the gate. Later, after police arrived, Jitender Kumar was taken to a local government hospital where he died during treatment. Hours later, on Sunday morning, the accused were booked under IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and under provisions of SC/ST Act. Police didn’t comment when asked why murder charges were not pressed against the accused. Superintendent of police (SP) of Bijnor, Dharamveer Singh, said, “The incident took place in an academy in Akbarabad village under Kotwali police station area of Bijnor on Saturday night. The two private teachers live on the academy premises. We have detained all the accused." The teachers alleged that Jitender was harassing them for quite some time and it was not for the first time that he had barged into the premises. Additional superintendent of police Sanjay Kumar said, “Jitender was involved in a spat with one of the teachers two months ago.” Meanwhile, the relatives of Jitender claimed that he didn’t barge into the campus but was waylaid, beaten, dragged and locked inside. “Jitender was taking his mother to a doctor on a motorcycle when he was attacked. They dragged him to academy premises and locked him. He sustained injuries on his head. When his mother informed other family members, they came, got him freed and took him to a community health centre (CHC) with the help of police. But he didn’t survive,” a relative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/two-women-teachers-beat-harasser-to-death-in-bijnor-cops-dont-press-murder-charge/articleshow/83491170.cms||Harveer Dabas

The Ordinance requires individuals seeking to convert and religious convertors (who perform the conversion) to submit an advance declaration of the proposed religious conversion to the district magistrate. Thereupon, the DM must conduct a police inquiry into the intention, purpose, and cause of the proposed conversion.

---||Delhi||Relief comes in small bites for Delhi restaurants||NEW DELHI: Even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced reopening of restaurants as part of the gradual unlocking of the capital, chat groups of restaurateurs shifted from constantly discussing doomsday scenarios for the industry to enquiring about sanitisation services, resumption of supplies and sending out messages to staff, hoping that the worst is behind them. Although restaurants will now open with a 50% seating and on a trial basis, most restaurateurs have welcomed the move after almost eight weeks of the Covid lockdown. Avantika Sinha of the recently opened Singaporean eatery Mai Bao is gearing up for reopening as is Vanshika Wadhwa whose Fio Pop had barely opened when the lockdown was announced. While Wadhwa plans to get her two outlets up and running within next two days, Sinha hopes her outlets are operational by Thursday. “It is a welcome move. It is time to restart as the situation is definitely better. All our staff are also vaccinated, which is a big comfort,” Sinha said. While they will focus on deliveries to spruce their numbers, she says looking at the response from people looking to dine in, things look promising. Chef Radhika Khandelwal of Fig and Maple says things may be slow initially, but reopening is the first step. “There is anxiety and excitement brewing at the same time and we are working round the clock to make sure the experience is safe and seamless.” Big chains are also looking to open most of their outlets through the week. Rohit Aggarwal of Lite Bite Foods is planning to reopen his 12 outlets of Punjab Grill, YouMee, Tres and Artful Baker across the city, while Impresario Handmade Restaurants will start Social and Smoke House Deli. “We are happy to open our doors to our customers and make our way back, slowly by surely. Since dine-in contributes to 80% of our revenue, we will resume operations across the city from Monday. Our customers have observed our safety and hygiene protocols last year and we’re hoping to see increased footfall across the city,” said Satyajit Dhingra, chief regional officer (north), Impresario Handmade Restaurants. Sonali Chauhan, general manger of The Connaught, said, “The current scenario demands a cautious and well-planned approach. With social distancing and other safety protocols, the restaurant industry will gradually be back to normalcy.” Lack of clarity on operating hours and permission to serve alcohol, though, has meant not all outlets will immediately reopen. Joy Singh will open his dining space Yeti in CP, but his bar Raasta will remain closed. Deepak Tandon of Wok in the Clouds, too, will reopen his Rajouri Garden outlet but not the CP and Khan Market outlets. Zorawar Kalra of Farzi Cafe and Bo Tai hopes restaurants would get extended operating hours. “Dinner time is crucial for the survival of a restaurant, especially in Delhi where diners eat out late. Longer operating hours also mean reservations can be spread out over a longer time, making social distancing even easier.” Another major concern most restaurateurs have is reopening on a trial basis and strict checking. Many allege inspections had become a way to harass outlets through multiple challans last year. Some will also wait before immediately spending money on reopening, calling their staff back and resuming their rentals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/relief-comes-in-small-bites-for-city-restaurants/articleshow/83493301.cms||Amin Ali

Farmaan, 30, alleged that Saina was killed by her family members as she had married against their wishes. A resident of city’s Lisari Gate area, Saina got married to Farmaan last month. And they got their marriage registered on May 17. But Saina died under mysterious circumstances on the night of May 31. Farmaan claims he was told by his in-laws that Saina developed a stomach ache and later succumbed to it. However, recently, he was tipped-off that his wife could have been killed by her parents who were unhappy with the marriage. In his complaint, Farmaan claimed he is in possession of an audio recording which is “testimony to the torture on his wife when first attempt was made to kill her.” A case of murder, disappearance of evidence and criminal conspiracy was registered against six named accused, including the father and uncle of Saina at Lisari Gate police station. “As evidence, we have also received an audio recording but we are yet to ascertain its authenticity. We will take further action based on the findings of the post-mortem report,” Arvind Chaurasia, circle officer of Meerut Kotwali said.

We tried everything, but could not revive her. We had a married life of 17 years – and we hardly stayed away from each other. Thus, these 30 days have not been enough to prepare for the rest of my life,” says Patel. He along with his son Purva, 15, have paid Neha a unique homage – while she died of low oxygen saturation after scurrying for bed in a few hospitals, the duo along with family members planted 450 trees and have pledged to nurture them to replenish oxygen in nature. “The pledge had started at Siddhpur where I had been to perform Neha’s post-death rites. The Brahmin there asked us to take a pledge to plant and sustain at least three trees. Giving reason for the pledge, he told us that the wood used to cremate our bodies is not planted by us – it’s a gift of someone else. Thus, we must pay it forward,” says Patel. “His words touched me, and I decided not to stop at three.” During the second wave of Covid-19, four of the five members of the family had tested positive simultaneously. “Along with Neha, my son, my father and myself were also down with infection. Only my mother tested negative. Neha’s condition deteriorated very fast, and she needed critical care on the third day of infection,” recounts Patel. “I have seen her gasping for breath, and I pray to God that nobody should go through such ordeal.” It was a love-cum-arranged marriage for the couple. “We met each other for the first time in 2000 and acquaintance took shape of friendship and eventually love. As we belong to the same community, we could convince our families for the union. We got married in 2004,” says Patel. He gives Neha credit to give his life a spiritual bend. “She loved to reach out to the needy. Thus, I started volunteering with a local temple. I regularly collect ashes from a local crematorium and take it to Haridwar for immersion. This time, Neha’s ashes would also travel with me,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wife-died-wanting-oxygen-man-plants-450-trees-to-replenish-o2/articleshow/83494672.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Bizman says cops helped in ‘stealing’ goods from his unit||Ludhiana: A hosiery businessman has accused the personnel of Tibba police station of helping some people steal goods from his factory. He shared the CCTV footage in which the cops are seen “keeping a watch at the main gate of the factory”. However, the policemen said they had information of stolen hosiery goods inside the factory, following which the goods were seized for verification. Sajid, 40, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and runs his factory from a rented accommodation in Tibba, said he went to his hometown on May 30 as his father was unwell and returned on June 10. He found the lock of the factory gate had changed. He broke the lock, entered and found goods stolen. Thereafter, he scanned the footage of the CCTVs installed near his unit and found that some cops and a few other people had barged in and fled with the goods after loading them in a pickup van that was parked on the premises. Sajid said he lodged a complaint with Tibba police, but no action was taken. However, Tibba SHO inspector Parmod Kumar said, “The police had received three complaints against Sajid from different persons that he was not returning their money, totalling around Rs 5 lakh. Sajid had given an affidavit, saying that if he failed to return the money till April 30, the complainants could take away goods and machines from his factory. Sajid did not return the money and went back to hometown. The complainants waited for a month and on May 30 went to his unit to take away the goods and machines.”“The police are also investigating four cases of factory thefts and had received information that Sajid used stolen hosiery goods. The police had reached the spot for verification. The pickup van found parked inside the factory had a fake number plate on it and has been seized by the police. We are probing the case,” added the inspector. When the TOI later tried to contact Sajid, his phone was switched off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizman-says-cops-helped-in-stealing-goods-from-his-unit/articleshow/83491270.cms||---

They have submitted a digital presentation to commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal, who will share it with the municipal corporation to make the required changes.The 10 chowks and roads are: Kesar Ganj Mandi, Girjagarh Chowk, Division 3 Chowk, Mata Rani Chowk, Meena Bazaar Chowk, Old Session Court Chowk towards DMC Hospital, Chander Nagar puli, DMC Road near police lines, Pakhowal Road canal bridge towards Jawaddi, and Atam Nagar Chowk towards bus stand. Assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh said, “The restrictions imposed due to the pandemic have been eased. Eventually, traffic chaos will be back on roads. We have picked up 10 traffic congestion points, where we will work first to decongest them.”The cops arrived at the solutions after studying the reasons for traffic chaos at these points. “At Atam Nagar Chowk, there is a manhole which is a few feet higher than the road. As a result, commuters do not use about 10 feet space. At the Old Session Court Chowk, those who have to go left towards DMC Hospital have to stop at traffic signal. Therefore, we plan to build a slipway there. At Chander Nagar puli, there is a need to make round the sharp edges of the bridge, so that vehicles take less space while taking a turn. At DMC Road towards police lines, there is a need to build a concrete median,” he added.  “At Division 3 Chowk, Kesar Ganj Mandi, Meena Bazaar and Girjagarh Chowk, spring posts should be installed so that vehicles remain on their side of the road,” he said.The traffic police had prepared maps for the project. “However, it was a bit difficult to make others understand these. Meanwhile, a teenager, Daksham, and his father, Rajesh, approached us and expressed willingness to help. Then, Daksham prepared a digital presentation of the maps with a voiceover. Now, municipal corporation and other officials can easily understand the project. I have submitted the project to joint commissioner of police Deepak Pareek, who has sent it to the police commissioner. The presentation will be shared with the MC,” the ACP added. Teenager helps make digital presentationFifteen-year-old Daksham helped police make the presentation easy to understand. Daksham’s father Rajesh, a resident of Shivaji Nagar, said, “Daksham has cleared Class X. He is more into coding. He is already preparing a mobile application of Ludhiana city police free of cost. We had approached the traffic police to know if Daksham can help them in any project and they asked him to prepare the presentation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/plans-afoot-to-decongest-10-busy-chowks-roads/articleshow/83491246.cms||Payal Dhawan

Worried that their field-level employees who deal with thousands of dak—such as letters, parcels, speed posts and cash disbursements to lakhs of beneficiaries—and lost their lives in the pandemic, officials of the postal department are working out roadmaps on safety strategies to tackle pandemic going forward. “A total of 988 Covid cases have been reported in Telangana, of which postal staff recovered in 643 cases and the remaining, 345 are active cases. Till date, 12 departmental staff and another 26 gramin dak sevaks (GDS) died in the pandemic,” S Rajendra Kumar, Telangana chief post master general told TOI. With regard to Andhra Pradesh, the number of active cases and deaths are much higher. Andhra Pradesh chief PMG M Venkateswarlu said, “A total of 1,210 Covid cases have been reported, of which, 534 cases recovered. We have lost 81 departmental staff and GDS employees.” The chief PMGs in both states admitted that the death rate and active cases in GDS employees is higher when compared to departmental staff. GDS work in rural areas and also have direct interaction with general people, while rendering postal services such as sale of stamps and stationery, conveyance and delivery of mail, among other duties, which inclued IPPB work in the Departmental Post Offices/RMS and even cash disbursements. “A SOP of Covid-19 norms to be followed by every postal employee while discharging their duties has been communicated. But lack of awareness cost us many lives, and many were affected,” said S Rajendra Kumar. Despite the second wave of the virus continuing and lockdown being extended, the dak services in the Telugu states did not get paralysed. “The department has provided sanitizers, face masks and hand gloves to all the field staff delivering the letters, speed post and parcels at the people’s doorsteps,” M Venkateswarlu said. Apart from these efforts, a massive sanitization drive is being taken up in and outside of all post office buildings to prevent the spread of the virus, Rajendra Kumar added. Meanwhile, postal department officials have also communicated reports to higher ups of their department in Delhi regarding Covid deaths to quickly get aid for family members of the deceased staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/postal-staff-in-ap-t-continue-to-brave-the-pandemic/articleshow/83494642.cms||Sunil Mungara

The FIR, against Manoj Sevakram Lahori, has come on a complaint by the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation, which accused the builder of constructing the building, Mohini Palace, illegally, that too with poor material. Lahori has been booked under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and other relevant sections of the IPC as well as the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act. In the afternoon of May 15, the fifth floor ceiling of the building gave way, leading to the crash. Last month, in all two buildings collapsed in Ulhasnagar within 15 days of each other, killing a total of 12 people, the other building being Sai Shakti. Civic officials said both buildings were constructed between 1994 and 1996 and were not a part of buildings listed as ‘dangerous’. Indeed, many buildings in Ulhasnagar which have collapsed came up during 1994-1996. After last month’s collapses, residents of 505 buildings in the area were advised to get structural audits done. The list was drawn up by a committee appointed by Ulhasnagar’s municipal commissioner to look into buildings constructed between 1994 and 1998, a period which saw a construction boom in Ulhasnagar. As per the panel’s report, most of these buildings were constructed with an inferior quality of sand. The committee has put out a list of such buildings in each of Ulhasnagar’s municipal wards. The maximum number of such buildings, 160, is in ward four, followed by 133 in ward two, 118 in ward three and 94 in ward one. The case against Lahori was registered after the committee found negligence on his part. The panel found that he had sold flats without even the registration process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-builder-booked-a-month-after-ulhasnagar-building-collapse/articleshow/83494655.cms||Pradeep Gupta

Many parts of the fort have either been destroyed over the years or impacted due to incessant construction activities in the area. “To preserve the historic fort, I had followed up with Cidco MD and the department of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for obtaining permission for restoration. After restoration work by Cidco was discontinued for two months, reportedly due to administrative reasons, I had written to state minister for medical education and cultural affairs Amit Deshmukh for resumption of restoration work at the fort,” said local MLA Manda Mhatre. A Cidco spokesperson said that the chief vigilance officer of Cidco visited the site, along with Cidco’s chief engineer and other engineers concerned. “Cidco vice-chairman and managing director has taken serious cognizance of this incident and has instructed officials to probe the reasons for the structure’s collapse. The debris scattered on the road after the collapse has been cleared. The interlocked scaffolding will be detached from old stone masonry and the unsafe portion will be brought down safely. If required, the adjoining site office will be shifted to avoid any mishap. After completing safety measures, traffic movement will be regularised on the main road,” said the spokesperson. “The fort’s restoration and beautification project was inaugurated by Cidco’s former managing director Lokesh Chandra in June 2019. The fort is spread across 5 acres. Cidco is developing it as a tourist spot and an educational and cultural centre. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 17 crore. Cidco has assigned the task to Kimaya Architects as it has experience in restoration of historical places,” the source added. “Kimaya Architects will adopt the architecture style of historic forts and accordingly use suitable materials for the restoration work. To preserve the biodiversity, the fort and its surroundings will be developed as a natural trail. Battery-operated vehicle will be used within the fort to avoid air pollution and the old bastion will be restored as a watchtower to view the surrounding natural beauty,” said the Cidco official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/relic-in-ruins-a-day-after-collapse-cidco-set-to-resume-fort-restoration/articleshow/83494761.cms||George Mendonca

The 60 lakh-mark was crossed after 83,113 people got vaccine doses in Delhi on Saturday, including 54,788 people who were given the first dose . Atishi, however, added that less than two days of Covaxin and less than one day of Covishield stocks were left for those in the 18-44 age category. “We would like to appeal to the Centre to maintain a regular supply of vaccines for the youth of 18 to 44 years. If the youths are vaccinated quickly, it will help fight hesitancy,” she said. Atishi said that 53.6 lakh vaccine doses were received for those above 45 years of age, of which less than 5.6 lakh doses were left. Delhi had received 72,800 doses of Covaxin on Saturday.

---||Nagpur||93% of 928 fully vaccinated HCWs of pvt hosp stay uninfected in 2nd wave||Nagpur: A study done by Alexis Hospital on its 1,068 doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers (HCW) has found that 93% of the 928 fully vaccinated healthcare workers (HCWs) did not contract Covid-19 despite working amid highly contagious and virulent second wave. Among the 24 HCWs who had only one dose or remained unvaccinated, 79% required hospitalization while the rate was just 3% among 65 HCWs who were infected after receiving both doses. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who is one of the doctors at the hospital located at Mankapur, told TOI that the study was done to ascertain benefits of full vaccination. “Also, we wanted to check whether mutated virus variant escaped antibodies developed after vaccination. Results are very good and prove that antibodies developed after full vaccination also gives protection against mutated variants,” he said. The hospital has been examining and treatment patients of novel coronavirus since August last year. On request of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), the hospital has started vaccination centre from January 29. Deputy director (administration) of the hospital, Dr Nilesh Agrawal, told TOI that fully vaccinating the staff gives confidence while working during the pandemic. “We gave top priority to vaccination. By April first week, 928 (86.9%) of total 1,068 staffers were administered two doses,” he said. One is considered fully vaccinated 15 days after receiving the second dose. “There are very less chances of infection in those fully vaccinated. Of the 928 fully vaccinated staff, 65 (7%) tested positive, and only two (0.22%) required hospitalization. Disease severity was zero as these two HCWs had no severe symptoms,” he said. Dr Agrawal further said that 140 (13.1%) HCWs received either one dose or did not take the jab. “Of them, 24 (17.14%) contracted the disease and 19 (79.17%) of them required hospitalization which is very high as compared to fully vaccinated staff. Three (2.14%) HCWs had severe disease,” he said. “HCWs are always exposed to the virus and can have high viral load, so they must ensure full vaccination,” said Dr Agrawal. He insisted that eligible people should take the jab without any delay. “Along with significant protection against risk of infection, two doses of vaccine also reduce risk of hospitalization as well as chances of acquiring severe disease. Vaccination also helps in containing the spread in family or community,” said Dr Agrawal. As per data of the state government, the district has population of 52,72,665. The government had estimated around 30% (15,81,800) of total population in above 45 age group. Vaccination started for 45-plus with comorbidities and 60-plus from March 1. All above 45-plus were eligible for inoculation from April 1. As per data of state’s public health department, 8,25,430 (52.2%) people from this age group have taken first dose as on June 10. Thus, 7,56,370 (47.8%) people from this age group are yet to be vaccinated. The NMC and Zilla Parishad are running 221 centres across the district. Each centre can easily inoculate 300 in a day. Thus, total capacity of the district is 66,300 per day. But the number of doses is below 5,000 per day for the last few days. On Sunday, 1,357 jabs were given on Sunday, including first and second dose for HCW, frontline workers (FLW), 45-plus and second dose of beneficiaries from 18-44 age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/93-of-928-fully-vaccinated-hcws-of-pvt-hosp-stay-uninfected-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83493330.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The dolphin is suspected to have died of starvation after ingesting a fishing net. The forest department, on being notified of the case, arranged for a necropsy to be carried out on the dolphin by Dr Shantanu Kalambi and Dr Suranjana Ganguly from ReefWatch Marine Conservation. The dolphin was found to have a large mass of fishing net in its stomach, along with a few fish that were also entangled in the net. Samples of the dolphin’s organs were collected for further examination and histopathology. The dolphin was a young male and was found to have a few minor external injuries to the side, which are believed to be potentially rake marks inflicted by other dolphins. Though the likely cause of death is believed to be starvation due to ingestion of the net, the rescuers said that the exact cause of death will only be ascertained after the reports of the samples arrive. The dolphin was 2.43m in length and 0.45m in width. The forest department operated Goa Stranding Network rescue stranded marine animals along Goa’s beaches in a collaborative effort along with ReefWatch Marine Conservation and Terra Conscious. Drishti Lifeguards usually act as the first informers of cases of stranding and immediately a forest department rescuer is rushed for help. The network has helped improve reporting of stranding cases and many Olive Ridley turtles and dolphins have been rescued, especially along South Goa’s coast, recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dead-humpback-dolphin-found-on-vainguinim-beach/articleshow/83495780.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Covid ravaged their lungs, they get back slowly to normalcy||AHMEDABAD: While majority of the patients of Covid-19 — about 70% according to some guesstimates — get on with their lives after mild to moderate symptoms, remaining 30% have a long road to recovery. In second wave, several young patients recorded very high lung involvement due to which their hospital stay was prolonged along with post-discharge recovery. TOI profiles three youths who fought the infection and are now getting back to routine slowly. Jalpa Patel | Lung involvement 80%Jalpa Patel, 35, will complete nearly a month after getting discharged from a hospital after surviving Covid-19. However, the young mother of a six-year-old boy still cannot move around the house in her signature brisk manner as before Covid without stopping to catch her breath. In fact, she is still advised to go slow in doing house work and advocated as much rest as possible to allow her battered lungs to heal. JALPA PATEL“I still feel breathless most of the time. Sometimes the fatigue is extreme. I cannot dare to go up and down the stairs like before. I used to work non-stop before Covid-19. Today, I feel apprehensive at the prospect of walking briskly in the house,” says Jalpa. Jalpa says she along with three of her family members contracted Covid-19 in early April. After spending a few days in home isolation, she started coughing hard and was asked to get a CT scan which revealed 65% of her lung was affected. By the time she was put on oxygen and later on Bipap ventilator, 80% of her lungs were infected. “I was discharged after I could sustain on atmospheric air but my lungs, badly damaged by Covid, are recovering painfully slowly. Doctors say she still needs some more months to fully recover,” says the mother who had sent her super-active son to her brother’s house till she is able to find her strength. Preyash Vora | Lung involvement 70%Preyash Vora, 42, has not recorded a magical recovery from Covid. Son of Gujarat’s famed magician Harshad Vora – better known by his stage name Junior K Lal – who succumbed to Covid, says it has been more than three months when he along with the entire family, barring 92-year-old grandmother, tested positive. “But it has been a slow recovery. Even after discharge, I had to remain on oxygen therapy at home for two months. Till last month, my pulmonary function test score was less than normal,” says Vora. PREYASH VORAVora, a chemical businessman, says while his father succumbed to Covid, he was hospitalized for 12 days as Covid had infected 70% of his lungs. “When I tested negative, doctors advised me to recuperate at home on 4-6 litres of oxygen,” says Vora. All through his recovery, he has been taking personal physiotherapy sessions for breathing to nudge the lungs to recover and breathe life back into him. “I do multiple breathing exercises. In June, doctors said my lung function had improved but still I do not feel fully recovered. I feel breathless while undertaking basic activities like walking and brisk walking initially. Even today, I cannot think of hitting the gym like before. I am slowly moving towards normalcy,” says Vora. Harsh Patel | Lung involvement 50%Harsh Patel, 35, an IT consultant, got the classical symptoms such as fever on April 19. The RT-PCR tested positive, and HRCT was 0/25. “In just three days, it shot up to 15/25. The doctors recommended it due to my rapidly deteriorating condition, says Patel, whose father and uncle also got infected, but they did not need hospitalization. Harsh PatelWith breathing difficulty, Patel was admitted to a city-based hospital, and after a week, he had to be first taken on NRBM (non-rebreathable mask) and then on BiPAP. “The lung involvement was over 50%, and I was praying fervently that I would get back with my family. I had already lost a friend to the pandemic,” he said. In all, Patel spent 25 days under hospitalization. “I got shifted to another hospital due to the lung damage. Even after the discharge, I need some oxygen breathing at home, as my physiotherapy to improve lung condition is also on,” he said. Today he is on path of recovery. His relatives said that with physiotherapy sessions, Patel has started walking slowly within his room. The oxygen requirements have also gone down a bit as he is hopeful of getting back to routine soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-ravaged-their-lungs-they-get-back-slowly-to-normalcy/articleshow/83494720.cms||---

The weekend rush was witnessed at popular destinations including Khadakwasla dam, Sinhagad fort, Panshet, Lonavla and Khandala. Stringent norms that have been in place for over a year fell by the wayside when people flocked to these popular hangouts and water bodies without wearing masks or maintaining proper distance. Entire families along with children were spotted enjoying a day out on both sides of the Khadakwasla dam on Sunday. Close on the heels of the latest relaxations in the Covid curbs, a large number of people from Pune and adjoining areas thronged various picnic and tourist spots around the city on Sunday, giving a tough time to the police to handle the situation. In fact, the Sinhagad fort and the shops at Khadakwasla chowpaty remained closed while forest officials had shut down the road leading to the fort at Donje. However, people were seen arguing with them to let them go up to the fort. Similarly, traffic in Lonavla went haywire on Sunday evening as a large a number of revellers from Pune and Mumbai arrived to enjoy the weekend at the popular hill station in the monsoon. The Lonavla city police on Sunday evening had a tough time streamlining the traffic. Inspector Sadashiv Shelar of Haveli police said, “We were anticipating a crowd at the Khadakwasla dam site and also at Sinhagad fort. We had bandobast at both the points to control the crowd. Many people listened to what we said but many kept defying our repeated requests and we had to fine them. Many tourists at the spot were not wearing masks and did not follow the norms of social distancing.” According to the forest officials, many tourists started arriving at Donje village and demanded that their vehicles be allowed to travel towards Sinhagad fort. However, forest officials refused them entry. Many citizens then climbed to the fort on Sunday morning. The small eateries on the fort are shut but curd and lemon juice sellers made brisk business, the police said. “The situation was such that there was a large crowd at the entrance gates of the fort,” Shelar said. There was strong bandobast at the fort and people were told to leave the fort premises as soon as possible using the public address system, he added. Vehicular movement was disrupted at Khadakwasla dam site owing to the haphazard parking by people, Shelar said. “We cleared the traffic by the evening,” he said. Inspector Dilip Pawar said all picnic spots like Bhushi dam and Tiger Point in Lonavla and Khandala have been closed for visitors following Covid-19 related restrictions. “We have deployed police personnel at these spots and do not allow anyone to go there,” Pawar said. He said following an ease in the restrictions in Pune and Mumbai, people came to Lonavla anticipating that everything is open now. “We have penalised the people if they found violating restrictions,” Pawar said. An officer from the Lonavla Rural police said compared with Lonavla city, the footfalls in the rural parts was less. “People however are not allowed to visit the tourist spots,” he added. An officer from the Pune Rural police said between Saturday and Sunday over 450 people have been penalised for not wearing masks and not following social distancing, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crowd-at-picnic-spots-fears-no-virus-defies-covid-norms/articleshow/83493349.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Dehradun||Economist-turned educationist who changed lives of many Dehradun children, passes away||DEHRADUN: GK Swamy, who helped provide free quality education to many underprivileged children in Purkal village and adjoining villages in Dehradun, died aged 84 on Friday. Swamy was founder of the Purkal Youth Development Society (PYDS), a CBSE-affiliated institution which set a new benchmark in providing top-notch education facilities to children from impoverished backgrounds free of charge along with freshly cooked meals daily as well as pick up and drop facilities. Swamy’s insistence on not compromising with quality at the school which currently has around 500 students, resulted in many of the students, children of housemaids as well as daily wagers, going on to win international awards and studying at prominent US universities on scholarships. In a 2017 interview with TOI, Swamy had said, “I believe that all children have immense potential and poverty should not hold them back. That is why we give them an education which ensures that they and their families never have to go back to the life they started from.” Born in Tamil Nadu, GK Swamy lived in Mumbai for most of his professional life and worked as a consultant in capital investment before retiring and shifting to Purkal in 1997. He subsequently started helping a few village children with their studies in order to help them make the transition to a good English medium school from the village Hindi medium school. Later, as more and more children started coming, he along with his wife Chinni founded PYDS in 2003. The couple also started another organisation, Stree Shakti to help village women become financially independent Swamy was honoured with several awards for his efforts, including the International Social Impact Award in 2017 by the Resource Alliance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/economist-turned-educationist-who-changed-lives-of-many-kids-passes-away/articleshow/83491421.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Crowdfunded camp gives Mumbai slum shot in the arm||MUMBAI: Unlike most others, Dilip Lokhande grinned while taking the jab at a one-day camp set up in Govandi's Shivaji Nagar slum on Friday. It meant he could finally resume work at a local pharmaceuticals company which did not take in employees that were not vaccinated against Covid-19. Lokhande was among the 152 beneficiaries-- all between 18 and 45 years of age-- who got the jab at the first vaccination camp inside a slum crowdfunded by private individuals. Due to an erratic vaccine supply, the BMC discontinued shots for the 18-44 years category in public hospitals last month. Private hospitals have been administering shots to this age group. But their tie-ups have been limited to residential complexes and corporate offices so far. The camp in the Govandi slum was organised by a non-profit through crowdfunding raised by the Indian Graduate Student Association, a US-based Indian students' body. "I was getting desperate for vaccine shots as I couldn't go to work and earn without them," said Lokhande, 33, a resident of Zakir Hussain Nagar. He had made umpteem rounds of hospitals looking for vaccines but was turned away every time. "I had been to the BKC Jumbo centre, Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi and even travelled upto Nerul to a hospital. But I was told I did not fit into the permitted age group for vaccination. It left me anxious as I'm the sole breadwinner," he said. Besides being unable to afford vaccines in private hospitals, slum dwellers face the challenge of lack of digital literacy. Shehzad Ansari, who did not own a smartphone and couldn't register on the CoWin platform, landed up at the Govandi camp and waited for five hours till everyone was done so he could be registered by volunteers and then inoculated. Then, there are myths among communities about the side-effects of vaccines. Non profit groups carried out awareness drives for a month before setting up the vaccination camp just to dispel fears among residents. "Everyone around had been scaring me about the side effects of the vaccine. They said I would fall ill or could even die. But I have not experienced a single side effect and I'm glad the volunteers convinced me to take the vaccine at the camp," said Vijayalakshmi Shukla, a Bainganwadi resident. Young adults from the slum work largely as drivers, househelps, cabbies, security guards and do odd jobs in offices. They have been setting out since the city partially unlocked. "While we were setting up the vaccination camp, several curious onlookers gathered wanting to know if we were giving out food supplies," said Shievani Upadhyay of the Enrich Lives Foundation that organised the camp. "We gave out coupons and fixed time slots in advance for the beneficiaries. But our big learning was to have a printer on site. Many of these people do not have the resources to print out vaccination certificates later," said Upadhyay. The organisation had procured vaccine supplies from the Surana Sethia Hospital in Chembur and intend to reach out to more slums next. "We are happy to be administering shots to the underprivileged who should have been prioritized," said Dr Prince Surana, CEO, Surana Sethia Hospital. Meanwhile, Lokhande plans to register his wife online so she can take a jab the next time a camp is organised in Govandi while he looks after their two kids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/crowdfunded-camp-gives-city-slum-shot-in-the-arm/articleshow/83495762.cms||Nitasha Natu

The project had been stalled since 2019 for not having clearances or over exemptions the state wanted, but has now been approved by the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) though an inspection team it sent had recommended “avoiding” the project as the best mitigation strategy. The entire road is meant to connect two points in the forest patch, Laldhang and Chilarkhal, a release from the CM’s office on Friday said. But the plan has worried environmentalists and activists for two broad reasons — the construction itself will disrupt wildlife habitat and migration routes, and the increased traffic will disturb tigers, elephants, leopards, deer and other ungulates who inhabit these forests. An inspection committee, which visited the forest construction site in March, listed five major effects of road upgrade — habitat loss and fragmentation, disturbance of environment which would render habitats unsuitable for various species, death of animals by moving vehicles, disruption of wildlife connectivity and barriers to animals’ movement. The state, however, said the road has to be built.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/road-through-corbett-rajaji-corridor-to-hit-wildlife-habitat/articleshow/83498483.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena legislator’s lesson on cleanliness causes a stink||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena legislator from Chandivali Dilip Lande on Saturday forced a nullah cleaning contractor to sit on a waterlogged road and asked workers to throw garbage on him, alleging he did not do his job properly. Condemning the act, opposition leader in the legislative council Pravin Darekar called for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to take a stand on whether his MLA’s conduct was justified. In his defence, Lande told TOI that the contractor was assigned to clean the Sanjay Nagar nullah and to deploy 3-4 workers at the spot to ensure rainwater recedes quickly, but no one was present at the spot. The Sena MLA has alleged that due to shoddy work, there was waterlogging on the LBS road leading to inconvenience to the locals. Times ViewShiv Sena MLA Dilip Lande has courted such controversies in the past too. Violent and vengeful acts are not expected, especially from an MLA. Police must take stern action and book Lande. The Sena leadership must also ensure that such acts are not encouraged. Regardless of the shoddy work by BMC contractors, legislators cannot take the law into their own hands or behave like vigilantes.“As a public representative of the area, the onus is also on me. I was trying to call him for two hours but he did not come. He later came to see me when I, with the help of some Shiv Sainiks, had already started cleaning the drainage. I only made him realise his responsibility,” said Lande. Waterlogging in various areas of the city has debunked BMC’s claim that most of nullah cleaning work has been completed. Reacting to this, Mayor Kishori Pednekar said, “I personally feel he should not have done this. But it is also the responsibility of the contractor to do his work properly so that people don’t blame the ruling party.” A BMC official said the worker harassed by Lande could be of a sub-contractor. “ If there is a complaint, the police will have to take action,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-legislators-lesson-on-cleanliness-causes-a-stink/articleshow/83494818.cms||---

On April 8, the education department had organized a draw of lots for the admission through video conferencing. The list of eligible students was declared on the same day and the students were informed by the education department. But the admission process had stopped due to the pandemic. Now, as the Covid-related restrictions have been relaxed by the government, the process for actual admission has started again. Education officer of NMC Sunita Dhangar has also issued a statement about commencement of admission process under the RTE. “Eligible students will have to approach the schools concerned. The dates for admission in the particular schools have been given on the portal and parents will have to approach the school with original documents on the dates provided by the education department,” the statement said. The NMC’s education department emphasised that only parents will have to approach the school on the concerned dates for admission and they should not take children with them to schools in view of the pandemic. There are 91 schools registered under the RTE with 1,546 seats under the jurisdiction of the NMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-begins-rte-admission-process-for-eligible-students/articleshow/83488474.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Nagpur||38 cases, 30 arrests in city for child pornography in last eight months||Nagpur: Around 30 persons were arrested in 38 cases of child pornography registered by city police under CP Amitesh Kumar in eight months. Most complaints were registered suo motu by police following inputs received from the state cyber intelligence and security unit after being alerted by National cyber crime reporting portal (NCCRP). The experts cautioned parents to be watchful about their children’s internet use as this segment is the most targeted one by the online sex predators, paedophiles and stalkers. As the online classes and tuitions have made mobile phones more accessible for the children, mental health practitioners feel they have become more curious about different things available on the internet including the explicit content which often pop-up during surfing sessions. Kumar said child pornography was a serious offence from which every one should remain at a safe distance or be ready to face serious legal consequences. “Even viewing and surfing for child pornography is an offence, leave alone storing, posting, sharing or forwarding by any means. The police, especially cyber cell, is keeping high vigil,” said the CP adding police were ready to come down heavily on such crime. With the child pornography being on high demand in the dark net and paid porn sites, global and Indian NGOs have already raised a red flag about the need to protect the children from this malady. “Global NGOs working as watchdogs alert our NCCRP regarding IP addresses being used for child porn which is relayed to state unit and then to local police for action. There is also a guideline from the apex court,” said senior inspector Ashok Bagul, incharge of the cyber cell. Cyber psychologist Prof Rakesh Kriplani, who also worked as child psychologists, said an action by the Interpol had already underlined the fact that India occupies high on the target list of the online stalkers, predators and paedophiles. “Study suggests that 85% of the children get accidental exposure to pornography as they come across such sites through pop-ups or by clicking some stray links sent to them by the predators. Many are scared to go beyond it but some get hooked,” he said. Kriplani advised parents to avoid posting pictures of their children online. “Block the front cameras of mobile phones or the smart TVs which may be misused by the cyber crooks to record videos and images from bedrooms or bathrooms,” he said. Activist Mahendra Limaye underlined the fact that child pornography was an offence under Section 67B of the IT Act but investigating agencies should use discretion to differentiate which child pornography involving sexual activities and which are mere innocent photographs having no mischief motives. Psychiatrist Rajesh Rathi said some people are sex addicts or show compulsive behaviour for getting rid of stress and so on while there are some who resort to child pornography as a mere ‘situational’ condition. The last types are the ones who can be labelled as ‘paedophiles’. “There are also people categorized under anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) who can also indulge in child pornography,” said Rathi. District child protection officer Mushtaq Pathan said parents must keep their child under watch when latter are using laptops or smartphones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/38-cases-30-arrests-in-city-for-child-pornography-in-last-eight-months/articleshow/83493363.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Delhi||Fuel price hike pinching, but we are saving money for welfare schemes: Union minister||New Delhi: Union minister of petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said that while the current high fuel prices were problematic for consumers, the government was saving money to spend on welfare schemes, with almost Rs 35,000 crore spent on vaccines in a year. Talking to reporters after inaugurating a PSA-based Medical Oxygen Generating Plant and Booster Unit at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Punjabi Bagh, Pradhan said that Rs 1 lakh crore had been spent on Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana this year to provide eight months of free ration to the poor. He also said that many crores had been transferred to farmers’ bank accounts under PM-Kisan yojna and the MSP on rice and wheat was also hiked recently. Pradhan said that all this was happening in the current year and all this expenditure was needed to create employment and development. He said that during these troubled times, the government was saving for welfare schemes. When asked about Congress’ Rahul Gandhi targeting the Centre on fuel prices, Pradhan said he should answer why fuel prices were high in Congress-led states like Punjab, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. “If Rahul Gandhi is so concerned, why doesn’t he ask Uddhav Thackeray to reduce taxes, as fuel prices are very high in Mumbai?" he said, adding that the price of petrol was among the highest in Congress-ledRajasthan. The oxygen plant at the hospital has been set up by Indraprastha Gas Limited as part of its CSR initiative and has a capacity of 1,000 L/m. The ministry said in a statement that the plant could also be used to fill oxygen cylinders and six more PSA based plants were being set up in Delhi by oil and gas PSUs. Speaking about vaccination, he called for all stakeholders of the society to join hands and make vaccination a ‘Jan Andolan’. He also spoke about efforts taken by the government that would ensure enhanced availability of vaccines in times to come and the decision taken by PM Narendra Modi to provide free vaccines to the states in the true spirit of cooperative federalism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fuel-price-hike-pinching-but-we-are-saving-money-for-welfare-schemes-union-minister/articleshow/83493378.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic administration has cremated 600 bodies using this material, which produces less carbon after burning. White coal is not only environment-friendly, but is also proving to be cost effective. The expense to cremate a dead body has gone down by 30% compared to traditional wood. There are 23 cremation facilities in PMC limits — 10 have electrical facilities while 13 avail gas. Five out of these 23 have both electrical and gas facilities along with wood pyres. The civic officials said complaints were raised by some citizens about pollution at crematoriums. “The civic administration has decided to procure more white coal for cremation. We are planning to reduce the dependency on wood for cremation. The decision has been taken to reduce pollution,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eco-friendly-cremation-with-white-coal-in-pmc-limits/articleshow/83493365.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Kunnathunadu has highest cases per million people in Ernakulam||KOCHI: Covid cases per million is highest in Kunnathunadu panchayat in Ernakulam, with a large number of the population in the local body contracting the viral infection through local transmission. With 1,81,196 cases per million, Kunnathunadu tops the list compared with the other local bodies in the district. The corresponding numbers for Kochi corporation and Ernakulam are 67,208 cases and 86,723 cases per million. The population in the panchayat comes to around 18,422 with a total of 3,338 people having tested positive for the disease till June 12 since the pandemic struck last year. At the same time, Kochi Corporation, with a population of 7,62,619 people recorded 51,254 cases. As many as 10 other local bodies in the district have clocked cases above one lakh per million. The number of cases per million has been lowest in Amballoor panchayat (36,602), according to the data. Health officials attribute the rise in the number of cases per million to an increase in testing. “The high number does not mean that the panchayat’s Covid management has been poor. Instead, it can be due to extensive testing. Chances of missing cases are comparatively less in such local bodies where the caseload is high. In general, case detection is earlier in such local bodies and it is reflected in low case fatality rates too. When most of the population is infected, people will have some herd immunity which will delay next wave. But it is hard to tell at which point they will achieve herd immunity since we don’t know about the seroprevalence. But testing has been ramped up in Kunnathunadu and the test positivity rate in the panchayat is coming down,” said a health official. Experts say more cases per million reflects the extent of the spread of the infection among the population in the local body. “We can say the population has achieved herd immunity only after 60% of them contract the infection. We have still not reached that level. The cases per million in the corporation is less compared to other panchayats because of the large population. The corporation has a population of around seven lakh people. We have to look into TPR over the year to know the exact situtation. What the authorities have to do is increase the vaccination drive,” said Dr Padmanabha Shenoy. “It is difficult to understand how only some local bodies report high cases per million and the numbers vary in adjacent panchayats too. TPR is the important bench mark in deciding the situation since it reflects the activities of the elected members of the respective local body and health workers in the area,” said Dr Junaid Rehman, former president of IMA, Ernakulam chapter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kunnathunadu-has-highest-cases-per-mn-people-in-ekm/articleshow/83493385.cms||T C Sreemol

The need to vaccinate them was felt on priority so the OMCs and the district administration chalked out a vaccination drive for the delivery personnel“As they come into contact with large numbers of people during their daily routine, they need protection against the virus and hence the programme was taken up with the help of the OMCs,” said Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector and nodal officer for vaccination. The delivery personnel of one of the OMCs have been vaccinated while the drive for two other OMCs is in progress. Prashant Suryawanshi, the nodal officer of an OMC, said there are 675 delivery personnel of the OMC in Nashik, of them, 653 have taken the jab. “All 653, who were eligible for vaccination, have been vaccinated. The rest had contracted infection so now they are in the waiting period,” he said. In the next round of vaccination, all the remaining delivery personnel of the company will be vaccinated. Similarly, there are 200 delivery personnel of two other OMCs who are still waiting for the vaccination. These 200 people will also be vaccinated in the next 20 days, the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/653-lpg-delivery-personnel-get-jabs-in-nashik/articleshow/83488582.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Experts said a dedicated oxygen bank operated by civic bodies would go a long way in meeting the needs of private hospitals, many of which – especially small and medium units – rely on private vendors for supply. “Generally, big hospitals have their own plants, but small and medium facilities are reliant on suppliers or refillers. In such case, a permanent oxygen bank will prove quite helpful, as they can respond early to an SOS call,” Sanjay Patil, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, told TOI. Patil said Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had set up a temporary oxygen bank at Sassoon General Hospital during the second wave and proved quite helpful. Such a move, when permanent, would be helpful. Subhash Salunke, advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said building up oxygen capacity is the best way forward. “We hope that some financial assistance would be offered to hospitals, which could help them construct their own plants,” Salunke said. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said PMC has set up four oxygen generation plants and that eight more were in the pipeline. “We have managed to increase our oxygen storage capacity to 52 metric tonnes. This will help us create better reserves in case of a rise in demand from civic or private hospitals in the future,” Mohol said. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said two civic hospitals can now cater to the needs of 200-and-odd patients. “Seven more plants are under construction and should be ready by this month-end,” Patil said. Pune FDA joint commissioner Suresh Patil said oxygen consumption has gone down drastically in the district — 125 metric tonnes per day, from a peak of 363 MT/day. Software testsAdditional collector Vijay Deshmukh said the trials of Oxywin and Oxychain apps were underway at Sassoon, Devyani and Baramati hospitala. Oxychain involves the manufacturer, supplier, and refiller. The app gives real-time data on how much liquid oxygen was produced, how much was supplied and to whom. Oxywin is a dashboard for real-time patients’ oxygen saturation data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/oxygen-banks-generation-plants-key-to-tackling-3rd-wave-experts/articleshow/83493369.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The Centre’s department of pharmaceuticals had sought a few clarifications from the directorate of industries, trade and commerce, which have been provided, said director for industries Swetika Sachan. The state has identified a parcel of land of approximately 250 acres at the Verna industrial estate that is in possession of the Goa Industrial Development Corporation. Of the 250 acres, around 125 acres would be made available for allotment to units manufacturing medical devices. “Goa’s proposal is pending with the Centre. It is scrutinising all the applications received from the states,” said Sachan. “More information was sought regarding feasibility and a financial viability study of the project, including assumptions made.” The Centre also sought additional information on the incentives and industrial schemes offered to potential investors. India’s medical devices manufacturing sector lacks a level playing field when compared to those in other countries. “The medical device industry in an upcoming one with a lot of potential for job creation in the state in the areas of manufacturing and research. Already, a few such industries are operating in Goa. Also, many technical institutes in the state have shown their support towards the proposal,” Sachan said. Since the proposal has to be accepted by the Government of India, the Goa government has not formally approached any industries or firms or tried to woo investors to set up medical device manufacturing units. The Centre is offering a grant-in-aid of 70% of the project cost of common infrastructure facilities, up to Rs 100 crore, while 30% of the cost has to be borne by Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/proposed-med-device-park-still-under-centres-scrutiny/articleshow/83495822.cms||---

Jagtap and others had gathered at the SV Road Junction in the suburb on Saturday in violation of the guidelines. Some of them were not wearing the face mask during the protest, he said. During the protest, the Congress workers raised slogans against the Central government over the continuous rise in the prices of petrol and diesel. Petrol and diesel prices in the country touched all-time high recently.

---||Kolkata||Scared of Covid spread, village in Sunderbans bars ‘relief tourism’||KOLKATA: Worried over the rush of a large number of “relief tourists” accompanying social welfare groups and NGOs to distribute post-Yaas relief in the remote islands of the Sunderbans, the village head of Mousuni island has issued a notice banning the movement of boats carrying relief without the permission of the local Gram Panchayat. “We are grateful to NGOs and good Samaritans for helping people in Mousuni during this hour of crisis. But we have seen a growing trend of a large number of people, at times numbering more than 100, coming to the island with relief distribution teams and they are violating Covid protocols, which can actually do more harm to the villagers. We are not against the help but we have asked them to seek prior permission and limit the number of people accompanying them with the relief items,” said Hasna Banu Bibi, the village Pradhan. During multiple visits to the island post Yaas, TOI has also found a large group of people heading to the villages with limited packs of relief items. There has also been a similar situation in Digha and Tajpur areas. While some groups head towards the sea to enjoy a beach walk amidst the safety restrictions, some others get busy doing videography and conducting social media lives in a bid to show off their act of philanthropy. “Last week, there was a group of 60 people carrying only two sacks of rice and four crates of mineral water. They booked eight totos for a tour to the island while dropping the relief items before a group of villagers. People also come with used and torn clothes that are unwearable,” said Sheikh Monirul, a Mousuni villager. Meanwhile, such “relief tourism” is causing a large scale river pollution with relief workers littering plastic bottles, thermocol plates and plastic bags in the water and it has become a matter of grave concern for the district administration in Sunderbans. “Such has been the extent of pollution that we have started a project to collect discarded plastic bottles and other non-biodegradable waste from the entire coastal area. We have also deployed a special team at all the prominent ghats to instruct people not to litter plastic waste in the Sunderbans and limit the number of participants heading for distribution,” said P Ulaganathan, the South 24 Parganas’s district magistrate. Last week, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had also urged the NGOs to work in coordination with the district administration while distributing relief items. “Most NGOs approach us and we guide them to the right islands and villages. Only a few violate protocols that cause all the trouble,” the DM said. Indrajit Basu, additional superintendent of Baruipur police division, said “The way plastic bottles and thermocol plates are floating in Sunderbans rivers is extremely worrying. Some have even floated deep into the core areas of the forest. This has to stop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relief-tourism-worry-for-sunderbans/articleshow/83493375.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Pune||‘Use posaconazole jabs if key mucor drug is scarce’||Pune: The Joint National Task Force for Covid-19 has said that posaconazole injections can be used to treat mucormycosis if amphotericin B is unavailable or cannot be used in patients with severe intolerance to the drug.Nationwide, there is a shortage of amphotericin B. Experts said the task force advisory— on posaconazole use — is primarily a stopgap until supply improves. “It (injectable posaconazole) is usually recommended as an alternative when both the liposomal or conventional amphotericin B formulations are unavailable. It can also be used if a patient cannot tolerate amphotericin B and develops toxicity,” said Sanjay Pujari, a member of the task force.As many as 28,252 mucormycosis cases have been reported from 28 states and UTs. Most have come from Maharashtra (6,339 cases) and Gujarat (5,486). Posaconazole in India is available as both an oral tablet and intravenous (IV) injection. “The maximum posaconazole concentration in the blood with IV formulation is seven-fold higher than what’s achieved by a single tablet of oral posaconazole. So effective blood levels are reached rapidly by the IV route. This is important during primary treatment of mucormycosis to achieve rapid anti-fungal effect,” Pujari said.The injectable form of posaconazole is recommended only as initial therapy if availability of amphotericin B is a problem. “Oral tablets of posaconazole are preferred as step-down treatment and continued for three to six months to prevent a recurrence,” Pujari said.Posaconazole is available from international and Indian manufacturers. It's availability early on was limited, but the situation has been improving. Experts said the drug’s scaled up manufacturing will increase stock. “Posaconzale generally benefits those patients who do not have aggressive disease,” said Ruby Hall Clinic’s ENT surgeon Sandeep Karmarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/use-posaconazole-jabs-if-key-mucor-drug-is-scarce/articleshow/83493380.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Residents’ forums organise jab drives for domestic helps, families||KOLKATA: Residents’ associations across the city are including their domestic helps, security guards and other support staff in the vaccination drives and even bearing the expenses of vaccinating them. In most residential complexes and gated communities, the maids and their immediate family members are being included in the vaccination drives. Residents’ Welfare Associations say that many support staff, who were reluctant to get vaccinated earlier, willingly participated this time when they found that their employers queued up with them and others, who already took the vaccine, have had no adverse effects on health. Asha Cooperative Housing Society on Deshpran Sasmal Road, with 236 apartments, is organising a two-day vaccination camp on June 14 and 15 in collaboration with AMRI Hospitals. “More than 300 people will be vaccinated. Along with the residents, domestic helps, support staff and drivers will be vaccinated too. The society will bear the expenses of their vaccination,” said Vijay Kapoor, a senior member of the society. There have always been some people who are reluctant to take vaccines and their concerns stem from personal safety, lack of knowledge about the vaccine and its efficacy. There are socio-economical reasons too. Those, who are the only earning members of their families, feel what will happen if they fall ill. In New Town, several thousand residents and their support staff have been vaccinated in the past one month. “There were a few people in some areas, who showed reluctance in getting vaccinated initially. We counselled them and told them why they should get inoculated not only for their own safety but also for the safety of their families and employers,” said Samaresh Das, chairman of New Town Forum and News, an NGO in New Town. In some households, the owners had to adopt a strict stance when their domestic workers refused to get vaccinated. “I told my maid that getting vaccinated was non-negotiable. We also offered to pay not only for her vaccination but for her entire family. It took us a few days to convince her but she came around,” said Debolina Roy, a resident of Swastik Apartments in Dum Dum Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/residents-forums-organise-jab-drives-for-domestic-helps-families/articleshow/83493386.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||Dist gets only 16% of amphotericin needs||Pune: A total of 12,838 vials of amphotericin B were supplied to hospitals in the district treating Covid-associated mucormycosis between May 20 and June 10, data has shown. But actual requirement — considering each patient needs at least six vials daily for a minimum 21-day course — is 80,000 vials for the 636 patients who are undergoing treatment in the district. The district administration had moved to control the supply and distribution of amphotericin B from May 20 following reports of widespread shortages and black marketing of the drug. Among treating hospitals, government-run units got the maximum share of the drug (7,677 vials). Private hospitals got 2,276 vials. Eleven hospitals/medical colleges in the district, designated under the state-sponsored health scheme for free mucormycosis treatment, received 2,885 vials during this period. “Total allocation has just been 16% of the district’s requirement. How can doctors treat patients when key drugs are not available in the required amount?” said health activist Abhijit More. ENT surgeon Samir Joshi of Sassoon Hospital said, “Amphotericin B, either conventional or liposomal, plays a key role in arresting spread of deep-seated mucormycosis. Surgeries are only helpful in clearing tissue that's already damaged.” Last week, the state told the Bombay High Court that of the 600 mucormycosis deaths till June 10, 82 had occurred within 36 hours due to shortage of amphotericin B injection. The court then asked the Centre to increase Maharashtra's allocation of the injection and import medicines as domestic production was insufficient.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-gets-only-16-of-amphotericin-needs/articleshow/83493382.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Row over mandatory dose for MGNREGA work in Dungarpur||JAIPUR: Simalwara Panchayat Samiti’s order allowing only those labourers to work in MGNREGA who have taken at least one dose of vaccine has courted controversy in the district. The move was taken to encourage villagers for vaccination has been opposed by the Bharatiya Tribal Party. Dungarpur is among the districts which are facing severe vaccine hesitancy from the villagers, especially tribals. The administration feels that this move will help people in dispelling the myth around vaccination. The order reads that only those villagers in the age group of 45 years and above and vaccinated will be added to the muster roll for MGNREGA. The decision was taken by Simalwara Panchayat Samiti Vikas Adhikari Harikesh Meena. TOI repeatedly called him, but didn’t get any response. The panchayat has 400 works approved under the MGNREGA which requires 6,000 workers. The MGNREGA work has recently resumed and is the only lifeline for several households in the area. The area witnessed inward migration in March with the onset of the second wave. Anita Roat, pradhan at Jyotri village, said that this order would prevent several eligible persons to add their name to the muster roll. “If the government has not made vaccination compulsory, how can an officer make it compulsory for MGNREGA. It should be revoked,” Roat said. Velaram Ghogra, state president of BTP, said that it appears to be an absurd call by the administration forcing the people to gt vaccinated. “This is not the right way to motivate people for vaccination. It will only create chaos among villagers or eligible persons who have lost their livelihood due to Covid. The officer should give them time for at least three months since the vaccination drive is very slow in the district,” Ghogra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/row-over-mandatory-vax-dose-for-mgnrega-work/articleshow/83493387.cms||---
---||Jaipur||‘Rajasthan remains laggard in creating jobs in manufacturing sector’||JAIPUR: The manufacturing sector in Rajasthan has remained a laggard in jobs creation. As per Niti Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goal report, the sector generates only 7.5% of the total jobs against a target of 20%. Rajasthan ranks 25th among the states and Union Territories. Lower level of value addition is one of the major reasons why the state failed to expand its manufacturing base, and thereby employment, the report indicates. With manufacturing activity remaining stagnant, innovation also has taken a backseat. Dileep Baid, ex-chairman of CII-Rajasthan said, “The desert state is rich in minerals and basic raw materials, but value addition remains a challenge due to lack of industrialisation.” Giving an example, Baid said that most of the minerals and raw material required for ceramic industry are produced in the state but they are sourced by Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and even Bangladesh. “Gujarat has become a hub for ceramics industry. Even the raw material is exported to Bangladesh where the ceramic industry is flourishing. But we have failed to take advantage of our raw materials by not being able to add value. Raw material availability alone will not attract investment unless we provide the whole ecosystem,” said Baid. Another sector where value addition leaves much to be desired is dimensional stone including, marble, granite, sandstone where Rajasthan enjoys a clear edge over other states. But much of the production (stone blocks) is exported without value addition closing the door for new economic opportunities including creation of jobs. Ishwinder Singh, president, Federation of Indian Granite & Stone Industry, said, “Earlier, Rajasthan used to be known for marble and sandstone. Now, we have become leader in granite as well. But much of the industry is in the unorganised sector. In the absence of big investments, it is hard to get newer technologies which are critical for value addition.” Similarly, the state produces largest quantities of mustard, guar, carom-seeds, coriander, fenugreek, henna, and isabgol. It is the second largest producer of gram, cumin seeds, milk along huge quantities of soybean, pulses and oil seeds. But it has remained a laggard in attracting investments in processing units. Baid said the state needs to improve its ease of doing business. On the ground, it takes decades to convert land use and the entrepreneurs cannot wait that long in the competitive world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-remains-laggard-in-creating-jobs-in-mfg-sector-says-nitis-sdg-report/articleshow/83493383.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Nagpur||Empty testing centres await patients, researcher tries self-testing method at Raj Nagar||Nagpur: Staff at the RTPCR testing centres sits idle these days, with the odd person turning up. The sample is quickly taken and then the wait continues. It was a dull Sunday at the four RTPCR centres visited by TOI. The visitors ranged from 20 to 40 in each. The numbers on week days are only slightly more, said the staffers. The same places had long queues in April and May. There have been days when none of the samples tested positive. Otherwise, the numbers range from 2 to 3 positive tests in a day’s lot from a centre. Most of them are asymptomatic, said the staffers. Those turning up for the tests mainly want it to facilitate travel or rejoining work. The same centres were full of patients referred by doctors to get a test done. The numbers have halved since a fortnight, said the health workers. Meanwhile, preparations continue for the likely third wave, with easier methods of testing being tried out. At Raj Nagar, Sittanshu Shastri, who introduces himself as a healthcare freelancer, has set up a counter in association with the Government Medical College (GMC). Shastri is looking for persons who will try the self-testing method. Here the patients can take their own nasal and throat swab. It’s easy and less painful as compared to when done by a healthcare worker, he says. “Healthcare workers cannot see inside so they straightaway put the stick inside the nose, which is a bit painful. The person doing it on his own has to push only till a resistance is felt inside, or one gets teary eyes. It does not pain,” says Shastri. The method, which was mooted by him at GMC, has been approved by ICMR. So far 36 samples have been taken since it was started at Raj Bhavan two days ago. This was still part of research however. Approval is awaited for research on another method, under which tests can be done by chewing on a cotton piece, from which saliva can be extracted through centrifugation. Such method can help save time if cases increase in third wave, he says. The self-testing method began with a pilot project at GMC in which 30 person participated in December. Work on a method of carrying out anti-body tests through blood samples taken by pricking on finger is also planned, he said. Next stage will be allowing people to take samples unsupervised, in their own homes, he said. Krish Yadav, who agreed for the self-sampling along with another relative, wanted to get tested before travel. As TOI spoke to people turning up at the centres, majority of them cited travel as the reason for getting the tests done. A student, Shubam Kalambe, had to report at the medical college in Wardha for which a Covid negative report was needed. At the Law College testing centre, Devansh Goyal had come as he needed to get a test done to visit his grandmother, who is admitted in hospital. She does not have Covid but the hospital is insisting on a negative report for visitors, he said. Seema Daryani had come to collect her mother’s report. “As she felt weak, her doctor recommended a RTPCR test. She is negative,” said Daryani. The Pachpaoli testing centre also has a 80-bed oxygen centre. On Sunday, there were only eight patients, due to be discharged in a week, said a volunteer here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/empty-testing-centres-await-patients-researcher-tries-self-testing-method-at-raj-nagar/articleshow/83493403.cms||Shishir Arya

Doctors here said that the recent Kerala high court order, allowing homeopathic doctors to prescribe preventive medicine against Covid 19, has come as a booster for this branch of medicine. The college authorities have also started telemedicine service and distribution of preventive medicines in association with Chottanikkara panchayat. “I have been prescribing homeo immune booster Ars Alb 30 to many including police personnel, staff of FACT, Kochi Refinery and OEN and other health workers,” said Dr Hari of Padiyar Homeo College. He said, convinced by the result of the immune booster, many institutions are now very keen to contact the doctors here to continue with the usage of homeo medicine. “As the second wave intensified we have been providing immune boosters to prisons and other working places like Shipyard and Cochin Port Trust,” said district medical officer (homeopathy) Dr Leena Rani. Officials said that as the immune booster could provide a safe shield against the pandemic, they have been facing a shortage of medicine to meet the ever increasing demand from all corners. “Along with the vaccine shortage and sudden increase in the number of Covid-positive cases, we were forced to become selective in providing homeo medicine,” Rani said. Besides the department’s direct supply, local self-government bodies too are engaged in distributing Ars Alb 30 through ward-level medical camps. Srikanth Nambuthiri, an audiologist, has been promoting usage of this medicine and even used a unique method to create awareness. He attached Ars Alb 30 with a detailed dosage along with his wedding invitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/good-response-for-homeo-immunity-booster-at-eroor/articleshow/83493408.cms||---
---||Vadodara||49 crooks took away Rs 1.51 crore from retired cop in Vadodara||AHMEDABAD: A retired deputy superintendent of police in Vadodara would have never thought that he would end up losing Rs 1.51 crore to 49 fraudsters when first of them called up promising to provide Rs 3.50 lakh of his dormant life insurance policy. The fraudsters who posed as insurance agents from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), lawyers who proposed to represent him in Governing Body of Insurance Council (GBIC), officers of Integrated Grievance Management System (IGMS); Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) and from Insurance Ombudsman office, Delhi, cheated him from September 2014 to January 2021. Retired DySP Manoj Vaghela, 74, a resident of Akshardham Society on Harani Varasia Ring Road in Vadodara, finally approached the cybercrime cell of the CID (crime and railways) on June 10 with a 21-page complaint after which an FIR under charges of cheating and abetment under IPC along with charges of information technology act was lodged. Vaghela said in his FIR that he had first got a call from an insurance agent in Delhi named Disha Singhania who enquired about his dormant life insurance policy and offered him a premium of Rs 3.50 lakh. As Vaghela agreed with her, the sequence of cheating began. The insurance agent gave him another number of a man who told Vaghela that he had also invested in another policy of a private company which got closed and lured him with Rs 27 lakh premium. After this, one after another agents called up Vaghela and asked him to pay money under different charges. They told him that he would have to take other policies in the companies according to their instructions to get the money of his old policies. On their instructions, Vaghela ended up paying Rs 61.65 lakh which include policies worth Rs 12 lakh for his family members and Rs 49 lakh as third-party policies between September 2014 and May 2015. However, as nothing concrete happened, they told Vaghela that he would have to pay money to some CBI and RBI officers to clear his file. Again, he followed their instructions and paid Rs 5.50 lakh to different persons who posed as CBI and RBI officers in July 2015. On August 5, 2016, he got a call from a person who introduced himself as a Mumbai-based lawyer and promised to return his money stuck in insurance policies by approaching GBIC. Vaghela agreed to that and kept them giving money whenever and whatever they demanded. This time, he ended up paying Rs 9 lakh to the fake lawyers who even sent various documents to Vaghela showing on how his case was progressing in GBIC. When this was going on, Vaghela got a call from various IRDA and IGMS officers who ensured to provide his money back and the retired cop continued to give them money in hope of getting his entire money. These fake IRDA and IGMS officers took Rs 16.27 lakh from Vaghela. By then, Vaghela realized that he might have been cheated and approached Gujarat insurance ombudsman in July 2016 but this was about to become anther ordeal for him. He said that he was told to contact the ombudsman office in Delhi from where various “fake officers” in garbs of different charges kept taking money from him. Between July 2016 and January 2021, he paid them Rs 68.33 lakh. Finally, one of the officers of the ombudsman switched off his phone and rest of the 48 accused also went incommunicado on January 2021. After this, he approached cops with his complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/49-crooks-took-away-rs-1-51-cr-from-retd-cop/articleshow/83499247.cms||Ashish Chauhan

---||Ahmedabad||Honey trap: PSI nabbed by city crime branch||Ahmedabad: City crime branch on Saturday arrested a suspended sub-inspector who was a close aide of former woman police inspector for allegedly helping a gang in extorting money from at least five traders by threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases. The accused identified as police sub-inspector G K Brahmbhatt worked with the main accused of the case, inspector Geeta Pathan. With Brahmbhatt’s arrest, three cops, including Pathan and a woman head constable Sharda Khant, have been arrested in the case. This case came to the light when the city crime branch had on May 13 arrested Pathan. After her arrest, she tried to commit suicide by consuming sanitizer. According to the cops, it was at the behest of Pathan that the fake complaints were filed at her police station. As crime branch was approached with complaints with similar nature and same complaint content, they inquired into it and found that Pathan and his aides were extorting businessmen by threatening them to book in false rape and molestation cases. Crime branch cops said that Brahmbhatt and Khant along with another accused used to scare the traders that if a complaint of rape and POCSO (protection of children against sexual offences) has been filed against them, they would spend their entire life in jail. Many traders scared with their threats and paid them in lakhs, said crime branch officers. The other gang members had made fake social media profiles through which they contacted the traders, called them in hotel room, and later threatened them to book in rape case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/honey-trap-psi-nabbed-by-city-crime-branch/articleshow/83493450.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Kin FIR against BJP leader||KOLKATA: The Jorabagan police have lodged a FIR against a TMC-turned-BJP leader and her brother, a senior sports official, after a resident of Pathuriaghata Street lodged a complaint against them on Saturday. The complainant has claimed that the two "influential persons" had broken open one iron safe and "committed theft in respect of 30-35 ancient gold coins including “Akbari Mohar”, six gold bangles, three gold chains (Dori Har), number of Basrai pearls, silver utensils and several antiques including one “Khanra” of the complainant’s grandfather from the first floor room of the Pathuriaghata Street residence. The cops have lodged a FIR against the duo booking them under IPC sections 380 (theft in dwelling house) and 461 (dishonestly breaking open receptacle containing property). The case, numbered 78, will be investigated, including the veracity of the claims. The former TMC MLA from Howrah who is with BJP now has completely refuted the claims. She said that she had not stepped into that house despite it belonging to her mother. "It is unfortunate that a person who had actually reported a theft in the house and ensured that two persons got arrested for stealing in her house is being dragged on to such a flimsy and motivated case. The two accused were servants who were arrested by Jorabagan police itself. We have clear court rulings with us. A civil dispute, that too with a person with questionable locus standi, should not have been dragged into the public arena in this manner. I wonder if the complainant has forgotten about the rich history of the heritage property or the help that my family extended to him in the past. While we will take legal recourse, it hurts when - despite possessing all documentary evidence - our names are maligned," she said. Police refused to speak on the issue saying the case was under investigation. DCP (North) Joyeeta Basu did not respond to calls. An officer from Jorabagan police stated that a complaint had been received and a FIR drawn up based on the complaint. "The case has just been lodged and nothing can be said till investigations are over," said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kin-fir-against-bjp-leader/articleshow/83493430.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Nagpur||CBSE class 10 syllabus cut poses new challenges||NAGPUR: An almost 30% reduction in Std X syllabus for 2020-21 means that those entering Std XI will face challenges. The immediate effect of this is being seen at coaching institutes where many students in the fresh batch have to be taught the basics as well. Panini Telang, a competitive exam coach and executive member of Association of Coaching Institutes (ACI), said the learning gap is visible. “While teaching physics, I realized that I cannot proceed with certain topics of Std XI because the immediately preceding base topics had been cut out of Std X syllabus,” said Telang. For Std X, CBSE cut around 30% of syllabus while state board slashed around 25%. Telang said, “What this means is that we will have to spend extra time covering up those topics from Std X. And covering up to 30% of the previous year’s course will obviously take time.” Both NEET and JEE exams are based on NCERT syllabus, something which CBSE is known to follow completely. While Std X theory exams for SSC and CBSE have been cancelled now, last year a decision had been taken to slash syllabus. However, no reduction in curriculum for either NEET or JEE was done. While the online JEE is held multiple times, the single NEET date is yet to be announced. While those students preparing for competitive exams may have some difficulty, state board junior colleges say it won’t be a big problem for them. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers’ Association, said, “The connection between SSC and our board’s Std XI is not so intertwined. In fact, Std XI is the base for XII. But our SSC is not the entire base of Std XI. Regardless, there is no denying the fact that for a few topics there will be some level of difficulty faced by our teachers, but it won’t be as drastic as the problems being faced by coaching classes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/std-x-syllabus-cut-poses-new-challenges/articleshow/83501062.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Districts follow Mission Indradhanush strategy to scale up vaccination drive||JAIPUR: Scaling up Covid vaccination, some districts in the state have started following the strategy which they have followed for vaccinating children under Mission Indradhanush (MI). Under MI, to ensure that the left out and missed out children and pregnant women are vaccinated under the routine immunisation programme, the health department lays special focus on identification of non-vaccinated and partially vaccinated children and pregnant women in high-risk, hard-to-reach areas like hamlets, brick kilns, tribal areas, forest areas, construction sites, migrant settlements, vacant sub-centres and urban slums. Some districts have started following the MI strategy for Covid vaccination. “Our mobile vans reach those areas which have shown vaccine hesitancy. It is just like what like we have been doing under MI to ensure vaccination of children and pregnant women who are left out or partially vaccinated under the national routine vaccination programme,” said Dr Balwant Manda, chief medical health officer (CMHO), Jodhpur. Dr Manda said, “Under MI, we do not go house-to-house, but we station at a place and children come for vaccination. We are following the same strategy here. Our Covid mobile vans go to a slum area or an area where vaccination coverage is low.” In Pali district, too, vaccination teams are visiting slums and remote areas to inoculate people above 45 who have been left out. In Jaipur, the health department will soon launch ‘vaccine on wheels’ for reaching the areas where above 45 population have been left out. “We will soon launch the drive to increase coverage of 45+ population. Also, we are planning to start a drive-through vaccination centre in the city,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, CMHO, Jaipur. Besides, in Bikaner, mobile vans are reaching those areas where the 45+ people have been left out from vaccination drive due to certain reasons. Officials said that they are following the guidelines on Covid vaccination issued by the Centre. The team remains present till half an hour after vaccinating the last beneficiary. “Till date, 78% of Bikaner’s 45+ population has received the first dose of Covid vaccine. Still, 22% are left out, we are targeting them with the first dose, which is why the district collector has launched the initiative,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar Gupta, reproduction and child health officer, Bikaner. Bikaner’s health department team will reach ‘on call’ at houses of the people to vaccinate them. It is a one-of-its kind initiative under which a group of 10 beneficiaries, who are above 45, can call the control room number from 8am to 6pm for slot booking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/districts-follow-mission-indradhanush-strategy-to-scale-up-vaccination/articleshow/83493414.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Ahmedabad||AAP to contest all 182 seats in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Promising a positive change in the state, Arvind Kejrwal set the stage for a tri-cornered electoral contest in Gujarat’s assembly polls by announcing on Monday that his party would contest “each and every” one of the 182 assembly seats in the state in 2022. Claiming that the past 27 years of BJP governance in Gujarat was a story of a “tacit BJP-Congress alliance”, Kejriwal said the common Gujarati now has an alternative in AAP. Addressing a press conference on the campus of the Vallabh Sadan temple after offering prayers to the deity, Kejriwal, who was on a one-day visit to the city, said, “AAP is a credible alternative to BJP and Congress. Gujarat will change soon.” “Gujarat is suffering because of this alliance between BJP and Congress. BJP led this state for the past 27 years. I heard people saying that Congress is in the pocket of BJP. Both BJP and Congress are the same. This must stop," he said. During the press conference, Isudan Gadhvi, a former vernacular TV news journalist, joined AAP. Kejriwal spoke about farmers committing suicide in the state, the condition of government-run schools and hospitals, and alleged that traders lived in fear. “People want to know why electricity costs are so high in Gujarat when it’s free in Delhi? If government-run schools and hospitals are top-class in Delhi, why are they in bad shape here?,” he said. When asked if AAP intended to replicate the “Delhi model” in Gujarat, Kejriwal said the model of development in Gujarat would be decided by the six crore people of Gujarat. Quizzed about AAP taking on BJP on PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah’s home turf, he said, “AAP will fight for the people of Gujarat and bring a change instead of fighting against any party or an individual." Kejriwal also inaugurated AAP’s new state party headquarters before presiding over the party’s state executive committee meeting. AAP made inroads into Gujarat politics recently by winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), where it is the main opposition. It also picked up seats in other local bodies — municipalities, and district and taluka panchayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aap-to-contest-all-182-seats-in-guj/articleshow/83529539.cms||---

---||Delhi||AAP to contest all 182 seats in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Promising a positive change in the state, Arvind Kejrwal set the stage for a tri-cornered electoral contest in Gujarat’s assembly polls by announcing on Monday that his party would contest “each and every” one of the 182 assembly seats in the state in 2022. Claiming that the past 27 years of BJP governance in Gujarat was a story of a “tacit BJP-Congress alliance”, Kejriwal said the common Gujarati now has an alternative in AAP. Addressing a press conference on the campus of the Vallabh Sadan temple after offering prayers to the deity, Kejriwal, who was on a one-day visit to the city, said, “AAP is a credible alternative to BJP and Congress. Gujarat will change soon.” “Gujarat is suffering because of this alliance between BJP and Congress. BJP led this state for the past 27 years. I heard people saying that Congress is in the pocket of BJP. Both BJP and Congress are the same. This must stop," he said. During the press conference, Isudan Gadhvi, a former vernacular TV news journalist, joined AAP. Kejriwal spoke about farmers committing suicide in the state, the condition of government-run schools and hospitals, and alleged that traders lived in fear. “People want to know why electricity costs are so high in Gujarat when it’s free in Delhi? If government-run schools and hospitals are top-class in Delhi, why are they in bad shape here?,” he said. When asked if AAP intended to replicate the “Delhi model” in Gujarat, Kejriwal said the model of development in Gujarat would be decided by the six crore people of Gujarat. Quizzed about AAP taking on BJP on PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah’s home turf, he said, “AAP will fight for the people of Gujarat and bring a change instead of fighting against any party or an individual." Kejriwal also inaugurated AAP’s new state party headquarters before presiding over the party’s state executive committee meeting. AAP made inroads into Gujarat politics recently by winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), where it is the main opposition. It also picked up seats in other local bodies — municipalities, and district and taluka panchayats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-to-contest-all-182-seats-in-guj/articleshow/83523240.cms||---

The order issued by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said municipal corporations, the civic supplies department and the local administration had been asked to ensure compliance and carry out surprise checks around the city. In the order issued on Monday, DPCC said the measures were taken based on suggestions given by NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC), informing them of the possible adverse effect an indiscriminate use of soaps and detergents not meeting the standards could have on the river. “There is probability of use of non-permissible chemical substances in the manufacture of soaps and detergents, which are not conforming to BIS standards and may harm aquatic life, water quality and animal’s dependence on the river water,” said the order. It added that, YMC in a report dated January 2021, had recommended NGT to direct Delhi government to prohibit the sale, storage, transportation and marketing of detergents not meeting the standards, while also launching awareness campaigns around the possible use of substandard detergents and soaps. DPCC said the suggestions of the report were accepted by the tribunal, asking the chief secretary to oversee its implementation. “Monthly action taken reports of inspections and action taken shall be submitted by the authorised officers to DPCC without fail,” the order added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/detergents-that-dont-meet-bis-norms-banned-to-save-yamuna/articleshow/83523268.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: Special investigation team speeds up probe into illegal mining, report soon||PANAJI: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing illegal mining in the state has intensified its tasks and started preparing reports of 126 mining violations before the final decision is arrived at. A senior police officer said the report is being prepared based on the scrutiny of documents submitted by the mines department on environment clearances, dump handling and fresh extraction. “We will complete the report as soon as possible,” he said. During the last assembly session, the opposition had cornered the government for not being able to recover the money from mining companies in illegal mining case. The officer said that based on the reports, the police will take necessary action. The SIT has filed 16 first information reports (FIRs) in the illegal mining cases, out of which eight have been charge-sheeted, three have been closed while three have been transferred to the respective police stations. The officer said that three cases have been quashed by the court. Presently, four police officers are investigating the illegal mining cases, even as the main mining case is pending for investigation. The SIT has been probing these cases for the past six years, but there hasn’t been much progress. As part of its investigation into the Rs 35,000-crore scam, the senior officer said that the investigating team had sought answers from the mines department to 19 questions pertaining to the leases, which were operational from 2007 to 2012. The documents provided to the SIT include environmental clearances (EC) issued to the leases, quantity-related papers and EC limits. On July 26, 2013, the mines department had filed a criminal complaint with the crime branch, seeking that criminal liability be fixed against those involved. It had also requested the police to file an FIR against persons identified in the reports of the Supreme Court-appointed Central Empowered Committee, the Shah Commission and the Public Accounts Committee. In April, director general of police (DGP) Mukesh Kumar Meena had directed the SIT to “speed up and complete the investigation”. Meena issued the direction during a meeting with crime branch superintendent of police (SP) Shobhit Saxena and those police inspectors who are investigating the cases related to illegal mining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sit-speeds-up-probe-into-illegal-mining-report-soon/articleshow/83495920.cms||---
---||Kolkata||ATM gang's Punjab connection: Ninth accused nabbed from Jalandhar||KOLKATA: The investigation by the Detective Department into Rs 2 crore worth sophisticated Man in The Middle (MiTM) ATM hacking Fraud - where eight ATMs of the city were targeted by fraudsters -has now led cops to Punjab after Delhi and Gujarat. Cops said they believe that one Nitin Somani - arrested from Jalandhar by Punjab police - is involved in the racket. The cops claimed one person who goes by the name of Frank - an associate of Somani - is also part of the gang. Somani, just like the two siblings, also the masterminds- Manoj Kumar and Naveen Gupta - hails from Delhi. While the Guptas are from Fatehpur Beri in south Delhi, Somani is from Krishna Nagar in east Delhi. The detective department plans to bring Somani on transit remand and question him to ascertain the claims made by the eight other arrested men in this case. Somani told interrogators that the entire system runs from Delhi. "Three people usually came to the targeted ATM. The device is placed inside the machine for which they were provided specialized keys to unlock the top of the machine. Once the machine was set up for hacking, usually a phone came from Delhi telling him that he can withdraw the money. Then, a fourth person came in a car and handed him over the ATM card. After withdrawing the money, he used to hand over the card and money to the car owner. The car owner would have given him 10% of the total amount withdrawn and leave," claimed an investigator. Cops want to know if these calls were made by the Gupta brothers across Kolkata, UP, Delhi, Punjab and Karnataka or if someone else is involved. While main accused Naveen was first to arrive in Kolkata in January to carry initial recce, it was only end March that the ATM gang made Kolkata their base. For three months, they carried out recce of the ATMs in Kolkata and fixed up the ATMs they want to target. "Md Vakil played a crucial part in this gang and spoke with Manoj at the rented flats. Naveen worked from various hotels in the Tiljala-Topsia areas. The Guptas and Vakil were the ones who had technical knowledge about hacking. The other five persons of the gang either provided them technical help or helped with the local logistics," said an officer. The police said the Guptas had moved in and out of the city, always booking his rooms through an app where he used to pay by hours and where KYC documentation was not strong. The accused had travelled from Kolkata to Haryana, UP and Delhi - and what cops suspect even Bengaluru - where they hacked pre-identified ATMs and then returned back to Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/atm-gangs-punjab-connection-ninth-accused-nabbed-from-jalandhar/articleshow/83493454.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||Use posaconazole injection if key mucor drug is unavailable: Experts||Pune: The Joint National Task Force for Covid-19 has said that posaconazole injections can be used to treat mucormycosis if amphotericin B is unavailable or cannot be used in patients with severe intolerance to the drug.There has been a nationwide shortage of amphotericin B for over two months now. Experts said the latest advisory from the task force — on posaconazole use — is primarily a stopgap until supply improves. The drug inhibits the synthesis of 'ergosterol', which is an important component of the fungal cell wall, to prevent fungal growth."It (injectable posaconazole) is usually recommended as an alternative when both the liposomal or conventional amphotericin B formulations are unavailable. It can also be used if a patient cannot tolerate amphotericin B and develops toxicity," infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the task force, said.As many as 28,252 mucormycosis cases have been reported from 28 states and UTs. Most have come from Maharashtra (6,339 cases) and Gujarat (5,486), the health ministry had said last week. Posaconazole in India is available as both an oral tablet and intravenous (IV) injection."The maximum posaconazole concentration in the blood with IV formulation is seven-fold higher compared to that achieved by a single tablet of oral posaconazole. So effective blood levels are reached rapidly by the IV route. This is important during primary treatment of mucormycosis to achieve rapid anti-fungal effect," Pujari said.A steady state of blood posaconazole levels is reached after three to four days with the oral tablets."Information on adequate blood levels achieved by crushing the tablets is still evolving. So the IV formulation is better in this context," Pujari said.The injectable form of posaconazole is recommended only as initial therapy if availability of amphotericin B is a problem. "Oral tablets of posaconazole are preferred as step-down treatment and continued for three to six months to prevent a recurrence," Pujari said.Posaconazole is available from international and Indian manufacturers. It's availability early on was limited, but the situation has been improving. Experts involved in the drug's distribution said scaled up manufacturing will increase stock. "Posaconzale generally benefits patients who do not have aggressive disease," said Ruby Hall Clinic's ENT surgeon Sandeep Karmarkar.Samir Joshi, ENT surgeon with Sassoon Hospital, said, "Amphotericin B is the key anti-mucormycosis drug. Posaconazole is certainly effective. Its inclusion in the advisory looks more like a stop-gap arrangement to foster confidence and address shortages."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/use-posaconazole-injection-if-key-mucor-drug-is-unavailable-experts/articleshow/83493487.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The complainant stated in her FIR that she has been living with three other women including the accused named Priyanka Goyal in a PG for six months. In February, Goyal called three of her male friends Shubham Sherawat, Mayank Sherawat and Nitish Sherawat at their PG home and they had a booze party. She objected to it, but Goyal told her that her friends would soon be leaving after the party, so she should bear with it. But later on, Goyal and her friends began holding frequent booze parties at the PG and also played loud music and disturbed others by making noise and uttering verbal abuses. “Goyal called the three men to the PG and they began staying there since June 4. When I objected to their stay, Goyal said that they would return to their home in some days and told me to adjust,” said the complainant. She said in the FIR that she went to her work on June 5 where her duty was scheduled in a Jaipur-bound flight and returned home on June 8. “When I returned home, I found Goyal and the others having liquor and playing loud music. I again told them not to drink and stop playing loud music. This time, my room-mate fought with me and threatened that she would throw my baggage and other articles outside,” she alleged in the FIR. At that time, other room-mates intervened and sorted out the dispute. But on the next day, Goyal and the three men again began drinking since morning and picked a fight with complainant. “On June 9 afternoon, when I was sleeping in my house, Goyal’s friend Mayank Sherawat slipped onto the bed besides me and began molesting me. When I resisted, he forced himself upon me and demanded sexual favours,” she said. The complainant pushed him aside, ran out of the room and told Goyal about this. But Goyal took the side of the accused and she along with the other men began threatening her. Then the complainant called up police control room, but before the cops could arrive, the accused fled from there. The complainant talked about this to her parents, who told her to file a police complaint. She finally approached Chandkheda police and filed a complaint of molestation, uttering of abusive words, criminal intimidation and abetment against the Sherawats and Goyal.

Deciding a case of criminal writ petition, the court quashed orders of magistrate and also sessions court, and discharged Giridharilal, a businessman, from the case. An offence was lodged against Giridharilal, Vijay Naidu and others for allegedly grabbing land owned by Sushil, who is the complainant as per police documents, by manipulating revenue records, maps and ownership details with the government. Giridharilal was accused of criminal conspiracy for conniving with others to dispossess Sushil, who was already having legal disputes with the petitioner. The court observed that ‘there is no material on record to warrant a trial against the petitioner-accused’. In the order, the court also said that ‘the complaint incorporates only a bald allegation which at best is in the realm of suspicion. Nothing is disclosed in the complaint as would throw light on the basis of the suspicion that the petitioner entered into a conspiracy with the co-accused to cause wrongful loss to the complainant’. The court, while discharging the petitioner, also underlined the fact that prosecution or trial is a serious matter and a person cannot be forced to undergo the trauma of trial merely on the basis of fanciful suspicion which is not based on any credible material. Quashing the charges, the court also mentioned that ‘there is no material on record, even to arouse a strong suspicion, and therefore, the continuation of the proceedings shall be an abuse of the process of the criminal law’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/13-years-later-hc-discharges-businessman-from-conspiracy-charges/articleshow/83493477.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kochi||Kerala: Now, Cochin Smart Mission Ltd to construct a new drain||KOCHI: The Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML), which extended a drain into the historic Parade Ground, is now planning to construct another drain to flush out water from the ground. The agency decided to construct another drain after protests by residents, activists and the local councillor. The CSML had constructed a drain along the road beside the Parade Ground. Following the public registered protest against felling a 200 year-old-tree in the in the course of proposed drain, the authorities stopped the work on the drain abruptly in front of the tree. Then, they decided to connect the new drain to another one existing in the middle of the ground so as to ensure smooth passage of the rainwater. “Then, the residents raised objection citing that it will lead to waterlogging on the Parade Ground. The work on the drains in the area is being carried out without considering the fact that the entire area is a heritage zone. There are allegations that the contractor is doing the work without getting necessary approvals,” said K J Sohan, former mayor. Following protests by the residents against constructing a drain through the middle of the ground, the CSML authorities convened a meeting to discuss a way out. “They suggested that a new drain through the road on other side of the ground can be constructed so as to help the water run off into the sea. Then, there will be drains all around the Parade Ground and through the middle of the ground. We don’t know whether there is the requirement for even a single drain in the area where there are no buildings, residences or shops,” said Antony Kureethra, councillor from Fort Kochi, who is also the opposition leader in Kochi corporation. According to the CSML authorities, the waterlogging issues can be addressed once the work on all the drains in the area is completed.  The entire work will be completed within a week, a CSML official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/now-csml-to-construct-a-new-drain/articleshow/83493482.cms||---

In the next two decades, the CPC is poised to grow into an international financial hub like Dubai and Singapore.

While police refused to divulge any details, a source said they have named at least nine people in the chargesheet. Forensically verified mobile videos shot by the family members and witnesses have been listed as crucial evidence in the case. Those named in the chargesheet include Deen Mohammad alias Sakruddin, Dilshan alias Aftab, Fayaz alias Sadri, Faizan alias Nirale, Tajuddin, Danish, Zahid, Islam and Nasiruddin, the source added. The investigation was transferred to Crime Branch on February 13. Forensic experts had re-examined the scene of crime and recorded the statement of all witnesses and the family afresh. The accused were also reinterrogated. Crime Branch found that Sharma had not opened any restaurant as alleged by the accused in the beginning. The accused had opened a dhaba in Rohini last year. A brother of Sharma’s friend had also opened a dhaba, which led to a brawl between the victim and accused at the time. The bitterness led to frequent tiffs. The probe has revealed that another brawl broke between them during Dussehra last year regarding a religious programme at Ram temple park in the locality. The family had alleged that the accused often taunted Sharma after that. According to police, 25-year-old Sharma was not only assaulted outside his house, but the goons had even barged into his house on the day of incident. Sharma lived with his family in K block of the area and worked at a hospital in Paschim Vihar. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rinku-sharma-case-cops-file-chargesheet/articleshow/83523284.cms||---

A South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official said that they are talking to the 1,400 common service centres to help in the process of collection and organising camps. “We have already organised two to three camps this weekend and the process will intensify in the coming days as we plan to make collect maximum advance for the financial year 2021-22 by June 30. All RWAs and market associations can approach us for organising such camps and we will arrange for the staff, provided there is a facility for Wi-Fi and campus to maintain social distance,” said the official. The residents who visited one of these camps, however, complained about limited staff and poor arrangements. “Some people from our area visited the camp organised in Greater Kailash-I on Saturday. Most of them failed to submit the tax as the computers/laptops were hanging constantly, the staff was not supportive and there was no sufficient arrangement for waiting. For the convenience of residents, we taught them to submit tax online, but there was no mention of a 2% discount when tax is submitted online,” said MK Gupta, president of S block RWA, GK-I. On this issue, the official said that the computers might be hanging due to poor connectivity or Wi-Fi issues. “Generally, the RWAs/organisers are supposed to make these arrangements and we can’t do much. But to resolve this, we plan to hire 50-60 laptops on rent with a dongle so that the operation doesn’t get affected much,” said the official. “For the 2% rebate given for submitting tax online, the facility can be availed only when the taxable amount is less than Rs 10,000,” the official added. Civic bodies are giving a 3% per cent rebate for Covid-vaccinated people, and 15% rebate for depositing property tax before June 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bodies-plan-to-collect-property-tax-at-your-doorstep/articleshow/83493523.cms||Vibha Sharma

The Rs 85 crore project is to set up a 24x7 water supply system in TP schemes 1, 2 and 3. The project will include household connections, consumer water meter fittings, civil, mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, setting up of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system and implementation of water supply management system in the project area for five years. As per the plan, a number of overhead tanks will be constructed in various parts of Ghuma area. This includes three 32 lakh litres, two 22 lakh litres and one 27 lakh litres overhead tanks, together costing Rs 12.41 crore. Setting up of Rs 35 crore water distribution network and another Rs 2.15 crore in providing household connections. “The water distribution network will require additional support infrastructure of nearly Rs 7 crore. We have modelled the 24x7 water supply on the experience of Ahmedabad. The major challenge is implementing the SCADA monitoring system. The metered water supply will mean that consumers will have to pay for the metered supply. A preliminary household survey will be conducted for the Ghuma area to assess their per day usage along with ground water consumption,” says a senior AUDA official. The round-the-clock water supply is planned collectively for Bopal, Ghuma, Godhavi and Shela. In the last three months the project work had suffered a lag owing to the Covid pandemic. “There was severe shortage of manpower, which has pushed back the completion of all major under-construction projects by about six to eight months,” says the AUDA official. The project was supposed to get 24x7 Narmada water supply by mid-2021. The officials added that contractors had demanded increase in payment as there has been a rise in the cost of steel and cement. Since the project is being jointly handled by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and AUDA, the officials are evaluating each and every aspect of the project after which they will consider if they need to increase the price or extend the deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bopal-ghuma-closer-to-24x7-water-supply/articleshow/83493503.cms||---

Also called AY.1 the Delta+ (Delta plus) mutant has acquired K417N mutation. Scientists fear that the monoclonal antibodies cocktail currently prescribed for Covid-19 patients may not work against the Delta+ mutant. According to Public Health England (PHE), a UK government public health body, 63 genomes of Delta with K417N mutation have been identified on GISAID. In its latest report on Covid-19 variants updated on June 11, India has reported six cases of AY.1 or Delta+ as of June 7. Dr Vinod Scaria, clinician and computational biologist, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, while referring to the Delta+ variant said: “One important point to consider regarding K417N is evidence suggesting resistance to monoclonal antibodies Casirivimab and Imdevimab. The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) cocktail incidentally has received an emergency use authorisation (EUA) from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in India.” Dr Vinod tweeted on Sunday that one of the emerging variants is B.1.617.2.1 also known as AY.1 characterized by the acquisition of K417N mutation. The mutation maps to the receptor binding domain and has also been associated with immune escape. “The variant frequency for K417N is not much in India at this point in time. As Delta continues to evolve acquiring new mutations, there is a lot of interest in understanding these mutations,” Dr Vinod tweeted, naming the new mutant as Delta+. Earlier, a report by PHE said the Delta-AY.1 (Delta with K417N) was found through routine scanning of variation in Delta. A small number of sequences were detected which had acquired the spike protein mutation K417N. Scientists attribute the earliest sequence from Europe in late March 2021. Dr Vinod said 127 sequences from Europe, Asia and America are now available in public domain. “Understanding this continued evolution is of great importance in mapping the evolutionary landscape of emerging variants. Largely, the virus has tried to optimise for transmission and immune escape by step-wise acquisition of new mutations," he added. He said several genomes are now available for the lineage AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1 from across the world. The sequences are mostly from Europe, Asia and America. The travel histories are not readily available to make assumptions. "The novel coronavirus has a nearly constant rate of acquiring genetic variants. Each emerging variant has acquired additional variants in a stepwise fashion. Acquisition largely follows a trend of transmissibility and/or immune escape. The K417N mutation is also found in Beta or B.1.351, which is also regarded as the variant of concern. Delta+ cases were also reported from other countries. They include one case each from Canada, Germany and Russia, two from Nepal, four from Switzerland, nine from Poland, 12 from Portugal, 13 from Japan and 14 from the USA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delta-variant-mutates-drug-cocktail-may-not-work-study/articleshow/83495883.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Kochi||Kerala: Ernakulam cops lend a helping hand to students||KOCHI: Even as lockdown continues in the district, policemen belong to the category of individuals who could not catch a break, especially due to the additional responsibility of enforcing lockdown over the past few weeks. Even while strictly enforcing lockdown, Ernakulam rural police assisted several students who reached out to them when they had no option to access digital education over the past one year. Officers with the rural police said that police had arranged 11 televisions sets and 10 smartphones for students during the previous academic year and supported 10 financially-backward students by giving them books and other school supplies. Over the past month, police said more students have been approaching them with similar requests and police have managed to give nine smartphones and one television set to students in need of support. An officer said that it was an undergraduate student who recently approached Ernakulam Rural SP directly after it became quite difficult for him to deal with his studies without a smartphone. “The degree student had no option to attend classes and he wrote to the email address of the district police chief SP K Karthick about his plight. The SP directed the concerned station house officer to visit his house and check the situation of the family. The officer reported back to the headquarters about the plight of the family and the next day a phone was arranged by the police and it was given to the student,” said an officer. “In another case, the family of a school student was barely able to pay their house rent. It was really difficult for them to afford a smartphone during the pandemic. Police came to know about their situation and a phone was delivered to him,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-lend-a-helping-hand-to-students/articleshow/83493508.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP: Scam in purchase of land for Ram Mandir||New Delhi: Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday alleged a “scam” by the Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust in the purchase of a piece of land for the proposed temple in Ayodhya. Sisodia claimed that the land was bought at an inflated rate using funds collected from thousands of people, including the poor. “The trust bought 12,080 square meters of land for Rs 18.5 crore on March 18. The same piece of land was sold for just Rs 2 crore five minutes earlier. There has been a scam in the purchase of this land. The trust must clarify why it was bought at such an inflated price,” Sisodia said at press conference where senior party functionary Sanjay Singh was also present. Sisodia said devotees who had donated their hard-earned money had become victims of the “fraud” carried out by BJP. “The devotees hadn’t thought that a piece of land worth Rs 2 crore would be bought for Rs 18.5 crore,” he said. Sisodia said the trust bought the land from Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari at 7.15pm in the presence of Anil Mishra and Rishikesh Upadhyaya, who is a BJP functionary and the mayor of Ayodhya. “They are members of this trust. The same land was sold to Tiwari and Sultan at 7.10pm by Harish and Kusum Pathak for Rs 2 crore. Anil Mishra and BJP’s Upadhyay were witness to this,” he alleged. “Extra land being bought for the construction of the temple was a matter of pride for most people, but this has now turned into disappointment and shame, considering that BJP functionaries have used the money allocated for Ram Temple for their own means,” he added. Sanjay Singh said when AAP flagged the issue, BJP functionaries jumped to the defence of those involved in the “scam”. “BJP came to the defence of all those who carried out this scam in the name of Shri Ram. It is crystal clear that the mayor of Ayodhya has a big role to play in it and BJP functionaries should reveal how much they have earned through this scam. The trust should give a full account of the money received through donations,” Singh demanded. “When the documents relating to Ram Temple were shown initially, it was obvious that they were fake... Can the price increase from Rs 2 crore to Rs 18.5 crore in five minutes?” Sisodia asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-scam-in-purchase-of-land-for-ram-mandir/articleshow/83523333.cms||AlokKNMishra

While implementation of some of the changes has already begun, others such as allowing investors to park their entire corpus into systematic withdrawal plans (SWPs) will require amendments to the law. Currently, NPS subscribers can withdraw up to 60% of the corpus at the time of their retirement and the remaining has to be used to purchase annuities that will fetch them income for the rest of their lives. With annuities offering 5-6% return in a falling interest rate regime, many investors do not see it as an attractive proposition, prompting Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority (PFRDA) to seek inflation-indexed annuities from the insurance regulator IRDAI. The matter is currently being examined by a committee. In the meanwhile, for those with a corpus of up to Rs 5 lakh, rules will be eased to allow to complete withdrawal of their money. “The notification will be issued in the next few days. An investment of Rs 2 lakh will not get you much via annuities,” Bandyopadhyay said. Separately, PFRDA has suggested to the government that the annual tax benefit of Rs 50,000 for NPS investment should be doubled. “We are suggesting that the pension coming from annuity should be made tax-free up to a certain level, say, Rs 10 lakh a year. It should be either tax-free or lower tax may be charged... Today, a monthly income of Rs 60,000-70,000 may look decent but 10-15 years down the line, it may not even meet your basic needs. So, indexation and taxation can play a role,” he told TOI. The changes come at a time when several individuals are looking to park a part of their provident fund contribution in other long-term saving instruments after the government changed the tax rules to make the interest on employee contribution over Rs 2.5 lakh taxable. While NPS was introduced for the private sector nearly 12 years ago, its assets under management (AUM) are under Rs 1 lakh crore, compared to a Rs 7.5-lakh crore corpus with insurance companies. Bandyopadhyay said PFRDA is also looking to register individuals as points of presence (PoPs) or to be part of the distribution network and is willing to pay a higher commission to expand the base. Currently, banks and institutional entities act as PoPs and are paid Rs 200 to get a new customer and 0.2% of the investment as commission. “The effort has been to keep the overall cost structure low. It has helped subscribers, but a time has come to encourage the distribution channel to improve the coverage and expand the corpus. Today, the threat of dying early is slowly going away and it is taken over by the risk of living long… We will try to see what best we can give to our distribution partners but I am not sure if we can manage the kind of returns that the insurance industry gives,” the pension regulator said. Already, fund management fees for fund managers have been increased and PFRDA is looking to expand the number from seven to 10 with the process expected to start at the end of the month. Besides, going forward, licences will be available on tap. Bandyopadhyay said the regulator is targeting a million new subscribers from the private sector this year, in addition to nine million under Atal Pension Yojana. “For the first time last year, the number of new customers joining from the non-government sector, which was six lakh, was more than the government sector. This is the trend that we will see in the years to come. Slowly, the non-government sector will not just catch up but the AUM will be higher.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/regulator-in-talks-with-govt-for-nps-overhaul/articleshow/83498505.cms||Sidhartha

The scheme was launched on World Environment Day on June 5. “Till date, over 400 consumers, mainly business houses/corporates, have approached us to get green power,” a senior official said. Tata Power has received response from over 37 consumers after the MERC allowed all power utility firms to distribute ‘green power’ to consumers for an additional tariff of 66 paise per unit over normal rates. The scheme is also open for residential consumers. Adani recently proposed to MERC for procurement of 1,000 MW power from renewable sources for Mumbai. It plans to source 30% of its power from renewable sources by 2023. “While residential consumers may not opt for this scheme as they will have to pay extra, we expect good response from hotels, commercial establishments and industries,” said the official. “To apply for scheme, call on toll-free number 19122 or write to helpdesk.mumbaielectricity@adani.com or visit the website http://adanielectricity.com.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-400-adani-users-opt-for-green-power-tariff-scheme/articleshow/83495060.cms||Somit Sen

---||Hyderabad||KCR to adopt a district to show ‘real development’||Hyderabad: Making it clear how serious he was about development of villages and towns, CM K Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday said that he will adopt a district in the state and show how development can be achieved. “Work hard for six months and see how villages and urban areas can be developed. If you do your work with dedication, results will come for sure. I will also adopt a district. Additional collectors and I will work together. We will show how development can be achieved,” the CM told additional district collectors and officials at a marathon review meeting on Palle and Pattana Pragathi programme implementation in the state. The CM would take up surprise visits to some of the villages and towns in Siddipet and Kamareddy on June 20 and Warangal on June 21 to inspect Palle and Pattana Pragathi works. He would inaugurate the new Warangal district collectorate complex. “We have no other important work other than rural and urban development. Tour the villages, stay there overnight and mingle with people the next day so that you understand their problems and find meaningful solutions,” he said. The state government gave away new four-wheelers to all additional collectors to visit villages and towns to ensure effective implementation of Palle and Pattana Pragathi programmes. “The government is releasing funds every month for Palle and Pattana Pragathi. We have filled up all vacancies in the panchayat raj department. You have required staff and funds. What else do you want? Can any other government do anything more than this? Hence, you should not show any laxity and become victims of punishment. The working of collectors will be assessed by their personal appraisal reports,” the chief minister said. “If any of the additional collectors and departmental officers (DPOs) are found negligent in implementing Palle and Pattana Pragathi works during my surprise checks, I will not pardon and take stringent action,” the CM said. The chief minister instructed the officials concerned to suspend sarpanches and secretaries if they failed to conduct gram sabhas. “If the sarpanches committing mistakes are from the ruling party, take action against them first,” the chief minister told the officers. He asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to depute a team of additional collectors and DPOs to tour Kerala to study rural development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-to-adopt-a-district-to-show-real-development/articleshow/83494639.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Delhi||Civil defence staffer arrested for posing as cop at Old Delhi railway station||NEW DELHI: A civil defence employee, who posed as an assistant sub-inspector and kept an eye on passengers at Old Delhi railway station, was arrested on Sunday. The accused, Jai Kishan Yadav, a 22-year-old resident of Mayapuri, was enrolled in Delhi civil defence in 2019, and was later promoted to the rank of deputy post warden. According to police, Yadav was spotted by a constable, Yogesh Kumar, posted in 7th battalion Delhi armed police, who had come to the railway station to drop his friends on Sunday. DCP (Railways) Harendra Kumar Singh said, when Kumar spotted Yadav on a platform, he saw him wearing Delhi Police uniform of the rank of an ASI. “There is no direct recruitment in the rank of ASI, and only constables and head constables get promoted to the level, that too, after 15-20 years of service. Here the suspect, who seemed to be in his early twenties, was spotted in ASI uniform, which got Kumar suspicious. He then started questioning Yadav about his rank and journey to ASI so early in his age. The accused tried to evade the queries by stating that he was directly recruited in 2019 by Delhi Police. It further confirmed that he was impersonating. When Kumar asked him to show his ID card, Yadav didn't,” Singh said. The DCP added that, while keeping a sharp eye on the accused, Kumar called his senior officers. “Yadav was arrested. During interrogation, he said that earlier he was a civil defence marshal in DTC buses and was later promoted to the rank of deputy post warden. He got the Delhi Police uniform stitched around one-and-half-years ago. It is being ascertained if he had indulged in any criminal offence previously using the uniform," the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civil-defence-staffer-arrested-for-posing-as-cop-at-railway-station/articleshow/83523356.cms||---

The suspects who were running the sex racket, used to take the customers in Wakad to another massage parlour in Baner. “We raided both the spots after getting confirmation from a decoy customer,” Mugalikar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pimpri-chinchwad-police-bust-2-sex-rackets/articleshow/83493541.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: The last among unequals envy the ‘better-off’ poor||NEW DELHI: The economically disadvantaged are not equally poor in Delhi’s districts. Those in East and North-East districts have had to sometimes resort to begging to stave off starvation in the lockdown, while in New Delhi, Central and South districts haven’t had to worry too much about their meals since they work for relatively affluent employers. This divide was quite evident among those who had lined up at distribution centres to get the free wheat and rice that Delhi government had arranged for them. An exasperated Aqib, a resident of Dilshad Garden, was tired of queuing up for rations but not getting anything despite the wait. He wished he had the address of some “big politicians” so he could go there and protest about the non-availability of the food grains on certain days. Besides having no food for his family, Aqib had another bigger fear. “As a manual scavenger, I have had scary and life-threatening assignments,” he said. “But it is more frightening here — to see the people lined up so close to each other. If poor people like me have to stand like this, corona infection cases will rise.” Sandhya Devi, 33, a housewife who is seeking a job because her husband does not now make enough money to feed the entire family of five, also grumbled about not only not getting the promised 4kg of wheat and a kilo of rice, but also having to spend money to buy other kitchen essentials. “Does the government feel that by giving us wheat and rice, that’s enough? Can these be eaten uncooked,” she asked. “It is high time the government also realised what is being given to us is not adequate. The free ration was promised to us for May and June, but the ration centres were closed through May and now when finally open, we aren’t getting our share.” At the distribution centre in New Delhi’s Gole Market, Sonam, 35, wasn't quite so disenchanted. “My husband Ramnivas is an electrician while I am a housewife,” she said. “Though Ramnivas has got no work during the lockdown, we have managed to sustain ourselves with our savings. My father-in-law's employer has given us a house to stay in and so we are not worried about having to pay rent.” Mamta, 32, too didn’t appear too disturbed. Despite being poor, she calls herself “privileged” to be working in the house of a wealthy family, which has been helping her during the pandemic. Even if she is unable to get the promised ration, she said she and her family wouldn’t die of hunger. Mamta, who had come to the distribution centre with her 12-year-old son, said, “My husband works in the housekeeping department of an agency on contract basis. Due to the lockdown, he had work only on alternate days. While we had to cut down on milk and some other expenses, we did not have problems about our daily meals.” Saroj, however, was almost tearing her hair out at not getting the rations. She has lined up for three days to no avail. For the umpteenth time, she approached one of the teachers on ration distribution duty and enquired about her turn but was asked to go and wait. “This is the same answer that I have been getting for so many days,” said the 22-year-old. “They always tell me they have run out of stocks. My husband goes to work and I have had to lock up my two children in our room to come here. So, it’s quite frustrating after all this to return home without wheat and rice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/the-last-among-unequals-envy-the-better-off-poor/articleshow/83492285.cms||Pankhuri Yadav

In the city, the petrol price per litre stands at Rs 99.9 while five districts reported prices over Rs 101 mark. Petrol prices crossed Rs 100 mark for the first time in Adilabad district and reached Rs 101 mark along with Komarambheem Asifabad, Jogulamba Gadwal, Nirmal and Wanaparthy. The highest price was observed in Jogulamba Gadwal at Rs 101.95. “All these districts have crossed the century mark in terms of fuel prices due to the distance from the oil depots and additional travel costs,” a government official said. The cost of petrol in Hyderabad per litre has increased since the beginning of this month. The prices touched Rs 98 on June 1 and there was a further increase of Rs 2 in just 12 days, making it just 10 paisa away from touching Rs 100 mark. The prices are hovering between Rs 99-100 in Jangaon, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Karimnagar, Medak, Nalgonda, Siddipet, Suryapet, Warangal rural, Warangal urban districts. The lowest price of petrol was seen at Suryapet (Rs 99.42). Sources in the industry say that the exact impact of the price on the sales of petrol would not be known immediately as the unlock procedure is still going on and several sectors have to still restart work. “But there was a dip in sales to around 20%, but it varies from pump to pump. The customers are not being given the subsidy benefit like in gas cylinders, which used to be the case earlier,” Marri Amarender Reddy, Petrol Pumps Owners Association of Telangana said. Looking at how prices have been increasing, it is estimated that prices in a few districts will reach around Rs 105 by the end of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/petrol-races-past-rs-100/l-in-22-dists-hyd-just-10-paisa-away/articleshow/83495894.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

While the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) will engage an agency to provide mosquito control measures in New Town for a one-year contract, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) is taking up dengue prevention measures in Salt Lake like conducting door-to-door surveys and cleaning the canals. BMC officials said that this year not more than 30 to 35 dengue cases have occurred in overall Bidhannagar area including Salt Lake and Rajarhat since January so far but they are not taking things lightly as it is from June to November that most dengue cases occur. According to civic officials, around 200 persons had been affected by dengue in entire BMC area last year with no death reported, which was quite low compared to 2019 when over 2,000 persons were affected. Over 20 persons have died in BMC jurisdiction area from 2016 to 2019. BMC officials said door-to-door survey has been started this month to find out if anybody is suffering from fever or any other dengue or Covid-related symptoms. “We are planning to release guppy fish in the canals like which we do every year and boating will be conducted to clean up the canals to prevent any stagnant accumulation of water. Larvicide will be sprayed on the corners of the canals,” said BMC board of administrators member Pranay Roy. Civic authorities said that they have been short of manpower to conduct vector-borne disease prevention drive equally across all 41 wards of BMC due to the ongoing Covid pandemic but they would continue with such measures. In New Town, NKDA is to engage an agency to prevent vector-borne diseases through spraying of larvicide and fogging for a one-year contract with NKDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-salt-lake-launch-drive-to-prevent-dengue/articleshow/83493520.cms||Suman Chakraborti

They were reportedly picked up from Bhura Rani road. SP (City) Mamata Vohra said the city police had registered a case on complaint of a resident, Mohammad Yamin, of Lakuan in Nainital district. He alleged the gang laid a trap and invited him to a house in Shanti Vihar colony on June 12. They allegedly made objectionable videos and forced him to pay Rs 10 lakh under threat to charge him in a false case. He paid them Rs 27,000 immediately from his garments shop in Lalkuan, where the accused took him in their car. The arrested individuals have been identified as Kulwinder Singh, a resident of the city's Shanti Vihar colony, Monu Singh of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, and Deewan Singh, a resident of Kaladhungi in Nainital. Three other members, including two women, are still absconding. "After investigation, it was found to be a honey trap case. The police team on Sunday arrested three suspects and recovered the car used to ferry them to Lalkuan. Three mobiles and a police uniform were also found," the SP added. The accused have been booked under sections 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (provocation to break the public peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 171 (wearing any garb or token used by that class of public servants) of the IPC. According to police, three gang members, namely Deepa, Pooja and Balbir, all residents of Nanakmatta town of the district, are still at large.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/honey-trap-gang-busted-in-rudrapur-3-held/articleshow/83491909.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Last week, a Kalupur resident was allowed by the Gujarat Information Commission (GIC) under the RTI Act to carry out site inspections of two under-construction road stretches in the city’s central zone. On Friday, following RTI applicant Pankaj Bhatt’s inspections of the Mohan Cinema to Santoshimata Temple stretch and the Idgah Circle to Nilkanth Awas Yojana stretch, the AMC learnt that road contractors were not using certified instruments. These instruments measure road thickness, the temperature of the hot mix, and weigh the raw materials used for road construction. The AMC’s engineer asked the contractors to stop construction and to ensure that the Gujarat’s controller for legal metrology provides a certificate for the measuring instruments. For each road project, the AMC pays a private third-party consultant to inspect these crucial aspects to ensure the longevity of roads. But Bhatt’s inspection highlighted the fact that these essential measuring instruments were being overlooked. “I was given an opportunity by the GIC and the AMC to exercise my right and participate in the city’s development process through the RTI Act,” Bhatt said. “Citizens should play an active role by filing RTI applications and help the civic body achieve the desired road quality it desires.” In fact, Bhatt has been allowed to inspect all roads that need resurfacing in the entire central zone in the financial year 2021-22. This is the first such instance of citizen inspection in Gujarat. In early April, state information commissioner Subhash Soni ordered the AMC to provide Bhatt samples from the fresh batch of materials used in an ongoing road construction project. Bhatt took advantage of the very first section of the RTI Act, which defines Right to Information as the right to inspect “work, documents, records”. The right also includes taking notes, extracts, or certified copies of civic body documents or records and even taking certified samples of material. The commission had gone a step farther and asked the AMC to provide the RTI applicant a copy of ‘test certificate’ against the material whose sample was provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rti-activist-shows-flaws-roadblock-for-contractors/articleshow/83493538.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Seniors risk Covid, brave joint pains to forage for the basics||NEW DELHI: Ram Chandar Rajak stoically bore the summer heat but shifted his body weight uncomfortably to relieve the injury ache on his right foot. It was a long wait of over three hours for the 60-year-old at Government Co-ed Senior Secondary School in south Delhi’s Nehru Nagar. A jhalmuri seller with a bag of puffed rice on his head, Rajak said, “Though I cannot walk properly due to the injury, I have to queue up for free ration. That’s the only way I can get meals for myself since I have earned hardly anything in the past 25 days and my savings dried up in the first week of the lockdown.” Hunger has driven many elderly people, like Rajak, to Delhi government’s free ration distribution centres. It also means stress exhaustion and discomfort for many of them, especially those with health problems. Rajak lives alone after his family returned to their native Bihar last year. “My 35-year-old son, Chhote Lal, was working in a factory, but he lost his job during the lockdown last year,” said Rajak. “He is now a labourer in Bihar and gets work three-four days a week. I used to send him Rs 2,000 every month to take care of my wife and his children, but lately I haven’t earned anything.” Some old people come to the ration centres so family members can go to work. Sunita Devi, 61, said that her two daughters, both deserted by their husbands, cannot leave home because of their three children. She has been trying to get the free wheat and rice for a couple of days. “I don’t have a ration card. I am a diabetic, so it is difficult to stand in the sun for so many days,” Devi said. “I haven’t yet got the token for the free foodgrain and I am feeling helpless.” Jai Prasad looked quite exhausted on Monday afternoon. The 67-year-old claimed he hadn’t had food or water for 10 hours. “My only concern is getting food for my family,” the old man said. “Otherwise, why would I risk corona infection with my low immunity?” he wheezed. Also left without an alternative was Shakuntala, 63. The widow said, “I have never had to work outside in my entire life and I have never stood like this for free stuff. But I don’t have an option. My son lost his shop job last month and is now a daily-wage earner. My daughter-in-law's earnings from housework have dwindled from Rs 3,500 to Rs 1,000 because families don’t want her to come any longer.” Another widow, Asha Devi, 61, waits for the day when she gets back her job as a cook. “After that I will not humiliate myself standing in a line like this for hours,” she said. “My children do not support me financially, but I have taken good care of myself for 30 years. Once the Covid cases decline, people will hopefully call me back to work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seniors-risk-covid-brave-joint-pains-to-forage-for-the-basics/articleshow/83492300.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Surat||Gujarat: Technical glitch snags force VNSGU to call off mock tests, exams||SURAT: With its online examination platform marred by technical glitches, South Gujarat’s largest university — Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) — was forced to announce cancellation of all mock tests as well as online examinations, barring those of BEd and medical streams, at the last moment. The university issued a notification on Saturday declaring postponement of the examinations until further notice as students faced problems while trying to log on to the platform. During the online mock tests, many students were not able to log in. Those who managed to log in had hardly attempted a few questions when the system logged them out. These issues forced the university to call off all mock tests and online examinations. Examinations of first semester of BEd which begins on Monday and that of medical faculty will be conducted as planned. The top officials of the university put the blame on students saying that the wrong contact details provided by them, including mobile number and email address, resulted in the glitch. However, the technical committee of the university is investigating the matter and is hopeful of finding a solution soon. University sources said that the server may have crashed due to the heavy traffic. VNSGU decided to conduct all the examinations simultaneously resulting in too many students trying to log in at the same time, they said. “There is a mismatch in the contact information submitted by the students at their college and the one they are using to log on to the portal. Also, data of some of the old students is not available. We have asked the students to provide to their colleges mobile numbers of all family members and at least two email addresses,” said vice chancellor Dr K N Chavda. He added that the academic council will decide on the new time-table. However, it is being deliberated that the online examinations be now conducted in a phased manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/tech-snags-force-vnsgu-to-call-off-mock-tests-exams/articleshow/83491956.cms||---

The webinar was held in association with the National Ayush Mission and the National Service Scheme unit of Adi Sankara Institute of Engineering and Technology, Kalady. The webinar, which was attended by around 230 people, was led by Dr Anu Elias, medical officer of Government Ayurveda Hospital, Cheruvathur. Yoga classes and demonstrations were conducted as part of the webinar. The demonstrations included those yoga poses included by the central Ayush department this year. She gave detailed explanations of each of the poses and how to do it correctly. “Yoga is journey to the self,” she said. The webinar was inaugurated by Neethu Sona, joint director, Regional Outreach Bureau (ROB), Kerala-Lakshadweep. She said that yoga would enable a person to improve his/her mental as well as physical health, which are equally important to fight the pandemic. “It is very important to be immune to the Covid-19 pandemic and yoga will help you achieve it. Yoga get international attention now and we must make practicing yoga a part of daily routine,” Sona said. Adi Sankara Institute of Engineering and Technology principal V Suresh Kumar presided over the webinar. National Ayush Mission district programme officer Dr M S Noushad, field exhibition officer Ponnumon, APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University NSS Cell coordinator V M Joy Varghese and NSS officer Sijo George spoke in the webinar. The ROB Kerala-Lakshadweep, which comprises various FOBs, is planning to conduct various programmes as part of the International Yoga Day on June 21. Due to the pandemic restrictions, all the activities will be held online. Last year, ROB has observed the day through conducting various progammes featuring the theme ‘Yoga at Home and Yoga with Family’ as decided by the United Nations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/webinar-stresses-on-importance-of-yoga/articleshow/83493557.cms||---

According to the Met office, the intensity of showers could increase slightly as the low-pressure that has been brewing over northwest Bay of Bengal close to the Odisha-Bengal coast, will move marginally closer to Bengal. Kolkata could receive around 100 mm rain between Saturday and Tuesday, said weathermen. Kolkata received 29.4 mm rain till 5.30pm on Sunday. “The low-pressure hasn’t moved much since it is trapped between westerly and easterly winds. But it has moved slightly towards our state, which is why rain has turned more frequent. It will get more intense over the next 48 hours but we don’t expect heavy showers. There could be short, sharp spells that won’t last long but will be frequent, adding to the rain count,” Das pointed out. Meanwhile, clouds have also been sailing into the state from Bangladesh, triggering short spells of rain. “These clouds have been driven away by the wind shear that now exists along the Bengal-Odisha coast. So, they are flying through Bangladesh and entering Bengal, much weakened. Again, the result has been short spells of rain,” added Das. Each spell, though, could trigger 20 mm–30 mm rain from now on.  “But since there is no other big system, heavy showers are unlikely,” said Das. Monsoon reached Kolkata on Saturday morning even as it rained intermittently, a day after its scheduled date of arrival. The city received short spells of drizzle through the day and will continue to receive light rain over the next 48 hours. Last year, too, monsoon had reached Kolkata on June 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-rain-on-the-cards-as-low-pressure-moves-closer-to-state/articleshow/83493556.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||IIT-Hyderabad designs world’s smallest microscope||HYDERABAD: Researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Hyderabad on Sunday said they have developed Muscope, the world’s smallest microscope, that will help in unravelling the mysteries of the microscopic world, including blood cells and disease-causing pathogens. Using a micro LED display, an IIT-H team designed and experimentally demonstrated the innovative technology. Muscope is an on-chip microscope. It can image up to one milli micron diameter with off-the-shelf electronic components, without optimisation. It is the smallest microscope — extending a few millimetre — capable of high resolution imaging. It has no purely optical or mechanical components and can be assembled like a circuit board. All its operations can be done over electrical interfaces. It can be software controlled — locally or remotely — and can be tuned online. Also, because of its small size, multiple Muscopes can be embedded in a small area, and in theory, their sizes can be tuned according to the desired field-of-view. Muscope uses common off the shelf components, making it low cost and robust. The IIT-H team that designed Muscope comprises Ekta Prajapati, Saurav Kumar, and Shishir Kumar of the department of electrical engineering. The result of the research study was published in preprint online portal, BioRxiv. Shishir Kumar told TOI that Muscope is the smallest microscope in the world with resolution rivalling desktop microscopes. “We want to use it for integrating microscopes in devices for medical diagnostics and life science research. In these applications, addition of Muscope will make devices compact, low cost and automated. Consider for example, microfluidic chips that we are working on in our lab. We want to manipulate single cells in these chips, moving them around, dosing them with chemicals and observing them under various conditions. These chips are less than a milimetre thick and laid out on a glass slide,” he said. Stating that to observe cells on these chips, a desktop microscope is quite troublesome as it occupies a large space, whose environment is hard to control, Shishir Kumar said that to observe multiple locations one has to have some mechanism to move either the chip or the microscope. The microscope itself is the costliest and most fragile part of the system. “With Muscope, we can observe multiple locations by just adding multiple units of Muscope. Even with multiple Muscopes, the system will have the size of a mobile phone, costing a fraction of the desktop microscope. Muscope achieves these feats by using a newly developed light source. It is lensless and completely electronic, meaning that it is made only using electronic chips. Due to the special light source, Muscope has many additional advantages, including high-speed illumination and patterned/coded illumination. This allows implementation of various imaging modes,” he said. The existing lensless microscopes can offer high resolution and wide field-of-view using super-resolution and computational techniques. But, the employment of macroscopic illumination system and unscalable opto-mechanical components limit their cost effectiveness, scalability, mass production and on-chip integration. Muscope fixes these issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iit-h-designs-worlds-smallest-microscope/articleshow/83495914.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Pune||Fake news: Pandemic was not set off by global cabal||Pune: Since the start of Covid-19, there have been scores of fake links and messages on social media claiming a global alliance of billionaires, scientists and government officials had a hand in “manufacturing” the pandemic. The posts also claimed certain individuals sought to gain financially by tracking people vaccinated against Covid.All these posts are fake; there has been no evidence whatsoever to support claims Covid was “planned”. Additionally, ‘population control’ has been a common theme among conspiracy theorists who believe a virus was unleashed to “kill millions”. One message claimed that a prominent billionaire had said that “at least 3 billion people need to die”. The billionaire never made that statement. Such fake messages have impacted vaccine drives in many countries. A recent report said lies pushed by anti-vaccine groups had triggered substantial scepticism among recipients in some African nations. The damage is not limited to developing nations. Last year, a YouGoV survey of 1,640 people found 28% of Americans believed vaccines were being used to “implant microchips in people”.The microchip theory gained pace when it was revealed that scientists were considering packing vaccination information into "invisible tattoos" on people's arms. But experts from the development team quickly dismissed the conspiracy theory, saying individuals will not be tracked and personal information would not be a part of the database.Social media firms have done little to stop these lies from spreading, experts have said. Last year, it was estimated that accounts held by so-called anti-vaxxers had increased their following by at least 7.8 million people since 2019.The Times Verified service was launched on April 30 to combat fake news related to the pandemic. Since launch, it has helped verify and dismiss more than 600 items of fake news.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fake-news-pandemic-was-not-set-off-by-global-cabal/articleshow/83493526.cms||---
---||Pune||All malls within PMC limits to close by 7pm, says civic chief||PUNE: Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Sunday said all malls in PMC limits will have to shut by 7pm. The new set of relaxations for the city, allowing malls to operate at 50% capacity, comes into effect on Monday. Dine-in services at eateries and bars have also been allowed — at 50% — till 10pm. But deadlines for malls may now impact timings of food outlets operating within the complexes. “...7pm malls closure time,” Kumar replied in a short text message on Sunday night, to a query by TOI which sought to know if food joints within malls will be allowed to operate till 10pm. A senior official with the Pune Municipal Corporation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there have been no updates on the relaxations. “There has been no change or an update in the relaxations which were announced on June 11, through an order by the PMC commissioner. The situation will remain so until the next Covid-19 review meeting, which is expected to be held on June 18,” the official said. All essential and non-essential shops within PMC limits will operate as per extended timings declared on June 11. The PMC areas were moved from level 3 to level 2 restrictions after a review meeting chaired by district guardian minister and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on June 11. The easing of curbs was because the weekly Covid positivity rate had dipped to below 5%, with oxygen bed occupancy also slipping below 25%. The PMC has continued with the weekend closure orders for non-essential shops (on Saturdays and Sundays). Restrictions on non-essential travel will come into force from 10.30pm from Monday. Liquor shops have been allowed to operate until 7pm throughout the week. Permissions for malls to operate is a major step in the relaxation process within PMC limits. In PCMC limits and rural Pune, malls continue to be under restrictions. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil earlier said the PCMC would continue with the level 3 restrictions regardless of whether the positivity rate dropped below 5% or not until next Friday. “We will review the situation next Friday. Orders will be issued every Friday based on the positivity rate for seven days before that,” he said. The only set of relaxations offered by the PCMC on Friday was allowing reading rooms, libraries and coaching classes to reopen at 50% capacity. Patil said it would be a challenge to monitor vehicular movement within the PCMC limits after 5pm since traffic in the PMC areas would operate till 10pm and there would be considerable cross-movement between the two corporations. As for Pune rural, Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state government on Covid-19, justified his recommendation to Pawar of not allowing further relaxations in rural Pune saying precautions were still not being followed properly. Dr Salunke said, “Covid-19 norms, like wearing face masks and social distancing, are not being followed properly. There is a threat of ‘reverse order’ impact, meaning Covid transmission can take place from rural to urban areas, if we lift/end Covid restrictions in rural Pune. Also, less than 10% of the population in rural Pune is fully vaccinated.” Vaccinated staffMall owners in Pune city have said they are looking forward to resuming operations from Monday. Businesses TOI had spoken to earlier said they have started vaccinating scores of their staff. Arun Arora, centre director of Phoenix Marketcity said their employees are ready to start operations from Monday. “We are ensuring that staffers who join have at least received their first shots. We recently conducted a drive to vaccinate all the staffers in the mall as well as retailers. The mall staff is still in Pune and did not return to their hometowns. Some employees of retail outlets have, however, gone back home.” Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, CEO of Amanora Mall, said they have vaccinated both staff and on-site retailers. “Ever since the state government issued an order on the 5-level unlock plan, we had an idea that we could soon get a chance to reopen, considering Pune city’s falling positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy,” he said. Curbs on malls have impacted scores of businesses that rely on them for footfalls. In March this year, when malls were asked to stay shut between 8pm and 7am, multiplex operators estimated that the curbs would cost them 80% of business after evening hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/all-malls-within-pmc-limits-to-close-by-7pm-civic-chief/articleshow/83493558.cms||---

Although nobody was injured, the community members are devastated and staring at an uncertain future. Mohd Salim, who, along with his wife and two children, had fled from Myanmar to India in 2013 for a better future, has lost all hope. “I lost my home and shop when a fire broke out at another location in 2018. It took several months to set up another shop and home, but all is gone now. I don’t know what to do and where to go,” said Salim. Community members said all shanties were gutted while a portion of a mosque was also affected. R P Meena, DCP (southeast), said, “The fire was brought under control with the help of beat staff and disaster management teams. The crime team has been intimated about the incident.” In initial inquiries, police found that at least 56 jhuggis with a population of around 270 people had been gutted. The cause of the fire is not known yet, said Meena. Some of the refugees have taken shelter in the mosque or under a tarpaulin sheet. A single mother of three children, Khatija Begum said, “I was sleeping in my shanty and suddenly woke up on hearing cries for help. When we were trying to flee, my dupatta caught fire but I, along with my children, managed to escape.” She could not even collect her children’s slippers and are left with nothing, said Khatija. Most of the refugees were badly hit during the Covid lockdown, and the fire has now made them homeless too. Salim, who had lost his job at a factory, said, “I have been selling vegetables to support my family since the lockdown, but a huge stock of veggies that was kept in my shack has turned into ashes. I cannot afford to rent a room.” Among his prized possessions that were burnt were two coolers, a sewing machine, 50kg potatoes and 20kg onions. “After saving money for five months, I bought a cooler for Rs 5,000 last week. I found some burnt pieces of coolers and sewing machine and sold the scrap to a ragpicker for just Rs 1,500,” he said. Like him, many others spent hours on Sunday morning to trace valuables or their remnants and iron pieces to make some money. Mohd Ilyas, who digs graves at a graveyard, said, “My wife’s earrings were kept in our shanty but I couldn’t find it in the ashes even after searching for almost five hours.” Another refugee, Abdullah, who has suffered losses in both fires, said, “I am an e-rickshaw driver and my work has been severely hit in the last one year due to the pandemic. With no roof over our head and no work, we are in a terrible condition. I now feel such miseries are written in our lives.” Sabeer Kya Min, founder of Rohingya Human Rights’ Initiative, said, “The government and other organisations should help in rehabilitation of Rohingya refugees. These people have lost everything and they don’t know where they will live now.” Some organisations provided food and clothes to them on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-series-of-unfortunate-events-camp-fire-leaves-rohingya-homeless-again/articleshow/83493562.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Kochi||KSRTC’s revival plan hits a hurdle||Thiruvananthapuram: The LDF government has been promising to revive Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) through various reform measures and technology updation for a while now. But, in contradiction to its declared policy, the government has partially backed away from its first promise of providing 1,000 buses to KSRTC through Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB). KIIFB has informed KSRTC that it cannot fund the purchase of 700 CNG buses out of the 1,000 promised in the state budget. When LDF government came to power in 2016, the first budget presented by the then finance minister TM Thomas Isaac had announced that KSRTC will be provided Rs 300 crore as loan from the special investment scheme to purchase 1,000 CNG buses with a hub in Ernakulam. He had said that KSRTC was incurring a loss of Rs 85 crore/month and it is impossible to proceed in that fashion further. The total liability of KSRTC then was calculated as Rs 3,446.92 crore and Isaac declared that all buses of KSRTC will be converted into CNG in five years. As part of this announcement, the budget had allocated a financial assistance for purchasing 1,000 CNG buses. In a communique from KIIFB CEO KM Abraham to KSRTC CMD Biju Prabhakar (accessed by TOI), it has been said that ‘given constraints for the additional funding for the procurement of 700 CNG buses for Rs 455 crore, this proposal cannot be proceeded with at this present time’. The letter was in response to the proposal and detailed project report submitted by KSRTC to KIIFB for the procurement of 700 CNG buses. The procurement of CNG buses are part of KSRTC’s revival plan to reduce its mounting losses, especially by saving fuel cost for long-distance buses, categorized as fast passengers, superfast and express ones. KSRTC has a fleet of close to 5,000 buses of which almost 1,800 buses are operating in the long-distance segment. Almost all these buses are on the verge of being phased out as the lifespan of these buses are seven years. Last time, KSRTC purchased buses was in 2017, when the government granted funds for the purchase of 100 diesel buses. “This won’t immediately affect KSRTC. As many as 300 buses have been sanctioned and they will soon be added to the fleet. We are also exploring the option of dry leasing buses, which is economical from a maintenance point of view. All these would help us in managing services for the next couple of years, and by then, it is expected that KIIFB would sanction the remaining buses,” said Prabhakar.

The advisory follows the electrocution of a man in Gujarat’s Aravalli district when he tried to rescue a bird caught up on a live wire. Honorary district animal welfare officer of Animal Welfare Board of India, Mitesh Jain, told TOI: “A man from Malpur town in Gujarat, Dilip Waghela, had climbed up an electric pole to free a bird on June 10. He was electrocuted. We urge animal lovers to notify the fire brigade if they see any bird in such a situation.'' Jain, who also runs an NGO, Karuna Trust, in Virar, added: “Fire brigade personnel use safety ladders and ensure that electric current is switched off before rescuing any bird from high-tension cables. In Vasai and Virar we have often used services of firemen to rescue birds from tall tree branches and electric poles. Also, it shows how dangerous the menace of manja threads can be.” An Andheri-based animal lover, Amrita Ghaswala, also informed that they had recently called the fire brigade to rescue a crow stuck from a tree branch at their building in Marol, Andheri (east). Jain added: “Soon after Makar Sankranti kite-flying festival, many birds were rescued. Months after this event, birds continue to unwittingly get trapped in stray manja threads. Hence our one day of fun (of kite flying) can prove to be a death knell for various bird species and at times humans, as was seen at Malpur last week.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-activists-on-alert-as-guj-man-dies-amid-bird-rescue-op/articleshow/83495175.cms||Vijay Singh

This proposal is part of the Gujarat State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), a document of over 300 pages, which was unveiled earlier this month on the occasion of World Environment Day. It is proposed that the 24-member CMCCC will have 12 members from the government, and six each from the private sector and academia and research institutions. The principal secretary, climate change department will be the coordinator of the committee. As part of the institutional mechanism to implement the SAPCC, the role of all 26 state government departments has also been spelt out in the action plan document. While some departments will have a more pro-active role to play in mitigating climate threats, all other departments will be required to carry out concerted awareness programmes regarding climate change. S J Haider, principal secretary, climate change department, said the SAPCC underlines actions that the state proposes to reinforce to adapt and augment resilience to climate threats. “The plan also envisages strategies for financing climate action and institutional mechanisms to ensure sustained action,” the official said. He added that monitoring and evaluation form a significant component to ensure that outcomes are in line with desired goals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/climate-change-panel-mooted/articleshow/83493599.cms||Meghdoot Sharon
---||Kochi||Mental stability tests a must to avoid acquittal: Kerala high court||KOCHI: Police’s failure to subject a murder accused to medical examination in a case where mental stability of the accused is doubted will entitle the accused to an acquittal, the high court has held. The ruling was given on June 9 by a division bench comprising justices K Vinod Chandran and M R Anitha in the judgment acquitting a 46-year-old woman from Kollam, who was accused of killing her mother and her two children. Though witnesses, including doctors, had told police that she had undergone psychiatric treatment, the investigating officer had not ventured to refer her for a medical examination to ascertain mental soundness at the time of the alleged crime. In the judgment, the court said, “If the investigating officer was fair enough and wanted to bring the true facts before the court, he would have made an inquiry into the aspect of the soundness of the mind of the accused. Peculiar nature of the offence of matricide and filicide of two small daughters coupled with the factors brought out during investigation ought to have been taken into account by the investigating officer to subject the accused to medical examination immediately after the incident to ascertain the soundness of mind of the accused at the crucial time of the incident. Failure to do the same creates serious infirmity in the prosecution case which would entitle the accused to benefit of doubt and consequent acquittal. In other words, the evidence adduced from the side of prosecution and defence creates a reasonable doubt in the mind of the court about the mens rea (intention to commit a crime) of the accused and the general burden of proof on that aspect resting on the prosecution was not discharged and that would enable the accused to benefit of doubt.” Prosecution case was that the accused slashed the necks of her mother and daughters aged eight and six years, causing their death, and that she attempted to commit suicide by inflicting a deep cut injury on her neck. Advocate P K Varghese, who represented the accused, had contended that the accused’s brother had deposed about his sister’s mental illness. A senior doctor at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, who treated the accused on the day of the murders, had advised psychiatric consultation. The investigating officer admitted in cross examination that he was aware of the history of mental illness in the family of the accused, including psychosis of father, nephews, and maternal sister, the counsel said. The appellant had undergone treatment for delusional disorder four years before the incident and was treated for schizophrenia one year after the incident, he had submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mental-stability-tests-a-must-to-avoid-acquittal-hc/articleshow/83491988.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Shiv Sena says will not share CM post for 5 years||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Sunday left no room for speculation about the occupant of the chief minister’s chair. Sanjay Raut, executive editor of party mouthpiece Saamna, made it clear in his weekly column Rokh-Thok that the CM’s post would be with the Shiv Sena for the full five-year term and would not be shared with MVA partners NCP or Congress. Coming at a time when neither the NCP nor the Congress was questioning the standing of the Shiv Sena in the state government, the assertion sent many looking for the trigger for Raut’s comments. The best anyone could come up with was Congress state unit president Nana Patole’s announcement later in the day that his party would contest all elections to local bodies and the state assembly on its own, but even there he only spoke about future polls and not the current arrangement. The NCP and Congress spokespersons also said there was no dispute in the MVA. As the day progressed, Raut finally decided to end the suspicion. Speaking to the media in Nashik, he said his assertion was aimed at the BJP and was made to scotch baseless speculation about the future of the MVA after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a one-to-one meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi early last week. “I am clarifying this because there should not be any speculation or confusion over the CM’s post among people as we all [Sena, NCP and Congress] knew this. I was one of the witnesses and a part of the MVA government-formation process, so I am saying that there is no such issue regarding sharing of CM’s post,” the Rajya Sabha member said. Raut said his column was meant to clarify that there was clarity in the MVA about the CM’s chair. “A commitment had been made by the MVA partners that the CM’s post would not be shared, unlike the decision at the time of the erstwhile government with estranged ally BJP about 50:50 power sharing. And I think NCP chief Sharad Pawar has also made the same statement while addressing a party function in the recent past,” he said. Raut wrote in his column that the state BJP wanted to come to power at any cost in the state he and asked whether it really had the support from its top leadership. “Rumours are being spread that the NCP will claim the CM’s post after two and a half years, which will spark controversy and new political equations will emerge. But it will not happen,” he said in the column. Reiterating that the government will complete its term of five years, Raut said that it was not helplessness but the need of all three parties in the MVA to remain in power. “The Congress is in power in one or two states. But being a part of the power structure in Maharashtra is an important factor. The NCP too could not spread outside Maharashtra, while the Sena, being the biggest brand of Hindutva, could not expand outside Maharashtra. In this situation, to keep the government running is the necessity of all three parties. If all goes well, why would one think of disturbing the settled government?” he said. The state Congress, while avoiding comment on Raut’s column, said it would remain with the Shiv Sena for five years. “Maha Vikas Aghadi will remain intact to keep the BJP away from power and the MVA government will complete its five years term,” party spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. He declined to comment on the Shiv Sena holding the CM’s post for five years. NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said all was well in the alliance. “The Shiv Sena is the largest partner in the MVA and is leading the government. It will go on for five years. The government is stable and will complete its term,” Tapase said. Two days after Thackeray-Modi meeting, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had, speaking at the foundation day speech of his party on Thursday, praised the Shiv Sena and said that no one had thought the NCP would form a government with it. “The Shiv Sena is a trustworthy party. Balasaheb Thackeray had always kept his word. When the Congress lost and the Janata Party government came to power, at that time also the Sena extended its support to the Congress in the state assembly polls by not putting up a single candidate in that election. Balasaheb had given a word to Indira Gandhi, which he kept,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sena-says-will-not-share-cm-post-for-5-yrs/articleshow/83495165.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar

---||Hyderabad||Agri power demand surges 62% in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Power demand has gone up exponentially in Telangana after the TRS government began providing 24x7 free power to the agriculture sector. Over five lakh new agriculture connections have been added in the state since 2014. Agriculture power demand has witnessed a steep 62% jump in the past few years, especially after the government began providing uninterrupted power supply to the agriculture sector. As a result, irrigation facilities and free power helped the state occupy the top slot in paddy cultivation in the country. According to official records, there were 19 lakh agriculture connections at the time of formation of Telangana in 2014. In the past seven years, 5.86 lakh new connections —3.65 lakh in Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) and 2.49 lakh in Telangana Northern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSNPDCL) — were added. The twin power distribution companies now have over 12 lakh agriculture connections each in their jurisdiction. In the undivided Andhra Pradesh, five to seven hour power supply was given to the agriculture sector, which was increased to nine hours uninterrupted power from 2016. Later, the government had extended it to 24x7 power supply from January, 2018. “The power utilities have been meeting the demand of the agriculture sector apart from domestic, commercial and industrial sectors that too without any load relief,” TSSPDCL chairman and managing director G Raghuma Reddy told TOI. To meet the power requirement of the agriculture sector, discoms have strengthened their power infrastructure. In TSSPDCL jurisdiction alone, Rs 11,301 crore was spent on infrastructure like constructing new 33/11 KV substations, erecting power transformers and distribution transformers. TSNPDCL spent another Rs 4,746 crore in the past five years. After the government started providing nine-hour power supply, there was a sudden demand for agriculture connections. Southern discom released 70,000 new connections, while the Northern discom released 42,000, both records in the history of the power utilities. With regard to power consumption in TSSPDCL limits, comprising erstwhile Rangareddy, Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Medak and Hyderabad (no agriculture connections in Hyderabad), it rose from 6,694 million units (MU) in 2013-14 to 10,818 MU in 2019-20, a growth of 62%. In TSNPDCL limits, comprising erstwhile Karimnagar, Adilabad, Warangal, Nizamabad and Khammam districts, power consumption jumped from 4,261 MU in 2013-14 to 7,904 MU, registering a growth of 85.49%. “Power consumption by the agriculture sector rose more in TSNPDCL as it covers rural districts except Warangal Urban. Secondly, apart from agriculture connections, there are lift irrigation projects, including Kaleshwaram, which need more power to provide irrigation facilities to the agriculture sector,” a chief general manager of TSNPDCL said. The area ünder cultivation has increased from 17.62 lakh acres in 2017-2018 to 35.27 lakh acres in 2020-2021, a growth rate of 100%, a senior government official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/agri-power-demand-surges-62-in-state/articleshow/83495916.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Goa||New tender for Bainguinim waste plant in 15 days: Michael Lobo||PANAJI: Waste Management minister Michael Lobo on Sunday said that the state government will float a new tender within the fortnight for setting up of the solid waste management plant at Bainguinim. Lobo said that the tender document is “ready, with modified criteria”. Lobo told TOI that as per the earlier tender document not a single bidder was eligible as decided by Central Public Work Department (CPWD) and that was the reason the state government is now issuing a fresh tender with modified criteria. The plant, estimated to cost Rs 200 crore is expected to cater to the entire Tiswadi taluka and would have facilities for recycling and sorting lines, segregation, bio-methanation and composting systems. Last month all the three bidders had been disqualified, after which the Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) started a fresh tendering process. The companies that had expressed interest were Hindustan Waste Treatment pvt ltd, Maaviya Engineering Consultants pvt ltd and Three R Management pvt ltd. The bids of these firms had been placed before the technical advisory committee for scrutiny. Due to inadequate offers received, the state government had extended the time for accepting bids four times, the last being on January 31. In 2008, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) acquired land at Bainguinim to set up the waste management plant and in 2017 the land was handed over to GWMC. A public hearing was held by GWMC and the environment clearance was also obtained. The corporation had also invited a request for qualification (RFQ) for the proposed plant. GWMC decided to undertake the project through a public-private partnership (PPP) on a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) basis, wherein the plant infrastructure will be implemented by the concessionaire along with operations and maintenance for a period of ten years. Union Ayush minister Shripad Naik had said the location identified for the solid waste management facility at Bainguinim is “wrong and the government has to rethink over it”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-tender-for-bainguinim-waste-plant-in-15-days-lobo/articleshow/83495180.cms||---

Class-1 officer of CGST posted in Division-IV Ahmedabad circle Neetusingh Tripathi was arrested in March along with another employee of the department while the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) laid a trap. ACB had received a complaint from Syga Home Furnishing after a notice was sent to ascertain difference between input tax credit vide GSTR-3B and credit vide GSTR-2A. The difference was Rs 1.56 crore, but Rs 5 lakh bribe was allegedly demanded by the accused for not finding any error and to close the file. The joint commissioner talked with the complainant and after some negotiations, the sum was settled at Rs 1.5 lakh, the probe agency claimed. Tripathi was denied bail earlier, but she filed another bail plea after the probe agency filed a chargesheet in the case. After considering all aspects, the court granted her conditional bail on furnishing bond and a surety of Rs 10,000. With other bail conditions, the court asked her to “file an affidavit stating her immovable properties whether self-acquired, acquired by family members or ancestral with description, location and present value of such properties” before the court. In another bail condition, the court has ordered not to leave her headquarters, which is fixed by her higher authority, without prior permission of the court. In her bail plea, the officer claimed innocence and asserted that nothing was either discovered or recovered from her during the trap laid by the ACB. Moreover, the court also considered that the officer has a five-year-old daughter and she needs to take care of her also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/reveal-properties-courts-bail-condition-for-cgst-official/articleshow/83493603.cms||---

Manufacturers said 40% of the cost of a solar water-heating system — increasingly a requirement for building permission to be granted — goes into specialized, imported glass tubes used to heat and distribute the water. “The glass-based tubes are imported from China, and it is a market worth Rs 150 crore. For a typical 100-litre system, which costs Rs12,000-15,000, about 40% of the cost goes to these tubes. A PLI scheme aimed at the manufacture of these tubes would greatly help glass manufacturers in India, who can’t currently compete with Chinese imports,” Jaideep Malaviya, founder and secretary-general of the Solar Thermal Federation of India, said. He added said they would meet Union minister RK Singh in the coming week to press this demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/solar-heater-makers-seek-pli-sops/articleshow/83492014.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi unlock: Traders welcome lifting of odd-even curbs||New Delhi: Traders on Sunday welcomed Delhi government’s decision to end the odd-even plan and allow opening of all markets on seven days of the week. They said the decision was needed to boost sales that have hit an all-time low. Several market associations held meetings to draw up their respective action plans for ensuring strict implementation of the Covid protocol. To make customers feel safe, traders at Connaught Place have pasted posters outside their shops, specifying that all their staff members are vaccinated. “We have ordered badges stating ‘I am vaccinated’ for shopkeepers and their employees. There is also a plan to start a month-long sanitation drive to keep the area safe,” said Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders’ Association. Bhargava, however, called for a crackdown on illegal hawkers. “Our efforts will come to nothing if these hawkers continue to put up stalls with total disregard to Covid norms,” he said At Sadar Bazaar, the Covid coordination committee will continue to ensure that no gatherings take place in the market. They have decided to give discounts to buyers who are already inoculated. “We formed a Covid coordination committee last week wherein 24 members, mostly representatives of different markets, worked really hard to coordinate with and encourage shopkeepers to maintain social distancing and follow other norms. With the lifting of the odd-even plan, our responsibility has increased manifold as there will be a sudden surge in the number of visitors,” said Rakesh Yadav, president, Federation of Sadar Bazaar Traders Association (FESTA). “All jewellers, cosmetic, plastic, hardware and other market associations have been asked to motivate people to get vaccinated by offering small gifts or discounts to those who have already go the jab,” said Rajendra Sharma, general secretary of FESTA. Sarojini Nagar traders may pursue authorities to help restrict the number of visitors by issuing tokens and barricading some entry points. On Sunday, the market saw a huge rush. “We are yet to take a final decision, but individual shopkeepers have assured us that they won’t allow more than two customers on their premises at a time. Social distancing can be maintained easily as long as the roadside patri market is not allowed by NDMC,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Mini Market Sarojini Nagar. Rajendra Sharda, president of GK-I M Block market, said security guards and parking attendants had been asked to come on duty only after getting vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-welcome-lifting-of-odd-even-curbs/articleshow/83492018.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Beach nourishment at Veli and Poonthura, a challenging task||Thiruvananthapuram: The sandy beaches in the district are being eaten away by strong waves at an alarming pace, resulting in loss of homes and livelihood. Minister for Transport Antony Raju – who represents Thiruvananthapuram assembly constituency – has pitched up the idea of beach nourishment along Poonthura and Veli. Experts associated with coastal restoration and wave dynamics welcomed the move and added that it has to be done with utmost scientific knowledge and based on long-term sustainability quotient. Beach nourishment hinges mainly on maintaining the natural slope equilibrium, they pointed out. “There is no harm in artificial sand deposits to prevent coastal erosion. The success of such a process depends on long-term sediment availability and we need measures to sustain sand. The depth of sea along Trivandrum coast has increased considerably. There should be a proper study on how and where the deposit shall be done. The quantification of sand deposit at the mouth of the harbour has to be accurate. Beach nourishment will take time to yield results,” said coastal scientist KV Thomas. Natural, man-made factors have contributed equally to depletion of sediment deposit on beaches along the district coast, other scientists added. Cumulative erosion has been detrimental to the beaches. “We used to have a regular weather pattern like monsoon from June to Sept and then we would have a fair patch which will begin from Oct till Apr. This period used to witness a natural beach building process. We could assume that even if beaches got washed away during rain, part of it or even more would come back in the following months. This process has not been happening in Trivandrum in the way we expect in the past four years. Periodic cyclonic activity, storm conditions, extreme rain and some man-made reasons may have resulted in this. If beach nourishment has to yield a solution, it has to be done for a prolonged period,” said another senior coastal scientist. Beach nourishment is being successfully done at Visakhapatnam as an annual project for Vizag port. There has been a notable increase in the beachfront area following this process. “If Vizag model is to be replicated here, we have to lay focus even on the nature of material being deposited. There should be 5 years of nourishment. The material should be almost similar to the original material and share the same characteristics. We need to revive the same process and equilibrium slope has to be maintained,” said anexpert. It is yet to be ascertained whether the proposed beach nourishment will coincide with the shore protection work set to begin at Poonthura. Raju said that Dr MS Swaminathan report shall be implemented to maintain ecological balance in coastal areas. “Deposit of sand is the important step in preventing coastal erosion. The firm engaged in construction of Vizhinjam harbour is not willing to deposit sand along the coastal area and emergency directions shall be given to it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/beach-nourishment-at-veli-and-poonthura-a-challenging-task/articleshow/83493608.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Plans have been afoot to demolish the building for the construction of a new court complex at a cost of Rs 23.35 crore. “The Ottapalam court complex has its archaeological value, historical and political importance. The building should be preserved,” said Palakkad History Club president Boban Mattumantha. Archaeologists, historians and educationists have also supported the demand to protect the heritage complex. The superintending archaeologist of Archaeological Survey of India has learnt to have given recommendation to protect the heritage building to the art and heritage commission and the district collector. During the British rule, many freedom fighters were trialled here and sent to prison. Those who were arrested for organizing the first KPCC meeting in 1921 were brought before this court and trials were conducted, Mattumantha said. Under the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958, the heritage complex should be protected. The new court complex could be constructed in the land near to the heritage building, he said. Judicial luminaries like Madhavan Nair and O Chandu Menon (who wrote ‘Indulekha’, the first Malayalam novel) had served as judges in the Ottapalam court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/demand-to-protect-heritage-court-complex/articleshow/83492069.cms||---

Scrutinising CCTV footage and the inputs developed with local intelligence led police to solve the daylight snatching that occurred outside Ghitorni Metro station on Friday. Sandeep Lamba, whose mobile phone was taken, is a research scholar, pursuing his PhD in mechanical engineering from IIT Delhi. He was also engaged in developing an app related to women safety issues. Police accelerated their inquiry after the complainant informed them that the robbed mobile phone contained valuable and important data related to studies, which was crucial for his career as well as the project in pipeline, related to women safety. A team comprising sub-inspector Rishikesh, assistant sub-inspector Raj Kumar, head constable Ram Karan, constables Sita Ram, Yogesh, Niranjan, Sandeep and Khushi Ram, under supervision of station house officer, Fatehpur Beri, inspector Kuldeep Singh and overall guidance of ACP, Mehrauli, Ranbir Singh, was set up to solve the case. “During the course of investigation, CCTV cameras installed at nearby place of occurrence and surrounding area were checked. Local informants were contacted and briefed about the incident. After rigorous efforts, the team finally zeroed down upon the accused,” said an officer. The accused, identified as Abhishek (21) and Rupak Kumar Pandey (22) were caught with the help of CCTV footage and local intelligence, said police, adding “the culprits were arrested within four hours of the incident.” The robbed mobile phone as well as the motorcycle used in the crime were recovered from the accused.

---||Delhi||One weekly market per zone will affect sales, say Delhi vendors||NEW DELHI: Weekly market vendors are not happy with the latest order of Delhi Disaster Management Authority. They complained that besides allowing only one market daily per zone, the authority had refused to allow the markets on roadsides, which would automatically affect their sales. Sunday’s order has stated that markets can be allowed to function at suitable nearby grounds, where the DDMA guidelines can be strictly implemented. District officials have also been asked to allow only 50% vendors at one place and not to permit any unauthorised weekly market. Traders said the directions would lead to confusion and even discord among vendors over putting up stalls. “We fail to understand why weekly market vendors have to face difficulties every time the unlocking exercise starts. When no market will be allowed on the roadside, how would people get to know about a new destination when only one market is allowed daily in a zone?” asked Rajesh Gupta of North Delhi Weekly Market Association. The condition of allowing markets only in open areas will do away with the chances of organising tehbazari at places where there are no open spaces, he added. “In zones like Rohini, where 38 markets are organised in a week, only seven will be allowed. Where will the rest of the vendors earn their livelihood?” Gupta wondered. “We are waiting for weekly markets to start operations and after a few days, we will pursue the authority to give relaxations.” Rajkumar Kataria, general secretary of Weekly Vendors’ Market Association in south Delhi, welcomed the move to allow weekly markets, but also pointed out that these markets were organised at one place for years. “Locals come here accordingly. So shifting them to other sites is not a good idea.” DDMA has asked civic bodies to publish the list of authorised weekly markets on their websites to discourage people to put up stalls anywhere else. If Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed or if there is any increase in cases, all weekly markets will be closed without any loss of time to avoid any upsurge, it has specified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-weekly-market-per-zone-will-affect-sales-say-vendors/articleshow/83492037.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kolkata||Posta flyover razing: Traffic curbs from tonight to August 15 in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority and Kolkata Police are gearing up for their biggest challenge this year — dismantling the incomplete and damaged Vivekananda Road flyover, popularly known as Posta flyover — from this Tuesday. Traffic changes to facilitate work will be in place from Monday night and continue till the morning of August 15. KMDA officials and cops said the agency entrusted with the dismantling job will pull down the flyover structure under the supervision of RITES. A special machine is being brought from Italy for the dismantling work which will ensure safety in the highly populated area, sources from KMDA said. The cops said the non-use of big cranes in this phase will mean that cops will get bigger space to adjust parking issues. The Kolkata traffic police have chalked up a massive traffic diversion plan around Strand Road with the Posta flyover demolition work expected to go on till mid-August. “The biggest challenge is to keep the MG Road traffic moving. We had to make the stretch both ways from Strand Road to Central Avenue. But if we allow every vehicle from Girish Park on this stretch, it is likely to choke the traffic. Hence, while we may allow smaller vehicles on MG Road in non-peak hours, we have to ensure that Posta and Girish Park-bound smaller vehicles will be asked to take the Maharshi Debendra Road and then the Kalikrishna Tagore Street to move further north. Only buses and minibuses will be asked to take the MG Road,” said an officer. The other challenge is the movement of trucks on to Posta. “While trucks will do better to enter through Dunlop, those from the port area and Santragachhi and headed for Strand Road (South) will be diverted towards Central Avenue-Rabindra Sarani. Trucks have to enter via CR Avenue-Beadon Street-Nimtala Ghat Road and finally Strand Bank Road. This will mean travelling extra kilometres through some busy stretches. While movement at night might not be an issue, those trucks moving from the port after noon under the special permissions might face challenges,” added the officer. “We have held meetings with traders and transporters of Burrabazar-Posta areas and we hope to meet the emerging challenges collectively,” said a Howrah Bridge traffic guard officer. The implementing agency — which is working on behalf of KMDA — has already marked out the area between Nawab Lane and Posta Crossing, a stretch of 115 metres, where it has removed lamp posts and set up barricades. “The agency which has been asked to carry out the job will be using advanced equipment like diamond cutters, heavy duty lifting machines, trestles and earth movers to cut and pull down the concrete slabs from the deck portion in small pieces without making any vibration and much noise. This work could be done using only much smaller cranes. Once the concrete deck slab is pulled down, the steel structure of the bridge would be dismantled for which gas cutters would be required,” said a bridge expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/posta-flyover-razing-traffic-curbs-from-tonight-to-aug-15/articleshow/83493609.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This World Blood Donor Day is not just a formality for a few families here, but a true celebration of their dedication. Members of these families have been donating blood on a regular basis and even crossed the 100th milestone in their selfless activity. Not surprising that while many would go out on family picnics on weekends, these families prefer to visit the blood banks every three months. While 66-year-old Praful Bhajiyawala has himself donated blood 104 times, 10 members of his family have collectively donated blood for over 400 times so far. “Now, six of them have discontinued donating due to age and the next generation is taking over. They are equally enthusiastic and regularly go to donate blood,” said Bhajiyawala. Five members of Viral Jariwala’s family not only donate blood regularly, they also encourage their neighbourhood to do so. Jariwala has donated blood 176 times till now. His younger brothers, Dimple and Amish too, have donated more than 100 times. “Our family has donated blood for over 400 times. It is a religious practice for us,” said Jariwala, a stock broker. Family of Kirit Gandhi, 57, a powerloom unit owner, also has three centurian donors. Gandhi himself donated 125 times, while his elder brother Girish donated 115 times and younger brother Ashwin 105 times. “Around 40 years ago, many people suffered injuries when Mukesh Dyeing Mills collapsed and my father took us all to donate blood. I was 17 then and since then we continued to donate blood,” said Gandhi. “Donation in groups helps us manage during scarcity of blood. These families are an inspiration for others. There is a need for young blood donors as we face shortage of blood often,” said Nitesh Mehta, public relation officer at Surat Raktadan Kendra and Research Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/families-of-centurion-blood-donors-keep-legacy-of-surti-spirit-alive/articleshow/83492155.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

However, after learning to ride two-wheeler and drive four-wheeler, Delisha wanted even more challenging a ride so she decided to take the wheels of her father’s tanker truck. For the past three years, Delisha has been driving the tanker Kochi to Malappuram at least thrice a week to transport fuel from the refinery in Irumbanam to a petrol bunk in Tirur. Video: 24-year-old #DelishaDavis from #Thrissur drives her father’s tanker truck, carrying hazardous goods, with ea… https://t.co/jwiQ5XSlDP— TOI Kochi (@TOIKochiNews) 1623643331000Delisha’s story came to light two weeks ago after a motor vehicle department official stopped her tanker when she was driving to Tirur with the fuel. This happed after the MVD was informed by someone who saw ‘a small girl driving a tanker through the national highway during the lockdown’. The official was surprised when she showed him her heavy vehicle driving licence and the licence to carry hazardous goods. “The MVD officials congratulated my passion and informed the media stating that ‘my story would be a motivation to women who are scared to drive’. The official said probably I would be the only woman in Kerala who have the licence to carry hazardous goods. I was surprised to know that no one has noticed me driving the tanker for the past three years,” said Delisha. Even though she learned to drive the tanker at the age of 16, Davis wanted her to wait till she got her licence. She secured the heavy and the hazardous licence at the age of 20. She said she found driving the tanker easier than a car and in each trip she covers around 300km. Now, Davis accompanies her as the cleaner and the number of trips has reduced to two or three weekly due to the lockdown. “My day starts at 2am. We drive to Irumbanam at 4am and returns to Tirur with the load at 9.30am. After unloading the fuel, we reach home by 3pm. I attended my PG classes in the evening batch. Driving is my passion and Appa supported me fully. Otherwise this would not have been possible. My dream is to drive a multi-axle Volvo bus and I am trying to get its licence,” Delisha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/its-easy-to-drive-a-tanker-than-a-car/articleshow/83492108.cms||---

Those who have been placed are getting salaries in the bracket of Rs 15,000-25,000 per month depending on their skills and job profile. During the second wave of Covid-19, police commissioner S N Shrivastava had asked district deputy commissioners of police to identify and arrange for training of youths so that they could not only get jobs but also act as force multipliers during pandemic. “There was a dual objective to provide employment and generate resource and talent that can contribute in healthcare sector in this time of pandemic,” Shrivastava said. The trained youths can work as home patient care and general duty assistants, emergency medical technicians, ambulance drivers, domestic Covid health workers, etc. “It was observed that the services of the trainees in the Yuva initiative could be utilised as primary healthcare workers. Special arrangements were made to impart basic training to these youth in collaboration with various reputed hospitals and companies engaged in healthcare,” Shrivastava said. The youths were trained on the basis of their educational background, interest and aptitude. “On the successful completion of training, trainees are provided with certificates to help them secure placements in future. In coordination with premium hospitals and companies engaged in healthcare, Delhi Police is also organising job fairs to facilitate placement for these trained and skilled youngsters,” police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said. In North district, 55 youths were trained and 54 of them have already been provided with jobs. The cops here conducted short-term courses in collaboration with pathology labs. North West district collaborated with five reputed companies and eight hospitals. In the initial phase, 157 candidates have been enrolled for training in basic healthcare, use of medical equipment, first aid & CPR, nursing and home care, vaccination programme and operation of oxygen plants. Of them, 34 have been placed. East and Dwarka districts have also provided jobs to around 35 youths till now. Similarly, other districts have also enrolled youths and will help them get placed upon completion of their training, the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-skill-train-close-to-1000-youths-help-find-jobs-for-123/articleshow/83493662.cms||---
---||Mumbai||New I-T portal doesn’t let taxpayers remit money abroad or answer notices||MUMBAI: The new income-tax portal launched on June 7, which promised to be a gamechanger, continues to be plagued by glitches. Taxpayers and tax professionals find they are unable to log in, or if at all they do manage to log in, they are unable to carry out transactions—be it uploading a relevant form or replying to a notice from the I-T department. A day after the launch, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman took cognisance of the various grievances pouring out on social media and passed on the message to Infosys, the tech service provider. However, as of now, taxpayers find themselves in troubled waters. One of the most common complaints is that overseas remittances are held up because Forms 15CA and 15CB can’t be uploaded. The former is a declaration made by the remitter that tax has been deducted at source on payments made to the non-resident. Banks now insist it is received by them before remittance is made. Form 15CB is a certificate from a CA that the provisions of the relevant tax treaty and the I-T Act have been complied with. Anish Thacker, president at the Chamber of Tax Consultants (CTC), says corporate entities are badly hit. “As Form 15CA cannot be uploaded, overseas remittances are held up. Corporates are being treated by the overseas party as defaulters and they are being subject to penalties for late payment and their reputation is at stake.” Ameet Patel, chairperson of the taxation committee at Bombay Chartered Accountants’ Society (BCAS), rues that “taxpayers cannot reply to notices received from the I-T department. In some instances, if the reply is not received within a certain period of time, the case can become time barred. Owing to the non-functionality of the I-T portal, many such taxpayers will suffer penal consequences”. These are not minor glitches, but major issues that need immediate attention,” adds Patel. Taxpayers are currently facing a host of other issues as well. Patel illustrates: Newly incorporated companies or firms are not able to register themselves on the I-T portal. It is not possible to register the TAN number for filing tax deducted at source returns, digital signature certificate is not getting registered or updated. A tax practitioner who tried to register a corporate client, got a message saying: As you are a minor, you are not authorised under the law to register. Thacker says a parallel run of the old and new I-T portals for a month or two could have eased the issues which taxpayers are facing. A 998-page note on guidelines on how to navigate the new I-T portal has also raised eyebrows. All taxpayers, including the salaried (whose I-T returns for the FY 2020-21 are due in September) may continue to face a huge hurdle if the problems aren’t addressed. “Profile updation requires matching of Aadhar as well as PAN details and more often than not, mismatches are shown. For instance, if one word in the address is missing or spelt differently in one of the two identity cards then there will be a mismatch, which cannot be rectified on the portal. This means we have to either update our Aadhaar or PAN,” points out a chartered accountant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/new-i-t-portal-doesnt-let-taxpayers-remit-money-abroad-or-answer-notices/articleshow/83495196.cms||Lubna Kably

The project is aimed at indigenous development of technologies to supplement 5G connectivity. The team led by Gautam Makwana of the university’s Graduate School of Engineering and Technology, has undertaken this pilot project, which once developed would accelerate development in wireless transmission in a big way, a university release said on Sunday. The team has been sanctioned a sum of Rs 22 lakh by Gujarat State Council of Science and Technology for this unique 5G antenna project. GTU VC Professor Navin Sheth announced that this wireless antenna could connect around 10 lakh devices and provide them a speed of 10 gigabytes per second and thus exchange data at extremely high speed. He said this would also help generate more automation in core sectors of economy like agriculture and industry. He said as against 4G, this new antenna would work much faster and will also contribute in realizing the Aatmanirbhar Bharat dream of developing competent wireless technology. The VC added that when developed, the 5G antenna technology will stand as a “basic facility” for 6G technology in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gtu-team-takes-up-project-to-develop-5g-antennae/articleshow/83493626.cms||---

Both static and dynamic load tests of the bridges were done. As for Ambedkar bridge, the Garia-bound eastern flank was first closed, followed by the Science City-bound western flank for load test. With this, KMDA has now completed load test work of all flyovers and bridges maintained by them as of now. “With the load test work of all flyovers over as of now, detail project reports will now be prepared based on the load test reports as to how much repair and strengthening work needs to be done,” said a KMDA official, adding that the load test work of Chitpore bridge was conducted to assess its post repair structural strength. Police said that the load-testing at Ambedkar bridge this time was a simpler exercise as far as traffic movement was concerned, and the major relief was the completion of work at Chitpore bridge. “This will help us decongest the Shyambazar Crossing. Several smaller vehicles now don’t have to come up to Shyambazar from Sovabazar,” said a senior ACP. “At Ambedkar bridge, we will now get all flanks ready for vehicular movement. This is where a lot of VIP movement is taking place at Trinamool Bhawan,” an officer said. PWD sources said they expect the work on the Red Road culvert to be completed on time as well. “As work on one flank is over, we expect the other flank to be handed over to us by June 17,” said a senior traffic police officer. Meanwhile, KMDA sources hinted that repair works at the Baghajatin ROB and Kalighat bridge will be done without impacting traffic for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chitpore-ambedkar-bridges-to-be-opened-to-traffic-today/articleshow/83493652.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The accused were identified as Sreejith alias Sreejith Unni, 31, and Adarsh, 22. Both are residents of Thirumala. As many as 50 nitrazepam tablets and 100g of ganja were seized from them. The autorickshaw in which they travelled was also confiscated. Nitrazepam is a hypnotic drug which is commonly used in the treatment of the condition of insomnia. Substance abusers use this prescription drug as an affordable alternative to illegal narcotic drugs. Officials said that the accused were caught on Saturday night from Kundamanbhagam while transporting the substances in an autorickshaw. The Excise officials who were checking vehicles intercepted the auto and seized the substances. Excise circle inspector C K Anilkumar, who led the team that made the catch, said that the two accused tried to escape after attacking the officers. But they managed to overpower the duo and apprehend them. “Unni is a known criminal who has around 20 cases in his name at Poojapura police station. This include cases related to sexual abuse of minor, assault on cops and armed assaults on people,” the CI said. The accused were produced before the court on Sunday and were remanded in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-men-arrested-with-nitrazepam-tablets-ganja/articleshow/83493676.cms||---

The initiative was introduced by district collector Dr T Prabhushankar to facilitate people to air their grievances from their homes. The meet is scheduled to take place on Monday from 11 am to 2 pm. Citizens need to download BharatVC – an application developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC) of government of India from Google Play store on android mobile phones. They can join the grievance meeting by clicking the link - https://bharatvc.nic.in/viewer/7534956730. The district administration website has detailed instructions on how to join the meeting. Before Covid-19 pandemic, the weekly GDP meetings saw large gatherings at the collector office to submit grievance petitions from across the district. These meetings were called off by the state government in all districts to prevent spread of Covid-19. The officials said that while the online meeting will be a virtual simulation of the grievance day programme that we usually have every week on Monday, it will be an opportunity for people to directly interact with the collector. People willing to join the meeting must log in by 10:30 am and keep their queries short to facilitate more number of people to utilize the platform. “Initially, we thought of organising offline grievance meeting in primary agriculture cooperative society, which can accommodate more people. We then decided to have virtual meeting so that people can attend it from their homes,” officials said.  It can be operated with a very low bandwidth, which means one need not have high speed internet to attend the meeting. “A face-to-face interaction will give a sense of satisfaction to the public. We had a trial-run with our own staffs. The applications worked with even a minimal internet collection,” said the collector. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-dist-to-hold-grievance-day-meet-online/articleshow/83697103.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityThe India Meteorological Department had forecast light-to-moderate rain for Sunday, but only some parts of Delhi received very light rain. Meanwhile, the air quality improved to 'satisfactory'. Read AlsoDelhi may see earliest monsoon in 13 yearsIf the southwest monsoon, which is advancing at a rate faster than normal, hits Delhi on June 15, it will be the capital’s earliest monsoon in the last 13 years.According to IMD, Safdarjung observatory, the city’s base station, recorded 0.4mm of rainfall till 8.30 am on Sunday. Palam and Ayanagar reported 1.1mm and 3.6mm, respectively, from 8.30am to 5.30 pm. Some parts of the city also benefited from strong winds that provided a respite from the heat. The maximum temperature dipped to 35.2 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal, while the minimum temperature settled at 23.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “Conditions are favourable for a further advance of the southwest monsoon to Delhi on June 15.” The normal meteorological date for monsoon is June 27. Met department has predicted rain till June 18, but the intensity is likely to be more on June 15. “Light-to-moderate rain, along with gusty winds of 40-50 kmph, may be witnessed on Tuesday,” said a Met official. Meanwhile, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the capital was recorded at 83 in the ‘satisfactory’ category against 133 in the ‘moderate’ category on Saturday. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), a forecasting body under the union ministry of earth sciences, said: “The overall Delhi’s air quality has improved. Rain on Saturday led to an improvement in the air quality. The wind speed is forecast to stay high for the next three days and isolated rain is likely in Delhi. AQI is likely to improve and stay in the ‘satisfactory’ category for the next three days. However, the contribution of bigger particles is still significantly high in Delhi's air with a coarser versus finer particle ratio at 3:1, which normally remains around 1:1 in Delhi and the NCR region. This tends to suggest that fossil fuel emission generated particles are lesser and quickly dispersing, but dust-laden bigger particles are prevailing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/monsoon-er-than-later-date-with-rains-likely-in-two-days/articleshow/83493733.cms||---

The highlight of the documentary is its focus is on a serpent grove at Chevalamadam near Kilimanoor. The students struck on the idea of the the documentary after the general education department issued an instruction to all schools to celebrate the World Environment Day online. “During the pandemic, it is impossible to get all the students together and to conduct special programmes. So, we thought of making a documentary based on this year’s theme for World Environment Day. Besides teachers, two students of the school, Asin, a Class II student and Aamy, a pre-primary student also contributed in making the documentary a great success, said MC Abhilash, teacher, and Harithasena co-ordinator. The teachers of the School were thinking of a unique learning exercise to make the students aware of ‘Ecosystem Restoration’, which was this year’s theme for the World Environment Day. The theme reminded them of Chevalamadam village in Pazhayakunnumel panchayat. “Often as part of the environment day celebration, we used to plant tree saplings. But this time around, we wanted our children to experience something different. When we came to know about the theme, we decided to choose Chevalamadam village that had implemented the concept of ecosystem restoration years go,” said Abhilash. The serpent grove in the village, a miniature model of biodiversity, is a treasure house of varied herbs. Thanks to the protected grove and the water sources, which are more than 1,000 years old, the local climate is cool. According to studies conducted by the children, the water sources around the grove survive even in the harsh summer. Above all, the children were also excited to see the natural beauty of the grove. “We were cooped up in our houses for so long, so, I was happy to go out. The grove is home to many organisms, including butterflies and birds. Besides small trees, it contains big trees that are usually found in forests. And in the pond adjacent to the grove we can see tortoises and fishes too,” said Asin. By making a documentary on the grove, the teachers and students have brought to light how interestingly the biodiversity has been protected in a small village in an age when such ecosystems face threat from all corners. In fact, several activities carried out by the school show its firm commitment to protect the environment. The school has formed a club ‘Harithasena’ with an aim to nurture in young minds the importance of protecting the environment and conserving it for the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-docu-to-get-the-green-message-across/articleshow/83493729.cms||---

Forest officials also said that the wall is 5m from the high tide line and is therefore in violation of CRZ norms. Activities in and around turtle nesting sites have been restricted by the GCZMA to ensure safe nesting of Olive Ridley turtles on Agonda, Galgibaga, Mandrem and Morjim beaches. Following the complaint, GCZMA, in its meeting held on June 10, decided to ask its expert members to carry out inspection of the structure on Morjim beach and submit a report to the authority. Earlier this month, reports had emerged that fishermen had constructed a wall along the Morjim beach following the destruction caused by Cyclone Tauktae. The fishermen said that after sand erosion, there was fear that during high tide water levels may rise and cause destruction of fishermen’s canoes and gills left in huts on the beach. The fishermen alleged that they had not received support for shelters for their fishing gear from the government leaving it exposed to damage. They also said that rampant encroachments by hotels in the beach areas had also reduced the space available for fishermen for parking their canoes etc, affecting their livelihood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gczma-experts-to-inspect-wall-at-morjim-beach/articleshow/83495994.cms||---

The private agency (contractor) developing the project has now filed a case of arbitration, saying the delay in land acquisition between the landowners and the Delhi government has caused a loss to the tune of around Rs 310 crore since work for the project started, a source associated with the project said. “The project has already been delayed and several deadlines have been extended. Now, the development of the project will depend on how soon this case is resolved between Public Works Department (PWD) and the contractor,” the source associated with the project said on condition of anonymity. The Barapullah Phase-III elevated corridor project, which is being carried out by PWD under the Delhi government through a private construction firm, was started in 2015. The project has already missed three deadlines in 2017, 2018 and 2020.The hired agency had restarted construction work two months back for the redevelopment of a well in the middle of Yamuna river. However, the fresh dispute (between PWD and the contractor) over money has again halted the work.  Sources said that the dispute between the PWD and the hired agency began after a well, which was dug for setting pillars, collapsed due to heavy rains last year. ians||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/barapullah-ph-iii-project-faces-yet-another-roadblock/articleshow/83493771.cms||---

Jijo, son of Joseph of Jolly House, Irayimmanthura near Pulluvila, is the deceased. The Poovar police have registered a case on unnatural death and launched a probe following the incident. According to the police, the mishap occurred around pm on Sunday. Jijo had reached the beach along with friend Deepu. They stepped into the lake to take a dip. It is suspected that Jijo drowned after being trapped in a whirlpool. Since it was a region where the Neyyar joins the Arabian Sea, the phenomenon of whirlpool was common here. Jijo’s body was recovered almost an hour later by the personnel of fire and rescue services, the police officers of Poovar station said. It has to be noted that the two youths reached the beach while a complete lockdown was enforced on the weekend. Also, it was only a day ago, the district collector made an appeal to the people to stay away from beaches till Wednesday based on a weather forecast that predicted the sea would be rough. The collector had also forbidden fishermen from going to sea and requested the coastal residents to stay alert. The body of the deceased was shifted to the mortuary of Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/youth-drowns-in-backwaters-near-poovar/articleshow/83493749.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Collapsed span of Borim bridge hazard to vessels’||PANAJI: The portion of the 50-year-old non-functional Borim bridge, which collapsed on Saturday, has become an underwater obstruction and poses danger to vessels, said government authorities on Sunday. An advisory has been issued asking all vessels to stay away from the channel where the incident occurred. According to government officials, PWD, the electricity department and Captain of Ports are working to remove the 60m-long span and restore navigation along the channel. Officials said that along with the debris, an unused 33kVA electricity cable is dangling over the river and needs to be removed. The electricity cable was strung across the river on the 50-year-old bailey bridge at Borim. “We have stopped navigation as a precaution. A notice has been issued to mariners regarding navigational hazard,” said captain of ports James Braganza. Given the bad weather conditions and monsoon, movement of vessels is little to none and thus there is no major impact. The clearance operation has been hindered by the precarious nature of the bridge. “The bridge is very weak and it is dangerous for our people to go on top of that. The electricity cable is dead but we still need to remove it. If we go to pull the cable, the bridge may come down,” said an official with the power minister’s office. The bridge was in a dilapidated state and had been put out of use by the public works department (PWD) 15 years ago. Officials expect the weather to worsen on Monday with high wind speeds and heavy rain expected. This, said officials, may affect efforts to remove the unused dead electricity cable and the span that has collapsed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/collapsed-span-of-borim-bridge-hazard-to-vessels/articleshow/83495246.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Metro plays to gallery for Covid awareness||NEW DELHI: To raise awareness about the benefits of vaccination against Covid-19 among the more than 3,000 workers at its construction sites of the Phase IV project across NCR, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has started a unique initiative. Executive director (corporate communications) of DMRC, Anuj Dayal, said that as part of a week-long campaign, a series of nukkad nataks (street plays) targeting small groups with a limited number of workers, have been organised at the construction sites since last Wednesday. “Social distancing and all other protocols are being carefully ensured during these shows. Approximately 3,000 workers are expected to be covered under this awareness initiative,” he said. “Professional artists who work in commercial movies, TV shows and web series have been roped in to perform the nukkad nataks,” he added. Dayal said that since most of the workers come from states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, the shows are designed and written in different dialects spoken in rural parts of these states, so that the workers are able to understand it better. “Popular folk songs from these regions are being used in these shows where the actors also interact with the workers. Informative leaflets about vaccination benefits are also being distributed among the workers,” he said. “All relevant information about the benefits of vaccination have been compiled in a very lucid manner in Hindi,” he said. A short film will also be made and will be shared on social media accounts of DMRC, apart from being shared with the workers on mobiles so that it can reach a larger audience, he said. Dayal said that the number of workers is gradually increasing as the lockdown restrictions have been lifted. “DMRC contractors are in touch with the workers to create the necessary confidence in them for their return to work in safe working conditions. Those workers who stayed back during the lockdown were provided with accommodation, food and medical supplies as per requirement,” he said. “Vaccination drives have already been conducted at some of DMRC’s construction sites. DMRC authorities are in touch with the local administrations and private healthcare providers to organise more vaccination drives at construction sites,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metro-plays-to-gallery-for-covid-awareness/articleshow/83493817.cms||---

The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by D Kesavan, who sought a direction to remove the encroachments from the temple land at Thiruverumbur village to renovate the damaged part of the temple and its pond to preserve its sanctity. He also sought to take steps to conduct the chariot festival through the streets surrounding the temple. The bench observed that pursuant to an earlier direction of the court, a meeting was convened by the ASI with the executive officer of the temple and the encroachments have been enumerated. There are two categories of encroachments - encroachment of a property under the ASI and encroachment of properties under the control of the temple. The ASI was empowered to evict the encroachments by following the procedures under Public Premises Act and the temple authorities can initiate action under the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act. “The deity being a perpetual minor, its interest has to be protected by the court. Therefore, this court would be well justified in issuing a positive direction to remove the encroachments,” the judges said. This court can take judicial notice of the fact that whenever proceedings were initiated by the temple authorities to remove the encroachments, the encroachers dragged on the matter for several decades and continued to squat on the temple property. This should not be allowed to happen in the present case, the court said. The judges disposed of the petition by directing the ASI and the temple authorities to take steps to remove the encroachments from the temple land. Taking into account that the ASI has already initiated steps to renovate the temple, the judges directed it to complete the work expeditiously. The judges also directed the commissioner of HR and CE department to take all possible steps to ensure that the temple car perambulates in the car street as was done from time immemorial. The judges also directed the commissioner to monitor the temple land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/remove-encroachments-on-trichy-temple-land-hc-to-asi/articleshow/83493777.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Dehradun||Hoteliers, restaurateurs in Uttarakhand seek relaxations in Covid curfew so tourists can start visiting||NAINITAL: As yet another summer, which is the peak season for tourism in the hills, passed under lockdown-like restrictions, hoteliers have asked the state to do away with the weekend curfews and the restrictions on weekdays that are currently in place because of the ongoing Covid curfew in Uttarakhand. In Kumaon, hoteliers said that while tourists were ready to get RT-PCR tests done to visit the hill station, they did not want to come as long as shops remained closed most of the time. Restaurant owners also demanded that dining be allowed at 50-75% occupancy at least (under curfew norms, only home delivery is allowed). Speaking to TOI, Nainital hotels and restaurant association’s secretary, Ved Sah, said that the summer was already nearing its end and none of the hotels had opened because there were no tourists. “Most of the tourists in Nainital come from Delhi and NCR regions but due to strict Covid restrictions in the state, they do not want to travel. Even though some hotels have opened, barely one or two of their rooms have been booked,” Sah said. Sah said that hoteliers had met local officials and politicians, seeking a solution to the financial strain on the tourism industry, Uttarakhand’s mainstay, but to no avail. “Even though our hotels are closed, we have been paying all the bills and taxes for their upkeep. There is no respite. Now if another summer goes without tourists, not many of us will be able to stay afloat,” he said. Last week, shop owners, hoteliers and boat operators had held a demonstration in Mallital, where they begged for money. The protest was against the ongoing Covid curfew in Uttarakhand, which allows shops to open for fixed hours on select days. The traders said if this continues, tourists will never come to Uttarakhand and they will be forced to beg. Speaking to TOI, Kishan Singh Negi, head of Mallital Vyapar Mandal, said, “For the last two seasons, hoteliers, restaurant owners, shopkeepers or even boat owners have not earned anything. We have borrowed money that we cannot repay. We simply cannot survive if this situation continues.” Hoteliers in Mussoorie also said that it is high time the government steps in to ensure the tourism industry gets back on its feet. “The tourism and hospitality industry has been bearing the brunt of the pandemic for two consecutive peak summer seasons. It needs some support to revive. We hope that the government will come up with some practical solutions to protect the livelihoods which depend on tourism in our state,” said Sandeep Sahni, president of Hotels and Restaurants Association of Uttarakhand. Shopkeepers in the queen of hills also said that the curfew must end so business can start to get back on track. A trader who did not wish to be named, said, “The lockdowns last year and this year have had a devastating impact on our livelihoods. It is high time that the curfew is withdrawn, so that our lives and livelihoods are back on track.” A statewide Covid curfew was imposed in Uttarakhand early last month, allowing shops to open for limited periods of time on select days. The curfew will be in place till June 15.

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Plea against laying concrete lining in Grand Anicut canal||MADURAi: Madras high court has sought the state government's response in a plea against laying concrete lining at Grand Anicut canal and its branch canals, saying it would affect the percolation of groundwater. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation filed by R Prakash, a resident of Thanjavur district. The petitioner stated that the project for extension, renovation and modernisation of the Grand Anicut canal had commenced in February. The plan was to lay a concrete bed lining in Grand Anicut for about 148.43km and in branch canals for about 636km in Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts. He stated that the main objective of the project was to improve the water carrying capacity and irrigation efficiency. At present, nearly 20% of the works were complete and it was only now that the farmers and general public came to know that the process undertaken affected the infiltration process thereby hampering the increase in ground water level. He stated that the project of laying concrete lining would affect the groundwater level in the area. The percolation contributes to the recharge of groundwater in both shallow well and deep borewells used by the population to obtain water for drinking and agriculture purposes. Hence, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench seeking to remove the concrete lining and restore the canals to its original state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-against-laying-concrete-lining-in-grand-anicut-canal/articleshow/83493789.cms||---

SUV nosedives into 43-ft well as ground caves in||MUMBAI: Mumbai: An SUV fell into a 43-foot-deep well in Ghatkopar on Sunday morning, creating huge waves on social media as a video of the incident went viral. The spot where the car had been parked was once the mouth of a well that was now covered. While no one was injured, a young man — the SUV owner’s son — who was to get into the vehicle in some time had a lucky escape. The concrete surface that covered the well caved in, said officials. The SUV was extricated about 12 hours later — around 9pm — by using a crane. The traffic police were the first to reach the location. "We believed that the incident had occurred on a street and would cause traffic congestion. On reaching there, we discovered it was private property," said an official. Police said the building, Ramnivas Society, down Cama Lane, had been constructed years ago. “A portion of the well was covered with concrete and was used as a parking space by building residents. Due to excessive rainfall over the past few days and, probably, the weight of the vehicle, the concrete portion caved in around 9 am,” said an official. A statement put out by the BMC mentioned that their staff would help pump out water from the well. "The society has been asked to ensure that the car is removed and the portion over the well is cordoned off,” the statement added. The owner of the SUV, Dr Kiran Doshi, resides in the building and runs a nursing home in Ghatkopar (east). He said that a helper who washes cars alerted him about the vehicle teetering. Doshi rushed outside. “But before we could get to the car, it fell into the well which is about 100-150 years old,” said Dr Doshi. The car had been purchased four months ago. "We have got submersible pumps from the BMC to take out the water. We have also called for a crane to take the car out. "Doshi's son takes the car to travel to work everyday. "On Sunday, he was about to leave home and take the SUV just before it sank," said inspector Nagraj Majage, Ghatkopar traffic police. An insurance expert said that based on the policy taken, the owner can claim insurance. “Based on the policy taken, the owner can claim insurance once the car is removed and cost of repairs are calculated. It all depends on whether the car can be salvaged and the type of insurance,” an insurance expert said. BMC officials said that several housing societies in Mumbai have wells inside their compounds. “The BMC’s insecticide department gives permissions. Every such well has to be covered to prevent mosquito breeding,” said an official.

Petitioner M Ramaiah, 81, had sought a direction to TNSTC to take appropriate steps for government buses plying on Madurai-Tenkasi road to stop at Mangalapuram. The standing counsel appearing for TNSTC submitted that they have received a complaint that certain buses did not stop at the bus stop because of certain unscrupulous drivers and conductors. The transport corporation would issue a direction to stop all the buses at the bus stop. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi directed TNSTC to ask all drivers and conductors operating buses on the route to stop at the bus stop. It said this may be discreetly verified and in case of any violation, stringent disciplinary action initiated. The judges directed TNSTC to inform the concerned trade union of the employees about the order and that if there is any violation, they will be proceeded against departmentally. People of Mangalapuram were at liberty to bring any violation of the order to the notice of the TNSTC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-stc-to-ensure-buses-stop-at-mangalapuram/articleshow/83493815.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Leader of Opposition in Uttarakhand assembly, Indira Hridayesh, 80, dies in Delhi||NAINITAL: Leader of Opposition in the Uttarakhand Assembly Indira Hridayesh passed away after suffering a cardiac arrest in New Delhi on Sunday morning. She was 80. The senior Congress leader and MLA from Haldwani had attended a meeting chaired by party in-charge for Uttarakhand on June 12 and was staying at Uttarakhand Sadan. Her son Sumit Hridayesh said that she had "collapsed" and doctors confirmed "cardiac arrest". Indira Hridayesh had tested positive for Covid-19 in September, and had recovered in a few weeks. She had also undergone a heart surgery. A senior Congress leader told TOI that Hridayesh had gone to Delhi along with state president Pritam Singh to "chalk out the strategy for next year's assembly elections". "She was in good health. Her death has come as a huge surprise for all of us,” the leader said. Tributes poured in from across the political spectrum through the day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi condoled her death. "Dr Indira Hridayesh Ji was at the forefront of several community service efforts. She made a mark as an effective legislator and also had rich administrative experience. Saddened by her demise. Condolences to her family and supporters. Om Shanti," the PM said in a tweet. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called her "a strong pillar of the party in Uttarakhand and she kept working for the Congress fraternity and the people till the very end". "Today we have lost a persistent leader, beloved representative and a guardian," said Priyanka Gandhi, the party's general secretary. Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat expressed his grief at her death, while former CM Harish Rawat said it is an "irreparable loss for the country and the state". Several other politicians from the state also sent their condolences. Her son, who in a social media post thanked people for their support, said, “She had attended several meetings in Haldwani, and had been working with the party leaders and cadres. None of us had thought that she would leave us like this.” Born in 1941, Hridayesh was the state finance minister from 2012 to 2017. She also held the portfolios of parliamentary affairs, higher education and planning in the Congress government led by Harish Rawat. Hridayesh’s body was kept at Uttarakhand Sadan for leaders to pay their homage. Her body was brought to Haldwani at 9:15pm on Sunday for cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/leader-of-opposition-in-uttarakhand-assembly-indira-hridayesh-80-dies-in-delhi/articleshow/83492395.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Raid on home bakery in Malad selling weed brownies, 3 held||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday raided a home bakery at Orlem, Malad, and busted a gang involved in selling weed or marijuana brownies. Three persons, including a 20-year-old collegian and her 19-year-old boyfriend, have been arrested for making and selling the baked goodies containing the banned narcotic substance in what appears to be the first such case in the city. Sources in the NCB said they got a tip-off that weed pot cakes or brownies, said to be popular on the party circuit, were being baked and sold from a flat. “We busted the marijuana/pot cake-making bakery and seized 830 gm edible weed pot brownie and 160 gm marijuana and arrested three persons,” said a senior NCB officer. While Elston alias Fernandes and his girlfriend, who is pursuing BBA, were arrested during the raid, the NCB on Sunday arrested alleged drug supplier Jagat Chaurasia from Bandra and recovered 125 gm marijuana from his possession. NCB sources said Fernandes and his girlfriend had been running the racket for the past one year. “Chaurasia would supply the drugs and they would prepare the weed brownies or pot cakes at the bakery. The woman and her boyfriend also advertised the products on social media. The woman’s father owned the Malad flat. We have sealed the bakery, which was functioning from one of the rooms in the flat,” said the officer. The price of the pot cakes varied depending on the customer. Most of the buyers were college students, added the officer. Officials stated the case points to a new trend among youngsters of consuming the drug by mixing and baking ‘brownie weed pot’ cakes. Investigators are now focusing on tracking down buyers. “A cannabis edible or weed brownie is a food product that contains cannabis extract as an active ingredient. Cannabis edibles may have a more potent effect as compared to smoking it,” an officer said. Examples of cannabis-infused foods include baked goods, candy, potato chips, and more. “One may not be able to distinguish between regular baked goods and those containing cannabinoids, which tend to have a slightly green tinge and emit only a faint odour of cannabis,” he said. The NCB team was led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-raid-on-home-bakery-in-malad-selling-weed-brownies-3-held/articleshow/83495251.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Chandigarh||HP dams dry: Power supply may be hit||Patiala: Low water levels in Bhakra Dam’s reservoirs may impact power generation and irrigation requirements of partner states of BBMB, including Punjab and Haryana. Water level at the reservoir is 48 feet less than last year’s level at the corresponding time. The reservoir level on Sunday was 1,514 feet against last year’s level of 1,562 feet on the same day last year. At Pong Dam, the water level is 1,291 feet. Llast year, the level was 1,338 feet. Water level at Ranjit Sagar dam is 1,660 feet, which is 26 feet less when compared to last year’s level of 1,686 feet. Punjab gets about 4,000 million units of power from powerhouses on the Bhakra dam, but this may reduce to 2,800 million units this year. Though low water level is expected to hit power generation at Bhakra, PSPCL director (generation) Paramjeet Singh said, “BBMB officials have assured they would release enough water to meet the demands of power generation in accordance to our share.” According to experts, there is likely a shortage of about 1,200 million units during the paddy season. Against a schedule of about 1500 million units for till date in the current fiscal, the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) has generated 1,200 million units, accounting for a reduction of about 20%. Daily generation at Bhakra is 120 lakh units, which is two-third of last year’s daily generation of about 180 lakh units per day. Punjab is being supplied with about 13,000 cusecs water and Haryana and Rajasthan receive 10,000 cusecs each. A senior official said water is being released as per requirement and there are no restrictions. Paddy season in Punjab started on June 10 and it is due from June 15 in Haryana. Normal monsoon has been predicted in the country and any deviation to below normal may increase state problems. Vinod Gupta, AIPEF spokesperson, said, “Deficient snow and rainfall during the preceding winters have been cited as the reason for low water storage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hp-dams-dry-power-supply-may-be-hit/articleshow/83493862.cms||Bharat Khanna

One such technique employs plastic waste in roadworks. Activists said Pune Municipal Corporation should follow in the footsteps of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, which has made reusing plastic waste for road construction mandatory. PMC officials said they were promoting reuse of plastic and plan to increase its usage. “Only completing a few patches of roads will not be of any help. The civic body should make sure that adequate research and ground work is done,” Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch said. He said the civic administration should monitor road digging and repairs even if roads are made more durable with plastic waste. “The state’s directives are being followed. PMC has been reusing plastic for roadworks, mostly for bigger thoroughfares. We will also explore the possibility of using plastic waste for smaller projects. Technical expertise will be sought to use such innovative solutions for creation of better roads and substantial reuse of plastic,” additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemnar said. “The use of plastic in road construction has proved to be effective. Organisations like the BMC and Public Works Department (PWD) have been using it on a large scale,” Shirish Phadtare, an expert on plastic recycling, said. According to PMC, plastic in different forms accounts for almost 5% of municipal solid waste and is toxic in nature. Due to its poor biodegradability, it poses significant environmental hazard. In order to contain this problem, experiments have been carried out to check whether plastic waste can be reused productively in the construction of roads, officials said. As per experts, around 4-6kg of plastic is used with around 100kg of bitumen to make roads. Atudies show adding about 5-10% of plastic helps substantially improve the stability, strength, fatigue life and other desirable properties of bituminous mix. It leads to improved longevity and pavement performance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-urge-pmc-to-use-plastic-waste-for-roadworks/articleshow/83492418.cms||---

This has been prescribed as content handling, processing and moderation is a domain of the headquarters in the US for these companies, while their subsidiaries — such as in India — are mainly tasked with advertising, marketing and promotional activities. The officers also need to be residents of India, and have to have a local postal address. “They need to be in the local time zone, and not operate from any overseas location, including the US,” sources told TOI. The new rules have ordered the companies to appoint three statutory officers in India for coordinating the gamut of content-related activities, and liaison with the government and their users/subscribers. While the chief compliance officer shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the IT Act and Rules, the duty of the nodal contact person will be to ensure 24x7 coordination with law-enforcement agencies. The job of the grievance officer will be to handle complaints of users around content, and that person will be the local face of the HQs in India with the public at large.  According to the mandate under the new IT rules for intermediaries, the companies were asked to appoint the officers in India by May 26. While there was initially some reluctance and a delay in their appointment, most companies are now compliant (some such as Twitter have made contractual appointments for now as they look for permanent recruits). The government believes that having representatives of the HQs in India will help in better coordination on content-related queries and demands, as previously there have been numerous cases of “inordinate delays” due to lack of direct coordination with the team in charge of content.  “Previously, all the requests were being sent to the Indian offices, which couldn’t do much as they did not have any say on content-related matters. They would generally pass on the government or user complaints to the HQs which would take its own time in taking a decision. This would delay the whole process of compliance and any possible remedial action by days, and even weeks,” a source said. When contacted, a spokesperson for Twitter refused to comment. “We do not have any comment to offer at this time.” A spokesperson for Google and YouTube said, “As applicable to us under the new IT rules, we have appointed three officers in India.” Questions sent to Facebook and its group companies WhatsApp and Instagram did not get any formal response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/social-media-companies-statutory-officers-must-be-on-hq-roll/articleshow/83498555.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Chandigarh||Delay alleged in releasing body of +ve prisoner||Sangrur: A family from Haryana’s Jind had to run from pillar to post in Sangrur district in Punjab to get the dead body of their 71-year-old Covid-positive relative who was facing jail term and was lodged in Sangrur special jail. Alleging red-tapism, the family of deceased claimed that confusion of health officials over the decision to carry out postmortem of Covid deceased identified as Ram Kumar, delayed the matter.  The senior health officials claimed that it was probably the first case in which the postmortem of Covid deceased has been carried out in Punjab, as he was brought from jail and facing imprisonment. The health officials revealed that permission of SMO of government hospital concerned and judicial magistrate is required to conduct postmortem of custodial death but in this case, the deceased was a Covid patient. According to government guidelines, the postmortem of Covid dead bodies are not carried out and thus, the permission from health director was sought in this case. Dr G B Singh, health director of Punjab said, “I have recommended and granted permission to the health authorities in Sangrur to carry out postmortem. It is probably the first case in which postmortem of Covid deceased has been carried out as it was a case of custodial death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delay-alleged-in-releasing-body-of-ve-prisoner/articleshow/83493892.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid restrictions lead to case drop||KOLKATA: Ever since the Covid restrictions were imposed on May 16, there has been a steady and sharp drop in the number of new cases, deaths and positivity rate in Bengal and Kolkata, indicating without doubt that the peak of the second wave is over and the state has endured the worst in this phase. While Bengal had 19,117 new cases and recorded 147 deaths on May 16 — the first day of restrictions — number of new cases has slid to 4,286 and deaths to 81 on June 12. The decline has been just as sharp in Kolkata during the period. While the city recorded 3,451 new cases and 33 deaths on May 16, the figures dropped to 401 and 14, respectively on June 12. The decline in positivity rate in Bengal has been even more dramatic. It has dropped from 29.7% on May 16 to 6.8% on June 12. Number of tests, however, has remained steady at over 60,000 a day. While doctors and experts have heaved a sigh of relief at the wane of Covid over the last one month, they warn that the lifting of restrictions has to be gradual, guarded and strictly according to rules being followed worldwide. “It’s still too early to lift all the bars and they should, in fact, remain in place till at least October. The restrictions have been successful, though it was imposed late. Now that we have the situation under control, we shouldn’t let it go,” said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. He added that the withdrawal of public transport in Kolkata along with intra-state and inter-state travel has curbed transmission effectively. “This is the only way and we had done it last year as well which helped us keep the number of casualties low. If we can stick to some restrictions till October, we would be in a better position even if the third wave strikes in November,” added Sarkar. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) consultant Arindam Biswas agreed. He added that gatherings should not be allowed for the next few months and tests should go on. “Once congregations are allowed, transmission will return and there could be a revival of the second wave. More importantly, the number of tests should remain the same since this will help to detect if the virus is mutating. We need to guard against it,” said Biswas. He added that gatherings, too, could help the virus to mutate. “The more transmission happens, the higher are the chances of the virus mutating and affecting even those who are vaccinated,” said Biswas. But unlocking can’t be prevented over the next few weeks, felt a public health expert. “It will happen and the challenge for the authorities and the people is to take a lesson from the previous two waves and make sure that we don’t repeat the mistakes. Social distancing and masks were almost discarded during the latter half of the first half,” he said. Sarkar felt that the speed and extent of lifting restrictions should depend on the rate of vaccination. “If we can vaccinate more consistently and faster, only then can we afford to lift restrictions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-restrictions-lead-to-case-drop/articleshow/83492445.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Pune||PMPML gears up to convert midi bus fleet from diesel-run to CNG||PUNE: With the prices of petrol and diesel at an all-time high, the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) plans to convert 233 of its diesel-run mid-sized buses to CNG, officials have said. Rajendra Jagtap, chairman and managing director of PMPML told TOI that talks pertaining to the conversion had been initiated with Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd (MNGL) and Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). “We have written to PMC and MNGL. The cost of converting the buses into the CNG variant can be recovered within a year,” Jagtap said. On Sunday, a litre of diesel in the city cost Rs 92.61, the highest ever in Pune. The price of a litre of petrol stood at Rs 101.96. “The switch will ensure that the bus’s engine life extends beyond 10 years and the operational cost reduces. Also, CNG is an eco-friendly fuel and it will reduce pollution levels drastically. Our calculations show that we will be able to recover the conversion cost within a year,” Jagtap added. Presently, while PMPML runs 815 CNG buses, an additional 806 buses are run by private contractors for the transport body. In addition, the fleet consists of 233 diesel-run midi buses, 327 standard diesel-run buses and 150 electric buses. “For a decade, the civic body’s environment department has been providing assistance to autorickshaw owners, who want to convert their vehicles to CNG, and they can easily help us with the plan. There are two options — one in which MNGL does the conversion for us and recovers from difference in price and the other under which PMC pays for the conversion,” Jagtap pointed out. Meanwhile, the transport body said that around 40% buses will start plying on city roads from Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-gears-up-to-convert-midi-bus-fleet-from-diesel-run-to-cng/articleshow/83492439.cms||Joy Sengupta

Over the last one year, different organizations representing parents have been formed to take up issue related to school fees. Mohd Shahid Sharif, one of the education activists present there, said, “Recently, the state government has reduced RTE reimbursements by 50%. I believe it has been done because even government knows that schools are not incurring as much expenses as before. Similarly, we are demanding that a minimum 50% fee reduction must be done by all schools.” Sandeep Agrawal, who too represents a parents group, alleged that authorities are in cahoots with school managements. “It has become clear that the government administration is serving the interest of private school managements rather than of parents. We have been raising this issue since a long time and it’s but natural that fee should be reduced. Also, many schools are forcing parents to buy books from campus, which is illegal,” said Agrawal. Parents from different schools were present in black attire, to mark their protest visually too. Banners were displayed with school names and demands to reduce the fee. Sharif said, “Schools are not following Parents-Teachers Association forming norms and that’s why school fees are being increased arbitrarily. We want the government to ensure that schools function in a transparent way, just like a charitable organization. Instead, commercialization of education has become the norm. We shall continue with our protests at different levels to ensure that parents get relief,” said Sharif.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-protest-seek-50-cut-in-school-fees/articleshow/83493891.cms||---

Makwana left home taking along his wife Kajal (26) and daughter Niyati on June 11 afternoon. According to Rajkot taluka police, his elder brother Kiran approached the cops on Sunday after he recovered Vijay’s suicide note from his home. Cops said Makwana left behind a five-page suicide note in which he addressed three pages to the police commissioner and two pages to JP Jadeja.Cops said that Makwana, who ran tuition classes in the city earlier, had entered into construction business seven years ago along with his brother and they had constructed a high-rise building on Kalavad Road a few years ago. However, facing fund shortage, Makwana took a bank loan and also borrowed around Rs 2.5 crore from JP Jadeja, a well-known builder in the city. He had also reportedly given 30% share in his newly constructed building to Jadeja and was also paying him interest regularly till last few months, the family told cops.“For the last few months, Makwana was unable to repay the bank loan. Meanwhile, Jadeja allegedly wanted to grab the under-construction building and was not allowing Makwana to sell the flats. Makwana also started receiving notices from the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) as well as from the bank and blamed Jadeja for the stalemate and left home with his family,” police sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/missing-builder-left-behind-suicide-note/articleshow/83492505.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Road through Corbett-Rajaji corridor will disrupt tiger habitats||DEHRADUN: Cutting through the heart of the lone wildlife corridor connecting the Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves, a 4.7-km road threatens one of the most productive habitats of tigers and elephants in the country. The project had been stalled since 2019 for not having clearances or over exemptions the state wanted, but has now been approved by the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) though an inspection team it sent had recommended “avoiding” the project as the best mitigation strategy. The entire road is meant to connect two points in the forest patch, Laldhang and Chilarkhal, a release from the chief minister’s office on Friday said. But the plan has worried environmentalists and activists for two broad reasons — the construction itself will disrupt wildlife habitat and migration routes, and the increased traffic will disturb tigers, elephants, leopards, deer and other ungulates who inhabit these forests. “The grasslands from the Himalayan foothills, the Terai delta, that extend from Corbett to Palamu in Jharkhand and beyond to Assam are the productive habitat for tigers and large ungulates in all of Asia. Tiger populations reach their highest densities in these rich habitats, especially like Corbett and Kaziranga,” said leading tiger conservationist K Ullas Karanth. Social activist Reenu Paul, who has been fighting several cases against the Uttarakhand forest department, said, “The (Centre’s) Elephant Task Force in 2010 had identified this forest patch as one of five high-priority landscapes for conservation of elephants. The Wildlife Trust of India had listed this stretch among elephant corridors of significance in its Right of Passage report (in 2017).” Part of this forest falls under the NTCA’s Tiger Conservation Plan area, which prohibits any land use change. In July 2019, the Supreme Court had pulled up the Uttarakhand government for starting work on the road without clearances from the Union environment ministry and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). In December that year, the standing committee of the NBWL gave a clearance but with riders to ensure wildlife safety, which the state requested be altered, but the NBWL rejected that plea in October last year. The state brought it up again this year, the NBWL agreed to review it and set up an inspection committee with members from the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the Wildlife Institute of India, the National Highways Authority of India and the state forest department. The committee, which visited the forest construction site in March, listed five major effects of the road upgrade — habitat loss and fragmentation, disturbance of environment which would render habitats unsuitable for various species, death of animals by moving vehicles, disruption of wildlife connectivity, barriers to animals’ movement. “Connectivity of the eastern Uttarakhand and Terai landscape will be severed with western part of Uttarakhand and Rajaji tiger reserve. Long-term viability of tiger and elephant population in western Uttarakhand will be in question,” the inspection committee report said. “Whole traffic of Kumaon area and other major cities in central-eastern and eastern parts of the state would be diverted to this road due to its shorter distance and to avoid taxes levied in the state of Uttar Pradesh,” it added. It concluded, “Therefore, it is decided to adopt avoidance as the best mitigation strategy.” If not, it further said, the road alignment should be elevated and if even that could not be done, it proposed a detailed mitigation plan which recommends underpasses or overpasses, no felling of trees and no night traffic, among others. Environmentalists raised the same concerns. “Passage of traffic through this stretch, on a single-lane road, will cause jams and not allow animals to pass,” said Dr Sandeep Kumar Tiwari, programme manager of IUCN Asian Elephant Specialist Group. The state, however, said the road has to be built. State forest minister Harak Singh Rawat told TOI, “The road is essential. A committee set up by the state found that some people died on their way to hospitals because they had to take long routes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/road-through-corbett-rajaji-corridor-will-disrupt-tiger-jumbo-habitats-fragment-numbers/articleshow/83492473.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Schools prepare for yet another online session||Nagpur: With the new academic session all set to begin from the last week of June, schools seem to have accepted the fact that online schooling was not just a ‘stop gap’ arrangement. Though unlocking has started at various levels, it’s very unlikely schools will reopen any time soon. This also means teachers will have to continue with online classes longer.Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir in Gandhibagh, said this year all schools will be better prepared for the online platform. “Now all teachers have got experience with online teaching and so this coming session won’t be a very big challenge. Teaching methodology will evolve because now we know how to manage class timings and assess children online,” said Tiwari. He added that the ‘lesson plan’ is the key for online classes. “Lesson plan is basically strategizing how to cover syllabus in how many classes and its assessment. For online classes, this becomes a bigger challenge because time management becomes a big issue due to technical difficulties,” said Tiwari.The digital learning divide created last year, between the haves and have-nots, may not be as wide this time, feels Premlata Tiwari, principal of Bhola High School. “Our teachers have identified how many children don’t have access to mobile phones and have started working towards a solution. Teachers will also be looking to mentor kids residing near their residence so that if any doubts are there, it can be clarified easily, plus a physical follow up may also be taken,” said Tiwari. Razia Sultana, principal of Anjuman High School & Junior College, said this time parents will also be included in future teaching strategy. “Last year, a lot of students took things lightly because the attitude was that everyone will pass. The cancellation of board exams, based on health concerns, has reinforced that view. But in the year going ahead, it’s important that parents become active and equal stakeholders in their child’s education if online classes have to be a success,” said Sultana. She added that meritorious students are the ones suffering the most. “Those who wanted to chart out their future with JEE, NEET etc are stuck badly because of exam dates not being declared yet. It’s such kids who have had to deal with online classes throughout 2020-21 session and now the uncertainty over competitive exams,” said Sultana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/schools-prepare-for-yet-another-online-session/articleshow/83493974.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Did any other person protect the accused or give them information about the girl?” said a police official. The cops will also try to ascertain if the accused Dishant Kahar and Nazeem Mirza had done similar crime with any other girl in the past. “The accused had deleted their chats with the girl. We will recover them to find out if they coaxed the girl and took advantage of her circumstances. It is also possible that they may have photos of the girl in objectionable condition when they committed the rape. They may have kept a back-up of the pics,” the police added. Cops said that the accused may have destroyed some evidence too. The investigators are also questioning the accused about the source from where they had got the liquor.

---||Mumbai||Class IX boy from Rajasthan booked for flashing in e-classroom||MUMBAI: A 15-year-old schoolgoer from Rajasthan was booked after he entered online coding classes hosted by an ed-tech platform and flashed female instructors. Police said the class IX student is the son of an armyman and is well-versed with computers. The series of flashing incidents were reported between February 15 and March 2. The coding class had free entry and participants were asked to provide only their phone numbers and email addresses. "The boy provided fake mobile numbers and email IDs close to 50 times, though he may not have flashed each time," an officer said. The coding instructors were at their wits' end and had contemplated shutting down the class. On March 30, an FIR was registered at the Sakinaka police station. "At least two of the instructors harassed are from Mumbai while the others are from different parts of the country," said DCP Maheshwar Reddy. Through technical surveillance methods, the cops discovered that the accused was located in Rajasthan. A team, led by sub-inspector Sunita Bhosle, visited the state last month. After hitting a few dead ends, they tracked down the accused's address. But it turned out he didn't live there anymore. While the police team was in Rajasthan, another incident of flashing was reported in an online coding class on May 30. This time, the team hit the right note and tracked the accused's location to Jaisalmer. "The boy admitted to flashing online and said he did it "just for the heck of it," said senior inspector Balwant Deshmukh. The youngster would use a store room for the offence. "On examining his laptop, we found that he had taken measures to guard its IP address from getting tracked. Copious notes about hacking were also found. His phones have also been seized for analysis," an officer said. "The boy was careful to never show his face on screen. But on one occasion, he had been trying to hide from the camera when the instructor managed to click a screenshot of his background. The image helped us in the probe," said an officer. The police team encountered hostility and faced a lot of pressure to drop the probe while they were in Rajasthan. They produced the youngster before a local children's court which sent him to an observation home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-class-ix-boy-from-raj-booked-for-flashing-in-e-classroom/articleshow/83495301.cms||Nitasha Natu

The inspection, which is to be carried out under the additional collector as per the authorities directives, will have a representative of the water resources department, a field surveyor of the GCZMA, a mamlatdar, and an official of the directorate of land survey and records. While the owner of the property has said that it has permission to carry out repairs of the anti-erosion structure, the Vainguinim residents claim that the wall is an entirely new structure and being constructed out of a material which will be ecologically damaging to the beach. The GCZMA has said that the inspection should ascertain whether the wall is as per the permission granted in 2017 to the hotel for construction of the anti-erosion structure. The dimensions of the construction, the location of the wall that was earlier standing on the beach, and the distance from the high tide line are some of the aspects which will be verified during the inspection. Cement concrete has been used as against eco-friendly material. Moreover, cement concrete structures are prohibited on the beach, that too within the intertidal zone that is a highly ecologically fragile area. “The ongoing linear wall construction is a new work, and not ‘repairs’, as permitted under the NOC,” the complainants said. The GCZMA has also asked its expert members to visit the authority’s office and verify all the documents placed on record by the complainant and the hotel. While the hotel has said that it has permission to carry out repairs of the anti-erosion structure, the Vainguinim residents claim that the wall is an entirely new structure and being constructed out of a material which will be ecologically damaging to the beach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gczma-orders-inspection-of-vainguinim-wall/articleshow/83496107.cms||---

It will issue equity shares and convertible warrants to Reliance Infrastructure, which will see its stake in Reliance Power rise to 38% from the current 9%. The boards of Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure approved the capital plan on Sunday. Reliance Power will issue 60 crore equity shares and 73 crore convertible warrants to Reliance Infrastructure at Rs 10 each, which is a discount to its last closing price of Rs 13 on Friday. The entire capital raised will be used to retire Reliance Power’s debt, which stands at Rs 25,000 crore. A week ago, Reliance Infrastructure had announced plans to raise Rs 551 crore from its promoters and international private equity fund Varde Partners. Reliance Infrastructure’s stake in Reliance Power will increase to 25% after the equity share issuance and will further go up to 38% on conversion of warrants into equity.  Reliance Power’s board also approved two other fundraising proposals — issuance of foreign currency convertible bonds and issuance of equity shares with or without warrants via qualified institutions placement (QIP).

Moreover, the village is also constituency of Mahrashtra Vikas Aghadi’s minister of state Abdul Sattar as well as union minister Raosaheb Danve. The hamlet comprises members of Bhatka Joshi community which falls under nomadic tribe category. Community members claim that still about 95% community’s population sustains on alms, grains collected by going door to door as well as by telling horoscope. Community’s first gram panchayat member Gajanan Gadai told TOI, “For the past 30 years, the Rajput community dominated the village and they have been objecting to the electrification of our hamlet.” He alleged that the village, politically as well as in population, is dominated by members of Rajput community and they have always opposed to the settling of Bhatka Joshi community in the village. He said that several communication have been made to the electricity board, district collector, state as well as union government, but issue is far from resolved. About four decades back, four families belonging to this landless community reached this village and settled on the state-owned grazing land. Their number grew over a period of years and as on date there are 40 families comprising about 200 people residing there. Community leader Vishnu Muke said, “Three years back, Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that electricity has reached every village. We don’t know about other parts of the country, but despite making all the efforts, electricity connection has never reached Bharadvasti.” Villagers have unanimously maintained that due to lack of absence of power supply, those owning the phone have to go to the village locality and get the cellphones charged. “For about 40 years I have been cooking in lamp and for past several years kids are studying in the light of lamp. If there is power failure in your cities for 10 minutes, there is so much outrage. Imagine, what not we have been through in these years, said Suman Nikalje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sillod-village-awaits-power-connection-for-over-3-decades/articleshow/83487354.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Only 11 deaths were reported in the day with five districts – Bhandara, Wardha, Gondia, Gadchiroli and Yavatmal reporting zero deaths. Chandrapur, Akola and Amravati reported a death each; Washim 2, Buldhana 3 and Nagpur 3. Out of 3 deaths in Nagpur, 2 are of the patients referred from other states, which means only 1 death was reported in Nagpur district. Deaths in rural Maharashtra have gone down too, which is a very comforting factor. Out of 33,075 tests conducted in last 24 hours, 448 tested positive in Vidarbha. Eight districts reported less than 50 new cases, with four of them reporting less than 20. In all, cases have gone down significantly across the region. On the other hand, 1,304 patients recovered in a day. Now, out of 10,93,147 total cases in the region, 10,63,011 have recovered which means the recovery rate is 97.24%. Number of under treatment patients reached below 9,000 which means now less than 0.80% of total cases reported till date in Vidarbha are under treatment. Most of the districts in Vidarbha have offered relaxations under ‘break the chain’ notifications now. As a result, there could be a spike in new cases in next two months. The administration is taking careful steps to continue the good show. Wardha: With 17 people testing positive out of 1,736 samples, the casetally went up to 49,023. There were 27 recoveries, taking the total to 48,658 and leaving 365 patients under treatment. No death was reported and the toll remains at 1,314.

---||Nagpur||5k staffers of state corporations on strike from June 16||Nagpur: At least 5,000 officials and employees of five state-owned corporations, including the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), will go on an indefinite strike from June 16 to demand implementation of VII Pay Commission recommendations. The striking employees belong to Maharashtra Seeds Corporation Limited, Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation, Western Maharashtra Development Corporation and Maharashtra State Marketing Federation. Till June 16, when the strike will be launched officially, the employees will work by sporting black ribbons.Ajay Patil, central president of Maharashtra State Forest Development Corporation Employees Sanghatana, said, “During budget session of the assembly in March, the MVA government had announced to implement VII Pay Commission recommendations for state-owned corporation employees but the decision has not been brought into force.”An action committee formed on the issue in May had submitted a memorandum to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to honour the government decision. As it has failed to implement the recommendations, a notice has been issued for an indefinite strike.FDCM managing director N Vasudevan told TOI that they are trying to convincing the employees to withdraw proposed strike as already many working days have been lost due to Covid-19. “The strike will further cripple work. It is a policy matter and the state will have to take a final decision,” said Vasudevan.Patil said, “This is kharif season, which is the main agricultural activity in the state. Most of the striking employees of these corporations deal with farming activity like distribution of seeds and foodgrains. The protection and plantation work of FDCM, which has 3.50 lakh hectare forest area in its possession, will also be affected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5k-staffers-of-state-corporations-on-strike-from-june-16/articleshow/83493997.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Retired Mumbai professor spruces up forest protection hut in hubby’s memory||In a unique gesture, Prafullata Chawathe (77), a retired professor of mathematics from Mumbai University’s Kalina campus, got the Bamangaon protection hut in Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), near Nagpur, refurbished with a donation of Rs 5 lakh and has offered to look after its annual maintenance. The renovated hut has been named after Prafullata’s husband, Dilip Chawathe who was an engineer, who passed away last year. It was dedicated to the frontline conservation staff by PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar last week. Protection huts are located deep inside wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. They are used by foresters on protection duty and are usually in poor condition, often devoid of basic amenities. Prafullata told TOI, “We were inspired by regular visits to Tadoba and wanted to do something for the frontline staff who are real protectors of the jungle. I’m happy that the Kuti has been inaugurated that too by the PCCF. The forest guards now have a comfortable place to rest. Others may take inspiration and renovate other huts too.” Asked what prompted her to take up this cause that rarely strikes tourists, Prafullata said, “I had only two things in mind – to do something for forest protection or education. Over the last 20 years, I and my husband have visited 60 wildlife parks in the country and abroad but Tadoba enchanted us the most and hence we used to visit regularly....” “Tigers were never on my mind as earlier I have been visiting Tadoba with birding groups. My daughter Monika Lenart and son Yatin are settled in California. Post-retirement, there was no better place for us to spend time with nature and hence we used to visit wildlife parks,” she said. “When my husband passed away, I and my children wanted to help Tadoba in some way. The idea of renovating the Bamangaon Kuti came after a suggestion from deputy director (core) NV Kale. I agreed and handed over money to the Tiger Conservation Foundation this January,” said Prafullata. TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkarhailed the gesture by the Chawathe family. “...The renovated checkpost at Bamangaon in the Kolara range will boost the morale of patrolling teams. Such donations also get tax exemption.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-retired-city-prof-spruces-up-forest-protection-hut-in-hubbys-memory/articleshow/83495321.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Nagpur||Raut: Machinery missing, no chance of MAPL resumption||Nagpur: In a major setback for resumption of medicine manufacturing plant of Maharashtra Antibiotics and Pharmaceuticals Limited (MAPL), at Hingna MIDC, guardian minister Nitin Raut said there is no chance of the plant’s revival, as there is no machinery. However, two private companies, which had offered to resume production at the plant, are ready to explore the possibility of producing oxygen and medicines related to Covid-19 pandemic if given the premises free of cost for a long-term period. TOI had on Sunday reported heavy machinery worth crores was missing from the plant, which is the only government-run medicines manufacturing unit in Vidarbha. It came to fore when joint director of industries AP Dharmadhikari along with former employee and union leader of the plant Suresh Gotmare and representative of former nominee director in MAPL—Environmental Engineering Inc (EEI) — Sudhir Paliwal visited the plant on May 17. They visited the plant on the directives of Raut. Raut told TOI, “Dharmadhikari reported me there is no machinery remaining in the plant. I directed inspection after some former employees met me and informed that the plant was ideal for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine, oxygen and other medicines. I also wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and food and drugs administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne to take over the premises and give it to us to restart manufacturing of medicines related to the pandemic. But now there is no meaning as there is no machinery in the plant, without which production cannot restart,” he said. MAPL, Nagpur, falls under Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), a government of India undertaking and comes under department of pharmaceuticals, ministry of chemicals and fertilizers. Paliwal told TOI, “MAPL, Nagpur, is still in existence despite the plant shutting in 2003. HAL has 59% share holding in MAPL and 8% is with IDBI. SICOM had 33% shares which were procured by EEI in 2002, which I represent. We have experience of running this plant. Existence of MAPL is the only hope for the plant’s resumption. Also, the plant was constructed as per guidelines of World Health Organization (WHO). Even without the machinery in the plant, we are ready to take it over and run it subject to all clearances.” Another city-based private company — Alphabet Multiples Pvt Ltd — also met Raut, and wrote to him and the CM showing eagerness to manufacture vaccine, oxygen and medicines for the pandemic at MAPL’s plant, subject to the premises being handed over free of cost for 30 years. Director Vivek Singh said, “We also visited the plant and were shocked to see all the machinery missing. It would have become easy to resume the plant if it was in place. Now, investment will increase. The building has also developed cracks and needs repairs. We have experience in manufacturing oxygen and medicines. Therefore, we can think of restarting the plant if given without any hurdles,” he said. In another setback, the Committee on Public Undertakings headed by Meenakashi Lekhi in its report submitted to Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on January 29, has recommended hiving off MAPL. As per the report, HAL informed the committee that NBCC (India) Limited has been appointed land management agency and MSTC Limited as auctioning agency for MAPL’s plant. HAL had also informed the committee that board of directors of MAPL is yet to approve the decision taken by the cabinet. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had written to the central government requesting to resume MAPL plant a few days ago. He had written the letter when he was unaware of the machinery not being present inside the plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/raut-machinery-missing-no-chance-of-mapl-resumption/articleshow/83494016.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra CM’s meet with PM new ploy to divert attention: Mete||AURANGABAD: BJP supported MLC Vinayak Mete on Sunday said that the recent meeting between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Maratha reservation was a new ploy by the ruling MVA government to divert attention. “The state government first failed to protect reservation for Maratha reservation during the legal battle and later did not take any corrective measures in the past around one and half months to offer relief to the Maratha community. To divert attention from its failure and inaction, Maharashtra Chief Minister met Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. On June 8, Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar and PWD Minister Ashok Chavan met PM during which Maratha reservation and other issues were said to be discussed. Addressing the media in Aurangabad on Sunday, Mete also announced that Aurangabad will serve as the venue for a crucial meet of Maratha community planned on June 29. “There is a huge unrest among the Maratha community as its quota in education and jobs has been snatched. The success of a massive protest rally taken out at Beed on June 5 was testimony to this. The protest against the government would be scaled up by arranging district-level meets, followed by rallies,” he said. While the Maratha community in the past had carried out silent rallies to press for reservation, Mete said that future agitations would be “vocal”. “We cannot remain silent any more when the failure and inaction on the part of the state government was taking a toll on the lives of the Maratha community. The message to the government is loud and clear that it is only accountable for loss to the Maratha community,” Mete said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cms-meet-with-pm-new-ploy-to-divert-attention-mete/articleshow/83487361.cms||---
---||Madurai||Price fall: Bananas left to rot on plants in Madurai||MADURAI: Farmers in Sholavandan and other parts of Madurai who have cultivated bananas are incurring heavy losses due to price drop, leaving the bananas to rot on the plants without picking them. Bananas are cultivated on more than 1,500 acres in Sholavandan and over a thousand acres in Melur region besides Thirumangalam in Madurai. This being the banana season, there is good demand for the plants with raw bananas hanging on them used as the main decoration at festivals and weddings. A pair of banana plants sell for more than Rs 1,000. However, like last year, this year too major functions and festivals were cancelled due to lockdown restrictions and the demand for all types of bananas fell steeply. Palaniappan, 65, a farmer from Rishabam in Sholavandan, said they were in dire straits due to the recurring lockdown. “This year, plants developed well and the bunches were also big with not less than 400 fruits of good quality per bunch. But after paying for labour, cutting bunches and taking them to the market, they don’t even sell for Rs 50 a bunch,’’ he said. This pushed the price of a single banana, which used to sell for Rs five to Rs 10 before the lockdown last year, to fifty paise, said Perumal, a farmer from Sholavandan. A fee of Rs 20 to cut a bunch and carry it to the vehicle has to be given to a worker. Add to this the transport charge of Rs 10 per bunch, what a farmer gets is just Rs 20, a pittance as a minimum of Rs 40,000 is spent per acre, he said. Melur- Periyar Single Crop Farmers Association president M Murugan said this was the plight of farmers not just in Madurai but other districts too. As the lockdown affects sales, the government should come forward to procure the fruits for a good price and distribute it to hospitals and Covid care centres, where bananas would find immense use as immunity boosters, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/price-fall-bananas-left-to-rot-on-plants/articleshow/83494032.cms||---

He said that QBMC’s complaint referred to dredging of at least 500 tonne of mud from Khazan land under survey number 170. “This was transported by two tractor trolleys and dumped in adjacent properties under survey no 182/5,” as per the complaint. A site inspection conducted through the Mormugao Mamlatdar has confirmed the desilting of the water body, Desai’s letter to WRD letter stated. Quelossim Panchayat had issued a stop work order to the project promoter stating that dredging and excavation of mud is being carried out in no development zone despite the matter pending in the court. The panchayat had scheduled a site inspection, but it couldn’t be held due to some reason. After the work continued, the panchayat had issued a second stop work order. QBMC chairman Lopinho Xavier had in a complaint to authorities alleged that use of heavy machinery in the khazan was causing irreparable damage to agricultural land on the banks of the Zuari. Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), after a series of inspections, had confirmed that the land is in an eco fragile zone, in which no development can be done. Goa State Biodiversity Board had also requested GCZMA to look into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dy-collector-orders-action-in-quelossim-khazan-land-digging/articleshow/83495362.cms||Paul Fernandes

---||Kochi||Kerala: About 500 trees in assigned lands felled in Thrissur||THRISSUR: Preliminary estimates indicate that about 500 trees, mainly teak, were felled in different assigned lands in the district after the revenue department issued a controversial order relaxing the norms on tree felling. Sources said only seven rosewood trees have been found felled so far in the district. The forest department officials have launched a drive to collect complete data on the felled trees in the next three or four days. Forest authorities have reportedly issued about 40 passes for transporting the trees which were felled in the cover of the revenue department’s order. Most of the trees were chopped down from the Machad forest area. Interestingly, the stumps of some of the felled trees were found to be burnt in the Akamala area. The forest officials said the timber mafia must have cut more than the permitted number of trees and the stumps might have been burnt to destroy the evidence. The forest department officials have launched a separate probe into the burning of the wood stumps. However, wood science experts at the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) said it would still be possible to identify the trees if some unburnt portions of the stumps are dug up and sent to the laboratories having facilities to study wood anatomy. According to sources forest officials had issued some passes to fell trees in the Pudukkad forest area but here too they suspect more than the permitted number of trees were cut. Trunks of several of these trees were seized from near Nilambur two days ago. Tree trunks which were illegally felled from assigned lands at Poomala Alukunnu were seized from Pattikkad area on Saturday. About 80 teak logs, valued roughly Rs 80 lakh, were seized in the operation. Two persons were also arrested in connection with the seizure. The forest officials concede that the revenue department’s order must have dissuaded at least some of their colleagues from taking any proactive action to prevent the indiscriminatefelling of trees. The order had made it clear that stern actions will be takenagainst those officials who try to prevent tree felling in the assigned landsby farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/about-500-trees-in-assigned-lands-felled-in-thrissur/articleshow/83490258.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Mumbai||BMC has Rs 80,000 crore FDs, got Rs 1,600 crore interest this year||MUMBAI: The BMC’s corpus in fixed deposits (FDs) crossed Rs 80,000 crore this year, despite the corporation spending over Rs 2,000 crore on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. The FDs are locked in various state-run and a few private banks. According to the civic finance department, the BMC received an interest of around Rs 1,600 crore on its FDs and the consolidated amount of all FDs is now just over Rs 80,000 crore. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), confirmed the development to TOI. In this year’s budget, the BMC had dipped into the Rs 50,952-crore FDs attached to the infrastructure development fund for creating mega projects like Mumbai Coastal Road. The BMC is also custodian of Rs 26,283 crore FDs that are in employees’ provident fund and pension accounts. The civic body earns around Rs 1,800 crore interest per year on FDs. Last year, the amount reduced by Rs 700 crore due to a reduction in interest, but in the current financial year, the BMC has received around Rs 1,600 crore interest. This year, BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal had announced a Rs 39,038-crore budget. Despite falling revenues and a drop in income amid the pandemic, the budget saw a hike of nearly 16.7% from last year’s outlay of Rs 33,441 crore. Chahal had admitted that the capital expenditure of the civic body had increased and it wasn’t sustainable unless revenue collection improved or new sources of revenue added. Instead of raising money from the market through bonds, the administration dipped into its FDs and took an internal interest-free loan of Rs 10,564 crore to meet its its increasing expenditure. Of this, Rs 5,876 crore was to be raised as internal loan from funds kept under two departments. BMC officials said Rs 3,500 crore was from the garden development fund, meant to create long-term assets, and Rs 2,376 crore from the depreciation fund that could be used for capital work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-rs-1600cr-interest-bmc-fds-grow-to-rs-80000cr-this-yr/articleshow/83495336.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Aurangabad||9-feet python rescued from SRPF base in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: A nine-foot-long Indian rock python was rescued from the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) battalion base in Satara area of Aurangabad on Saturday night. A team of snake handling experts — Manoj Gaikwad, Deepak Gujar and Kunal Banswal — had received a rescue call when the SRPF jawans spotted the reptile moving into a narrow drain after crawling across the road. “The Indian rock python must have strayed into the SRPF base in search of food. The creature did not resist much when we safely took it out of the drain and put it in the bag. As both sexes are almost alike in many snakes, it is unclear whether the rescued snake is male or female,” Gaikwad said. The rescued reptile has been kept under observation and is slated to be released in its natural habitat after a couple of days. “The python was found to be very hungry. We are feeding it so that it can gain some strength,” Gaikwad added. Solitary in nature, Indian rock pythons (Python molurus) are a large non-venomous python species found in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The powerful reptile is classified as lower-risk/near-threatened on the IUCN Red List of threatened Species, calling for conservation measures. “Indian rock python is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act and its killing can attract stern legal action. All snakes, including the Indian rock python, have an important role in maintaining ecological balance as they keep check on the population of rodents among other creatures,” honorary wildlife warden of Aurangabad, Kishor Pathak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/9-ft-python-rescued-from-srpf-base/articleshow/83487387.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad part of international study on protecting eyes||HYDERABAD: The city has now joined an international research race to develop and evolve methods that would help in protection of eyes and eyesight. LV Prasad Eye Institute in collaboration with Queen's University of Belfast, UK, along with nearly 30 other partners from the US, the UK, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and India, is working on a suite of studies to explore the impact of vision care on the global level to achieve sustainable development goals in low and middle-income countries. The research study has received funding support of 3.5 million Pounds from the Wellcome Trust and Chen Yet-Sen Family Foundation. Apart from focussing on eyesight, the research would also involve methods to reduce road traffic injuries, the world’s leading cause of death in children and young people. Researchers would also find out methods to slowdown the onset of cognitive decline and dementia among elderly persons struggling with poor sight. The study would also evolve proven preventive strategies for cognitive decline and dementia that could reduce the incidence by an estimated 41%. There would be focus on improving economic independence by helping older people use online banking on smartphones. LVPEI senior public health specialists Dr Srinivas Marmamula and Asha Latha Metla and senior retina consultant Dr Raja Narayanan are part of the study. According to them, poor vision was the world’s largest unmet disability affecting 2.2 billion people. About 8.8 million people in India are blind, and another 47 million people are visually impaired. About 70% of the blindness the world over is preventable. The research is led by Prof Nathan Congdon of Queen’s University and Dr Rohit Khanna of LV Prasad Eye Institute. Sashidhar Komaravolu from the Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India, Hyderabad, is also part of the research team from the city. “It is a five-year project designed to leverage high-quality research results to drive lasting policy change and achieve an improved quality of life for people in low and middle-income countries. It comprises four research trials to examine the impact of glasses on promoting better living, from childhood to old age, and the impact on multiple sustainable development goals,” Dr Rohit Khanna said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-part-of-international-study-on-protecting-eyes/articleshow/83494063.cms||Syed Akbar

Administrator Praful Khoda Patel is expected to arrive at the islands for a seven-day visit on Monday. A notice circulated online among the islanders by the forum urges people to register their protests following Covid protocols. Besides participating in the protest via social media, the islanders will hoist black flags in front of their houses, hold up placards and wear black masks or badges. “The aim is to express our protest during the administrator’s visit. The islanders will either wear a black mask or a black badge to mark our protest. We will hold a core-committee meeting on Monday evening and decide on further course of action in the coming days. If there is a positive response from the administrator, we will call off the protests,” said UCK Thangal, convenor of SLF. The online campaign would be centred around sharing videos and images of the protests on social media platforms. The placards held up by the residents will urge the government to recall the administrator besides demanding a rollback of the ‘anti-people’ reforms. The notice shared on social media by SLF also warns residents not to use government land, government buildings, public roads and bridges to stage the demonstrations and to strictly adhere to Covid protocol. The notice also states that public representatives and the public should boycott the programmes of the administrator. SLF is planning other modes of protest in the coming days during the administrator’s visit to the islands. Lights will be switched off and candles will be lighted. People will raise slogans at homes and bang coconut shells or plates or other utensils to register their protest. Sources said that the administration is not expecting any law and order situations considering the existing lockdown in the islands. “We will take a decision on when to stage these protests after a review meeting,” said a volunteer with SLF. Administrator Praful Patel will be visiting the islands from June 14-20. As per a message issued by the chief protocol officer, Lakshadweep administration, Patel will arrive at Agatti by Monday noon. Last Monday, thousands of families in Lakshadweep had observed a hunger strike from 6am-6pm in protest against the draft regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dweep-residents-to-hold-black-day-protest-today/articleshow/83492677.cms||---

The caller informed the police that armed intruders would enter India by sea from Sri Lanka through Rameswaram in Ramanathapuram district. The caller made an internet call to Thideer Nagar Police on Saturday afternoon, making the caller untraceable. The police alerted the Q-branch that probes the intrusion of Sri Lankans fleeing the island nation through India. A senior police officer in the know how told TOI that the caller provided the names and mobile numbers of the three ‘intruders’. “Two of them turned out to be journalists and one of them was well known to one of them. The reporters suspected that the call could be mischief by someone affected by news they broke recently,” the officer said. Efforts were underway to trace the caller and to quiz the suspect named by the journalists. The police have stepped up vigil in the coastal district and alerted village informants among the fisherfolk to confirm that it was a hoax.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hoax-call-claimed-armed-intrusion-from-sri-lanka/articleshow/83494057.cms||---

The role of the SIT will be limited to merely sharing information of common interest and relevance between the agencies. “Considering the seriousness, impact and dimensions of the offences, the government hereby constitutes a special investigation team consisting of officers from forests and wildlife department, vigilance and anti-corruption bureau and police crime branch,” states the government order constituting the team issued by chief secretary V P Joy. However, all these three agencies have their original powers drawn from different Acts, including the Indian penal code, prevention of corruption Act and Acts relating to forest conservation like forest (conservation) Act, 1980, Kerala preservation of trees Act, 1986 etc. For the same reason, multiple cases will have to be registered under these Acts by the agencies independently and the investigation will have to be conducted within the contours of the Acts from which the specific agencies draw their powers. “A rule was framed by the revenue department in 2017 to facilitate cultivation in the land assigned under the arable forests assignment rules, land assignment rules etc. Such assigned land will be only to the extent of a few cents. When there is a large number of trees that have been felled as being reported, there is a high possibility that those have not been felled from such assigned land alone. Someone might have facilitated the illegal felling of trees that has to be investigated by the forests department. Since there is a major criminal conspiracy and connivance of officials that also needs to be investigated, the vigilance also has a major role under the prevention of corruption Act. However, the role of the crime branch in the whole investigation will be very limited,” former law secretary and senior counsel in the high court B G Hareendranath said. Though senior government sources agree that there is no legal advantage in constituting a multi-agency SIT in such cases, the decision to set up a joint SIT is likely to smoothen the pace of investigation as multiple types of offences are involved. “The SIT members can prepare a joint coordinated plan of action, and they can even share the statements of individuals, or any other information that one agency feels would be useful to the other,” a top police official said. The Centre has in the past set up multi-agency probe teams when major scams had erupted in which the specialised agencies could not get into the bottom of the cases due to jurisdictional limitations. However, it is probably for the first time that such a joint team is being formed in the state to probe a scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sits-role-limited-in-tree-felling-probe/articleshow/83490289.cms||KP Saikiran

As a good Samaritan, he took them to a hospital and left after giving them some money. The youths thanked him and took his phone number to return the money. However, this was a staged act. Days later, the youths called the man to meet him and robbed him of his car, cash and jewellery. They also took him to an ATM in south Delhi’s Neb Sarai and made him withdraw money. Two youths have been arrested and a juvenile apprehended for the crime. Police received a complaint on June 10, DCP (south) Atul Thakur said. The businessman said the youths called him to a party to thank him for saving their lives. “On June 9, the duo came near his house and they proceeded for the party in the victim’s Baleno. The accused made him drink en route,” a senior officer said. One of the accused, identified as Rohit Mishra, was driving while the other, Sohil Saifi, was sitting in the back. They brought the complainant to Sangam Vihar where they called three other associates. The men held him at gun point, thrashed him and took his valuables. They also drove to an ATM and forced him to withdraw money. As the accused started distributing the money, the victim heard them planning to kill him too. Taking advantage of the men being distracted, he sneaked off into the dark and hid and managed to reach a police station. Police said the complainant had very little knowledge about the accused. The mobile numbers of accused persons were saved in his mobile phone, which was already taken by them. So, technical surveillance was used locate them and two of the accused, Rishit (19) and Sohil (20) were arrested. They are residents of Alpha 2 locality in Greater Noida. The car and ATM cards were recovered as well. The duo led the cops to their third accomplice, a minor. Police said that Mishra has been found involved in four previous cases of similar nature till now in Gautam Buddha Nagar jurisdiction alone. The antecedents of others are being verified. The exact number of their involvements is also being ascertained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-youths-stage-accident-rob-good-samaritan-a-few-days-later/articleshow/83494056.cms||---

OSLabs is the parent of IndusOS, a homegrown mobile platform. The Sebi complaint is in addition to a lawsuit that PhonePe has already filed against Ventureast and Affle in the Singapore high court. The lawsuit says that VPF deliberately deceived PhonePe by continuing to engage PhonePe and OSLabs on the sale of its shares in OSLabs in favour of PhonePe even though it had sold those same shares to Affle in a side deal without OSLabs and PhonePe’s knowledge. This, it said, was done during a legally binding no-shop period. PhonePe in its Sebi complaint has alleged serious misrepresentations, “including a series of unethical and bad faith actions, as well as potentially illegal actions, that have been and are being continually undertaken by the managing partner, general partner and principal of VPF involved with this transaction”. PhonePe founder and CEO Sameer Nigam said, “As founders, we are always held to the highest standards of legal and ethical integrity by our investors. But these standards should apply to investors in startups too. VPF has also acted in complete negligence of its fiduciary duties as a large shareholder of IndusOS.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/phonepe-files-complaint-with-sebi-against-ventureast/articleshow/83498600.cms||---

The team had held a meeting with the district revenue officials on the issue.  The building plan was not approved by the Ratnagiri town planner while Parab had applied for the measurement and had even paid house and street light taxes to the gram panchayat concerned. Ratnagiri collectorate officials said the joint team was headed by Dr Sureshkumar Adapa, regional director, coastal area CRZ management, Nagpur, MoEFCC, MCZMA, Dapoli sub-divisional officer Sharad Pawar and tehsildar Vaishali Patil, and some other officials.

---||Goa||‘As the world prayed and cried, told myself this can’t happen again’||PANAJI: When Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch towards the end of the first half of Denmark’s opening Euro 2020 clash against Finland, Armando Colaco closed his eyes. The former India coach could not bear to see the sight of medical staff running on to the field and giving CPR to the star midfielder. For Colaco, this was all too familiar. His thoughts raced to December 5, 2004, when Dempo SC’s Brazilian striker Cristiano Junior breathed his last at the Sree Kanteerava stadium in Bengaluru. “I closed my eyes and prayed,” said a teary-eyed Colaco, who as coach of Dempo won his first big trophy that evening at Kanteerava but also lost a player he admired so much. “I told myself, ‘no, no, no, this cannot happen again on the field. The world is watching, praying, crying. God, please save Eriksen’.” Eriksen was saved thanks to timely intervention from the players, referee and the medical staff. Junior was not so lucky. It was the 78th minute of the Federation Cup final against Mohun Bagan. Dempo were leading by a goal, scored by Junior. With their rivals pressing for an equaliser, the Goans launched a counter and Junior — while scoring — clashed with goalkeeper Subrata Paul and collapsed. “We could sense something was wrong as we ran towards Cristiano,” said Samir Naik, who captained the team. Unlike what happened on the pitch at Parken on Saturday when referee Anthony Taylor stopped play and called for medical attention within three seconds, Dempo players could only watch helplessly. Neither the officials nor players knew what to do as Ranti Martins and RC Prakash — closest to the scene — held the Brazilian’s hands and cried for help. “He was breathing when we got there,” said Naik. “But unlike what we saw at the Euro, (medical) facilities in 2004 were inadequate. Things could have been different if the same had happened now.” Dempo didn’t even have a team doctor at the time. It wasn’t mandatory as local organisers were tasked with the responsibility of arranging a doctor for matches. Junior was dead before the ambulance could reach the Hosmat Hospital. The cause of death was later identified as cardiac arrest. “The match continued. We played the remaining 12 minutes, received the trophy and were told of Cristiano’s death only when we reached the hospital. We broke down, unable to control ourselves,” said Stanley Colaco, the regular captain who sat on the bench nursing an ankle injury for the final. Seventeen years after the tragic on-field incident, the players feel lessons are still not learned. “After seeing what happened at the Euro, I have decided not to allow the team to take the field, unless there are qualified doctors at the venue and there is an ambulance,” said Naik, now Dempo coach. “Very often we have seen (for Goa Pro League matches) that cars are parked in front of an ambulance, blocking its path. It’s criminal. And we have matches kicking off at 3.30pm during summers.” Dempo players now know how to react to such situations on the field. The club conducts regular medical courses, teaching players how to handle emergencies. “The clubs are (now) educating players. Wish this had happened in 2004,” said Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-the-world-prayed-and-cried-told-myself-this-cant-happen-again/articleshow/83494082.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Idukki Flying Squad DFO, Shantri Tom, who is heading the probe team in Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod, said that it was found during the examination of documents conducted at Meppadi range office that forest department hadn’t given permission to cut the rosewood trees at assigned land in Muttil. "We have checked whether trees in LA patta land were felled with the permission of the department," he said. Tom added that it was found that the department had taken action against unauthorized felling of trees which took place on assigned land. "Also, documents show that officials have recovered most of the felled trees and steps are underway to recover the remaining timber," he added. He said that probe is also underway into the incident of the accused managing to submit a backdated copy of a Form 4 pass to a forest department official at south Wayanad DFO office. Also the team has collected documents from Lakkidi forest checkpost to see whether they had recorded the illegal transport of timber by the accused from Muttil to a timber depot in Ernakulam. Meanwhile, investigations by Meppadi forest range officer MK Sameer into the 48 cases registered in connection with the felling of 101 rosewood trees at Muttil has reached the final stage. Sources said that though forest department had served notice to key accused Roji Augustine on June 9 to appear in connection with the case within five days, he has not turned up. Forest department have seized 202 cu m of rosewood timber felled from Muttil till date. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muttil-trees-axed-without-nod/articleshow/83490309.cms||---

They have promised to follow all standard operating procedures and adhere to safety measures. Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association secretary Ashraf Tayub said that the efforts taken by the chief minister to bring down the spread of Covid-19 in the state in such a short span of time was laudable and the whole world was in appreciation of the efforts taken by the Tamil Nadu government. “As the spread has come down, the livelihood of people also have to be protected. The textile industry has 75 lakh workers and their salaries have to be given. Traders also had to pay building rent and electricity bills, in addition to taxes and GST. Closure of the shops for long periods could lead to damage of goods including expensive textiles. Electric equipment including air conditioners, generators and computers may need repairs,” he said Laghu Udyog Bharati president K R Gnanasambandan has thanked Stalin for letting MSME units including export units to start functioning during the lockdown. He said that the government should allow small textile shops, less than 1,000 sqft to function during weekdays. “It will help people fulfill their urgent requirements and help in procuring uniforms required for school and factories.” He also as the chief minister to take up the issue of giving loan moratoriums to MSMEs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/textile-merchants-seek-permission-to-operate/articleshow/83494092.cms||---
---||Jaipur||‘Remove plaque saying Pratap retreated in Haldighati battle’||Jaipur: Several Rajput outfits and historians have written to Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot to ensure that a correction is made to a plaque at the Archaeological Survey of India site in Rakhtalai which states that Maharana Pratap ‘retreated’ in the Battle of Haldighati in 1576. While the inscriptions -- ‘Pratap’s Forces retreated’ and ‘Pratap Ke Sena Ko Peeche Hatna Pada’ -- were partially scraped off from the plaque recently, there are demands that the plaque should carry the inscription that Rana Pratap did not retreat from the battle. The letter was sent on Sunday on the occasion of the 481st birth anniversary of Pratap. Chandra Shekhar Sharma, an associate professor in Udaipur said, “In the light of recent research and evidence, historians have come to the conclusion that Pratap’s army never retreated from the Battle of Haldighati.” “The war was won by Pratap, which is evident from the discovery of copper plates referring to how the Rajput warrior had been allotting land and taking administrative decisions in Mewar after the battle,” said Sharma, whose book ‘Pioneer of the National Freedom: Maharana Pratap’ sparked a controversy after it was included in the list of reference books by Rajasthan University in 2017. Highlighting another misrepresenting of fact, he said a few decades ago, “The date of the Battle of Haldighati was revised from June 21, 1576 to June 18, 1576, in the light of new evidence. If the date of the battle can be revised after centuries, why can’t the fate of the battle be revised too, based on the latest evidence,” asked Sharma. Speaking at a virtual session celebrating the 481st birth anniversary of Pratap, chaired by the governor Kalraj Mishra, Sharma said the Rajasthan State Archives in Bikaner has a collection of at least 40 copper plates post the Battle of Haldighati, disapproving the theory of Pratap losing the battle. Hemant Singh Mojawat, president of Mewar Pratap Yuva Manch, said: “It is unfortunate that the central government has allowed misrepresentation of facts by ASI. These facts should be corrected in the interest of the nation and Pratap should be declared a national hero.” ASI’s Jodhpur division superintending archaeologist Bipin Chandra was unavailable for comments when TOI contacted him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/remove-plaque-saying-pratap-retreated-in-haldighati-battle/articleshow/83494119.cms||Shoeb Khan

---||Pune||SPPU vision spans courses to carbon footprint stretch||PUNE: From environmental impact, industry requirements to seamless e-learning and assessment, the Savitribai Phule Pune University’s (SPPU) vice chancellor Nitin Karmalkar has a strategic plan for the next10 years. It is the need of the hour, Karmalkar said, adding that the National Education Policy coupled with the requirements of the Covid pandemic, made it imperative to have a plan for the largest university in the state. The plan includes reducing carbon footprint by 50%, increasing the tree cover by 100%, creating programmes depending on industries in the area, doubling the population of international students by starting market friendly courses and developing a seamless e-learning and assessment portal. Karmalkar said while involving the industry experts in all aspects right from curricula development to selecting the research topic will be one step, he also plans to make internships compulsory for all undergraduate and postgraduate students in the coming years. “We have already started it for the commerce faculty and some humanities students too are working with various NGOs. We want internships to be an integral part of the curriculum so that students who graduate have hands-on experience. We have already started providing co-location to select R&D units of the industry on the campus,” he added. SPPU draws foreign students but has competition from private universities. Karmalkar said instead of offering courses relevant to our country, he will start courses that will be relevant to their respective nations. “The university plans to double the population of international students through aggressive marketing, forging new educational partnerships with leading universities, increasing the fellowship numbers with the support of our alumni abroad by significantly enhancing the services and support available to incoming students,” he said. “We will develop programmes on innovative subjects to attract foreign students. We have a dedicated BBA programme in international business for international students. The New Education Policy has opened up an opportunity to provide dual degrees. We would try to leverage this by establishing at least 10 strategic partnerships over the decade,” he said. Research has been the Achilles heel for many state and private universities. Karmalkar said a board of experts unconnected to SPPU will select the projects for SPPU every year, ensuring quality and transparency without bias. While SPPU has been able to conduct the previous examination smoothly without too many problems, it is yet to come up with a foolproof online assessment method. The university may not go completely online, but Karmalkar said efforts are on to come up with an assessment that is not just based on MCQs, but will also check the cognitive and logical reasoning of students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/for-pune-varsity-vision-for-change-spans-relevant-courses-to-carbon-footprint-spectrum/articleshow/83494104.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Hotels near RGIA den for drug traffickers?||HYDERABAD: Hotels in and around Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Shamshabad have come under the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Cyberabad police radar as mules involved in drug trafficking and gold smuggling are using these hotels as transit hubs. In recent instances of heroin trafficking and gold smuggling, the DRI has found that smugglers pick up the package from mules staying in the hotels in Shamshabad and send it to onward destinations. On June 5, DRI sleuths seized 12 kg of heroin worth Rs 78 crore and two women passengers from Uganda and Zambia acted as mules. The sleuths arrested the Ugandan when she came to collect her missing baggage at RGIA. The accused came to Hyderabad from Zimbabwe via Johannesburg and Doha and stayed in a Shamshabad hotel. She did not take her luggage initially and waited for a few days. A DRI official said: “The woman was staying in the hotel and was supposed to return to the hotel after collecting the baggage and hand it over to her handler. We have seen similar instances in gold smuggling. Though the gold is destined for other cities, the mules land in Hyderabad.” He said the handler also stays in the same hotel in Shamshabad where the mules stay. “They arrive from Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and other metros to Hyderabad and pick up the smuggled gold from the hotel and leave the place,” he said. The hotels are now under the surveillance of RGIA police and the DRI. Shamshabad deputy commissioner of police N Prakash Reddy told TOI, “When a foreigner arrives at a hotel, the staff take his or her details and uploads them in FRRO website for registration. The hotel staff will have to maintain a register of guests checking in. Our patrolling staff regularly visit the hotels and check the guest lists. If there is any suspicion, we taken action. The DRI and other enforcement agencies are looking into both smuggling and trafficking cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hotels-near-rgia-den-for-drug-traffickers/articleshow/83494086.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Kelakam police on Sunday arrested the child’s mother and her partner. They have been arrested under section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 341 (wrongful restraint) and under section 75 of Juvenile Justice Act. Kelakam inspector of police A Vipin Das said that the baby was beaten up with a stick and has suffered a fracture on the shoulder, apart from injuries on the face. He said that the couple have been living together for the past three weeks but were not legally married. “The couple has been staying together for three weeks and the accused saw the baby as a nuisance. Also, there was criminal lapse on the part of the mother, who had the responsibility of protecting the child. She failed to take the baby to the hospital even after knowing about the injuries,” he said. According to the police, the girl was beaten up multiple times during the last one week at their rented house at Kanichar. According to the doctors, the girl is currently stable. The child’s grandmother told the media that the child’s mother told her over phone that her partner has been beating up the child, following which she went to the house to inquire about it on Saturday afternoon. After finding the child’s injuries she took the child to Peravoor taluk hospital in the night. The child was later shifted to the medical college. The injured girl is the youngest of the mother’s three children from her first marriage, and the other two children have been staying with their father. The mother’s partner was also previously married and has two kids from that marriage. The grandmother said that the mother’s partner used to beat the child for silly reasons, including if the child urinated in the room. “He didn’t allow the mother to take care of the baby. If he did not want to take care of the child he should have told us to take her away instead of beating up the one year old,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/1-yr-old-girl-hospitalized-as-moms-partner-batters-her/articleshow/83492759.cms||---

Then, fearful of the consequences if it went off, he took it to the police station on Saturday and surrendered. Cops said the ‘bomb’ he assembled from scrap bits and pieces had no chance of going off. After losing both parents, Pagare had been staying alone at rented places, but had to shift frequently since he was not able to pay rent. Pagare, who worked at a saloon, was mostly without any income, or earned negligible amounts, due to the prolonged restrictions. His three married sisters too remained engrossed in their own families, leaving him feeling lonely. He was lonely due to the lockdown and Covid restrictions, and hassled by his penniless condition. Pagare, now in custody of Nandanvan police, watched YouTube videos to learn how to make a bomb. He built one, but then lost his nerve and walked into Nandanvan police station with the so-called bomb in a bag, raising a scare. Pagare handed over the bag to a constable, saying it had a bomb which he found at a desolate place, where he had gone to relive himself opposite KDK College. Senior inspector MD Sheikh of Nandanvan police station said Pagare’s version of finding the bag at a desolate place was not believable. “Pagare soon spilled the beans, admitting it was he who had made the bomb and was now scared of getting caught by the police. He decided to bring the bomb to the cops fearing it may explode, and then he may land in bigger trouble,” said Sheikh. Nandanvan police alerted Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS), which dismantled the device brought in by Pagare. “It would not have exploded or caused any damage. He (Pagare) had filled a plastic box with some gunpowder used for making crackers (pyrotechnic materials). There was also a old Chinese mobile phone for making the circuit, a bulb with some pins in it and filled with petrol. He had also tried to use mosquito repellent machine and an old toy battery to create a red-light on the top,” said a BDDS expert, adding there was no detonator or gelatin like material. An officer said, “Pagare assembled the device after seeing a video on bomb making in his sister’s mobile phone. It would not have exploded but triggered fear and chaos.” Police even alerted intelligence agencies, and State Anti-Terrorist squad too rushed to interrogate Pagare. He was remanded to police custody for two days by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lockdown-blues-drive-man-to-make-bomb-asks-cops-to-defuse-it/articleshow/83494083.cms||Soumitra Bose

Officials said that few top school teachers via their managements gave an undertaking saying that they don’t require aid as the school paid them full salaries even during the pandemic. “Only 3,000 to 4,000 teachers opted out from receiving aid,” said a senior official from the education department. Even as managements claim that there is no option to opt-out, the officials said that even now teachers can give an undertaking requesting to remove their details. “The request has to come from teachers, not managements as we want to make sure that someone who is in need is not deprived of the aid,” the official added. Officials said that the aid is not given to about 30,000 teachers whose details had not been entered by the managements. “Managements had an option to edit the total number of teachers. However, few have submitted without editing and the page got frozen/locked and they could only enter details of a particular number of teachers, say if they had 30 teachers and entered it as 10, details of only 10 teachers are accepted. The remaining teachers did not get the aid because of management’s mistake,” said the official. Teachers, however, requested that the state should give aid to the remaining 30,000 teachers, who have submitted their details in offline mode. “They are in dire need of this aid as they did not receive any salary for more than a year. The state should consider their request,” said Shabir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-3k-teachers-opt-out-of-govt-aid/articleshow/83494149.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Between May 17 and Sunday, the state has reconciled 17,724 unreported deaths, with 2,288, 1,606, 2,213 and 1,522 fatalities added daily over the past four days. In the last 28-days, in fact, fewer new deaths (11,894) have been added compared to reconciled figures, pushing the state’s cumulative Covid-19 toll to 1,11,104 and the case fatality ratio back to nearly 2%. On Sunday, Maharashtra recorded 483 ‘new’ deaths and 2,288 backlog fatalities. It, however, appears that even the deaths reported daily are not so current as many have occurred at least a week ago. Across India, undercounting of deaths has become a major debate as states like Bihar, MP, Goa and Punjab addi-ng previous unreported deat-hs. District officials from Mah-arashtra told TOI that they have got orders to revisit their death figures and have been working on it. Surprisingly, Mumbai, that has so far claimed to have no lag in data reported, added 67 unreported deaths. The state continued to see a fall in daily cases though. It added 10,442 new cases, taking the total caseload to 59,08,992, closer to the 60-lakh mark. Mumbai too continued to see a decline with 695 new cases reported on Sunday, taking the cumulative caseload to 7,15,660. Nineteen deaths reported on Sunday took the city’s toll to 15,183. Active cases in the state and city have increased to 1,55,588 and 18,166, respectively. Western Maharashtra and Konkan regions remain a cause for concern. Satara reported 65 deaths on Sunday, highest in the state in a day, and 823 new cases, while Palghar and Kolhapur registered 53 deaths each and 211 and 1,132 daily cases, respectively.

A student of BE robotics, the youth had entered the Asia Book of Records on February 27 last year for touching his nose with his tongue 219 times in a minute. “When I measured by tongue, I found it is longer at 10.8cm, but approaching the Guinness Book requires money and hence I am trying to collect funds,’’ he said. He can use his tongue like a brush to draw and write letters. Praveen says he did not realise that his tongue was a wonder until he was able to effortlessly touch the side of his nose and elbow with it. He has touched his elbow with his tongue 142 times in a minute, which has also entitled him to a record. Hiding his tongue in his nasal cavity is another skill that he has developed through practice. He calls the prank the “invisible tongue”. Praveen says his lengthy tongue has never been a source of discomfort and he uses it to paint and draw.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/20-yr-old-in-virudhunagar-may-have-longest-tongue/articleshow/83494141.cms||---

The family was from Uttam Nagar in New Delhi and they were on their way home from Auraiya when the accident happened.The truck was parked on the Agra-Noida carriageway near Zero Point, police said. Rameshwar Singh, SHO, Beta-2 police station, said five people were in the car and Sonu (21) was behind the wheel. “Police got information about the accident around 5.10 am from some local people. A team reached the spot and took all the passengers of the car to Kailash Hospital in Greater Noida. Three people were declared dead there,” he said, adding that the accident happened around 4.50 am. The deceased have been identified as Sonu’s father, Pratap Singh (55), his mother, Usha Devi (50), and their relative Satpal Singh (30). Sonu and his uncle Santosh Kumar (40) are said to be in a serious condition. The car used to run for an app-based cab aggregator service at times, police said. “The person driving the car did not see the truck and rammed into it from the rear. The impact was such that the front portion of the car got completely damaged,” Singh said. “An FIR has been lodged against the truck driver under sections 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. The vehicle has been seized. We are looking for the truck driver,” Singh added. In a similar incident on March 20, 2021, four members of a family died after the car they were travelling in was hit by a mini truck on the Yamuna Expressway. One of the tyres of the truck burst and the vehicle jumped on the divider. It landed on the other side of the Agra-Noida carriageway and hit the car that was travelling towards Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-of-family-die-on-yamuna-e-way-as-their-car-rams-a-parked-truck/articleshow/83494168.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

Officials of Fire department said that except property loss, no one was hurt. Fire department officials got the distress call at 5.35 am. One fire tender was rushed immediately to the spot, but by that time, the fire had already reached the 2nd floor. “The mishap occurred on the 2nd floor of the main old building in the club. Computers, the server, and furniture which were in the penthouse on the 2nd floor were damaged,” Fire department officials said. To douse the thick fire, three fire tenders from Assembly, Gowliguda, and Secretariat fire stations were rushed. After two hours, the situation was brought under control. “At the time of mishap, there was only one security guard in the whole premises. He was standing at the gate,” officials said. Officials suspect that a short circuit in server room could be the cause. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fire-at-nizam-club-no-casualties/articleshow/83494135.cms||---
---||Goa||India wary of Afghanistan threat||Shanmugam Venkatesh, handpicked by former coach Stephen Constantine to be his deputy during his second stint with the national team, provided some interesting numbers. In the first seven matches of the Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifiers, he pointed out in an interview with AIFF last week, the average ball possession of the current squad has increased by 10.2 per cent, number of passes from 338 to 450 and the team now has an average of 450 passes per match with an accuracy of 80 per cent. These numbers show improvement from the previous campaign, but what matters most is the result against Afghanistan on Tuesday. Should India get the better of their opponents in Doha, they will finish third in group E of the Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifiers and qualify directly for the third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers. It would give coach Igor Stimac some breathing space and enough time ahead of the third round in November to put things in place. With six points from seven matches, one more than Afghanistan, even a point will do. But that’s something Stimac is not even contemplating. “I don’t know any coach or any team who would come out playing for a draw,” Stimac told reporters during the pre-match media interaction on Monday. “When you are facing much better sides, you need to drop and defend for your life and wait for one, two or three chances to counter-attack. It happened against Qatar, but we don’t go out to draw the game but win.” Afghanistan are not as strong as Qatar or Oman, the two heavyweights in the group, but they are not as weak as bottom-placed Bangladesh either, who India defeated 2-0 in the previous clash. With all players plying their trade outside the country – in Germany, United States, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Australia and India – Stimac recognises the threat. “The win against Bangladesh gave us extra confidence and moved us out of the danger zone. We now face Afghanistan, a team better than Bangladesh with international experience as the players play in foreign leagues. “You can recognise the threat on the pitch. How they are confident with the ball, the passing quality. But I know my team has the ability to go out and play confidently. We will make sure we finish this tournament on a winning note,” said Stimac.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/india-wary-of-afghanistan-threat/articleshow/83522176.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Police said that a criminal case was registered for violation of lockdown rules. When police went to the spot, there were 60 members—both men and women—who were found partying. Police recovered liquor bottles and sound systems from the location. Following the police intervention, police registered a case against both the farmhouse owner and the participants. “We found that the farm house has no permission and we will be writing letter to tahsildar to close the premises. Many of the participants in the birthday party were software professionals,” deputy commissioner of police (Shamshabad zone) Prakash Reddy told TOI. In this case, 68 members were made accused and they booked under 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC, Disaster Management Act and Excise Act. Since the organisers had no liquor permission, Excise Act was also invoked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-bust-birthday-party-at-farmhouse/articleshow/83494215.cms||---
---||Nagpur||World Blood Donor Day: Big camps not feasible yet, focus on voluntary blood donors, says experts||Nagpur: Though life is slowly moving towards normalcy after the second wave of Covid-19, neither the state nor central government have issued any clear guidelines or SOPs about mass blood donation camps. There is no ban on camps, but the notification only mentions that they should be held by following all Covid-19 protocols strictly. As a result, blood banks and social organizations are preferring to organize small camps. On World Blood Donor Day, experts in the blood transfusion field told TOI that more blood donors should come forward voluntarily to avoid blood crisis. “Organizing mega blood donation camps in which thousands of bags of blood used to get collected is still a distant dream. Still, we have recently conducted a camp where up to 500 individuals donated blood,” said Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director of Lifeline Blood Bank. According to him, individuals should come forward, visit the blood banks and voluntarily donate blood in advance in order to improve the conditions further. Dr Vinky Rughwani, member of Maharashtra State Blood Transfusion Council, said that number of voluntary blood donors is increasing. “Contribution of social organizations that create awareness among citizen by organizing blood donation camps is playing the most important role in increasing the number of blood donors. During the unlock phase, we have started organizing blood donation camps with proper SOPs but the number needs to be increased,” he said. In diseases like thalassemia major, the patient needs blood quite often. There are about 1.5 lakh thalassemia patients in country and blood donation is life-saving for them. “Blood available in our country is 10% less than the actual requirement. This is another important reason why we should encourage bigger blood donation camps,” said Dr Rughwani. The theme of this year’s World Blood Donor Day is “Safe Blood Save Lives”. The slogan is ‘Donate blood and make this world a healthy place to live in.’ Donate blood 2 weeks post jab The government has revised the deferral criteria for blood donation post Covid-19 vaccination to two weeks. Eligible donors can donate blood after 14 days of the first jab or 14 days post the second jab. As vaccination for 18-44 age group is set to start next Monday (June 21), doctors have appealed to youngsters to donate blood before taking Covid-19 vaccine or at least two weeks after taking the jab as per latest guidelines.  SOME GOOD NEWS - Permission given to hold blood donation camps where all Covid guidelines will be followed - Several blood donation camps are being held during the week from June 14-21 - Covid-19 vaccination for 18-44 age group will resume from June 21. Youths cane either donate blood this week or two weeks after the jab is taken||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/world-blood-donor-day-big-camps-not-feasible-yet-focus-on-voluntary-blood-donors-says-experts/articleshow/83494201.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Combative mayor plays to gallery, but tries to dodge controversy||MUMBAI: She has the ability to shoot off her mouth. When challenged to name the beneficiary of a particular contract, her tweet read, ‘Tujhya Baapala’ (To your father). Days later, she was rapped by the Bombay High Court for her comments 'blaming' stay orders for illegal buildings that are still standing. Mumbai’s first citizen Kishori Pednekar has a yen for trouble spots. Often the first one to reach a flooded area or the site of a building crash, Pednekar who was elected in 2019 has been one of the city’s most visible mayors in recent times. She understands how to stage a photo op. On a visit to Nair Hospital for an interaction with nursing students, she donned their uniform and reminded everyone present that she herself was a nurse once. Within minutes of the interaction, pictures of Pednekar in white went viral. A three-time Shiv Sena corporator from Lower Parel, Pednekar, 60, was part of the party’s Mahila Aghadi (Women’s Front) and was known for scathing speeches and streetside daredevilry, traits characteristic of the Sena’s brand of combative politics. Old-timers recall that in the 1990s, Pednekar scaled a seven-foot wall to break into the Doordarshan Kendra office in Worli and protest for more screen time to Marathi shows. She was in a group that made headlines by entering Mantralaya with secret pockets filled with chana dal lining their sarees to escape detection and then brazenly dumping the dal on the food and civil supplies minister in protest over a supplies scam. “My father was a mill worker, I grew up in a chawl. I studied in what was called Tabela School,” Pednekar told TOI. As a teenager, she acted in plays and delivered performances. It was a talent that soon translated into a demonstrative role in public life. “After being trained as a nurse I started working with Mandakini Chavan who introduced me into activism and then the Shiv Sena. She used to take up issues of mill workers rights. Mandakinitai taught me to speak on the mike and that was how I learnt public speaking,” Pednekar said. In the party, Pednekar rose to become Upa Vibhag Pramukh (deputy zonal leader). “We held programmes like distributing wheat and flour at affordable prices to the poor…I am a woman, but the Sena gave me a chance to fight. We did a lot of work to expand the Mahila Aghadi’s base, holding events, competitions and resolving family disputes. It is because of this base the Sena is still so strong,” Pednekar said. Visitors line up to meet her at the Mayor’s bungalow inside the Byculla Zoo compound even on Sundays. But she manages to take time out to cook fish and chicken on the weekends for her family—husband, son and daughter, their Labrador Prince and a calf. The Mumbai mayor’s post is for 2.5 years and the reservation—open, women, SC, ST—is decided by lottery, after which the 227 elected corporators pick a candidate from within them. Pednekar’s term will end in March next year. “Many say it is a titular post and has no power. This is true to an extent, the Mayor must get more powers to get things done but even a titular post can be used effectively to keep a check on the administration,” Pednekar said. She has been at the receiving end too. Last year, she was accused of getting her son Prasad’s firm a contract related to a Covid centre. Pednekar denied the allegation and said rules were followed by the BMC. Her immediate aim now is to clear up the controversy regarding the courts. She said she never intended to blame them. “I respect the judiciary fully, and in fact I was pulling up the BMC’s own law department as to why they fail to get stay orders vacated on time. These law officials help violators and fail to represent the case well in the courts. I am against illegal constructions and don’t support it in any way,” Pednekar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-combative-mayor-plays-to-gallery-but-tries-to-dodge-controversy/articleshow/83495359.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Goa||Goa: Suffocated by tar, cobra in Margao gets another lease of life||PANAJI: An Indian spectacled cobra, stuck accidentally in melting tar at Sao Jose de Areal recently, may have not survived for long if not for timely rescue and a marathon 11-hour cleansing operation that offered the reptile a new lease of life. On a hot summer day, this wandering cobra, one of the big four venomous species, ran between a few barrels of bitumen, abandoned by the roadside, about 6km east of Margao. “We were worried the traumatised cobra may die before we could remove all the tar. Luckily its skin didn’t peel off nor was it blinded by the tar,” Choudhury, wildlifer said.“We managed to slowly pull it out at around 11am. If it had remained beyond noon, it would have died in the heated tar,” animal rescuer Julio Quadros said. The reptile — in extreme pain and gasping for breath — quickly changed hands from Quadros to the forest department and then to engineer-turned wildlife conservationist, Benhail Antao. For Antao, with nearly two decades of experience in rescues, the unusual operation was a challenge. Handling the deadly snake and ridding it of the sticky material required care, caution and patience. Tar becomes harder on drying up, but assisted by his friends, Sanghamitra Choudhury, Vighnesh Patil and Ambrish Kotharkar, he kept scrubbing gently late into the night. “We noticed that the snake was gasping for air as tar had sealed its mouth. Our priority was to let him breathe, so we inserted a stick between its jaws for temporary respiration through the mouth,” Antao said. Once satisfied about the snake’s respiration being normalised, the rescuer continued, cleaning its hood, jaws and other upper parts. “Every rescue has different problems and one has to be innovative. Instead of using turpentine, which is chemically strong, I used the more organic and edible coconut oil for soaking tar and rawa (semolina) for scrubbing it off using ear buds and toothbrush,” Antao said. The cobra was initially scared, and most often, snakes strike out of fear or self defence. Antao took care of all safety aspects to protect humans and the animal during the operation. “We were worried the traumatised cobra may die before we could remove all the tar. Luckily its skin didn’t peel off nor was it blinded by the tar,” Choudhury, wildlifer said. For cleansing the remaining part of its body, the snake, less tensed by now, was wrapped in cloth and allowed to soak in coconut oil for two hours. It was around 1am when the last visible glob of tar was removed and the dehydrated reptile could be kept under observation overnight. “It was very heartening to watch it rest in the water tub once all the tar had been removed,” Margao mobile squad range forest officer Prakash Naik said. “In the morning, we were satisfied about its health and released it in a lake,” Antao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/suffocated-by-tar-cobra-gets-another-lease-of-life/articleshow/83494180.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Mumbai||Sepsis risk 4 times higher in Covid babies, find Mumbai doctors||MUMBAI: Newborns infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus have a higher risk of adverse outcomes and death, a study by city-based doctors and scientists has found. The risk of sepsis was 4.09-fold higher and the need for a ventilator rose 3.67 times in infected neonates compared to babies who did not have Covid-19. The findings are from a retrospective analysis of 524 babies born to Covid-positive mothers at BYL Nair Hospital between April 14 and July 31 last year. About 6.3% (33) of the 524 neonates were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR test. The clinical outcomes of the 33 babies were compared with 490 uninfected ones by experts from Nair and the ICMR-National Institute of Research in Reproductive Health in Parel. The study is one of the first to document how Covid impacts newborns. “The infected neonates are at a higher chance of developing complications and require intense management, but their own underlying problems such as being pre-term, underweight, also add to the criticality of the disease as per our observation,” said Dr Sushma Malik, head of paediatrics at Nair and lead author. While only six of the 33 positive neonates were symptomatic, nine needed NICU care. The paper said there were 13 neonatal deaths overall, of which three were in 33 infected babies (9%) compared to 10 in the uninfected group of 490 (3%). A significantly higher percentage (12%) of the infected babies had trouble breathing compared to the negatives (3.9%). Positives had difficulty feeding—almost five times more. Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by immune response to an infection, was found in 12.1% compared to 3.3% uninfected ones. The paper published in the Journal of Tropical Pediatrics showed that 27% of 33 positive babies required NICU care, opposed to 25% in the negative cohort. While the difference here was insignificant, the need for non-invasive ventilator (CPAP) was six times higher, and that for ventilator was nearly four times more in the positive babies. The paper, co-authored by Dr Suchitra Surve and Dr Rahul Gajbhiye from the ICMR-NIRRH, found that gender had no effect on the severity of Covid. The study found the fear of higher premature births unfounded as only 4.8% of the neonates were born pre-term, which is less than that reported previously, wrote the authors. The study could not answer the big question of how the babies caught the infection as the amniotic fluid or placenta was not tested. A neonate positive at birth but not after 24 or 48 hours is considered a probable case of ‘intrapartum transmission’, one that happens during labour or delivery. In the study most neonates were positive at birth but negative for the repeat swab at 48 hours. “Thus ... the virus seems to be acquired intrapartum in our cohort,” the paper stated. Dr Malik said Nair had done over 1,000 deliveries of Covid-positive mothers, of which fewer than 50 babies had come positive since last April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sepsis-risk-4-times-higher-in-covid-babies-find-city-docs/articleshow/83494241.cms||Sumitra Debroy

These teachers were paid about Rs 40, 000 per month plus incentives or allowances on average, with some even drawing more than a lakh each month. Principals or managements said that there was no option to opt out from getting the aid and cited it as the reason for their teachers receiving Rs 2,000 aid and 25 kgs rice from the state government. “It’s quite strange that everyone was give the aid irrespective of whether or not a teacher got salary. No option was given to opt out,” said Latha Shankar, principal, P Obul Reddy Public School, adding that half of the teachers from the school got the aid and the remaining did not as their names were registered with their previous school. She said that ration that teachers received was distributed with the sub staff—aayyas, drivers, among others or less fortunate in the vicinity. Seconding Shankar, S Narasimha Reddy, principal of Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur said that almost all teachers from his school received the amount as well. “We did not want to apply for the aid, but we were told its mandatory,” said Reddy adding that all the teachers from the schools have received aid in the last two months. He said that they recently had a meeting and it was decided that the money would be donated and used for the benefit of those students who are Covid-19 victims. “None of our teachers collected rice,” he added. As per the figures available with the education department, as many as 2,04,743 have been given aid and over 90% of them also received rice. The state has spent about Rs 120 crore to provide financial aid and rice to teachers. The officials, however, said that they did not force anyone to take the aid and added that the amount was given only to those teachers who have sent their details. “Initially, 1.45 lakh teachers applied for the aid and it was sanctioned to 1.25 lakh. Subsequently, aid was sanctioned to over 2.4 lakh teachers from 10,500 private schools,” said a senior official adding that as per rules all the teachers working in recognized private schools, whether or not they received salary, are eligible to get the aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-teachers-to-donate-govt-aid-to-covid-victims/articleshow/83494193.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

In case of an accidental death, they will get Rs 78 lakh. The increase in the sum comes after an MoU was signed between police and Axis Bank, where salaries of the cops get credited. Delhi Police Headquarters on Jai Singh Road now has an in-house bank, ATM, cafeteria, bank, staff and officer lounges and a Nafed outlet that will provide grocery items of daily needs at reasonable prices. Police commissioner S N Shrivastava has inaugurated these facilities at a complex, Suvidha, on the headquarters premises. “The facility is dedicated to all rank and files of Delhi Police. A need for these facilities was being felt since a long time. The police chief has handed over the supervision to Sundri Nanda, special commissioner (general administration and HQ),” PRO Chinmoy Biswal said. The salary accounts of all Delhi Police personnel have been with Axis Bank since November 2002. “The branch at PHQ will extend all facilities as provided in a branch. It also has ATM and Cash deposit machines,” Biswal said. The canteen on the ground floor has a bigger space. The facility is airconditioned and is provided with Wi-Fi, DTH connection, an RO and a water cooler. The facility has modern cooking equipment for preparing food in a hygienic manner, he added. Nafed Bazaar is a grocery shop operated by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited. “Nafed procures foodgrains, pulses, oils and oilseeds directly from farmers and provides them to customers. As there are no intermediaries involved, the prices are competitive and good quality is also ensured. This bazaar will operate six days a week from 8am to 8pm,” the PRO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kin-of-delhi-cops-to-get-more-aid-for-untimely-death/articleshow/83494250.cms||---

The water level is at 67.8 feet with an inflow of 390 cusecs. Farmers in the southern districts are hopeful of a good harvest in the next season also if the dam’s water level remains favourable. Releasing water in the first week of June is very important for the crops in Madurai and Theni districts. Drought and lack of proper rainfall had made it impossible for water to be released from the dam for over 12 years. On June 4, the water level was 67.8 feet. Usually, the water level in the dam starts receding after the shutters are opened for irrigation by two to four feet from the day of opening. The Vaigai dam has a maximum level of 71 feet and the first flood warning is issued when it reaches the 66 feet, the second at 68 feet and the third at 69 feet. The water level in the Mullaperiyar dam stood at 130.7 feet on Sunday, with an inflow of 645 cusecs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaigai-dam-level-remains-same-for-a-week-though-water-released/articleshow/83494223.cms||---

This follows 1.9 lakh Covid-related deaths since April 1, 2021, which is 17% higher than lives lost to the pandemic in the entire FY21. “Life insurers, while making Covid reserves last year, assumed 50–100% higher Covid deaths for FY22. Our analysis shows that reserves made by them can cover 1.5–2x the Covid-related deaths in FY21,” said a report by Macquarie. The 5-10 times increase in the number of death claims is based on enquiries with life insurance companies and industry bodies by Macquarie. The report says that worry for investors is there could be a significant impact on embedded value for life insurance players. The embedded value is a measure used to determine the worth of a life company that factors in future liabilities based on actuarial assumptions. Of the three listed life insurers – HDFC Life, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life, Macquarie Research has projected 2%, 3% and 4% impact, respectively, on embedded value should Covid-related claims for FY22 be four times of FY21.

Besides these frauds, the bank is also investigating into illegal transfer of Rs 1.09 crore from the accounts of several customers in Asha Parari branch in Buxar. The suspended manager of the bank branch, Dr Ravi Shankar Kumar, was arrested from Patna on June 6. Ala said he had written to the EOU almost a week back and requested it to take up investigation against the bank’s two managers, Yogesh Kumar and Madhulika Rani, and three cashiers who were found involved in the embezzlement after an internal inquiry. He said two separate FIRs were lodged with Warisaliganj police station and Pakri Barawan police station in Nawada and one in Gaya in connection with the frauds and five bank staff had been suspended. He said Yogesh had been posted at the Bernawa branch and Warisaliganj branch of the bank before joining as manager at the Malahiya branch in Gaya. Madhulika was posted as manager at the Warisaliganj branch before being transferred to Ram Raipur branch in Shiekhpura. “Yogesh had transferred customers’ fixed deposits into his own account and also the accounts of his family members,” he said. “The internal inquiry of the bank had started in April this year. It ended recently after which FIRs were lodged with three different police stations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dbgb-fraud-eou-urged-to-register-fir-start-probe/articleshow/83490482.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Crime branch awaits forensic report over Ratheesh Kooloth’s death||KOZHIKODE: The crime branch team probing the death of Ratheesh Kooloth, the second accused in the murder of IUML activist Mansoor at Panoor in Kannur district in post-poll violence, is awaiting the forensic report. Ratheesh’s postmortem report said that the death was due to hanging, pointing to suicide. Ratheesh was found hanging from a tree at a hideout used by the accused at Chekkiyad in Kozhikode district on April 9. Police said that though the postmortem certificate said that the death was due to hanging, there were some injuries on Ratheesh’s body, and they had to be accounted for. “We had taken statements of two arrested accused who said that Ratheesh was with them at Mansoor’s murder site at Panoor and that he had sustained injuries in the violence. We could not yet record the statement of the first arrested accused in the case as he got infected with Covid while under judicial custody,” said a senior police officer. He said that the reports of some scientific examination, including forensic reports, are awaited and added that the investigation report would be ready within two weeks. Ratheesh’s preliminary postmortem report said that there were internal injuries and possible signs of strangulation which raised suspicion of foul play in the death, and a crime branch inquiry led by deputy superintendent of police Shaj Jose was instituted in this case. IUML activist Mansoor was killed in post-poll violence at Mukkil Peedika in Koothuparamba constituency in Kannur on the polling day on April 6. The police FIR says that accused 1-11, who were CPM workers, along with 14 other identifiable persons, arrived as a group and attacked Muhsin and when his brother Mansoor tried to prevent the attack they attacked him too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/crime-branch-awaits-forensic-report-over-ratheeshs-death/articleshow/83492915.cms||---
---||Delhi||AAP’s Pathak alleges scam by corpn in cleaning of drain||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party functionary Durgesh Pathak on Sunday alleged that for the last five years, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led East Delhi Municipal Corporation was issuing tenders and taking money to clean a non-functional drain, which was built to solve the waterlogging problem of Swami Dayanand Hospital and the adjacent area. Pathak claimed that on paper, this drain was fully complete by 2016, but in reality, it was never functional. He alleged that for the last five years, every year the BJP-led corporations were spending lakhs of rupees in the name of cleaning of the non-functional drain. Pathak alleged that the BJP-led civic hospital was known for getting waterlogged every monsoon. “To solve this problem of waterlogging, the BJP-led civic officials and leaders decided to develop a drain. The tendering process was done in 2011. On paper, this drain was fully completed in 2016, but in reality, this drain was never functional,” he alleged. “From 2016 till 202,1 this drain has not yet become operative because there was a need to break a wall between the waterlogged area and the drain. In the last five years, the BJP-led civic body could not do this simple work,“ he claimed. East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain said AAP’s allegations were fake and the drain was supposed to go from Saboli to Dilshad Garden but due to GT Road crossing in Dilshad Garden, its work was stopped. He said the incomplete drain was under PWD limits. Jain added that only 15 meters of the drain was left to be built, which would soon be completed and merged with the drain near the railway line. He said that the NGT declared it a natural drain and had ordered not to concretise it. He also said de-silting of the drain had been done in the EDMC’s jurisdiction and that PWD was responsible for getting it cleaned in its area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aaps-pathak-alleges-scam-by-corpn-in-cleaning-of-drain/articleshow/83494315.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Neighbourhood shopkeepers among 7,000 arrested in a week for flouting norms in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The city police, which carried out close to 7,000 arrests and prosecutions in the past seven days of people breaking enhanced restriction rules, claimed that the shopkeepers and traders (especially those within neighbourhoods), have become a major cause of worry for them. “The number of motorists being handed challans for not sticking to the time ban saw a sharp rise, even surpassing the seizures of vehicles for the first time on certain days,” said an officer. The average daily prosecution of citizens went up this weekend as compared to last week even as seizures of vehicles dropped. Police said that a section of grocery and stationery shops of local markets remain open beyond the 10am deadline citing “logistic difficulties” of closing and reopening again in the afternoonfor another four hours. “The biggest worry, though, are the roadside tea stalls and eateries that are trying to reopen leading to crowding. This defeats the purpose of such enhanced restrictions. Paan and cigarette shops fall in the same category. While officers are happy with major markets sticking to rules, they say that it is the ones adjacent to markets or the temporary food item sellers, who seem to be unaware of the laws,” said an officer. Till Sunday noon, the cops prosecuted 1,144 persons per day with total arrests standing at 8,013. Last week, the average arrests per day stood at 818 with a total of 5,692 arrests. In comparison, till Sunday afternoon, police seized 1,503 vehicles per day, down from the daily average of 1784 last week. The total seizures of vehicles this week stood at 10,522 compared to 12, 493 last week. “The grocery shops can open between 7 am and 10 am and again for four hours at noon. The other shops might operate in the afternoon shift. But all shops — except medicine and eateries that are catering to home delivery — must shut shop by 4 pm. Even for eateries, they can only do home delivery. Any violation of the same can hand them a challan and even arrests,” explained a divisional officer. Police said they have also nabbed motorists claiming to drive down to shops and eateries. “Those arguing are being shown government notifications,” said an officer at a naka on Howrah Bridge. “We are ready to close our shops, but at times customers do not care about curbs. If someone is at our shop, it’s difficult to shut it down,” said a shop owner in Gariahat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neighbourhood-shopkeepers-among-7k-arrested-in-a-wk-for-flouting-norms/articleshow/83492903.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Pune||30 water-starved Kondhwa societies to get supply from Diwali||Pune: A new 10-inch pipeline from NIBM Road to Pargenagar that is being installed is expected to resolve water issues in over 30 housing societies in Kausar Baug and Pargenagar in Kondhwa. The societies that will have access to the water distributed by the Pune Municipal Corporation include Kumar Homes, Vijay Park, Manish Park, Hill Mist Garden, Hill Mist Harmony, Firadosh, Satine Miracle, Galaxy society and all Parge Nagar Societies, and properties in Life Line hospital lane. “We get water from the PMC, but the pressure is very low and does not suffice. We have to heavily depend on tankers for our supply. Some societies have installed rain harvesting systems,” a resident of Kausar Baug said. Another resident from Pargenagar said, “We are supposed to get water twice a day but the pressure is so low that it fills only 20-30% of the tank. We have been spending lakhs of rupees on water tankers.” Local corporator Nanda Lonkar said the plan to install this pipeline was proposed in 2013, but the work was halted due to bureaucratic issues. After a lot of back and forth with the defence minister, since the pipeline had to pass through areas belongs to them, and the PMC got the permission to install the extension of the existing express water pipeline that ran till 400 meters ahead of Gera Junction to Kausar Baug and Parge Nagar areas. She added that the installation should be complete before Diwali after which housing societies will have access to 24x7 water supply by PMC. MLA from Hadapsar Chetan Tupe said once there is proper distribution of the Bhama Asked water to areas in eastern Pune, water from Khadakwasla dam can be distributed to Kondhwa-Mohammedwadi, Hadapsar and other neighbouring areas with water problems in south Pune. “We are in talks with the PMC to divert water from Khadakwasla dam to all parts of southern Pune. The job to set up a 24x7 water pipeline across many parts of the city was given to two companies-- L&T and Jain Irrigation. But due to some dispute between PMC and Jain Irrigation there is a lag in construction of the pipeline. It is now expected to be completed by 2023. We are installing the extension of the express pipeline to Kausar Baug and Pargenagar, and neighbouring areas to be ready to receive water supply from PMC once the Bhama-Asked water project is complete and PMC is set to redirect the water from Khadakwasla here,” said Tupe. Two Years For Full Implementation A thorough plan and implementation for the sanction and distribution of water from PMC to these areas is expected to take up to two years PMC has a makeshift proposition in place to redirect some water to Kausar Baug and Parge Nagar through the express pipeline from the 24x7 water supply currently given to the larger Kondhwa area Wards 26 and 27 in Kondhwa receive 45 MLD water from PMC. Once the installation of the extension of the express water pipeline is completed, we will redirect the water for 1-2 hours to these areas through the express pipeline till such time that a new plan is made Somnath Waskar I Junior Engineer, PMC Water Supply Department||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/30-water-starved-kondhwa-societies-to-get-supply-from-diwali/articleshow/83494278.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Goa||Goa: Four internal evaluations for Class IX, XI from this academic year||PANAJI: The Class X and XII public examinations had to be cancelled in 2021 due to the pandemic, leaving the Goa Board to rely on students’ internal assessment marks and their performance during the previous academic years to evaluate students. This has led the state board to the realisation that evaluation methods need to be adapted to the changing scenario. Accordingly, its academic council, at its recent meeting, has decided to conduct four evaluations during the year for Class IX and XI students. From the upcoming academic year 2021-22, students will have two tests, instead of one, during each of the terms. Besides this, the board will also ask teachers to lay more stress on continuous evaluation of students by testing the student at least once after completion of four chapters in a subject. Board officials said this will help teachers to better assess students, while it will also serve as preparation for the upcoming academic year to evaluate students more accurately if the pandemic situation does not ease. “Now, two exams will be conducted of 20 marks each during the first term. Similarly, two more exams of 20 marks each will be conducted by the schools during the second term,” said Board chairman Bhagirath Shetye. “There will also be one assignment of ten marks each for each of the two terms,” He said that as per the current evaluation system, the gap was too long between two evaluations. “Now, one evaluation will be carried out at least after every four chapters, so that the teachers will know if the students have understood the concept or not. Earlier, one test would be held every one-and-a-half month. More frequent evaluations will help teachers understand better where the student stands. In a pandemic situation, it has been realised that more frequent evaluations will help.” The board plans to allow these tests to be carried out in the online mode if the pandemic situation persists and learning continues to be online. After cancellation of the Class X public exam, the Board formulated a scheme for tabulation of marks for the 2021 batch. As per the scheme, teachers were to evaluate students based on their internal assessment marks with some weightage also given to students’ performance in Class IX. A similar scheme is being planned to evaluate the Class XII batch of 2021. The Board had specified to schools that teachers allotted the job of evaluating students should be closely familiar with the children’s performance through the year for a fair result. This has led to the Board realizing the importance of teachers evaluating students more frequently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-internal-evaluations-for-class-ix-xi-from-this-acad-yr/articleshow/83494273.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Mumbai||Half of healthcare, frontline staff in Maharashtra yet to get 2nd jab, says Centre||MUMBAI: Nearly five months since the start of the nationwide Covid vaccination drive, less than 56% of healthcare and 47% of frontline workers have taken the second dose in Maharashtra, the Centre has said. The state features along with 18 others that have administered fewer second doses than the national average. Maharashtra has started a drive to trace all those who have missed the second dose. Maharashtra numbers show that while 12.23 lakh healthcare workers (HCWs) have taken the first dose since January 16, a little over 7.87 lakh have taken the second dose. Similarly, while nearly 20 lakh frontliners have been vaccinated with one dose, the number of fully vaccinated people in the category is merely 8 lakh. Back-of-the-envelope calculations based on data provided by the state show that the ratio of fully vaccinated people in both categories, considered crucial since they are at the frontline, are 52% and 42%, respectively. Union health secretary Shri Rajesh Bhushan, in a recent meeting with states, called the incomplete vaccination of the two categories a matter of “serious concern”. Dr Archana Patil, director of health services, said that issues like duplicate entries and use of another mobile number at the time of taking the second dose could be pulling down the numbers of those fully vaccinated. “We are compiling that and also following up with these two categories to get vaccinated on a priority basis,” she said, adding that all districts have been asked to look into their second dose coverage. Vaccination for healthcare workers had started on January 16 and that of frontline workers on February 3. In Mumbai, civic officials said it has been a matter of intrigue why second dose recipients were low in attendance. For 1.87 lakh and 2.34 lakh healthcare and frontline workers who have taken the first dose, 64% and 55% have turned up for the second. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, said all ward offices have been working to trace “drop-outs”. “Duplication of entries appears to be a more plausible reason than hesitancy,” she said. But it would be clear once the data has been cleaned, she added. A similar trend is unfolding in the big cities of Thane district as well. Kalyan has seen barely 42% HCWs taking the second jab till June, which means only 6,795 of the total 16,024 workers have turned up. In Thane city, only 15,569 of the 23,887, or around 65%m took both doses, while in Navi Mumbai, 62% of 32,445 took both doses.  “It is surprising HCWs have not yet been immunized completely though the drive started as early as mid-January” said Dr Mahesh Bedekar, adding that HCWs should lead by example and get immunised completely at first.

The Golf Green police claimed that the victim — Pulak Chowdhury — had to depend on his live-in partner and his step son to make ends meet, especially in this period of enhanced restrictions, leading to further depression. “On Sunday, at 12.40pm, we received information of an alleged hanging.

Valavan (skilful) was one of the four Chippiparai puppies that began training at the college in March. The forest department has also recruited Kaduvan (tiger) for Pollachi division, Kaligan (sky) for Nilgiris division and Athavai (female elephant) for Gudalur division. “The puppies underwent obedience training in the first phase and sniffing training in the second phase. They were handed over to the forest divisions a few days ago. They can sniff out sandalwood, teak wood, ganja, ivory, deer horn, raw meat and skin of wild animals,” said assistant conservator of forests M Senthilkumar. A dog handler and his assistant are taking care of Valavan at Boluvampatti forest range office. “Native breeds require less maintenance compared to imported breeds. Chippiparai and Kombai excel at sniffing out forest crimes. We will monitor Valavan’s performance for some months and bring more sniffer dogs to the forest division,” Senthilkumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/valavan-has-a-nose-for-forest-crimes/articleshow/83494316.cms||A Subburaj
---||Dehradun||In a first, women patrol Nanda Devi forests at 14,500 feet||DEHRADUN: At 14,500 feet, one can leave nothing to chance. So, for months, Durga Sati, 32, Roshni Negi, 25, and Mamta Kanwasi, 33, had been preparing for the taxing trek. Last week, they became the first women guards to be deployed in the treacherous forests of the country’s second highest mountain, Nanda Devi, over 25,000 feet high. “We patrol the mountains to protect rare animals — like snow leopards, Himalayan bears and blue sheep — and plants — Himalayan viagra and thousands of medicinal herbs. There is always the threat of poachers, even at these altitudes,” said Mamta. “We also check water sources and see if anything appears amiss from a security point of view. We have to ensure our territory is safe.” And because they had to take a circuitous route this time, stopping for checks along the way, the trek became an arduous 60-km-long one. Their deployment came about with a chance conversation and initiative on their part. Women forest guards would usually go up to Laata, at 11,150 feet, but would be asked not to go further. “But we thought, if not now, when? We joined this service to serve our country and nature. So, I decided to do this,” said Roshni, whose father owns a vegetable shop at Joshimath in Uttarakhand. The third of four siblings, she has been in the service for five years. She teamed up with Mamta, wife of an army man, and Durga, and approached the range officer of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, Chetna Kandpal, who agreed and started training them. “It was a special assignment because of the altitude these brave frontline women were scaling. It was a long tour and they did well,” said Rajeev Bhartari, head of the forest force, Uttarakhand. On June 1, they started from Laata and trekked to Bhelta (11,800 feet), where they stayed the night. Then, they went to Lata Khark (12,800 feet) and then, onwards to Jhandidhara (13,800 feet). They returned to Lata Khark, from where they went to Dharasi (14,500 feet), their final destination. “The trek was dangerous. It needed us at our best in terms of physical and mental agility,” Mamta said, also from Joshimath. “One day, of the 8-km trek we had planned, 5.5km was on glaciers. A second’s distraction would have cost us our lives. No one would have even found our bodies.” Durga further said, “We had the constant threat of Himalayan bears and snow leopards on our minds. We had to remain alert all the time while keeping an eye out for poachers.” Both Durga and Mamta have been forest guards for 12 years. While Mamta has a two-year-old daughter at home, Durga has three kids. “We can’t afford to be afraid. We have to take up challenges and set an example for our kids,” said Mamta. Durga added, “We, as human beings, have exploited our environment the most. Now, it is our duty to come forward and save our forests, however difficult the circumstances."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/for-1st-time-women-patrol-nanda-devi-forests-at-14500-ft/articleshow/83492917.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Docs see ray of hope to salvage vision of mucor patients||Nagpur: Sohel Shaikh refuses support as his relative holds his hand to help him walk out of the doctor’s cabin. A patient of mucormycosis, there are hardly any signs of the dreaded disease on his face.If doctors have taken tough decisions to remove patients’ eyes to save their life, there are those like Sohel who could be saved from last resort procedures. Patients like Sohel had come with infected eyes but their vision was saved.About to be discharged from Kingsway Hospital in the city, Shaikh, a 36-year-old school teacher, was among the patients in whom the eye infection was manifested in early stages itself. Reaching the hospital in time helped as doctors who have gained experience by treating large number of patients are also trying procedures that can prevent eye removal.Doctors said as experience gains in more cases of mucormycosis or black fungus, a number of patients are walking out unscathed or with minimal extraction of facial bones from hospitals. The eye has been saved in a number of case since May, though there were times from February to April when even doctors did not have much clue on dealing with the fungus.Doctors have been resorting to what is called ‘orbital decompression’ in medical terms. “The bony socket in which eye fits is the orbit. Fungal infection leads to pressure, leaving the part swollen. We do an endoscopic surgery reaching the orbit through nasal route and clear the infection. If that is not enough, a small cut on the orbit from outside helps,” said Dr Shweta Lohiya, ENT surgeon who operated patents like Shaikh.Reaching the doctor in time helps, said Dr Atul Kamble, an eye surgeon who is also part of the team. However, the fungus’s behaviour is unpredictable, as at times it spreads too fast hardly leaving any scope.Shaikh contracted Covid-19 last month but managed treatment at home . Yet, he ended up with mucormycosis. “Some days after recovering from Covid, there was a bulge in the eyes. After seeing a doctor in Chandrapur, I got admitted in Nagpur without wasting any time,” he said.Anil Meshram from a village in Pandurna Tehsil in Madhya Pradesh had a similar problem. The 42-year-old also had a bulging eye after a week of recovering from Covid. Meshram’s eye could be saved through orbit decompression. “A portion of this facial bone was removed hampering his speech. He will soon get a prosthetic for that,” said Lohiya.Anil Chakunde also made it to the hospital in a couple of days after getting a swollen eye. It was too late in his case, however. The problem was reported on May 19, tests were done next day, said his wife.“Within 12 hours, the infection had gone beyond repair and his one eye had to be removed. Sometimes, the fungus barely gives any reaction time,” said Kamble.Yet, as many as 40 patients could be saved with orbital decompression, he said. This was confirmed by another doctor who requested anonymity.“Awareness among the patients has led to early reporting to the doctor. With this, the patients are treated at the ENT surgeon’s stage only. Even if the infection has reached the orbit, it can be shaved off preventing eye removal,” said Mohan Majumdar, president of Ophthalmologists Society of Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/docs-see-ray-of-hope-to-salvage-vision-of-mucor-patients/articleshow/83494371.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Vijayawada||Black and red rice grow popular among Andhra Pradesh’s paddy farmers||VISAKHAPATNAM: The increasing demand for black and red rice has led to a gradual increase in cultivation of the exotic and nutritious crops in parts of Andhra Pradesh. Paddy farmers in parts of the state see the rising demand as a major opportunity to rake in profits and these alternative rice varieties fetch better prices than conventional white rice. As per estimates, more than 1,000 farmers are engaged in cultivation of black and red rice. The agriculture department has been encouraging farmers to cultivate these rice varieties through natural farming in parts of Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur and a few other districts. Black rice or Kala Batti is, as the name suggests, black in colour which turns to purple upon cooking. The purple colour is due to the rice’s anthocyanin content. Black rice contains more vitamins and minerals than white rice and is also rich in fibre and has anti-carcinogenic properties, says K Prakash, assistant director of agriculture and district project manager of natural farming. Similarly, red rice or Ratna Chodi is rich in iron, said Prakash adding that farmers started cultivating these rice varieties nearby a year ago. Now, these exotic rice varieties are cultivated in around 200 acres land in Vizianagaram district. “Soon, more farmers will fancy growing black and red rice,” Prakash added. Muralikrishna, a farmer who grows black rice, said, “I came to know about the benefits of black rice and its market value and decided to experiment on some land. The input cost for growing the variety is low and the return is good as there is high demand.” Muralikrishna has decided to promote farming of Kala Batti among his peers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/black-and-red-rice-grow-popular-among-andhras-paddy-farmers/articleshow/83467118.cms||Nalla.Babu

---||Goa||In peak of 2nd wave in Goa, 99.6% of those who died weren’t fully vaccinated||PANAJI: As vaccinations opened on Sunday to the 18+ age group, it has emerged that those who succumbed to Covid-19 during the pandemic’s deadly second wave were largely unvaccinated. Directorate of health services (DHS) data revealed that over 90% of those who died of Covid over a 42-day period from April to June hadn’t taken a single dose of the vaccine despite several of them being eligible for it. Of the 1,798 fatalities during this period, vaccination data wasn't available for 166. Among the rest, only six of the fatalities — 0.4% — were fully vaccinated. However, it is yet to be ascertained whether two weeks had passed after they were administered their second dose, the period after which sufficient antibodies are formed to fight the virus. DHS medical officer Dr Prashant Suryavanshi said that the six persons who succumbed were highly comorbid. Some had diabetes and hypertension along with other co-morbidities. The youngest, who was 44, had diabetes and acute coronary syndrome. A little under 10% of the fatalities — 157 persons — had taken the first dose of the vaccine. The data, from April 24 to June 7, shows 1,798 deaths, 1,469 of whom were unvaccinated. “We can say for certain that most of those who died of Covid-19 during the second wave weren’t vaccinated,” Suryavanshi said. The unvaccinated, however, also include citizens in the younger age group for whom vaccinations had not begun. “Now that vaccination is open for everybody over the age of 18 without any prior registration, people should avail of it. Mortalities due to Covid will surely decrease if people take the vaccine.” Although vaccine beneficiaries will continue to get infected with the novel coronavirus, it will reduce the severity of the infection. “Vaccination can never be fool-proof, but the chances of turning serious and requiring hospitalisation reduces to a great extent. Ultimately, we have to see that a person does not die of Covid,” he said. He said that this has been seen in the context of healthcare workers in the state — a large number of doctors, nurses and paramedical staff have been protected from severe Covid-19 infection during the second wave after being vaccinated. Healthcare providers also advised against breaking Covid-19 protocol when visiting vaccination centres. “People should wear two masks properly, maintain proper social distance and protect themselves, since there could be asymptomatic persons carrying the virus visiting vaccination centres. It’s everyone’s responsibility to stay safe,” a healthcare provider said. Meanwhile, the Opposition squarely blamed the BJP government for the second wave deaths, saying the government failed on several fronts to protect the interest of the citizens against the deadly virus. They said that authorities failed to create the necessary infrastructure for the second wave, kept borders open, allowed tourists in in the name of economy, failed to heed to the call for restrictions/lockdown, and to add to that, indulged in politics over oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-peak-of-2nd-wave-99-6-of-those-who-died-werent-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/83494314.cms||Lisa Monteiro

He said that the petroleum and natural gas ministry has invited bids for development of oil and gas fields at Vadatheru in the Cauvery basin on June 10. “The identified area for auction falls in the Cauvery basin and also in the Protected Agricultural Zone declared by the state government, under the Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act, 2020,” he said adding that the legislation prohibits any new exploration, drilling and extraction of oil and natural gas and other similar hydrocarbons from the zone.

The reports recommend reforms in various sectors. However, these reports are merely gathering dust since being submitted and awaiting implementation. Interestingly, as per details tabled before the assembly, the government has now constituted another committee, led by chief secretary V P Joy, “to examine” the reports submitted by the commission since August 2017, and “implement the recommendations in a time-bound manner”. The government had spent Rs 10.79 crore from August 18, 2016 till April 30, 2021, when the commission formally demitted office. The commission submitted its first report in August 2017, which was on reforming the vigilance system in the state. In 2018, the commission submitted two reports — capacity development of civil servants in the state in March and a report on welfare to rights in October. In August 2019, the commission submitted another report on civil services in the state. In 2020, the commission submitted three reports that included the report titled “towards people-centric service delivery” in March, second report on welfare to rights in September, and report on “public infrastructure- development and management” in November. In 2021, the ARC submitted five reports. These include reports on “accountability and public grievance redress mechanism in the government” and “e-governance for better governance” in two volumes (in January), “people-centric service delivery in local self-government institutions”, “finance and planning” and “secretariat reforms” (in February). In its first report on vigilance reforms, the commission had recommended setting up of a state vigilance commission with statutory powers that can supervise, advise and recommend appropriate action on the investigation reports by the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau in the state. It had also submitted a draft act to set up an independent three-member vigilance commission to be headed by a person who has served or is currently serving as a high court judge for a minimum of five years. In its final report on secretariat reforms, the commission had suggested several reforms in the secretariat, including regrouping functionally-similar government departments for effective and optimal performance, which at present are staggered under various secretaries. The fourth administrative reforms commission was constituted by appointing V S Achuthanandan as the chairman of the commission, in the rank of a cabinet minister in the state. The other members included former chief secretary C P Nair as a full-time member, and former IAS officer Neela Gangadharan as its part-time member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/vs-led-panels-reports-gathering-dust/articleshow/83492943.cms||KP Saikiran

The intensity of rainfall is expected to reduce from June 17 till June 19. On these days, the city is likely to get light intensity (2.5mm to 15.5mm) rainfall over the city. “An off-shore trough is currently prevalent between north Maharashtra and Kerala. Due to an already existing low pressure system, the westerly winds blowing in from the Arabian sea has strengthened from Friday. These systems are collectively responsible for intensifying the effects of monsoon over parts of Konkan, Goa and Madhya Maharashtra region, which includes Pune. As a result, the city and district areas are expected to get rainfall throughout the week,” said a senior IMD official. The met department has warned of intense to very heavy rain (64.4mm to 204.4mm ) over the ghat sections till June 16. “There is a high chance of low visibility and formation of potholes due to continuous heavy rainfall. Commuters travelling through the ghat section need to be extra cautious for the next few days,” added the official. In the city limits, there are chances of uprooting of trees and accumulation of water in low-lying areas, said met officials. On the progress of monsoon, a senior IMD official said almost the entirety of Maharashtra has been covered by the monsoon and it is active all over the state. On Sunday, the weather condition was overcast for some hours in the morning. Towards the afternoon, however, it remained mostly sunny. No rainfall was recorded in Shivajinagar and Lohegaon observatories till late in the evening. The day temperature for coming days would hover around 27-28°C in the city. Although monsoon arrived in Pune three days before the scheduled date, the season’s rainfall in the city till date is 56.9mm, which is less than the usual of 63.7mm. Met officials said June is expected to witness more rainfall than is normal and warned of more rain in the district in the coming days.

---||Faridabad||Murder case against seven Faridabad cops over custodial death||GURUGRAM: Seven Faridabad cops have been named in an FIR invoking murder charges against them for allegedly torturing a 24-year-old youth picked up in a cybercrime case in custody. The youth, Nuh resident Junaid, died 10 days later. The FIR, filed in Nuh, names sub-inspectors Rajesh and Surjit, assistant sub-inspector Narendra and Javed, head constables Naresh and Dalbir and an SHO, Basant. The case was filed after Junaid’s relatives and neighbours thronged Bichhor police station in Nuh on Saturday, set a vehicle on fire and blocked several roads, demanding exemplary punishment for the cops. Junaid and five others were picked up by the cyber cell of Faridabad police on May 31 when they were returning home from a wedding in Rajasthan. All of them were allegedly taken to Faridabad, but no FIR was filed. Junaid’s mother, Khatija, alleged that her son had been kept in police custody overnight and beaten up by the cops. She claimed that on June 1, Junaid’s brother Irshad went to Faridabad to get him released. “They made him (Irshad) sign on several blank papers,” Khatija said in her statement to the cops. Junaid had multiple injuries. After he came back home, according to Khatija, he started complaining of acute pain and was examined by a local doctor. His condition, however, kept deteriorating. Junaid was taken to a local health centre on June 11. The family approached the sub-divisional magistrate and got a medical test done to ascertain the nature of his injuries. Juanid died while being taken to a private hospital in Hodal that day. Angry over his death, Junaid’s relatives and other villagers marched to Bichhor police station on Saturday and demanded action against the cops. They torched a police vehicle and blocked roads. A day after the protest, the FIR was filed against the Faridabad cops under sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC at Bichhor police station. A second FIR for rioting was lodged against 200 people in connection with the protest and torching of a police vehicle. Nuh SP Narender Bijarniya confirmed the FIRs. “Investigation is under way,” he said. A Faridabad police spokesperson said the allegations against the cops were baseless, concocted and motivated and lies were being peddled to cover up for crimes. The police statement said Junaid had a kidney ailment. He was rounded up with Shahid, his cousin, alleged kingpin of a cyber fraud racket that has defrauded hundreds of people. Junaid was handed over to his family within hours when he was not found to be involved, the police statement said, adding his two brothers – Azad and Irshad – were found to be active members of the gang on further investigation and arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/murder-case-against-7-fbd-cops-over-custodial-death/articleshow/83494422.cms||---

The police had arrested the tantric — Kisan Asaram Pawar (41) of Hiwarkheda in Jalna district — on June 3 on the charge of cheating a fabrication operator from Pune of Rs52 lakh. “Pawar is an illiterate man. Meanwhile, all three complainants, who approached the police are well-educated people at respectable positions in the state government and private companies,” deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Shrinivas Ghadge, said. Ghadge said, “The police arrested Pawar’s four aides last week — Krishna Asaram Solanke (33), Baban Asaram Solanke (35) and Vijay Uttam Chavan (42), all from Jalna, and Kailas Ramdas Solanke (22) of Ahmednagar.” “We have recorded statements of three new complainants and they will be merged with the FIR. We are expecting to get more complaints against the arrested men,” Ghadge said. The fabrication unit operator gave Rs52 lakh to the tantric and paid visits to him at Jalna several times. “There was no ‘currency notes rain.’ The victim then demanded his money back from Pawar but he did not budge. So, the victim approached the police,” the police said. Ghadge added, “The complainant and other victims came to know about tantric through mutual friends, with the Solanke brothers spreading the word around. They even painted a picture of how currency notes fall during tantric’s magic performance.” “After arresting Pawar and his accomplices, the police have seized bags full of currency notes from their possession. However, the notes say ‘Children Bank of India’ and closely resemble the actual currency notes,” Ghadge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-get-3-more-cheating-plaints-against-tantric-aides/articleshow/83494394.cms||---

The distribution of seeds in advance and routine farm-related advisories have also aided the farmers who are now hoping to reap a good harvest this year. Monsoon entered Jharkhand on Saturday via Sahibganj and Pakur districts. On Sunday, it covered almost all districts except a few on the western flank of the state but they, too, would get covered in the next two to three days, officials said. Close to 200mm pre-monsoon rain was witnessed this year from mid-March to the end of May and it has enriched the farmlands with sufficient moisture content suitable to begin sowing. Talking to TOI, a senior agro-meteorologist at Birsa Agriculture University (BAU), A Wadood, said that farmers have begun sowing across large parts in the state. “The BAU as well as the state agriculture department have been regularly issuing pre-sowing advisories to our farmers to help them ready their fields on time. Good pre-monsoon rains turned out to be boon for farmers as a result of which we are seeing commencement of sowing in June itself,” Wadood said. “The quality and quantity of the yield are directly dependent on timely sowing. Before 2020, by the end of July, we used to have 25-30% sowing coverage and by the end of August or early September, we used to touch 80-85%. The acute heat and poor pre-monsoon rain used to harden the fields and make it difficult for farmers to plough. We can expect a bumper harvest this year, too, like last year owing to good climatic conditions,” he said. Last year, the state had recorded paddy harvest of over 50 lakh tonnes. Paddy is cultivated on about 18 lakh hectares in Jharkhand while about 3.12 lakh hectares are under maize cultivation and 6.12 lakh hectares under pulses. Figures from the state agriculture department suggest that till June 12, direct sowing on about 7,000 hectare has been completed. A department official said, “We are aiming to touch 80% sowing coverage by the end of July. Since seed distribution begun in mid-May, we are hoping that farmers are almost in the last phases to prepare their fields to begin sowing. As far as Covid protocols are concerned, we are also advising everyone through our regular farm bulletins to maintain appropriate behaviour such as keeping social distancing and using masks while working in the fields.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/kharif-sowing-begins-with-first-showers-of-monsoon/articleshow/83492448.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Mission Zindagi: Friends who help save lives across country during pandemic||RANCHI: A group of friends who started a Facebook page named “Covid Warriors-Mission Zindagi” has now been able to increase their members to 90 and help hundreds of families ravaged by the Covid-19 virus across the country within a short time. Himanshu Pradeep Kalia, an alumnus of Xavier Labour Research Institute (XLRI) Jamshedpur, and his friends in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad started the Facebook page on April 18. Soon after, they have members from Delhi, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Hyderabad, Darbhanga and even Singapore and the USA. During the initial days, they helped Covid patients and their family members by providing real-time information. “During the peak of the second wave, there was a crisis of all medical facilities, be it beds in finding hospital beds or availability of oxygen cylinders, plasma or lifesaving drugs. So, our small contribution was to collect information about their availability and post the details on our Facebook page,” Himanshu said. Once people knew about the effort being made by the group, they started sending queries to the group. “We had to create a google sheet with details of inquiries that we received soon after and started allotting responsibility to our members attend to the requirement,” said Sundaram Ojha, a PhD scholar based in Ranchi. In the meantime, the Covid warrior group saw an increase in the number of members as more people volunteered to help those families in need. One such volunteer is Medha Hossain of Dhanbad, who came forward to take the responsibility in her area and provided information about bed availability or search for plasma donors. “We had to constitute a data handling team in which Amar of Jamui in Bihar and Sanchet worked during day time for around 12 hours to collect requirements and allot the responsibility to the volunteers. A column was kept yellow till the requirement was resolved,” said Himanshu, explaining the functioning of the group. During night hours, data handling was done by Shruti Parveen and Pallavi, who lived in the USA as it suited their working hours. The group members said they often felt the need for financial support to help the families who had limited means. “We also got people in our team who helped with medicines and oxygen concentrators. Singapore-based author Nandini Sen Mehra had been helping people with medicines and sponsoring oxygen cylinders, too,” Himanshu said. Another group member from Ranchi, Sundaram Ojha, said since she worked as an RJ early in her career, she found it very convenient to talk to people over the phone and comfort them, till the time her team members arranged the requirements. She said, “We have lined up plasma donation for several dozen families in Ranchi as it seemed many people were ready to donate plasma and help but it was not that easy in other cities.” Ojha further said while interacting regularly with the family of the patients, she often developed an emotional connection. “I still feel bad for Rizwan of Lucknow who’s nephew Junaid had contacted us. We had arranged donors but for some reason, the plasma could not be provided and after around five days, Rizwan succumbed to the virus,” Ojha said, describing it as a collective failure of the group. Puja Dutta, who joined Mission Zindagi from Delhi on the very first day, went to attend an elderly woman in Vikaspuri Delhi after the group shared details. “We were shocked to find that the elderly woman’s grandson was reluctant to allow volunteers to provide her the oxygen cylinder and Puja had to struggle hard to convince him,” Ojha said. Amar, who was entrusted with data handling, could not find any volunteer to help a woman with an oxygen cylinder. “So, he to drive down to Darbhanga from Jamui in his car with an oxygen cylinder and a regulator. The woman had lost her husband to Covid just a few days ago and the family was clueless on how to arrange medical support,” Ojha said. With Covid cases declining everywhere, the group is now attending to fewer cases and most of them are still related to post-Covid complications, leads about doctors and arranging delivery of medicines through online apps, she added. Himanshu said many people who were assisted by their group later volunteered to join them. “Today, we are a strong team, sufficient in terms of fund and now planning to reach out to residents of Bharaich in UP, my hometown, with logistical support,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mission-zindagi-friends-who-help-save-lives-across-country-during-pandemic/articleshow/83492589.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

A team from Hazaribag police had already brought Singh back from Jammu after seeking his custody on transit remand. Singh has several murder cases registered against him in Hazaribag, Ramgarh, Ranchi and Chatra districts. The accused is a resident of Udhampur in Jammu and had availed voluntary retirement from the Army after carrying out the shootout and was living a settled life cultivating his fields. Sources on condition of anonymity revealed that Singh was serving as a commando in the elite 4 Parachute Commando Battalion stationed at Udhampur at that time. However, they did not reveal how the accused came in contact with the conspirators. Jammu SSP Chandan Kohli said the accused was hired by members of a rival gang for his sharp-shooting skills and was paid a hefty amount to carry out the attack. “A specific information was received by Jammu police a few days back after which an operation was launched in RS Pura area of Jammu and a man identified as Avtar Singh, son of Naseeb Singh of Udhampur, was questioned for a suspicious bullet injury on his foot," he said. "Initially, he shared no valuable information but on sustained questioning, the accused started to spill the beans and confessed that he was involved in the Hazaribag court shootout and had received the bullet injury in the incident,” the SSP said. During questioning, the accused told the police that in 2015 he was serving in the Army when some people approached him and offered a hefty amount to eliminate Sushil Srivastava, after which they planned the shootout in the Hazaribag court complex with an AK-47 rifle. “The accused claimed that he had escaped from the court complex after the incident but was shot in the foot in retaliatory police firing," the SSP said. “After the shootout, he was paid a hefty amount by the people who had planned the incident and later he availed voluntary retirement from the Army and was living a life away from his criminal past until Jammu police managed to trace and arrest him. One more shooter hired to carry out the crime is yet to be arrested and a manhunt is going on to find him,” Kohli added. Investigators in other intelligence agencies on condition of anonymity revealed that the second accused had also served in the special forces. The SSP added that Jharkhand Police were informed about the arrest, after which a team of cops reached Jammu and took custody of the accused, who is now being taken to Jharkhand for further investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/ex-army-man-nabbed-in-jammu-for-2015-hbag-court-shootout/articleshow/83492937.cms||Abhijit Sen
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Weekend lockdown spoils non-veg items’ stock, vendors rue losses||JAMSHEDPUR: The 38-hour-long weekend lockdown clamped has spoilt a large volume of stocks of non-vegetarian items like chicken, mutton and fish, many vendors here rued on Sunday. They, however, appreciated the government for enforcing the lockdown to curb the Covid-19 infection and hoped to do brisk business from this week. Raj Kumar, who owns a broiler chicken shop in Kadma market and sells over 300kg on Sundays, said, "The purpose of the complete lockdown was to prevent further spread of the virus and we need to honour and accept it. I am hoping to make up the loss this week." Similarly, mutton shop vendor Rakesh Kumar said the volume of sales on weekends is more in comparison with weekdays. "Sundays being a holiday for the working families, many prefer to prepare non-veg items and my business picks up to nearly double on these days," he said. Fish vendor Chandan Ghosh said small traders like him sell about 50 kg of fish on Sunday alone. He added that a Bistupur wholesaler who ordered four fish-laden trucks is yet to unload the stock. Meanwhile, some fruit vendors allegedly tried to create a ruckus in the Bistupur fruit market opposing the weekend lockdown but Bistupur police station officer-in-charge, Vishnu Rout, denied any such incident. Some vendors and shopkeepers also tried to open their shops in the early hours but police shut them down. The top brass of the police and civil administration was seen enforcing the lockdown. All officials at checkpoints also actively examined e-passes of people who are out on the streets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/weekend-lockdown-spoils-non-veg-items-stock-vendors-rue-losses/articleshow/83493008.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: 45% of population in 10 districts positive before 2nd wave: Sero survey||RANCHI: Nearly 45% of the population in 10 districts of Jharkhand had already been infected by Covid-19 before the second wave of the deadly pandemic struck the state in late March, a seroprevalence survey conducted by the state government has said. The seroprevalence survey, conducted by the state department of health, medical education and family welfare, in Bokaro, Dhanbad, East Singhbhum, Dumka, Garhwa, Hazaribag, Khunti, Palamu, Ranchi and West Singhbhum has shown that 44.74% of all the people who were screened had Covid-19 antibodies. Undertaken between February 4 and February 26 this year, the survey had screened nearly 4,000 people, including people from high-risk groups. Of these 10 districts, Bokaro had the highest seroprevalence (57.65%) while West Singhbhum had the lowest (24.3%). In Ranchi, one of the worst-affected districts, nearly 52% of the population had Covid-19 antibodies by the end of February. The seroprevalence in East Singhbhum was nearly 57%. “Based on the survey report, it can be assumed that the infection was spread among nearly half of Jharkhand’s population. In other words, the remaining 55% of the state’s population are vulnerable and still at the risk of getting affected,” the health department concluded in its report. In the second wave of the pandemic, Jharkhand saw over 2.17 lakh positive Covid-19 infections between April and May and a little over 3,500 deaths. The department has also concluded that since the state reached its peak of infections of the first wave on September 20 last year, the antibodies in the people may have weaned off with time, indicating that the population may have been re-infected in the second wave. A health official also expressed similar views. “The prevalence of antibodies implies that a person was infected, but it doesn’t mean that he or she will not be affected by the diseases caused by the virus. There are several factors for Covid-19 causing mortality such as co-morbidities, low immunity or underlying health complications in the infected person and delayed medical care among others,” said the official requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/45-of-popn-in-10-dists-ve-before-2nd-wave-sero-survey/articleshow/83492946.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Vadodara||Cops struggle to ascertain if 19-year-old was gangraped||Vadodara: Was the 19-year-old girl raped by only one of the accused or was she assaulted by both? The police investigating the case said that though they have booked both her accused co-workers for raping the girl, only the FSL tests will prove how many were involved in the crime. “We have got traces of semen from the girl’s body so it is established that the accused got physical with her. But we will have to wait for FSL test reports to ascertain if the semen is only of one of the accused or both. If we find two semen samples, then it would be a clear case of gang rape,” said a senior police official involved in the investigation. Cops said that accused Dishant Kahar has already admitted his crime, but the other accused Nazeem Mirza is denying. “Dishant said that it was consensual, but he is lying. Nazeem even claimed that he didn’t have liquor but we have an eyewitness who saw him drunk. Nazeem has denied raping the girl,” the official told TOI. Investigators said that even if Nazeem may not have raped the girl, he is equally guilty of the crime. “He was the one who brought the liquor that was given to the girl. He was well aware of the plan to get her drunk and then rape her. When Dishant raped the girl, he was in the room so his complicity in the ghastly crime is clear,” the official added. The girl, a resident of Laxmipura area, had told her boyfriend that she was touched without her permission and was raped. She resisted but was too tipsy to ward off the accused. In her suicide note too she mentioned that ‘something bad’ had happened with her. The police have said that Dishant and Nazeem, both colleagues of the girl, were trying to woo the girl for last couple of months. “They had been prying on her. It was a pre-planned rape,” the police said.

While weathermen maintained that the actual onset of monsoon in the state is usually between June 10-12, it often came two to three days late in the last one decade since 2009. However, in 2020 and this year, officials said that the monsoon has lashed the state before June 15. According to the weather bulletin, the state received good rainfall for the past three days including Sunday. Since June 1, the state recorded a cumulative downpour of 73.44mm against the normal rainfall of 51.1mm, officials said. “The state is expected to receive good rains in the next four to five days and monsoon is likely to be even everywhere here. So far the surplus is 44%,” said Abhishek Anand, a weather scientist at IMD (Ranchi). The IMD bulletin further added that a low pressure area over north-west Bay of Bengal coupled with a cyclonic circulation is likely to move west-northwestward across Odisha, Jharkhand and north Chhattisgarh during the next couple of days. As per the bulletin, Palamu has witnessed 154% surplus rain, followed by 147% in Ranchi and 138% in Lohardaga. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that three youths got stranded in Basa river in Gumla district due to sudden flash floods.

---||Nagpur||Too many pills adding to physical and psychological burden of seniors||Nagpur: Advanced age brings many physiological and psychological complications and Covid has only made them worse. Already dependent upon a variety of medications, post-Covid complications have now added to the list aggravating the situation doctors call ‘polypharmacy’. While some consider ‘polypharmacy’ a bane, others feel there is no option but to address the health issues with adequate medicines to save life. Amid the raging debate revolving polypharmacy, psychiatrists feel the senior citizens need much care and love especially from the caregivers at home. Dr Nitin Gupta, consultant primary care physician, diabetologist and also specially trained for geriatric complications, said elderly seemed to have faced the worst during Covid pandemic with loss of life, spouse and also much worse health complications than others. “I am seeing many elderly patients whose sugar level have shot up post-Covid. They are also facing problems like pulmonary fibrosis among others,” said Dr Gupta.“All these complications have increased their medications manifold which has just added on to the treatments already on. This is leading almost all elderly patients to polypharmacy,” he said. “It has become difficult for them to take almost 20-25 or even more pills per day without getting confused and making mistakes,” said the physician based on his recent experiences. Dr Gupta added polypharmacy was not only adding to the ‘pill burden’ but also aggravating the ‘bill burden’. “The standardization of the discharge prescriptions without or with minimum individualization is one of the reasons behind polypharmacy. I am trying to modify their prescriptions, cut down on the drugs having similar actions, adding fruits and vegetables instead of multivitamins or immune-boosters and suggesting yoga, pranayama and aerobics instead as much as possible,” said Dr Gupta. Physician Dr Sharad Deshmukh, who has been treating many seniors, stated the multiple guidelines of the government, different medical and research bodies were responsible for polypharmacy as each of the protocol has its own therapies that doctors try to follow. “Though there is low evidence of efficacy, still their usage is wide and rampant. The most common misuse of drugs is that of the antibiotics,” he said. Dr Deshmukh added psychological disturbances were most prevalent in the elderly after Covid. “Many times, the elderly patients are scared of heart diseases and come with complaints of breathing difficulty, shortness of breath but without many physiological reasons. The cause seems psychological or anxiety,” he said adding that headaches, loss of odour, abdominal issues and respiratory damages are common. Noted physician Dr Nikhil Balankhe argued that polypharmacy was required to fight multiple post-Covid symptoms and complications. “Most geriatric patients have many comorbidities that must be addressed simultaneously. Their immune power or resistance is low. Hence, gravity of post-Covid complications is bigger,” he said.“Some elderly patients may get confused with drugs due to dementia but all those prescribed drugs are important to tackle life-threatening conditions,” said Dr Balankhe.Well-known psychiatrist Dr Sudhir Bhave said the caregivers must be more sympathetic and compassionate. “Acceptance is the key. I counsel the senior citizens to accept the fact that they would need certain medicines though too many of them have side-effects but the optimum use cannot be ignored,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/too-many-pills-adding-to-physical-and-psychological-burden-of-seniors/articleshow/83494447.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand train passengers stranded during weekend lockdown||RANCHI: Passengers of the Indian Railways, who arrived at Ranchi railway station from within and outside Jharkhand on Sunday morning, were highly inconvenienced with the absence of road transports to their onward destinations. CNG fired auto rickshaws, electric rickshaws and private taxis though were parked in their respective stands at the station, their drivers to entertain the passengers citing intense police checking at various intersections of the state capital. Kamal Saha, who arrived from Kolkata at 5:30am, was sitting on the steps of the station’s main entrance with his two heavy trolleys. Saha, who works for a private water treatment plant installation company, is on an office errand to Ramgarh. “I tried booking a taxi but all of them refused stating that a total lockdown is in effect across Jharkhand today and if they embark on a journey, the cops might frisk them and impose hefty penalties,” he said. At around 11:45 am, Saha rang up his colleagues in Ramgarh and urged them to send a vehicle. From the moment she disembarked from the Rajdhani Express, Shweta Tiwari was in a tearing hurry to reach a private superspecialty hospital in Booty More to meet an ailing relative. She approached an auto driver, who was reluctant at first. “Madam, you have to pay Rs 600. If the cops stop us anywhere, I will drop you there itself and you will have to walk the rest of the distance,” her driver demanded. Helpless, Tiwari agreed. Mandar-bound Rajesh Tirkey took cover at the steps of the footover bridge from the heavy rains. Struggling to book a cab online, he turned to a fellow passenger from the Rajdhani Express. “Why aren’t cabs available?” Tirkey asked, only to know the cabs did not hit the road due to the lockdown. Shabnam Bano, who reached Ranchi from Jamshedpur on board the Tatanagar Ranchi passenger, began a long march for her home in Hindpiri, struggling to pull her trolley and manage her two year old daughter at the same time. “The autos refused to give me a ride. My husband is away at work and there is no one to come and pick us up,” she said. “Though the government has allowed us to ferry passengers from the station, the checking today is intense. Many of us have been fined by the traffic cops for not complying with the guidelines. Why should we take the risk then?” Mahesh Yadav, an auto driver, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/train-passengers-stranded-during-weekend-lockdown/articleshow/83492658.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||GST rate cut in Ranchi to benefit patients in private hospitals, say health professionals||RANCHI: Health professionals here have welcomed the announcement of the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to cut GST rates on medical items being used for Covid-19 treatment till September 30 this year. Experts said the tax reductions announced on medication and equipment used for Covid-19 treatment will provide some relief to patients and their kin by reducing medical bills in private healthcare centres. Talking to TOI, critical care expert and Rims professor Dr Pradip Bhattacharya said: “We have been providing all kinds of drugs and life-saving equipment to our patients for free, so the Union government’s decision will not affect us. Having said that the exemption of GST on a few drugs like Amphoterricin-B and Tocilizumab will make those medicines easily available with the retailers as they are no longer required to face the GST hassle before procuring and selling them.” On being asked about any tariff changes at the Rims paying ward due to the cut in taxes, the public relation officer of Rims, Dr D K Sinha said: “We only levy lodging charges from Covid-19 patients admitted at the paying ward and the medication and other costs are borne by the state government. So the treatment cost of our patients will not get affected.” TOI also spoke to people who were admitted to private hospitals and they said that the reduction of taxes will definitely help them. “One of my family members was admitted to a leading private hospital in Ranchi after developing black fungus infection and we were paying around Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000 daily. The reduction in taxes will surely help us in reducing our bills as the medicines and equipment used will become cheaper. I would request the government to extend the relief till the end of pandemic and not just for three months,” Nitish Kumar, a Jamshedpur resident, said. Meanwhile, doctors treating mucormycosis (black fungus) patients said the waiver on Amphoterricin-B will surely help the patients and their kin. Senior ophthalmologist Dr Anindya Anuradha said: “It is a very good decision by the government as it will not only reduce the prices but will also provide the much-needed boost to its availability as more and more medicine suppliers will try to procure the medicine and make it available.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/gst-rate-cut-to-benefit-patients-in-pvt-hosps-say-health-professionals/articleshow/83492972.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Over the last one year, different organizations representing parents have been formed to take up issue related to school fees. Mohd Shahid Sharif, one of the education activists present there, said, “Recently, the state government has reduced RTE reimbursements by 50%. I believe it has been done because even government knows that schools are not incurring as much expenses as before. Similarly, we are demanding that a minimum 50% fee reduction must be done by all schools.” Sandeep Agrawal, who too represents a parents group, alleged that authorities are in cahoots with school managements. “It has become clear that the government administration is serving the interest of private school managements rather than of parents. We have been raising this issue since a long time and it’s but natural that fee should be reduced. Also, many schools are forcing parents to buy books from campus, which is illegal,” said Agrawal. Parents from different schools were present in black attire, to mark their protest visually too. Banners were displayed with school names and demands to reduce the fee. Sharif said, “Schools are not following Parents-Teachers Association forming norms and that’s why school fees are being increased arbitrarily. We want the government to ensure that schools function in a transparent way, just like a charitable organization. Instead, commercialization of education has become the norm. We shall continue with our protests at different levels to ensure that parents get relief,” said Sharif.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/parents-protest-seek-50-cut-in-school-fees/articleshow/83494482.cms||---

Viky Bohra, 37, pleaded guilty in November 2020, admitting that between 2016 and 2018, he used inside information he obtained from his wife, then an employee in Amazon’s finance department, to place trades in Amazon stock, making a profit of $1,428,264, according to a release from the US attorney. US Attorney Tessa Gorman said, “This case should stand as a warning to those who try to game the markets with insider trading: there is a heavy price to pay with a felony conviction and prison sentence.” According to records filed in the case, Bohra’s wife had access to confidential information regarding Amazon revenue and expenses. “Because of that work, Bohra and his wife were subject to blackout periods during which no Amazon stock could be traded.

Bohra’s wife was advised of insider trading policies making it clear the responsibility to safeguard confidential financial information,” the records said. Despite warnings, Bohra obtained his wife’s confidential information and traded in Amazon stock and options in accounts tied to him and his father.

The family was from Uttam Nagar in New Delhi and they were on their way home from Auraiya when the accident happened.The truck was parked on the Agra-Noida carriageway near Zero Point, police said. Rameshwar Singh, SHO, Beta-2 police station, said five people were in the car and Sonu (21) was behind the wheel. “Police got information about the accident around 5.10 am from some local people. A team reached the spot and took all the passengers of the car to Kailash Hospital in Greater Noida. Three people were declared dead there,” he said, adding that the accident happened around 4.50 am. The deceased have been identified as Sonu’s father, Pratap Singh (55), his mother, Usha Devi (50), and their relative Satpal Singh (30). Sonu and his uncle Santosh Kumar (40) are said to be in a serious condition. The car used to run for an app-based cab aggregator service at times, police said. “The person driving the car did not see the truck and rammed into it from the rear. The impact was such that the front portion of the car got completely damaged,” Singh said. “An FIR has been lodged against the truck driver under sections 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code.

The directions came after a complaint by Aires Rodrigues that the civic body was acting in violation of the CCP Act by addressing the 30 elected representatives as corporators and not councillors. “They have to be referred to as councillors,” said director for urban development Gurudas Pilarnekar while speaking to TOI. Section 5 (11) of the CCP Act defines a “councillor” as any person who is elected as a member of the Corporation. It has been noticed that many councillors would refer to themselves as corporators. Rodrigues had sought immediate action regarding the “clear violation of the provision of the CCP Act” and had asked CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes to immediately comply with the provisions of the Act. Rodrigues had criticised CCP for wrongfully designating the elected representatives as corporators and had asked secretary of Urban Development Dr Tariq Thomas to rectify the violation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/refer-to-ccp-members-as-councillors/articleshow/83494588.cms||---

In Europe, however, the total number employed dropped to 16,412, from 17,671 in the year before. Infosys expanded its workforce outside India by 7,280, of which 1,941 were fresh graduates. “This workforce brings us greater diversity of skills and experience. This initiative also significantly de-risks our operations from regulatory changes related to immigration policies,” Infosys said in its filing. Indian IT firms have increased efforts to hire locals in the last two years. Infosys has already surpassed its commitment, made in 2017, to hire 10,000 American workers. TCS has hired 21,500 employees in the US over the last five years. In the past three years, Infosys launched technology and innovation centres in the US across Indiana, North Carolina, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Texas, and Arizona. Last year, it set up a digital innovation centre in Dusseldorf in Germany and a strategic centre of excellence in Baden in Switzerland for turbomachinery and propulsion practice. Infosys said it has developed the InTap platform for its recruitment process. “Likewise, the employee joining process also had to be pivoted to allow remote joining and induction. Our Launchpad tool provides a guided flow for our new hires throughout the onboarding process, making the entire process paperless and faster, resulting in faster deployment on projects,” it said in the filing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/infosys-hired-3k-employees-in-us-in-fy21-eu-strength-dips/articleshow/83498653.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Goa||Goa industrial development corporation's coal block plans in limbo||PANAJI: Goa’s ambitious plan to extract coal from the Dongri Tal II coal block appears to be staring at a setback as the Centre has yet to agree to Goa’s plea for time to complete the formalities and pay the Rs 163.9 crore performance guarantee. It has been more than two months since Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) wrote to the Union ministry of coal asking for additional time. With no favourable reply forthcoming, the process to appoint a mine developer-cum-operator (MDO) is stuck in a limbo. Though the Dongri Tal-ll coal block was allocated to GIDC in September 2019, major milestones for the coal mine were missed as the state government dragged its feet in complying with norms laid down by the coal ministry, said sources. The Dongri-Tal II coal mine at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh has a 2.9 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity, but the state’s attempts to exploit the coal mine has been thwarted by “political tussles” and “amateurish decisions”, said a source. GIDC issued the tender to appoint a MDO for the coal mine in March and with the Centre’s deadline about to lapse, sought an extension on March 28. “We are lying low because the Centre has yet to give us an extension. There is no point going ahead with the RFP if the extension does not come through,” said a GIDC official. GIDC did organise a pre-bid meeting with potential coal mine developers and even answered some of their queries, but with no clarity about the coal block itself, GIDC has decided not to proceed with the tender process. The MDO is responsible for extracting the coal which GIDC can subsequently auction online. The MDO has to obtain requisite statutory clearances, approvals, permissions, consents and NoCs to operate the coal mine. The Dongri Tal –II coal block has been allotted by the Union ministry of coal for commercial mining to GIDC, and as per the terms of the allotment agreement, which was signed in October 2019, at least 25% of the coal extracted in a financial year has to be sold to the MSME sectors in Madhya Pradesh and balance coal to other buyers across India. The MDO will have to submit a performance guarantee of Rs 77.2 crore along with an additional performance guarantee of Rs 163.9 crore which is equivalent to the performance security that GIDC has to submit to the Union ministry of coal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gidcs-coal-block-plans-in-limbo/articleshow/83494634.cms||Newton Sequeira

Many travellers, especially senior citizens and pregnant women, have pointed out that the rumbler strips erected between Cuncolim police station and Balli on NH66 are dangerous, and urged PWD to rectify them at the earliest. A local from Canacona said that many motorists have complained of spinal problems due to the rumblers. Also, speed breakers installed at Karvem and other two places along this route in Gaondongorim, Canacona have also come in for criticism after several two-wheeler riders reportedly fell off their vehicles due to the “abnormal height” of the structures. Residents have met speaker and local MLA Isidore Fernandes, demanding an inspection to be conducted by PWD. Speaking to TOI, Subash Pagi, assistant engineer, PWD said that work of installing the rumblers is usually awarded to a contractor and the people employed for the task are qualified and experienced and work under the supervision of an officer.

Kejriwal appealed to all market associations and shopkeepers to ensure there is no overcrowding and social distancing is maintained. “They should also keep masks inside their shops so that if someone is not wearing a mask, then the shop can offer them,” he said. In the order, DDMA has directed that only one authorised weekly market, with up to 50% of the allowed vendors at normal time, would be allowed per day, per zone with compliance of standard operating procedures issued earlier. Also, no weekly market will be allowed to function on roadsides and can be only allowed to function at nearby grounds where all norms can be strictly implemented. DDMA has also instructed that random RT-PCR or Rapid Antigen Tests of vendors and customers should be carried out at weekly markets.

Lobo said that the animal husbandry department gives a subsidy of Rs 74 per day per cow for their feed and maintenance, but the amount is insufficient. “I have discussed this with the chief minister and have asked to increase the amount to Rs 150 which is likely to be done once the pandemic situation improves,” he said. He also said that there are more than 450 stray cattle which were impounded from the Calangute-Candolim area and are kept at an animal shelter at Mayem. “For some time after we impounded those cattle, the problem of stray cattle here reduced as owners started keeping them securely. But the problem has started again and farmers are complaining that these stray cattle are eating the paddy and vegetable saplings they have planted. So we will start rounding up the cattle again,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-needs-to-hike-subsidy-for-looking-after-impounded-cattle/articleshow/83495024.cms||---

People have to just go back to the hospital, produce their cards, and make the claim, the official said. “They will not be reimbursed immediately, but only after their case is uploaded by the private hospital and only after the government reimburses the hospital,” the official said. In other instances too, where Covid-19 patients couldn’t produce their DDSSY cards to the hospital during their treatment period, they can similarly get reimbursed. The government’s DDSSY covers only treatment in general wards where people admitted in twin sharing or special rooms have to pay the difference in charges. Any extra charges will have to be borne by patients. According to the government’s notification, patients are covered up to Rs 8,000 per day in general wards and up to Rs 19,200 per day in ICUs with ventilator occupancy. The package also includes admission charges, intensivist, primary and specialist consultant charges, bed charges, nursing, resident doctor, diet, PPE kits for staff, X-ray, ECG, USG, 2 D Echo, cardiac monitor, infusion pump, catheterisation, CBC, FBSI, PPBSL, HBA1c, creatinine, liver function test, blood group, routine medicine, including multivitamin, vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D, paracetamol, antacid, anti-allergic, HCQ, azithromycin, doxycycline, levofloxacin and dexamethasone, ivermectin and dietary charges. The package doesn’t include Remdesivir. After complaints from private hospitals that the government releases their payments late under DDSSY, the government has stepped up its game and settled all claims up to May 15 and also settled all approved claims that it has received up to May 31. “The government has settled the backlog,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-patients-treated-in-pvt-hosps-after-may-5-can-still-avail-of-ddssy/articleshow/83493514.cms||---

Lobo, along with acting sarpanch Sanjay Kalangutkar and local fishermen, inspected the beach to ascertain the damage done to the rubble wall along the Nerul coast. During the recent cyclone Tauktae, high waves eroded the already battered rubble wall on the beach. Lobo said he would ask the WRD minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues to examine the matter and prepare estimates for anti-erosion measures and send it to the central government for funds to execute the works. “Due to global warming, the sea water level has increased. And the damage to the rubble wall resulted in the water entering nearby houses,” Lobo said. He cited the examples of the Querim and Arambol beaches which have not had such problems after anti-erosion measures were taken up at the beaches. Nearly two decades ago, Nerul’s Coco beach had several shacks, but after the 2007 tsunami, a large area of the beach near the mouth of the Nerul river disappeared. WRD erected a rubble barricade with nylon netting along a roughly 200m stretch. It was partly effective in preventing further sand erosion, but has faced the brunt of tidal action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-calls-for-anti-erosion-steps-at-nerul/articleshow/83495124.cms||---

But for the aggrieved consumers who knock on the doors of the court, the wait for justice can be quite long. A right to information (RTI) application filed by a consumer rights activist has revealed that out of 38 consumer courts allotted by the state government, only 26 are functional and they too are badly understaffed. “I was getting a lot of complaints about the delay in hearing of cases in the consumer courts over the last couple of years. The complaints have increased since the last few months following which I filed a RTI application in May this year to get details about the appointments and vacancies in the courts. I was shocked when I got the reply recently,” said P V Moorjhani, consumer rights activist in the city. He said that all the consumer courts should have one district judge and two non-judicial members. “There should be 26 judges in the courts but only 13 have judges as of now. Also, in the 26 functional courts there should be 52 non-judicial members. But currently there are only 27 non-judicial members in these courts,” Moorjhani, who runs Jagrut Nagrik, told TOI. “As per the Consumer Protection Act, only a court with one judge and one judicial member can hear cases and deliver judgements. But in some courts, only non-judicial members are delivering judgements. Such judgements don’t have any legal sanctity and they are null and void,” Moorjhani claimed. “Why isn’t the government filling the posts in the consumer courts? What is the point in running a consumer education campaign when the consumers aren’t getting justice in time?” questioned Moorjhani. He added that if the government doesn’t act within a week, he will file a PIL. “I will plead to bring the consumer courts under the high court and the government should fill up all the vacant posts swiftly,” Moorjhani said. According to Moorjhani, Vadodara has about 5,000 cases pending in the consumer court while Ahmedabad, Surat and Rajkot each have about 4,000 pending cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/half-of-gujarats-consumer-courts-are-functioning-without-having-a-judge/articleshow/83492625.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He underscored the need for “repositioning Goa to undo the damage caused by the BJP government”. He criticised the government for turning the state into what he called a “sin city” by promoting casino culture. Taking a dig at what he called BJP’s attempts to derive political mileage from the vaccination camps, Sardesai said, “Tika Utsav is all about elections. So many people died during the ‘dark hours’ at GMC for lack of oxygen, yet the committee is yet to submit its report to the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vijai-bats-for-united-oppn/articleshow/83493604.cms||---
---||Goa||GMC’s superspecialty block has turned a lifesaver for Covid patients: Kakodkar||Panaji: The installation of a liquid medical oxygen (LMO) plant at the Goa Medical College’s (GMC) superspecialty block on a war footing has turned out to be a lifeline for Covid patients in the state. “With the installation of the LMO tank and the Covid-19 caseload reducing, not a single patient has died for want of oxygen supply,” GMC’s superspecialty block in-charge Dr Uday Kakodkar said. “Now, we have enough oxygen. Besides, one will not find a patient on the floor or stretcher or a wheelchair due to lack of a bed,” he said. In May, there were many deaths at GMC due to erratic oxygen supply in the dark hours. The high caseload in that month also led to a shortage of beds at the state’s premier medical facility. “A team of medical and administrative officials stayed put throughout the night to ensure timely installation of the oxygen tank,” Kakodkar said. Cyclone Tauktae hit the state just a day after the installation of the LMO tank was complete and that helped save the lives of the critical patients on oxygen support in the cyclone aftermath, he said. “With highways blocked, it would have difficult for tractors carrying oxygen cylinders to reach GMC in time. It could have been disastrous,” the block in-charge said. On the flak GMC drew over the spike in deaths, Kakodkar said that no doctor likes to see her or his patient die. “A doctor will do everything for the patient – this is something that is ingrained into a doctor,” he said. Kakodkar said that the superspecialty block is “comparable to the best in the country”. Opened on May 5, with just two wards and 75 Covid patients, the capacity has now been scaled up to 12 wards with 424 beds, including 3 ICUs in just 18 days. “That was the time when no beds were available even in private hospitals, and number of critical patients coming in for admissions was rising. We kept on adding wards to accommodate every patient by putting additional beds in each ward. Oxygen concentrators were used for beds without an oxygen panel,” Kakodkar said. When the caseload decreased, all those who were accommodated on floors and stretchers were shifted to the superspecialty block by a dedicated ambulance accompanied by a team of doctors and nurses, he said. “One night, we shifted 91 patients. To overcome the crisis, the medical and administrative officials worked in tandem on a war footing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gmcs-superspecialty-block-has-turned-a-lifesaver-for-covid-patients-kakodkar/articleshow/83493624.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Kochi||Kerala: Health department in Ernakulam targets 4 lakh vaccinations in a month||KOCHI: Health officials in Ernakulam have decided to roll out more vaccination centres in the district. The idea is to give four lakh doses of vaccination in a month. Officials have said that the number of centres will be increased in a phased manner. "In the past six months, we could give around12 lakh doses of vaccines. Now, we are planning to speed up the vaccination drive. We anticipate that we will get enough doses of vaccines,” said an official with the health department. The plan, according to the officials, is to conduct continuous vaccination drives in the district for the next fortnight. In Kochi Corporation's limits, the number of vaccination centres will be increased to 19. “Until Sunday, the total number of vaccination centres was eight. We plan to increase the number from Monday. This will help us to provide more vaccines within a short period,” said an official with Kochi Corporation. The local body has reportedly readied the infrastructure required for the new centres. The requirement of additional staff has also been ensured by the corporation, it is understood. There will be one vaccination centre for every cluster of five divisions of the corporation. The health department is planning to start more centres in the municipalities as well. “In the municipalities like Muvattupuzha, Perumbavoor, Aluva and Paravoor, there are only one centre each. We will increase the number of centres once the municipality authorities set up the infrastructure required for it,” a health department official said. The authorities have decided to earmark 20 percent of the vaccines to those above 60 that are yet to receive the first dose followed by those who completed 42 days and 122 days after getting the first dose of Covaxin and Covishield respectively. Street dwellers, tribespeople and NRIs leaving the state imminently, will also be inoculated. They should produce the documents to prove that they belong to the priority group. In the case of street dwellers, assurance from the representatives of NGOs that bring them to the centres will be sufficient, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-health-department-in-ernakulam-targets-4-lakh-vaccinations-in-a-month/articleshow/83498776.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The mark sheets for state board Class X students of the 2020-21 batch will just have all pass printed on them. Admission to Class XI and polytechnic colleges will be based on Class IX marks, officials said. “The director of government examinations will only print all-pass on mark sheets. We can’t give marks or grades as there was no exam,” a senior official from the school education department said. No half-yearly or quarterly exams or common tests were held for these students as schools were mostly closed due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. “Leaving school will issue a certificate for Class IX marks. Based on the marks, students will get admissions in higher classes and polytechnic colleges,” the official added. While some school principals welcomed the decision, others wanted marks or grades to be assigned based on school-level tests. “I feel the government’s decision is better. Class X can be given all passes. We have also conducted many exams and we know where the children stand. Based on those marks, we can admit our students. For outside students, we can consider their Class IX marks,” said Agnes Rita, principal, GRT Mahalakshmi Vidhyalaya HSS, Ashok Nagar. Experts suggest grades based on school testsN Vijayan, senior principal, Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Tambaram, said the school education department can consider giving marks or grades based on school-level tests. “Even CBSE has given an evaluation criteria to award marks to Class X students,” he said. P Patric Raymond, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation, said around six lakh Class X students in government schools did not write any tests during 2020-21. “The previous state government cancelled Class X board exams in February when there was no demand and Covid-19 cases were also under control. No tests or evaluations were conducted during the two months of physical classes. So, the present government has no option other than mentioning all passes to state board students,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-marks-or-grades-for-nine-lakh-all-pass-class-x-tamil-nadu-students/articleshow/83500722.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Kolkata||Costly fuel may drive private buses off Kolkata roads once curbs ease||KOLKATA: As the city is looking forward to an easing of restrictions mid-week, it might struggle with very few buses on roads because of the spiralling fuel price. Even if one-third of the workforce is allowed to attend office, a commute crisis is likely as private operators may roll out less than 5% of its fleet of 11,621 buses in the city. Kolkata will be banking on buses of state transport undertakings (STUs). The diesel price in Kolkata touched an all-time high of Rs 89.88 a litre, while petrol was inching closer to Rs 100 a litre. The private transport operators have convened a meeting on Monday and are likely to meet the state transport department officials on Wednesday. The enhanced curbs in Kolkata remain till Tuesday (June 15). This is the passenger share of a normal weekday in Kol metropolitan areaThe rising fuel cost has also hit the STUs. With mounting losses, the bus operators have demanded a revision in fare immediately, otherwise they can no longer run buses incurring losses. In the last six months, the diesel has become costlier by Rs 15.86 a litre. Since 99% of transport vehicles (commercial vehicles like buses, cabs and trucks) run on diesel, the impact of diesel price rise is far-reaching. Apart from a substantial hike in prices of essential commodities, public transport is all set to be costlier, said Ardhendu Ghosh, a transport economist. “There is hardly any other option, but to revise the fare. Under current fare structure, no bus can ply in the city. Ever since the last fare revision in 2018, we have struggled to remain afloat. Almost every aspect of bus operation has increased manifold. But successive revisions of fuel prices have left us crippled,” said Tapan Bandyopadhyay, secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC), which runs the city bus services, also faces trouble with revenue plunging to a never before level. The oil marketing firms are also refusing to sell fuel on credit as the STUs have exceeded the credit limit. “As a regular commuter, I feel bus fare should be revised rationally. Even with a slightly higher fare, a bus offers the cheapest possible transportation. If a bus goes off the road, we then end up changing two to three autos to travel the same distance, paying at least three times the bus fare,” said Tarun Das, member of United Bus Users’ Association of Kolkata. “I bought my SUV (diesel run) in January 2019, when the diesel price was Rs 64. I spent more than Rs 1.5 lakh to buy the diesel variant so that in the long run, the fuel costs remain manageable. The gap between petrol and diesel prices was yawning. But now, the vehicle, a diesel guzzler, has become a major liability. The difference between petrol and diesel price is now less than Rs 5 a litre,” said Gaurab Basu, a paediatrician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/costly-fuel-may-drive-pvt-buses-off-city-roads-once-curbs-ease/articleshow/83492457.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Now, she drives her father’s tanker truck, carrying hazardous goods, with each trip extending up to 300km. After learning to ride a two-wheeler and four-wheeler, Delisha wanted an even more challenging ride. So she decided to take the wheels of the tanker truck. For the past three years, Delisha has been driving the tanker from Kochi to Malappuram thrice a week to transport fuel from the refinery in Irumbanam to a petrol bunk in Tirur. Delisha’s story came to light two weeks ago after a motor vehicle department official stopped her tanker when she was driving to Tirur with the fuel. This happened after the department was informed by someone who saw ‘a young girl driving a tanker through the national highway during the lockdown’. The official was surprised when she showed him her heavy vehicle driving licence and the licence to carry hazardous goods. “The officials congratulated my passion and informed the media. They said my story would be a motivation to women who are scared to drive. The officials said I am probably the only woman in Kerala who has a licence to carry hazardous goods. I was surprised to know that no one has noticed me driving the tanker for the past three years,” said Delisha. Even though she learned to drive the tanker at the age of 16, Davis wanted her to wait till she got her licence. She secured the heavy and the hazardous goods licence at the age of 20. She said she found driving the tanker easier than a car and covers around 300km every trip she makes. Now, Davis accompanies her as the cleaner and the number of trips has reduced to two or three a week due to the lockdown. “My day starts at 2am. We drive to Irumbanam at 4am and return to Tirur with the load at 9.30am. After unloading the fuel, we reach home by 3pm. I attend my PG classes in the evening batch. Driving is my passion and appa supported me fully. Otherwise this would not have been possible. My dream is to drive a multi-axle Volvo bus and I am trying to get its licence,” said Delisha.

---||Vijayawada||SRLDC to emulate Andhra Pradesh’s power mapping model||VISAKHAPATNAM: The reliability group of Southern Regional Load Despatch Centre, headquartered at Bangalore, has requested the Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh to share the details of its initiative of ‘mapping power network based on ArcGIS’ (geographical information system). The innovative technology would be replicated for the entire southern grid, which connects five states and a Union Territory. According to the officials, the technology would help power grids to monitor everything, from overloading to the areas that will be at risk during natural calamities, on a real-time basis. So that the power utilities can manage and maintain transmission and distribution networks in a more effective manner. APTransco has introduced this comprehensive solution for displaying the total power network of the state on the geographical system software ‘ArcGIS’ with the support of internal teams. Forecasting of weather and load scheduling, visualising areas which could be affected during natural calamities, real-time monitoring of line patrolling, etc., are the other advantages of the ArcGIS system. APTransco has already deployed the day-ahead electricity forecasting model using artificial intelligence and machine learning with an objective to forecast next day’s electricity consumption (in Units), including day-ahead electricity demand (in MW) on every 15 minute basis. In its communication to APTransco, the reliability group of SRLDC says, “It’s very beautiful system and we would like to replicate it for the entire southern grid. For this, we request you to please share all tower locations of the 400 KV and 220KV APTransco lines”. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said that the power sector has to be both financially and technically resilient to meet the state’s electricity demand and strengthen the sector to address future requirements. “The power utilities of Andhra Pradesh have been making all out efforts in this direction as part of which they introduced several innovative initiatives. These would help the power sector and consumers as well. All these initiatives are aimed at providing quality power to the consumers,” said Srikant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/srldc-to-emulate-aps-power-mapping-model/articleshow/83490237.cms||---

Initially, there was a discussion within the party that it would be better to fill the slot with a Muslim legislator as it was vacated by MA Shariff, who represented the community. Party leaders thought that such an arrangement would not only give Jagan the image of minority friendly leader but avoid controversy. YSRC has already nominated three Muslim leaders to the legislative council and the strength of the minority legislators in both Houses has touched a record seven. “Giving three berths in the legislative council shows YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s commitment towards the uplift and political empowerment of Muslims in the state,” said Muslim United Front (MUF) leader Habib-Ur-Rehman. He said Muslim minorities have never got such a share from Seemandhra in both the houses together even in undivided AP. One of the four legislators in the assembly, Azmath Basha, is a deputy chief minister with minority affairs portfolio. “Our leader needs no lessons on empowerment of any downtrodden section either it be Muslims or BCs or SCs,” said Hafeez Khan, Kurnool legislator. Taking the preference already given to the minorities, the YSRC top leadership is contemplating to allot the council chairperson post to a SC legislator. Sources said such an arrangement would also end TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu’s claims about making Dalit leader GMC Balayogi as Lok Sabha speaker and Pratibha Bharati as assembly speaker. “Although, the SCs were the backbone of Congress for decades, it never made an SC leader speaker of assembly or chairperson of council in undivided AP. It is time for YSRC to seize the opportunity,” said retired professor N Anjaiah. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is believed to have also enquired about the equation with the party general secretaries during a recent strategy meeting. Making a Dalit legislator as council chairman is also expected to bring balance in the social and regional equations among top posts. While assembly speaker, two deputy CMs hail from north coastal region, the CM, chief whip, two deputy CMs are from Rayalaseema. While one deputy CM is from West Godavari, south coastal region has not got any plum posts except its quota in the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/legislative-council-may-be-chaired-by-dalit-leader/articleshow/83499361.cms||Samdani MN

E-seva centres, where people can obtain official certificates for various government services, can also function from Monday in these districts. Tea shops are being permitted to function from 6am to to 5pm from Monday, chief minister M K Stalin said. Only parcel services will be allowed and people are not permitted to stand near the shops and consume the brew. The state government’s decision announced on Friday to allow reopening of state-owned Tasmac liquor outlets drew sharp criticism from political parties. Social media was abuzz with people questioning the rationale behind opening Tasmac outlets and keeping tea shops shut. While opposition parties including the AIADMK and the PMK condemned the reopening of liquor shops, BJP organised state-wide protests on Sunday. Sweet shops, construction company offices allowed to open With hotels and bakeries having already been allowed to function, the state government has now permitted shops selling sweets and savouries to open from 6am to 2pm. “The agencies responsible for running e-seva centres such as TACVT, primary agriculture cooperative societies, VPRC and fisheries department should ensure that the corona appropriate behaviour is followed at these centres as per SOP,” the state IT department said in a statement. While construction activities have already been permitted, the offices of the construction firms had remained closed. This impacted disbursement of salaries and making payments for purchasing construction materials. Hence from Monday, the offices of construction companies too can function with 50% employees, the statement said. These relaxations will not apply in 11 districts – seven western and four in the delta region, which continue to report high Covid numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nod-for-e-seva-centres-tea-shops-in-27-tamil-nadu-districts/articleshow/83498859.cms||---

Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, who took to his Twitter handle on Saturday with oblique comments on how wilted leaves help a tree grow afresh, was more direct on Sunday. “Many have made it a habit to switch parties.

---||Kolkata||Bengal to keep 60% Covid beds for women ahead of 3rd wave||KOLKATA: The Bengal government is attempting to reverse the gender ratio at the 26,000 Covid beds in government and private facilities in its disposal — by allotting more beds to women than men — in an attempt to be prepared for a possible third wave of the pandemic in which more children (and, consequently, more women) are likely to be affected. The gender break-up for bed availability is now around 60:40 in favour of males, state director of health services, Ajay Chakraborty, told TOI. “We plan to reverse this, reducing the male beds and increasing the female ones until the male-female bed ratio is 40:60,” he said, adding, “Based on current data, in most cases, this new Covid variant (Delta) is affecting all members of the family. So, if children are affected, so will be their mothers in most cases. We plan to keep them together. For the few cases, when the mother is negative, or may have recovered early, we are consulting experts on precautions she should take.” This would be part of the state’s attempts to augment infrastructure, equipment and human resources before a September deadline to battle a potential third wave. “Based on worldwide data, especially Canada, it is being predicted that there would be a two-fold spike in paediatric Covid infections in the third wave, compared with the second wave,” Chakraborty said. Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services, said: “Hospital admission rates for children, compared with adults, is a lot less. During the second wave (in Bengal), when Covid cases had spiked to nearly 20,000 daily, paediatric Covid patient admissions were around 200 daily. So, assuming this will peak to 500 daily cases, we have to keep aside 5% critical care units and 10% high dependency units (HDUs). But we are targeting for a substantially larger number. We plan to scale up paediatric intensive care units (PICU) to 500 beds and HDUs to 1,000. But, most importantly, for infants who are not even a month old, separate Covid beds will be kept in the 68 special newborn care units (SNCU) and newborn intensive care units (NICU) across Bengal,” The senior health official, however, said the biggest challenge was that intensive paediatric treatment facilities were very Kolkata-centric. “So, we target to set up self-sufficient paediatric units in the districts. Six new PICUs are being set up in Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, North Dinajpur, Purulia, Rampurhat and Diamond Harbour,” he added. The Bengal government, he said, was bulk-ordering paediatric oximeters. “Adult oximeters don’t work for kids because they have smaller fingers. So, we are acquiring paediatric oximeters. These would be dispatched state-wide. We already have 80 paediatric ventilators, and we are trying to attempt to find out whether adult ventilators can be recalibrated for use in kids who are above two years old. This is being studied at Medical College Hospital,” Chakraborty said. The state will also send out paediatricians and SNCU and NICU nurses to health facilities to train healthcare workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-to-keep-60-cov-beds-for-women-ahead-of-3rd-wave/articleshow/83495337.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Principles should begin at home, TMC reminds Suvendu||Kolkata: Principles should begin at home, Trinamool Congress on Sunday reminded Suvendu Adhikari — alluding to the latter’s comments about Mukul Roy and defection and giving up elected representation in the assembly — and also asked him about his dad (Sisir Adhikari, who has not yet given up his LS seat despite publicly announcing his decision to join the BJP about five months ago). “Shouldn’t he start the sermons from his own home? Or do we have to remind him that his father is yet to submit his resignation with the Lok Sabha,” said TMC spokesperson and state general secretary Kunal Ghosh. Adhikari senior had joined the BJP in March this year at a rally of Union home minister Amit Shah. The TMC veteran had then alleged that his family was being driven out of Trinamool. On Saturday, his son and BJP’s leader of opposition Suvendu said that the state assembly was not beyond the Constitution and he would ensure that the anti-defection law was implemented here. “It is not Adhikari alone, but Bardhaman Purba MP Sunil Mandal had also joined the BJP and their switching sides calls for disqualification under the Rule 6 of the Members of Lok Sabha (disqualification on grounds of defection) Rules, 1985. The LS Speaker has said that he is looking into the papers,” Ghosh said. Sisir had, however, earlier said that he had sent two letters to the Speaker in January and May on the issue. The TMC had sent a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to demand disqualification of the two members. Earlier this month, TMC leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay called up the LS Speaker to remind him of the issue. TMC leaders claimed they had sent a few more reminders to the Speaker over the disqualification of Mandal, who had joined the BJP in January this year. On Rajib Banerjee, too, party MP Kalyan Banerjee hit out on Sunday. “His central forces had beaten TMC party workers. He had tried to inflame Domjur communally. He had attacked the chief minister. There are no leaders in Trinamool Congress. There is the senior-most leadership and there are ground level workers who toil for the party,” Banerjee said. TMC MP Saugata Roy said he had suggested a six-month cool-off period before defectors can return. “There are hardliners and soft-liners. The CM will take the final call,” he said. CM Mamata Banerjee also made this distinction before while welcoming Mukul and his son Subhrangshu back in the party. Incidentally, after meeting Ghosh on Saturday, Rajib drove to party secretary-general Partha Chatterjee’s Naktala home on Sunday evening. Chatterjee lost his 91-year-old mother who was being treated for age-related ailments. Abhishek Banerjee, the party national general secretary and senior ministers went to meet Chatterjee to offer their condolences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/principles-should-begin-at-home-tmc-reminds-suvendu/articleshow/83493734.cms||Rohit Khanna

Named after children’s favourite character, Little Singham, the app has over 2 million downloads (15% from the east) across the country since its launch in July last year. Having rolled out the app, the startup has got nearly 5,00,000 monthly users without any active marketing, its founder Prerna Jhunjhunwala told TOI. “We saw a seismic shift in students’ e-learning and other associated platforms. This is where we saw the opportunity of creating an e-learning app for the kids aged three to eight years – the fundamental years of one’s school life. Having had the closest exposure with children while building a school in Singapore, I realised that there has to be an additional way that makes learning fun-filled for toddlers,” she said. As for funding, she added, “We are bootstrapped and in conversation with India’s leading VCs (venture capital funds) to raise funds. We are targeting 10 million downloads in the next 18 months and also planning to make the app available in regional languages. India has emerged as the second largest edu-tech market after the US and the Asia Pacific continues to be its biggest driver.” Now, the startup mulls over raising capital so that they can continue coming up with new contents for kids. “When we launched the app, the downloads were happening in India only. Recently, we have seen downloads from Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan,” the founder said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ed-tech-startup-touches-over-2-mn-downloads-5l-monthly-users/articleshow/83493053.cms||Sarthak.G

Special teams have been formed to trace the Baba booked for offences punishable under Pocso Act, Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act and IPC, reports Sindhu Kannan. Baba claimed he was Krishna, asked students to strip for himThe Mamallapuram allwoman police registered the case after three cases, two of them from minors, alleged explicit harassment including molestation, intoxicating minors with alcohol and showing them pornography. One survivor told police that the Baba manipulated girl students, called them to his bungalow and asked them to strip in front of him, claiming that he was Lord Krishna and they were Gopikas. Baba, a native of Vellore, himself teaches Tamil to higher secondary students at the school, founded in 2001, police said. The complaint submitted by the survivors, said the incidents had happened a few years ago when they were studying there. It all began on June 4, when a few of the alumni took to the social media narrating their ordeal. Soon after, Saraswathi Rangasamy, chairman of the Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights (TNCPCR) inspected the school. Since the Baba was not found on the school campus, he was asked to appear before the commission on June 11 along with the teachers, who allegedly facilitated the abuse, for inquiry. However, he failed to appear before the commission. Sources in the commission said one of his staff members represented him and told the officials that he was on a spiritual tour of north India and had to be hospitalised there for a health issue.

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin may take up NEET, farm laws with PM Narendra Modi||CHENNAI: In his first official visit to New Delhi this week, after taking over as chief minister of Tamil Nadu and his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, M K Stalin is likely to press for the abolition of NEET, an entrance exam for admission to medical colleges, and repealing the three farm laws. Abolition of NEET and repealing the new farm laws were key elements of the DMK manifesto and the party’s campaign for the April 6 assembly election. Sustained and substantial supply of vaccines and Covid drugs, clearing pending GST dues, and making the IVC facility at Chengalpet operational at the earliest are a few other demands that the CM would present to PM Modi when they meet on June 17 morning. “Officials are in the process of preparing a memorandum containing around 20-25 demands to be presented to the PM by the CM. Some of them are routine demands usually made by any new government in the state, with a few others that are political and part of the ruling party’s manifesto. And NEET is a key element of their manifesto,” official sources told TOI. “We are giving a further push to activate the IVC facility, owned by Bharat Biotech, at Chengalpet at the earliest. While the CM has already written to the PM on this, the state industries minister had personally visited Delhi and apprised the need for it during his meeting with Union ministers,” official sources added. “Early in the fiscal, one is not sure how much a state can demand. But somewhere, the state government has to start asking for funds,” a senior official said. “Increasing the borrowing limit of the state to tide over the increased expenditure on account of Covid and lower revenues has been another pending demand. A few other states too have raised this demand at the recent GST council meeting,” the official added. Stalin will reach New Delhi on June 16 evening. “As per the tentative plan, the CM is likely to return to Chennai on June 18. He will utilize the opportunity to meet a few ministers, besides others, and also visit the DMK party office ‘Arivalayam’ in the capital,” a senior DMK leader said. This week’s visit is Stalin’s first official trip to New Delhi in over a decade. The last time he undertook an official visit to the capital was in February 2010 when he was the deputy chief minister and represented the state on behalf of his father (then CM M Karunanidhi) at the CMs’ meeting. Meanwhile, the Thanjavur district Cauvery Farmers’ protection association has written to Stalin, urging him to impress upon the Centre to repeal the three farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-cm-m-k-stalin-may-take-up-neet-farm-laws-with-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/83500907.cms||D Govardan

Against the earlier limit of 10 people each from the bride and groom's sides, the number has been raised to 20 each from the bride and groom's side, they said. The announcement was made by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan while addressing district crisis management groups online during the day. Chouhan said that the Corona crisis is not over yet. A third wave is likely. Caution and vigilance are required. Political, social activities, processions, and activities inviting crowds will remain prohibited. There will also be a ban on schools,colleges, sports, events in the stadium We have to be proactive to stop the third wave. The experiences of US, England and Singapore show that the infection does not spread where people stick to Corona-appropriate behaviour, but wherever behaviour remains negligent, the infection starts spreading again. While advising people to remain vigilant, he said, after 90-day lockdown in England, Covid cases have started increasing after the Unlock. “Arrangements are necessary to stop the Covid wave and reduce its intensity. Therefore, state will continue to conduct 80,000 tests in the state daily. We are making efforts to ensure that tests should be conducted in every part of every district.

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Bed occupancy falls, percentage of patients in ICUs still high||BENGALURU: While the sharp decline in overall bed occupancy across Karnataka is a welcome change from desperate cries requesting for treatment witnessed in May, the percentage of patients occupying critical-care beds, especially in Bengaluru, continues to be a cause for concern. The situation outside of the city is only better. In Bengaluru, 80% of all patients undergoing treatment under the government quota across private and public facilities are occupying critical-care beds - high dependency units (HDUs), ICUs and ICUs with ventilators - requiring oxygen. Comparatively, cumulative data for all other districts shows that around 62% of the patients in hospitals are in such beds. As of 6pm Sunday, nearly 5,700 of the 7,200+ patients undergoing treatment at hospitals are occupying such beds in Bengaluru. According to data from BBMP bed management system, 1,700 (80%) of the 2,204 patients undergoing treatment under the government quota across private and public facilities are in critical-care beds, while Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) said that more than 70% (over 4,000) of the 5,000+ patients being treated under the private quota were critical. Among critically ill, districts have a higher proportion of patients in ICUPHANA president Dr HM Prasanna said: “There are about 5,000 Covid patients in non-government quota beds in private hospitals. Of these, around 70% to 80% are in HDU and ICU beds. In big hospitals, 90% of the ICUs are occupied.” Separate data from the state war room for districts outside Bengaluru shows that nearly 21,000 patients were occupying hospital beds as of June 11 — districts’ data is not compiled real-time as done in Bengaluru. Of these, more than 13,000 or 62% are occupying critical care beds. In Bengaluru, 55% of those in critical-care beds were in HDUs and the rest in the two categories of ICU beds, while 43% of the critical patients in the districts occupied HDUs. This means that among the critically ill, districts have a higher proportion of patients in the ICU. Overall bed occupancy across the state has declined significantly in the past two weeks. In Bengaluru, only 16.5% of the 13,293 beds dedicated for Covid under government quota were occupied as of Sunday evening, while around 50% of the beds in private quota were occupied. In comparison, all other districts together, where cases began surging after they peaked in Bengaluru, have 33% of the 63,761 beds occupied. The dip in occupancy coincides with the discharge cycle kicking in, which has, in turn, seen a reduction in active cases. Active cases across the state dipped below 2 lakh for the first time since the third week of April, from where it had skyrocketed to even cross the 6-lakh mark in mid-May. Further, the reduction in active cases has resulted in a dip in oxygen requirement across districts. As per the oxygen war room data, on June 11 — the latest available information on oxygen — the state consumed only 516.4 MT of oxygen. While daily oxygen consumption was hovering around 700MT at the end of May, it dipped to 640MT on June 4. From there, it has remained under 600MT/day on all days. Between June 5 and June 11, the highest consumption happened on June 6 (593MT) and the lowest was on June 10 (426MT).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-bed-occupancy-falls-percentage-of-patients-in-icus-still-high/articleshow/83499101.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Covid toll in Gujarat hovers at 10,000; young, old affected alike||AHMEDABAD: Covid-19 was earlier considered to be a virus that targetted the elderly and people above 60 years were considered high risk. As the official toll of pandemic in the state hovers at 10,000, analysis of mortality data reveals the pattern changed significantly in the second wave. Analysis of 9,985 deaths recorded in official records of Gujarat indicated that currently those above and below 60 account for equal share in mortality. While 50.4% deaths are recorded in the 0 to 59 years age group, patients above 60 years accounted for the remaining 49.6%. As on Sunday, official mortality figure reached 9,997 with deaths of six patients in 24 hours. In absolute numbers, Gujarat ranks 11th among states, whereas in terms of mortality, it ranks15th with1.2%. The second wave changed the target of the virus – compared to 60% deaths in 2020 in the 60-plus group, this year’s data shows that the percentage went down to 41.3%. This year, 58.6% deaths were recorded in the 15 to 59 years group, according to the state health & family welfare department. The findings are significant as this year, April (2,664) and May (2,650) accounted for more than half (53%) of Covid-19 deaths in Gujarat. “There are a few reasons for this – due to a change in virus’ profile, a high number of younger patients got infected. Moreover, distress signs were ignored and led to happy hypoxia. Oxygen saturation went down steadily, and when the patient was brought to hospital, the lungs were infected beyond repair,” said Dr Vivek Dave, a city-based critical care specialist. Distress signs were ignoredThere are a few reasons for the phenomenon – due to a change in virus’ profile, a very high number of younger patients had got infected. Moreover, distress signs were ignored in some cases that led to happy hypoxia. Oxygen saturation went down steadily, and when the patient was brought to the hospital setting, the lungs were infected beyond repair,” said Dr Vivek Dave, a city-based critical care specialist. “Lung involvement was also relatively higher compared to 2020.” Experts also pointed out factors such as vaccination for the senior citizens soon after the first wave. The working population (21 to 58 years) were relatively late in getting the protection. The mortality got reduced among the senior citizens who were vaccinated, said Dr Kartikeya Parmar, in-charge of Covid-19 hospital at Civil Hospital. “We had maintained vaccination status records of those getting admitted, and the results indicated that those who had at least one shot had relatively lesser chances of getting critical,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-toll-in-gujarat-hovers-at-10000-young-old-affected-alike/articleshow/83499056.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Foresters bullet kills villager during clash with mining mafia||BHOPAL: A villager was shot dead by forest officials in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh during a confrontation with sand mining mafia at dawn on Sunday, triggering a three-hour highway blockade by locals. Villagers allege foresters killed Mahaveer Singh Tomar, 45, when he had gone out to relieve himself, and his son, Rahul, accused the officials of beating Mahaveer and then shooting him because he objected to their opening fire inside the village. Forest officials say they were trying to stop illegal sand mining in the area, and that Mahaveer was shielding the goons. Morena firing: 9 forest dept officials bookedPolice have booked nine forest officials following a complaint lodged by Rahul. Additional police forces have been deployed in the region as anger continues to simmer. Divisional forest officer (DFO) Amit Nikam told local media that the forest team was chasing a tractor-trolley laden with illegally mined sand around 5am when a group of villagers, Mahaveer among them, stopped the foresters’ vehicle in Amol Pura village to shield the mining mafia. “Mahaveer and the others were trying to snatch weapons from forest officials when a bullet was fired accidently. We are sending a report on the incident to police,” the DFO said. Police, however, say the foresters fired more than 10 rounds. Rahul alleged his father was beaten up and shot dead by forest officials after he objected to their firing at the tractor-trolley within a residential area. His complaint mentions seven forest guards and names two of them -- Pramod and Ragvendra. “Let the court decide if the firing was in the line of duty,” said SP Lalit Shakyawar. Mahaveer’s death triggered anger in the village and locals blocked the national highway for around three hours. SP Shakyawar told TOI that immediate steps were to control the situation. Police said they have registered a case under IPC sections 302 (murder), 147 (punishment for rioting) and 294 (using abusive language) against nine forest officials on the basis of the complaint. In February 2020, A Dalit was shot dead, allegedly by a forest ranger, in MP’s Shivpuri during an altercation between his family and foresters over filling of water from a hand pump. Earlier this week, a team of foresters was attacked by a group of villagers involved in illegal mining. The gang tried to run the guards over with a sand-laden tractor-trolley, say officials. This is the third such incident in a month, including an attack on sub-divisional forest officer Shraddha Padhare by the mining mafia on May 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-foresters-bullet-kills-villager-during-clash-with-mining-mafia/articleshow/83499066.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Will ensure those coming to Bengaluru are tested: Karnataka CM||BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said those entering Bengaluru from other states and even districts will be screened, and swab samples collected for testing at entry points in a bid to prevent a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases. The move comes ahead of some lockdown restrictions being lifted in Bengaluru Urban district, besides others from Monday. With economic activity set to resume in Bengaluru Urban, authorities expect a massive influx of migrants returning to work in the city. As a result, officials of the health department have raised concerns over a possible spread of infections and a spike in cases. “I have spoken to officials about this. I have asked them to ensure strict screening at entry points into the city. We will plug loopholes, if any,” Yediyurappa told reporters. However, the chief minister did not spell out whether testing will be done at district borders or at places where heavy influx of migrants is expected such as bus stands and railway stations. Over the past week, there has been an influx of returnees at the railway station, perhaps in anticipation of restrictions being lifted. The strict lockdown will continue in 11 districts where positivity rates are still high, including Bengaluru Rural, Hassan, Kodagu, Mandya and Mysuru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/will-ensure-those-coming-to-bengaluru-are-tested-karnataka-cm/articleshow/83499147.cms||---

---||World||Junta trial of Myanmar's Suu Kyi to hear first testimony||YANGON: The trial of ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi will hear its first testimony in a junta court Monday, more than four months after a military coup. Near daily protests have rocked Myanmar since the generals' putsch removed her government in February, ending a 10-year experiment with democracy. The mass uprising has been met with a brutal military crackdown that has killed more than 850 people, according to a local monitoring group. The junta has brought an eclectic raft of charges against the Nobel laureate, from illegally accepting 11 kilograms of gold to breaking a colonial-era secrecy law. On Monday, her defence team will cross-examine witnesses over charges she improperly imported walkie-talkies and flouted coronavirus restrictions during last year's elections that her National League for Democracy won in a landslide. Her lawyers -- who have been allowed to meet with her just twice since she was placed under house arrest -- have said they expect the trial to wrap up by July 26. Hearings for the case will take place every Monday. If convicted of all charges, Suu Kyi, 75, faces more than a decade in jail. "We are hoping for the best but prepared for the worst," Khin Maung Zaw, one of Suu Kyi's lawyers, told AFP ahead of the hearing in the capital Naypyidaw. A separate case is scheduled to start on June 15, where she is charged with sedition alongside ousted president Win Myint and another senior member of the NLD. Suu Kyi spent more than 15 years under house arrest during the previous junta's rule before her 2010 release. Her international stature diminished following a wave of military violence targeting Buddhist-majority Myanmar's marginalised Muslim Rohingya community, but the coup has returned Suu Kyi to the role of cloistered democracy icon. On Thursday, she was hit with additional corruption charges of illegally accepting $600,000 in cash and around 11 kilos of gold. Her lawyer Khin Maung Zaw dismissed the new charges -- which could see Suu Kyi hit with another lengthy prison term -- as "absurd". "There is an undeniable political background to keep her out of the scene of the country and to smear her prestige," he told AFP last week. "That's one of the reasons to charge her -- to keep her out of the scene." Myanmar has plunged into a "human rights catastrophe" since the coup, the UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet said Friday, adding that the military leadership was "singularly responsible" for the crisis. Bachelet also slammed the sweeping arrests in the country of activists, journalists and opponents of the regime, citing credible sources saying at least 4,804 people remain in arbitrary detention. Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has justified his power grab by citing alleged electoral fraud in the November poll won by Suu Kyi's NLD. The junta has previously said it would hold fresh elections within two years, but has also threatened to dissolve the NLD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/junta-trial-of-myanmars-suu-kyi-to-hear-first-testimony/articleshow/83499237.cms||---

A study about the performance of the banking sector in Punjab during the pre-Covid-19 and the Covid-19 period has revealed that during the lockdown quarter (April-June 2020), NPAs were lower at 10.68% compared to over 11% in the pre-Covid quarters (see box). The largest proportion of bank branches in Punjab are located in rural areas (44%) compared to semi-urban areas (29%) and urban areas (27%) as of September 2020. The study conducted by Satish Verma, RBI chair professor (economics) at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in Chandigarh, has found that banking in Punjab dipped in the lockdown quarter. It recovered soon in rural areas but recorded a precipitous fall in the urban areas. In its geographical coverage, banking in Punjab is more ruraloriented and in deposits and advances, it is more urban-oriented, according to the study. There are nearly 10.8 lakh farmers in Punjab. During the Covid-19 period till September 2020, agricultural advances in Punjab fared well as their proportion recovered quickly besides remaining in this period at a level equal to or higher than that in the pre-Covid December 2019 quarter. The study also found that the kisan credit card (KCC) loans remained subdued in the June 2020 quarter that remained at almost the same level in September 2020. Micro & small enterprises worst hit by pandemic: StudyThe impact of Covid-19 on medium enterprises was mild in Punjab but was more intense on micro, small, and medium enterprises as regards the loan amount. However, it was particularly in the Covid-19 March 2020 quarter when the number of accounts across the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector declined. Punjab has over two lakh registered MSMEs. The study also found that the commercial banks were shy in extending loans particularly to micro and small enterprises mainly because of the NPA fears. The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for the MSME sector, which provided government-guaranteed and collateral-free loans to the MSME sector, has been slow in Punjab — the accounts disbursed being merely 54% of the net eligible and 65% of the sanctioned ones as on December 7, 2020. “Moreover, Punjab’s share at the maximum in the amount earmarked at the national level under the scheme works out to merely 1.84 percent. The low proportion of MSME units eligible for loans under the scheme in the state (maximum 11%) is the reason for Punjab’s low share,” according to the study. The industrial hub district of Ludhiana in the state performed poorly under the ECLGS scheme. Moreover, the performance of banks in a number of districts in Punjab has been inconsistent in relation to the indicators of the accounts sanctioned as a proportion of the net eligible for which the reasons need to be ascertained. The amount disbursed per loan by public sector banks under the ECLGS scheme worked out to Rs 2.83 lakh and to Rs 15.87 lakh for private banks. It clearly indicates that whereas the loans disbursed by the public sector banks under the scheme were mostly small loans, those disbursed by the private banks were mostly large or corporate loans. “This trend is being resented by the public sector banks. The state-level bankers’ committee (SLBC) must look into the matter,” added the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/non-performing-assets-in-punjab-agriculture-loans-mostly-over-11-since-fy-2019-20/articleshow/83499255.cms||Sanjeev Verma
