---||Thiruvananthapuram||Covid-19: Thiruvananthapuram corporation official writes emotional FB post over death of two babies||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A tiny, lifeless body of a three-day-old baby swathed in white clothes lays at a medical college mortuary in Thiruvananthapuram for three days, not wanted by anyone. The baby’s parents reportedly did not receive the body. Amid the usual sight of corpses at the mortuary, the sight of a baby pained the staff and they alerted the corporation team in charge of Santhikavadom. The team arrived at the mortuary and received the body and was cremated at Santhikavadom on Tuesday. They are keeping the ashes, waiting for someone close to the baby to turn up and take it for the rites. For the Santhikavadom charge officer, Shaji MS and his team, it has been a deeply moving experience which he recounts on his facebook post. "For the past one year, we have been receiving and cremating bodies of so many people who died of Covid-19. With no relatives nearby, we would do whatever we could to bid them an honorable farewell. But receiving the body of a three-day-old baby after coming to know that the parents didn’t receive the body was emotionally stressful for us," says Shaji MS. " We thought the least we could do was to keep the ashes, we hope someone would come for the baby’s ashes," he says. When the call came from Medical college, initially, the team thought that it was an unwanted body. A letter had been handed over to the corporation office four days ago and with Covid burials keeping the staff fully busy, the letter remained buried amidst the booking files. "The baby was born prematurely and we understand the father had demanded a postmortem and after that the parents didn’t receive the body and it had to be kept at the mortuary," a corporation official said. The team had to deal with cremation and transportation of two other babies on Tuesday. The team got a call from the mayor’s office saying that a couple couldn’t afford money to transport their baby’s body to Varkala from medical college. The team transported the body to Varkala in a corporation ambulance along with the parents. For the last few months, I have been receiving calls mostly related to deaths. So in a way, I was emotionless when I took charge at Santhikavadom. I had thought death wouldn’t scare me anymore having handled around 250 bodies in the last one year. But on Tuesday, I lost my sleep after receiving the baby’s body. Death really hurts. There was also another small coffin waiting at Santhikavadom. I saw two parents the same day; one who wouldn’t take their baby home and leave it in the mortuary and another couple who wept all the way home with their baby’s body in ambulance," Shaji says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-19-thiruvananthapuram-corporation-official-writes-emotional-fb-post-over-death-of-two-babies/articleshow/83380932.cms||Aswin J Kumar

An announcement from US President Joe Biden could come as early as Thursday. The vaccines purchased would go to 92 lower income countries, including some in Africa. Sources say that US will purchase the first batch of 200 million doses this year itself. The balance 300 million is likely to be purchased in early 2022. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Wednesday that Biden was committed to sharing vaccines because it was in the public health and strategic interests of the US. The news comes a week after the White House unveiled plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas, mostly through the United Nations-backed COVAX program, promising infusions for South and Central America, Asia, Africa and others at a time of glaring shortages abroad. Overall, the White House has announced plans to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June, most through COVAX. On Wednesday, Biden left for Europe, on his first foreign trip since assuming office. The announcement on the vaccine donation deal from the US President is expected after he arrives in Europe. Joe Biden will be attendng the G-7 summit in UK. He will then travel to Brussels for the NATO and US-European Union meetings. He will wrap up his tour of Europe with a meeting with Russian President Putin in Geneva on June 16.

---||World||Florida reverses itself, will allow rainbow bridge lighting||JACKSONVILLE: Florida reversed itself Wednesday and said a downtown Jacksonville bridge can be decorated in rainbow lights to celebrate gay rights, one day after it had ordered them doused.  Taryn Fenske, a spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis, told The Florida Times-Union that she didn't know why the Florida Department of Transportation had ordered the state-owned Acosta Bridge returned to its normal blue lighting Tuesday night, but said the rainbow colors will be back Wednesday night.  The Jacksonville Transportation Authority had planned to use rainbow lighting on the Acosta throughout the week in honor of Pride Month, which commemorates the struggle for gay rights. The state has allowed numerous celebratory lighting displays on the bridge to honor patriotic holidays, celebrate the Jacksonville Jaguars football team and raise disease awareness.  It had been the second time this month the state rejected a rainbow lighting display for a bridge.  "The bottom line is, (the rainbow) lights will be back" on the Acosta, Fenske told the paper.  The state transportation department said on Tuesday that its original decision to shut off the rainbow lights was not motivated by anti-gay animus but because the display violated regulations. It said the Jacksonville authority's permit for lighting the Acosta requires it to maintain a certain color scheme unless it receives state permission for a temporary change.  DeSantis, a Republican, was criticized last week when, on the first day of Pride Month, he signed a law banning transgender athletes from participating in school sports.  The state had earlier rejected Sarasota's request to light its John Ringling Causeway Bridge with rainbow lights this month despite also permitting other displays there. The governor's office did not immediately respond to a Wednesday email from The Associated Press asking whether that display will also now be allowed.  According to the state's bridge lighting policy, the transportation department can reject any temporary color scheme it deems offensive or not in the public's best interest. It also says special lighting displays should be limited to federal or state holidays or celebrations and "events of broad community interest and significance approved by local governments." Fenske said those policies will be reviewed.  The Times-Union reports that the Acosta is frequently lit in different color schemes. Last month, it was lit in teal to honor the Jaguars for drafting star quarterback Trevor Lawrence; green for mental health month; blue and green to raise awareness of neurofibromatoses, a neurological disorder that causes tumors; light blue for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the fatal condition commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease; purple for lupus awareness; and red, white and blue for Memorial Day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-reverses-itself-will-allow-rainbow-bridge-lighting/articleshow/83382166.cms||---

While NC president and Srinagar MP Farooq Abdullah denied that the alliance was reacting to the possibility of a "big development", the Valley was agog with talk of how the arrival of 200 companies of paramilitary forces was a signal of something brewing in Kashmir. "We have not been asked or informed about anything so far regarding the ongoing speculation (that J&K might be bifurcated again)," Farooq said. The administration, too, rushed to scotch rumours circulating on social media, saying there was no question of "any such misadventure". Sources said the return of paramilitary forces to the Valley was a routine exercise since several companies had been moved out ahead of assembly elections in four states and one UT. PAGD’s Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami said the conglomerate's primary goal of "working for the well-being of the people of Kashmir" would remain unchanged, whatever the circumstances. The alliance had been formed to fight for restoration of J&K's special status prior to the nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution in August 2019. Tarigami, who is from the CPM, was officially named spokesperson for the PAGD on Wednesday, replacing J&K People's Conference chief Sajad Lone, who quit the alliance last year. NC's Anantnag MP Hassnain Masoodi, Javid Mustafa Mir, Muzaffar Ahmad Shah and Mehboob Beg of PDP, besides Farooq and Mufti, attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-fresh-jk-bifurcation-rumour-gupkar-alliance-meets-after-6-months/articleshow/83382523.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The nearly 3-meter-high bronze will make a nine-day trip across the Atlantic Ocean later this month, sailing out aboard a container ship from the French port of Le Havre to Baltimore. It will then be transported to the US, arriving in time for July 4 celebrations. The mini-Lady Liberty is then set to go on display in the gardens of the French Embassy in Washington DC, arriving there in time for France's Bastille Day celebration July 14. The statue will stay there for the next decade. The monumental Statue of Liberty in New York's harbor, by sculptor Auguste Bartholdi, symbolizes the United States' welcoming to its shores of immigrants seeking refuge and freedom. A gift to America in 1885, it also serves as a monument to the enduring French-American friendship. The Statue of Liberty "is a like our Eiffel Tower," said US Embassy representative Liam Wasley at the send-off ceremony, calling it an icon that symbolizes not just liberty but "the richness of our relationship" with France. The smaller version heading to the US had been displayed in Paris at the Musee des Arts et Metiers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mini-lady-liberty-statue-heads-to-us-for-july-4-celebrations/articleshow/83383712.cms||---

Two gunshots were reported heard coming from outside Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland onto the base about 11:50 am, said Lt. Col. Brian Loveless, 802nd Security Forces Squadron commander. It was unclear whether anyone saw a shooter or whether more than one shooter may have been involved, he said.  Investigators also were trying to determine whether the gunfire report was true or a false alarm, Loveless said. However, he called the report "solid."  "We're trying to investigate a couple of leads right now to confirm that gunshots actually did take place on the installation.  No injuries were reported, Loveless said.  Lackland is on San Antonio's southeast side and is where the Air Force conducts all of its basic training.  "There's a lot of facilities on this installation that are very important to the Air Force. I would rather overreact (to a gunfire report) than underreact," Loveless said.  The base issued an alert midday, telling all Lackland Air Force Base personnel to go into lockdown. An alert on Twitter said: "Real World, LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN."  Officials said the shots were reportedly fired near the Valley Hi gate on the western side of the main base, just east of Interstate 410 and near a shopping center.  After an hour, the lockdown was lifted except for the Valley Hi gate.  San Antonio police said they were assisting in the investigation. In a statement, police spokeswoman Jennifer Rodriguez said officers were looking for the spot from which gunfire might have originated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/san-antonio-base-locked-down-for-hour-after-gunfire-reported/articleshow/83384293.cms||---

Two CAs, a Tibetan woman and eight others have been arrested. Around five lakh Indians have been duped of their “investment” and their sensitive data stolen through malicious “quick earning” apps running in the garb of an online multi-level marketing campaign. Over Rs 150 crore has been siphoned in just two months, according to police commissioner S N Shrivastava. Rs 11 crores of has been blocked in various bank accounts and payment gateways and Rs 97 lakh cash recovered from a Gurgaon-based CA who formed over 110 companies for Chinese fraudsters. These apps offered lucrative returns on investment with claims to double the investment amount in 24-35 days. They also had schemes promising returns on an hourly and daily basis, and had investment options starting from Rs 300 to several lakhs. One of the apps, Power Bank, was recently trending at No 4 on Google Play Store, cops said. Read AlsoWeb of deceit: Delhi cop goes deep inside to bust global racketNEW DELHI: For about a month, a young cyber cell officer became an avid user of the malicious Chinese apps offering quick income to people. He devoted hours to know their operations and even invested — and lost — money to help in following the money trail and bust the international syndicate. With aExplaining the origin of the operation, DCP Anyesh Roy said the Cyber Crime Cell had taken notice of various posts on social media by people about two apps: Power Bank and EZPlan. A team led by ACP Aditya Gautam carried out extensive technical analysis of apps at a lab. "EZPlan was available on the website www.ezplan.in. The Power Bank app projected itself as a Bengaluru-based Technology Start-Up involved in quick-charging technology, in a bid to deceive people. However, the server on which the app was hosted was found to be based in China," the DCP said. The malicious apps were also associated with several permissions such as ‘access to camera’, ‘read contact details’ and ‘read and write to external storage’. In order to entice large number of people to invest more, a small pay out amounting to 5-10% of the invested money was given. People, believing the "scheme" to be genuine, started investing more money as well as circulating and sharing the apps with their friends and relatives. Once someone had invested a large amount, their account was blocked by the apps, thus causing severe financial loss. When asked how people got to know about these apps, the main Chinese handlers behind this massive scam used to randomly contact people over various apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram and hired interested persons as partners for procuring bogus bank accounts, creating shell companies, circulating and promoting the apps, transferring money, etc. "A large number of such apps have been circulated by the fraudsters, including Power Bank, EZCoin, Sun Factory, Lightening Power Bank, etc. Some of these fraudulent, malicious Apps were also listed on Google Play Store," said a senior officer. Cops said that most of these apps were promoted through YouTube channels, Telegram channels and WhatsApp chat links sent through bulk SMSes. Once the user registered on the apps, he or she was repeatedly induced to invest money to earn very high returns.

---||World||US defense chief tells Pentagon to sharpen focus on China||WASHINGTON: US defense secretary Lloyd Austin directed the Pentagon on Wednesday to sharpen its focus on China, which the United States has tagged as its top strategic rival. "Now, it is up to the Department to get to work," Austin said after issuing an internal directive to the giant Pentagon bureaucracy. The directive, details of which are classified, comes after an assessment by a task force established by the new Biden administration in February to study the Defense Department's strategy towards China. "The initiatives I am putting forward today are nested inside the larger US government approach to China and will help inform the development of the National Defense Strategy we are working on," Austin said. A senior defense official said the task force had identified a "'say-do' gap between the stated prioritization of China and what we saw in a number of areas related to attention and resources and processes." "The directive today is really about ensuring that the department lives up to that prioritization," the official said. Austin said the directive will "improve the Department's ability to revitalize our network of allies and partners, bolster deterrence, and accelerate the development of new operational concepts, emerging capabilities, future force posture, and a modernized civilian and military workforce." Pentagon operations over the past two decades have been focused largely on dealing with jihadist militants in the Middle East and not a modern army such as that of China. The Pentagon's 2018 National Defense Strategy identified China as a major strategic competitor but the task force found that not much had been done to meet the challenges posed by Beijing. The US military is currently seeking to expand its presence in the Pacific at a time when China has been increasingly belligerent towards Taiwan, which it considers part of its territory. The United States maintains a significant presence in the Middle East, even as it has begun the withdrawal of its remaining 2,500 US troops in Afghanistan. To ensure that his directive is followed, Austin will be personally responsible for the implementation of the classified recommendations of the task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-defense-chief-tells-pentagon-to-sharpen-focus-on-china/articleshow/83384511.cms||---
---||World||Russian court brands Navalny political organisations 'extremist'||MOSCOW: A Moscow court on Wednesday branded political organisations headed by jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny extremist, banning their work and rendering staff liable to criminal prosecution.  "It was found that these organizations not only disseminated information that incited hatred and enmity against government officials, but also committed extremist actions," a spokesman for the prosecutors, Alexei Zhafyarov, said outside the court.  A statement by the Moscow City Court after the 10-hour session said Navalny's regional network offices and his anti-corruption organisation had been banned with immediate effect.  Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) has pressured the Kremlin in recent years by publishing investigations into high-level corruption among the political elite.  Those probes have in turn spurred massive street demonstrations.  His network of regional offices has also promoted the 45-year-opposition leader's smart voting campaign, which encourages voters to cast ballots for candidates in elections most likely to unseat Kremlin-friendly incumbants.  The ruling Wednesday comes ahead of parliamentary elections in September, in which the deeply unpopular ruling United Russia party is expected to struggle.  Navalny, Putin's most outspoken critic at home, survived a near-fatal nerve agent attack last summer that he blames on the Kremlin, a claim the administration denies.  Lawyers representing Navalny's organisation said Wednesday they had been given 10 days to appeal the ruling, which they said in a statement online they would certainly do.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/russian-court-brands-navalny-political-organisations-extremist/articleshow/83384748.cms||---
---||India||Boost for BJP as Rahul pal Jitin Prasada dumps Congress||NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday got a boost in UP, where polls are due early next year, with prominent Congress leader and former Union minister Jitin Prasada joining the saffron party, snapping three generations of family ties with the opposition party and ending his proximity to Rahul Gandhi. The move, which took political circles by surprise after BJP spokesperson Anil Baluni tweeted about an important impending arrival and Prasada's presence at the BJP headquarters later in the day, delivered a jolt to Congress which slammed his decision as politics of convenience. Read AlsoIf loyalists don't believe in Rahul Gandhi, why will Indians?Jitin Prasada's entry is less a gain for the BJP, and more a blow to the Congress, Rahul Gandhi specificallyOnce part of the Rahul brigade, Prasada is the latest after Jyotiraditya Scindia to part ways with Congress complaining that he had been left with no role to play in party affairs. Given his UP roots, the leader's move is also being read as a lack of confidence in Congress's prospects. At a time when the Centre has been under fire over the vaccination policy and questions are being asked whether its stock has fallen, Prasada's joining goes against the grain of opposition attacks and a vocal section of the commentariat. It provides a welcome change of narrative for BJP and is a dampener for Congress, which sensed an opportunity with BJP on the back foot in the wake of the second Covid-19 wave. Read AlsoFocus back on Congress leadership drift, turmoil in partyPrasada is not the first of Rahul acolytes to revolt, coming as it does after the exit of Jyotiraditya Scindia and a near successful rebellion by Sachin Pilot. Both leaders felt hemmed in by older leaders in their states.Prasada had floated ‘Brahmin Chetna Parishad’ recently and has been vocal about issues related to the community. A two-term Lok Sabha MP (Shahjahanpur and Dhaurahra), minister twice in the Manmohan Singh government and successor to the family's political legacy where his father Jitendra Prasada was a known face in state and Delhi politics. The senior Prasada had a crucial role in the Narasimha Rao government as the late leader's political secretary. Prasada's entry in the saffron party is read as timely for BJP at a time when there are murmurs about unhappiness in a section of the Brahmin community towards the Yogi Adityanath dispensation. Consolidation of major vote banks will help BJP as an assembly election almost always brings local and even sub-local factors to the fore as compared to a national election. Besides, it also gives leverage to the party leadership in the state to handle some aspiring leaders, said to be unhappy with the state government and who can be troublesome at the time of ticket distribution. Given the expected timeline, BJP will be fully in poll mode by the end of the year as the polls could be notified in December. Though BJP has been promoting several leaders from the Brahmin community — elevating Mahendra Pandey as state president and then as a Union minister and appointing Dinesh Sharma as deputy chief minister, the party has been worried about its support among the dominant caste. For this, Prasada could be handy given that he has been vociferously speaking for the community in the past few months. Home minister Amit Shah, BJP president J P Nadda and UP CM Yogi Adityanath promptly welcomed Prasada to the fold and said his entry would strengthen the party in the state. After joining the saffron party in the presence of Union minister Piyush Goyal and chief spokesperson Anil Baluni, Prasada said BJP was the only national party which worked in an institutional way, while others were all about a few people or confined to specific regions. He hailed PM Modi for his leadership and lauded other senior party leaders. “If there is any political party or a leader standing for the interests of the nation today, given the situation that our country is going through, it is BJP and PM Narendra Modi,” he said after joining the party. His joining is yet another jolt for Congress, which had lost Jyotiraditya Scindia last year. Prasada, 47, was one among the G23 who had written a letter to the Congress high command seeking overhaul of the party organisation in the wake of its dampening performance. There were speculations about Prasada joining BJP in 2019 too, but sources said he was mollified by Priyanka Gandhi and even the saffron party could not promise a constituency of his choice. Prasada is the latest prominent Congress leader to join BJP, following in the footsteps of Scindia, Sanjay Singh (Amethi), Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Tom Vadakkan, Rita Bahuguna Joshi and three chief ministers of north-eastern states, including Himanta Biswa Sarma (Assam), N Biren Singh (Manipur) and Pema Khandu (Arunachal Pradesh).

---||World||Joe Biden opens overseas trip declaring 'United States is back'||MILDENHALL: President Joe Biden opened the first overseas trip of his term Wednesday with a declaration that "the United States is back" as he seeks to reassert the nation on the world stage and steady European allies deeply shaken by his predecessor.  Biden has set the stakes for his eight-day trip in sweeping terms, believing the West must publicly demonstrate it can compete economically with China as the world emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. It is an open repudiation of his predecessor, Donald Trump, who scorned alliances and withdrew from a global climate change agreement that Biden has since rejoined.  The president's first stop was a visit with U.S. troops and their families at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, where he laid out his mission for the trip.  "We're going to make it clear that the United States is back and democracies are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges and issues that matter the most to our future," he said. "That we're committed to leading with strength, defending our values, and delivering for our people."  The challenges awaiting Biden overseas were clear as the president and the audience wore masks - a reminder of the pandemic that is still raging around much of the world even as its threat recedes within the United States.  "We have to end COVID-19 not just at home -- which we're doing -- but everywhere," Biden said.  Shortly before the president spoke, people briefed on the matter said the Biden administration had brokered an agreement with Pfizer to purchase 500 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to be donated to 92 lower-income countries and the African Union over the next year.  National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that Biden was committed to sharing vaccines because it was in the public health and strategic interests of the U.S. He added that Biden is aiming to show "that democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere."  "As he said in his joint session (address), we were the 'arsenal of democracy' in World War II," Sullivan said. "We're going to be the 'arsenal of vaccines' over this next period to help end the pandemic."  Building toward his trip-ending summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden will aim to reassure European capitals that the United States can once again be counted on as a dependable partner to thwart Moscow's aggression both on their eastern front and their internet battlefields.  The trip will be far more about messaging than specific actions or deals. And the paramount priority for Biden is to convince the world that his Democratic administration is not just a fleeting deviation in the trajectory of an American foreign policy that many allies fear irrevocably drifted toward a more transactional outlook under Trump.  "The trip, at its core, will advance the fundamental thrust of Joe Biden's foreign policy," Sullivan said, "to rally the world's democracies to tackle the great challenges of our time."  Biden's to-do list is ambitious.  In their face-to-face sit-down in Geneva, Biden wants to privately pressure Putin to end myriad provocations, including cybersecurity attacks on American businesses by Russian-based hackers, the jailing of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and repeated overt and covert efforts by the Kremlin to interfere in U.S. elections.  Biden is also looking to rally allies on their COVID-19 response and to urge them to coalesce around a strategy to check emerging economic and national security competitor China even as the U.S. expresses concern about Europe's economic links to Moscow. Biden also wants to nudge outlying allies, including Australia, to make more aggressive commitments to the worldwide effort to curb global warming.  The week-plus journey is a big moment for Biden, who traveled the world for decades as vice president and as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has now stepped off Air Force One onto international soil as commander in chief. He will face world leaders still grappling with the virus and rattled by four years of Trump's inward-looking foreign policy and moves that strained longtime alliances as the Republican former president made overtures to strongmen.  The president first attends a summit of the Group of Seven leaders in the U.K., and then visits Brussels for a NATO summit and a meeting with the heads of the European Union. The trip comes at a moment when Europeans have diminished expectations for what they can expect of U.S. leadership on the foreign stage.  Central and Eastern Europeans are desperately hoping to bind the U.S. more tightly to their security. Germany is looking to see the U.S. troop presence maintained there so it doesn't need to build up its own. France, meanwhile, has taken the tack that the U.S. can't be trusted as it once was and that the European Union must pursue greater strategic autonomy going forward.  "I think the concern is real that the Trumpian tendencies in the U.S. could return full bore in the midterms or in the next presidential election," said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. diplomat and once deputy secretary general of NATO.  The sequencing of the trip is deliberate: Biden consulting with Western European allies for much of a week as a show of unity before his summit with Putin.  He holds a sitdown Thursday with British Prime Minster Boris Johnson a day ahead of the G-7 summit to be held above the craggy cliffs of Cornwall overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.  The most tactile of politicians, Biden has grown frustrated by the diplomacy-via-Zoom dynamics of the pandemic and has relished the ability to again have face-to-face meetings that allow him to size up and connect with world leaders. While Biden himself is a veteran statesman, many of the world leaders he will see in England, including Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron, took office after Biden left the vice presidency. Another, Germany's Angela Merkel, will leave office later this year.  There are several potential areas of tension. On climate change, the U.S. is aiming to regain its credibility after Trump pulled the country back from the fight against global warming. Biden could also feel pressure on trade, an issue to which he's yet to give much attention. And with the United States well supplied with COVID-19 vaccines yet struggling to persuade some of its own citizens to use it, leaders whose inoculation campaigns have been slower have been pressuring Biden to share more surplus around the globe.  Another central focus will be China. Biden and the other G-7 leaders will announce an infrastructure financing program for developing countries that is meant to compete directly with Beijing's Belt-and-Road Initiative. But not every European power has viewed China in as harsh a light as Biden, who has painted the rivalry with the techno-security state as the defining competition for the 21st century.  The European Union has avoided taking as strong a stance on Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong's democracy movement or treatment of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province as the Biden administration may like. But there are signs that Europe is willing to put greater scrutiny on Beijing.  Biden is also scheduled to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan while in Brussels, a face-to-face meeting between two leaders who have had many fraught moments in their relationship over the years.  The trip finale will be Biden's meeting with Putin.  Biden has taken a very different approach to Russia than Trump's friendly outreach. Their sole summit, held in July 2018 in Helsinki, was marked by Trump's refusal to side with U.S. intelligence agencies over Putin's denials of Russian interference in the election two years earlier.

---||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee proposes ‘union of states’ to stop BJP’s bullying||KOLKATA: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday borrowed from Article 1 of the Indian Constitution to propose a “union of states” to stop BJP from bulldozing state governments run by other parties. Banerjee’s call to other opposition parties to band together to prevent BJP from “destroying federalism” and playing “dirty politics” came after a meeting at the state secretariat with Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait, who called her a “fit candidate for PM”. Banerjee, however, underplayed the endorsement: “Forget my name. I do not want to lead it. It is a collective family, let us work together.” “The centre did not get time to speak to farmers since January. Their movement must gain impetus and all opposition leaders should unite for that. Farmers want all opposition party CMs to hold a video conference to support them. I shall speak to our CMs. We will also issue a joint letter,”Banerjee said. The Bengal CM questioned the Narendra Modi government’s inability to implement a coherent vaccination policy and criticised it for imposing GST on Covid vaccines, which she felt was illegal and unethical, and called the pandemic “not only a natural disaster but also a political disaster”. “This is playing with people’s lives,” she said. “People have been left without jobs and many have died after being denied oxygen and vaccines,” she added, questioning the centre’s delayed implementation of the vaccination drive for 18 to 44-year-olds. “A lot of lives could have been saved. Why should the PM take credit for vaccination when the money that is being spent belongs to people and not BJP?” she said, thanking the Supreme Court for taking up the issue of free vaccination. “Even now no one knows when vaccines will arrive,” she said. A lot of lives could have been saved: CMPeople have been left without jobs and many have died after being denied oxygen and vaccines,” CM Mamata Banerjee said, questioning the Centre’s delayed implementation of the vaccination drive for 18- to 44-year-olds. “A lot of lives could have been saved. Why should the PM take credit for vaccination when the money that is being spent belongs to people and not the BJP?” she asked, thanking the Supreme Court for taking up the issue of free vaccination. “Even now no one knows when vaccines will arrive,” Banerjee said, adding that Bengal had already vaccinated nearly 2 crore people and bought vaccines worth Rs 200 crore. “Bodies from UP and Bihar are now floating down to Bengal. How many bodies were dropped in the river?” she asked. “Hindustan is starving,” she added. Those opposing the Centre’s anti-people policies were being threatened by central agencies, Banerjee said, adding: “They are threatening officers too. They are gagging public voice but India is a democratic country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/didi-seeks-union-of-states-to-take-on-bjp/articleshow/83385150.cms||Debashis Konar

"There were no victims or damage," the official said. Balad airbase, north of Baghdad, is used by US company Sallyport to service F-16 fighter jets flown by Iraq's air force and has repeatedly been targeted by rocket fire. Another US company, Lockheed Martin, withdrew its staff from the base last month amid concerns about the safety of its personnel. At least three foreign subcontractors and one Iraqi subcontractor have been wounded in attacks on Balad. The US routinely blames such attacks- which also regularly target US interests at other installations, including Baghdad airport- on Iran-backed factions. US troops are in Iraq as part of a military coalition that was established to fight the jihadist Islamic State group- a campaign that Iraq's government declared won in late 2017. The rocket attacks are seen as a means to pressure Washington into removing all its remaining personnel, whom Iran-linked factions view as an occupying force. In mid-April, pro-Iran fighters sent an explosives-packed drone crashing into Arbil airport in the first reported use of such a weapon against a base housing US troops in Iraq.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/five-rockets-target-iraq-base-housing-us-contractors-security-source/articleshow/83385918.cms||---

The letter to state mission directors of the National Health Mission dated June 4 stated that data and analytics generated by eVIN (electronic vaccine intelligence network) for inventory and temperature (of vaccines) was “owned” by the ministry and that it was “not to be shared with any other organisation, partner agency, media agency, online and offline public forums” without the consent of the ministry. The letter added that it was “very sensitive information and to be used only for programme improvement”. The letter elaborated that the eVIN system under the universal immunisation programme was rolled out by the central government with the support of UNDP and is “used to track the vaccine stock, status and temperature at all levels of vaccine storage, from national to the sub-district level”. All states are using the same system to update the stock and transactions of Covid vaccines on a daily basis, stated the letter. “The caution against sharing information is certainly unusual as is the word “owned”,” said a senior bureaucrat who had retired from the health ministry. “People have the right to know and the state has the right and the responsibility to inform people about how much vaccines have been received from the Centre. In what way is this information sensitive?” asked Chhaya Pachauli, a public health activist from Prayas. Amulya Nidhi of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said it was against the principles of a public health emergency to issue such a letter. “If you hide data on oxygen supply, on deaths, on beds available and on vaccine stocks, how will you build public trust? Transparency in data also prevents corruption.” “Recently, there was a case of vaccine doses being diverted to a private hospital. If the data is not in the public domain, how will people know where the vaccines are going?” asked Nidhi, adding that governments ought to be accountable to the public, and not hiding data from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/health-ministry-gags-states-on-vaccine-stocks-storage-data/articleshow/83385680.cms||Rema Nagarajan
---||World||Florida's largest county OKs plan after spike in gun deaths||MIAMI: Florida's largest county is moving forward after a recent spike in shootings with a nearly $8 million plan to reduce gun violence, seeking to focus on jobs for troubled teens and added funding for law enforcement. Miami-Dade commissioners unanimously approved Mayor Daniella Levine Cava's proposal at a meeting Tuesday, which followed an uptick in gun violence that began Memorial Day weekend.  "This recent wave of tragic violence is absolutely unacceptable," Levine Cava said after the meeting. "This community has demanded an immediate response to protect public safety, and we are responding."  The "Peace and Prosperity Plan" is being funded by a naming-rights deal made earlier this year with FTX, a trading platform for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, for the county-owned arena where the Miami Heat play. FTX Arena had previously been called American Airlines Arena.  Most of the money is to go to a program that focuses on teenagers already in the juvenile-justice system by providing summer camps, counseling and paying jobs. Funds are also going toward surveillance cameras, license-plate readers and additional police to monitor social media for threats that could lead to shootings.  Last week, Miami-Dade police launched "Operation Summer Heat" as an effort to crack down on gun violence. The 12-week program involves an increased police presence, with 17 strike teams tasked with shutting down illegally run businesses, which officials say attract violent crime.  Early Tuesday morning, a man and woman riding in a car were killed in a drive-by shooting in Miami-Dade. A drive-by shooting early Sunday at a graduation party left three dead. Another shooting on Friday in Miami's Wynwood neighborhood killed one person and injured six others. A bloody Memorial Day weekend saw three people killed and 20 wounded in a still-unsolved mass shooting at a banquet hall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/floridas-largest-county-oks-plan-after-spike-in-gun-deaths/articleshow/83386053.cms||---

Data and analytics related to vaccine stocks and temperature at which it is stored are often widely sought by different agencies for crucial information related to usage trends, uptake of vaccines in varied categories of population as well as electricity supply status. “This is not only for Covid-19 vaccines. Even in the past we have asked states and immunisation commissioners that this data be shared strictly with consent from the ministry,” an official said. The interest in such data with respect to anti-Covid jabs has increased further because of the significant gap in demand and supply. While on the one hand, such data can be used for market research and monitoring of adverse events, it can also be misused for malpractices, officials said. While vaccine related data is updated on eVIN on a real time basis to ensure monitoring of stock situation, storage management, temperature management and other logistics-related issues across the country, many people have asked for such stocks-related data to be made public. However, officials in the ministry maintain there is a strong need for such data to be protected as there are several commercial interests at work and the information can be used for unauthorised market purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bid-to-stop-commercial-misuse-of-data-officials/articleshow/83386084.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||India||Govt hikes kharif MSPs amid farm stir||NEW DELHI: With the Centre having emphasised its commitment to minimum support prices (MSP) in the face of an agitation by farm unions against the central farm laws, the Union cabinet on Wednesday announced new support prices for 14 kharif (summer sown) crops with boosts to oilseeds, pulses and less water-consuming nutri-cereals such as Bajra and Jowar. The MSP of most popular crop paddy got a modest hike of Rs 72 per quintal for 2021-22 marketing season compared to the previous year while the highest absolute increase in MSP over the previous year was for sesamum, a nutritional oil seed, of Rs 452 per quintal, followed by tur and urad dals (Rs 300 per quintal each). The expected returns to farmers over their cost of production will, however, be highest in case of bajra (85%), followed by urad (65%) and tur (62%). For the rest of the crops, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at least 50%, as has been the policy of the government. The announcement comes at the heels of a Rs 76,000 crore procurement at the end of the Rabi season, which included Rs 26,000 crore direct payment to Punjab farmers without being routed through arthiyas (market middlemen). Asked about possibility of resuming talks with farm unions, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and west UP, who are demanding repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee to MSP, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government is ready for discussion while adhering to the proposal of keeping implementation of laws on hold for 18 months and discussion on all the issues by a committee during the period to arrive at a solution. The overall hike, approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday, is in sync with the government’s plan to encourage farmers to go for coarse cereals (nutri-cereals), oilseeds and pulses in a big way by moving away from water-guzzling paddy. “Concerted efforts were made over the last few years to realign the MSPs in favour of oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals to encourage farmers shift to larger area under these crops and adopt best technologies and farm practices, to correct demand-supply imbalance,” said Tomar while announcing the Cabinet’s decision. On MSP, Tomar noted that the increase has been consistent with the government’s move to fix the MSP at a level of at least 1.5 times (50% return over cost) of the all-India weighted average Cost of Production (CoP). Farm activists, however, said it’s still not in tune with what the farmers have been demanding. They said the cost comprising the imputed rent and interest on owned land – known as C2 – was not taken to arrive at the new MSP. “In a crop like maize, the increase is as low as Rs 20 per quintal, compared to last year. The absolute increase across different crops does not even match inflation rate,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, farmers’ rights activist and convenor of Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture (ASHA). She said these MSPs are meaningless unless all farmers actually get them and that’s where the demand for a legal guarantee to procurement at MSP comes in. Sudhir Panwar, farm expert and Lucknow University professor, noted that the MSP hike is not in tune with the increase in input cost such as diesel in the past one year. “Announcement of MSPs without factoring in the actual cost of different farm inputs is a joke,” said Panwar while referring to the modest hike in support price of maize and paddy. In order to increase the acreage of oilseeds, the agriculture ministry has recently approved an ambitious plan for the free distribution of high-yielding varieties of seeds to the farmers for this Kharif season in the form of mini-kits. The special Kharif programme is expected to bring an additional 6.37 lakh hectare area under oilseeds. It is likely to produce 120.26 lakh quintals of oilseeds, amounting to 24.36 lakh quintals of edible oil. Besides, in order to attain self-sufficiency in the production of pulses, a special Kharif strategy has been prepared for implementation in the ensuing Kharif 2021 season. “A detailed plan for both area expansion and productivity enhancement for Tur, Moong, and Urad has been formulated. Under the strategy, all the available high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds will be distributed free of cost to increase acreage under pulses,” said the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-hikes-kharif-msps-amid-farm-stir/articleshow/83386333.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Thapar and others have been accused of defrauding Yes Bank by availing a loan which turned into a non-performing asset (NPA). The agency confirmed that searches were conducted at 14 locations in Delhi and NCR, Lucknow, Secunderabd and Kolkata on Wednesday which led to recovery of incriminating documents and digital evidence. The action by the bank and the anti graft agency comes promptly in just over a year of the loan turning an NPA and the account being flagged by the lender. An agency spokesperson said on Wednesday that the CBI had registered a case against two private companies based at Gurugram and Delhi and their directors and promoters apart from some yet to be identified bank officials for causing an alleged loss of Rs 466.51 crore to Yes Bank. “It was alleged that the private company based at Gurugram/Delhi had availed term loan facility of Rs 515 crore from Yes Bank Limited in December, 2017. The loan amount was declared as NPA on October 30, 2019. Further, the borrower was allegedly declared ‘Red Flagged Account’ on March 6, 2020 on the basis of Early Warning Signals (EWS),” the spokesperson said. He added that the accused and its holding company and their directors committed breach of trust, cheating, criminal conspiracy and forgery for diversion/misappropriation of the public money during 2017-2019. Apart from Thapar, 60, the agency has also named Raghubir Kumar Sharma, Rajendra Kumar Mangal, Tapsi Mahajan, and their companies M/s Oyster Buildwell Pvt Ltd, Avantha Reality Pvt Ltd and unknown officials of Jhabua Power Ltd. Sources said that around twenty locations including the premises of Thapar was searched. Yes Bank had filed a complaint against the accused after a forensic audit revealed misappropriation and diversion of funds. The accused have been booked under sections of criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery. Last year, the CBI had filed an FIR against Rana Kapoor, former MD of Yes Bank, and his family members apart from Gautam Thapar and his Avantha group in connection with the sale-purchase of a prime property on Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi. Kapoor had been accused of obtaining Rs 307 crore as bribe in the purchase of the bungalow and giving undue credit facilities to the Avantha Group companies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bank-fraud-case-cbi-books-gautam-thapar/articleshow/83386507.cms||Raj Shekhar

The ministry of electronics and information technology approached Twitter for blocking the handle of the Canadian-Punjabi singer under section 69A of the Information Technology Act, following a request from the of ministry of home affairs. The government asserted that this handle was being used to post inflammatory posts provoking communal sentiments by glorifying Sikh militancy in Punjab and pro-Khalistan feelings on the anniversary of Operation Blue Star. His posts allegedly also used the images of Bhindrawale, who was about to declare the formation of Khalistan when he was killed in Operation Bluestar, to arouse communal sentiments that could pose threat to public order, government sources said. The other prominent account belongs to Sukhdeep Singh Bhogal, a hip-hop artist from Australia, who goes by the stage name LFresh the Lion. Bhogal has around 5,600 followers. Government sources alleged that Jazzy B was also using his Twitter handle to support Lakha Sidhana, the Punjab gangster, who has been identified as among the key figures who masterminded behind Red Fort incident of 26th January, 2021. Government sources said that since he is a social media influencer, with 1.2 million followers, such posts by him would make an impact on a large number of people which could lead to a potential law and order problem. “Therefore, in public interest and to ensure that no law and order issue is created, the home ministry requested the ministry of electronics and information technology to block his Twitter handle,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-defends-twitter-ban-says-jazzy-b-was-glorifying-khalistanis/articleshow/83386577.cms||---

More than 800 employees of the division have tested positive so far. According to the senior divisional commercial manager of Danapur, Adhar Raj, hot water booths will be installed for the frontline workers as well as the passengers at 25 major stations, including the Patna Junction and the Rajendra Nagar Terminal. Steam machines, the design and structure of which are being finalised, will also be introduced on the premises of different stations so that the railway employees and the passengers can inhale the vapour. “We have decided to install ‘corona guard’ inside the waiting halls at the Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal and other stations under the division to keep the virus at bay. The newly developed device, which can kill bacteria and virus, may also be installed in our offices and public places later,” Adhar told this reporter. He added, “The railways has put all its frontline workers like loco pilots, station masters, guards, ticket collectors and paramedical staff on high alert and asked them to take full precautionary measures in order to ensure their safety.” Vaccination camp: Altogether 90 railway officials and many others in the 18+ age group were inoculated at a Covid vaccination camp set up on the premises of the Patliputra Rail Parisar in Patna on Thursday. According to Rajesh Kumar, the chief public relations officer of the East Central Railway (ECR), around 72% of the staff under the five divisions of the zone have already been vaccinated. “Of the 81,635 employees, 58,268 have received the vaccine shots so far.

While Tejashwi made his observations through his tweets, Jaiswal took to the Facebook route. “Nitish (Kumar) government is a fungus imposed on Bihar by the Election Commission. The announcement of its own result by changing the mandate of people is proving to be costly for Bihar,” Tejashwi tweeted. “The BJP’s puppets, who were perched in its system, had also infiltrated into the Election Commission in the garb of officials, and were also rewarded for it,” he said. For his part, Jaiswal assailed Tejashwi for posing a question on the equal cutoff marks for the candidates of the backward classes and general sections in the results of the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) examinations published this week. “On seeing the results of the BPSC, the ninth pass leader is having terrible cramps in his stomach. The ninth pass leader would have been happy if the backward classes candidates had been selected on 250 as cutoff marks against 535 marks of the general sections,” Jaiswal said. “Now that the poor and backward class candidates have come on par with the candidates of general sections by dint of education and hard work, he (read Tejashwi) is seeing the ending of his future,” Jaiswal added. He also said the scheduled tribe (ST) candidates were getting selected by fetching 514 marks and those from the scheduled caste (SC) categories by securing 490 marks. “It was the dream of Baba Saheb Ambedkar which today’s children are fulfilling,” he added. “The true homage to Ambedkar will be when non-reserved and reserved category candidates fetch equal marks and also contribute to the national development,” Jaiswal said and added: “This will end the politics of politicians who spread caste-based enmity and also do their politics on this basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-jaiswal-spat-sinks-to-new-low/articleshow/83380063.cms||Abhay Singh

Many of them openly flouted the social distancing norms and did not wear masks. Talking to this newspaper, Bhawna Kumari, a homemaker, condemned people for not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Autos and e-rickshaws have also started plying with full seating capacity,” she said. A Motihari resident, Md Riyaz Alam, who was seen waiting outside the passport office in the state capital, had to reserve an auto from the Patna Junction because “none of them is following the government’s seating guidelines”. However, rickshaw pullers claimed that they did not get many customers on Wednesday. One of them, Md Chand Khan, said, “I have dropped two customers to their respective destinations since morning and earned only Rs 50.” An office-goer, Rahul Kumar, was stuck in a traffic jam for hours. He complained, “I did not expect to see so many private vehicles on the roads.” Despite being happy with the footfalls at his general store in Ramnagri, Rajeev Bhushan Mishra, rued, “Many customers continue to violate the Covid safety guidelines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/as-govt-lifts-lockdown-patnaites-flout-covid-safety-norms/articleshow/83379635.cms||---

AIIMS-P nodal officer Dr Sanjeev Kumar said the detection of aspergillus indicated a new trend and there could be more such cases in the state. The doctors at the AIIMS-P were busy in the treatment of all the six aspergillus fungus. AIIMS-P has 85 patients undergoing tretament for black fungus. “They had recovered from the Covid infection in the second phase and did not have black fungus infection. Though in another patient, the lungs were found infected with candida fungus, which is a common disease and not to worry about,” Dr Sanjeev said on Wednesday. Most of them have been diagnosed with this deadly fungal infection in different parts of their bodies after recovering from Covid-19, he added. Besides medication, including regular doses of Amphotericin-B injection, surgical intervention is also needed in some cases. AIIMS-P has designated four of its operation theatres for mucormycosis. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) had the highest number of 107 black fungus patients. Its superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said while 84 of them were Covid negative, six had both Covid infection and mucormycosis. Seven patients underwent surgery there on Wednesday. More cases of mucormycosis from districts may reach the hospitals as the second wave has infected a large number of people, he said. While the number of Covid patients admitted there dropped to three, the PMCH had 27 mucormycosis cases on Wednesday. Despite being the largest hospital in Bihar, PMCH had to refer some of its black fungus patients to IGIMS or AIIMS for surgery. PMCH superintendent Dr IS Thakur said the hospital lacked endoscopic system needed for surgery of mucormycosis. Hence, two patients had to be referred to other centres. Thakur, however, said PMCH has started the process of purchasing necessary instruments, including endoscope. NMCH had eight mucormycosis patients. However, it ran short of the Amphotericin-B injection on Wednesday afternoon. “We have sent urgent requirement to the health department and are waiting for supply,” said superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh. Altogether ten black fungus patients were undergoing treatment at Ruban hospital, a private health facility. Its managing director Dr Satyajeet Singh said three patients who expressed their inability to meet the cost of injections were referred to government hospitals. “On an average, each patient had to pay about Rs30,000 per day as the price of six vials of injection needed as scheduled doses for fungal treatment. Thus, in case of a patient would have to pay over Rs2 lakh for one-week treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aspergillus-infection-worries-aiims-p-doctors/articleshow/83379731.cms||VK Tripathi

Punjab police had handed over a copy of a rent agreement between the owner of the flat and the duo, which the Punjab cops found with the duo’s accomplice, Bharat Kumar, arrested from Gwalior earlier in the day, leading to the exact whereabouts of the men. According to the agreement, the men had promised to pay Rs 10,000 per month to the owner for 11 months with a deposit of Rs 20,000. They had reportedly started staying here since May 23, after being introduced to the owner by a local property agent. Cops said the owner is an interior designer and a resident of CIT Road. “We will be interrogating him to find out which documents he had checked before he rented out the flat to these two men,” said an officer. The Shukhobrishti Com-plex in New Town has around 12,000-odd flats, but, according to the officials of the cultural association at the complex, more than 70% of the occupants are tenants. “Most of the residents in this complex are tenants while the original owners live somewhere else and almost never come here. As a result, we have limited information about those staying here,” said Mainak Kanrar, a senior member of the MIG cultural association at the complex. The gated community was started by West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Company Ltd (WBHIDCO) and was developed by Bengal Shapoorji Housing Development Pvt Ltd, who still manage the entire infrastructure-related developments there. “We have almost zero security here. In most complexes, residents’ associations have a list of who lives in the complex. But here, one tenant further lets out the flat to someone else, and it is a common practice for tenants to bring in friends and others to stay with them a few days after moving in. We actually have no clue who our neighbours are,” said a young homemaker in the complex. Residents said a set of brokers — with unrestricted access inside the complex throughout the day — control the movement of tenants. The brokers can be found at the local shops outside the complex or hanging out at nearby tea stalls. Local residents alleged that these brokers bring in new tena-nts with limited backgro-und checks and subject the older residents to all sorts of harassment. “Most people had bought flats here for investment purposes. They contact us to rent out their flats and we do so. But whenever we bring in a tenant, he has to follow the usual norms and supply the relevant IDs,” said one of the brokers in New Town, who also deals with properties in Salt Lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/long-time-occupants-blame-brokers-for-unverified-tenants/articleshow/83382133.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Officials said the plants — set up using civic and CSR spending — are a big step towards creating self-sufficient hospitals that won't need to rely on outside sources for oxygen during the pandemic. In April, the region had reported widespread oxygen scarcity with both civic and private units reporting serious shortages. The four PMC hospitals — Naidu, Dalvi Hospital, Laygude Hospital and the Baner dedicated Covid unit — are currently producing 3,950 LPM oxygen. In PCMC limits, the New Akurdi Hospital and New Thergaon Hospital are producing a combined 2,010 LPM oxygen. The District Health Office said 36 more oxygen plants may be set up over the coming months, producing a combined 26,000 LPM.Pune Mayor, Muralidhar Mohol, said, “We have set up four plants. Eight more are in the pipeline. Besides setting up these plants, we have also increased our oxygen storage capacity to 52 metric tonnes. This will help us have better reserves if there's a rise in demand from civic or private hospitals in the future.”Mohol said Naidu Hospital, which has a current capacity of 1,800 LPM, can cater to nearly 170 patients. The hospital is also an oxygen filling station for jumbo and dura cylinders.PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said New Akurdi Hospital and New Thergaon Hospital can now accommodate nearly 200 patients needing oxygen support. “Work is on to set up seven more oxygen plants by June-end,” he said, adding that regular audits and checks will be carried out to ensure safety at the plants. In rural Pune, eight plants are generating 1,769 LMP oxygen. At least 21 more units, with a total capacity of 13,000 LPM, have been proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/14-civic-units-in-district-get-their-own-oxygen-plants/articleshow/83383181.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Singhal said that the state has reported 1,955 cumulative black fungus cases. “There are currently 1,301 active cases. There are ample stocks of posaconazole injections and tablets. The state has so far supplied about 20,000 Amphotericin B injections to the districts to treat the patients,” said Singhal. The health secretary added that the teleconsultations offered by the 104 call centre crossed the five lakh mark. “As many as 5,012 doctors, including 951 specialist doctors, registered with the 104 call centre to offer teleconsultation services. The outbound calls from the 104 call centre touched the 5.5 lakh mark on Wednesday,” said Singhal. The state health department hired doctors to provide remote teleconsultation and to evaluate the 104 callers for Covid-19 symptoms. The doctors would also offer virtual triaging and advisory services for patients or suspected cases on testing, medications, hospital admission, etc. The 104 call centre is working in three shifts. However, the quantum of incoming calls has decreased in the last two weeks. For example, the call centre received 19,175 calls on May 3 as against only 2,482 calls on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/104-outbound-calls-cross-5-lakh-mark/articleshow/83379572.cms||---

Sangam Dairy declared a Rs 6 crore profit, considered too low according to market experts. ACB verified balance sheets of private dairies in the state and found profits ranging between 15 to 20 per cent. Sangam Dairy reported a turnover of Rs 980 crore during the last fiscal but declared Rs 6 crore profit. “Even by a conservative estimate of 10 per cent profit, Sangam Dairy should have made a profit of Rs 96 crore. However, the board showed Rs 6 crore profit. This needs investigation as money belongs to milk producers,” said an official associated with the probe. Officials suspect that large sums of money were diverted to unauthorised accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/low-profit-puzzle-at-sangam-dairy-under-lens/articleshow/83380056.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Can’t tax Swiss account in India if there’s no info, says ITAT||MUMBAI: Steps taken by an income tax (I-T) officer to bring to tax the maximum outstanding balance allegedly lying in a Swiss bank account has not found favour with the Delhi bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). The late Bhushan Lal Sawhney (now represented by his wife), challenged the additions made to his income on two grounds. One, that the assessment order pertaining to the six years from financial year 2005-06 to 2010-11 was time-barred. Second, no incriminating evidence was recovered during a search that had also been conducted on the individual taxpayer. Thus, the additions made on account of unexplained deposits in the Swiss bank account and interest earned thereon were unjustified. Based on the facts of the case, and as the Swiss authorities did not part with information pertaining to these years, the ITAT decided in his favour. In its recent judgment, the ITAT ordered deletion of this sum of about Rs 9.2 crore that was added to the income of the individual taxpayer. It also ordered deletion of interest income allegedly earned from the overseas bank account that was assessed in the taxpayer’s hands in subsequent years. The ITAT noted that information could be provided by the Swiss competent authorities only from April 1, 2011. Earlier years (to which this litigation pertained) were not covered by the Exchange of Information Article in the India-Switzerland tax treaty. While the I-T officer had sought to bring the bank balance (unaccounted overseas money) to tax in India, the ITAT noted that — based on the information available with the I-T department’s investigation wing — there was no incriminating material available on record to make additions to income in any of the assessment years that were under litigation. Interestingly, while the taxpayer’s son had admitted to the existence of the Swiss bank account, this was denied by the taxpayer (bank account holder). According to government officials, the genesis of the HSBC-Geneva account cases, which are in litigation at various levels, dates back to 2007 when an employee of HSBC Bank-Geneva obtained information on nearly 30,000 bank accounts and became a whistleblower. It is regarded as the biggest bank leak in history, covering the period 2005-07, with the aggregate sum of funds in these accounts amounting to $120 billion. The employee took refuge in France, and in 2011 the French government shared information of the bank account holders with authorities in India and other countries by way of what is referred to as a ‘base note’. Even in this case heard by the ITAT, the information was received by the I-T authorities from the French competent authorities. However, the lack of information directly from the Swiss authorities for the years in question and lack of incriminating evidence consequent to the search proved to be a stumbling block.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cant-tax-swiss-a/c-in-india-if-theres-no-info-says-itat/articleshow/83383500.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa industries get nod for 12-hour shifts in lieu of eight-hour||PANAJI: In a move toreduce exposure and footfalls at industries, the state government has allowed factories and industries to employ workers in 12-hour shifts a day till September 30. Chief inspector of factories and boilers Vivek Marathe, who issued the notification on Tuesday, said the decision has been taken to enable factories to deal with said exceptional requirement due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The total number of hours of work in any week, including overtime, shall not exceed 60 and no worker shall be allowed to work overtime for more than seven days at a stretch. The inspectorate of factories and boilers said that certain provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 (Central Act No. 63 of 1948) have been relaxed in order to extend the working hours for optimum utilisation of the workers in the factories. The temporary norms state that if a worker works on a weekly holiday, a compensatory holiday needs to be given to the worker within one to two months immediately. With an increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the state, industrial units are facing “manpower issues amongst the permanent, temporary and contractual employees” Confederation of Indian Industry - Goa chairman Atul Jadhav said. CII had asked the state government to enhance the current limits of overtime from 50 hours in a quarter, which the government has agreed to and increased to 75 hours in a quarter. In 2020, the government had given industries a similar leeway to operate two shifts of 12 hours each instead of three shifts. Jadhav said that doing so will ease the process of contact tracing, provide flexibility in the event of quarantining any employee who tests positive as well as their close contacts. Industry bodies said that it is easier to sanitise common places and facilities such as transport, canteen, wash rooms, changing rooms if they are used by fewer workers. “Overall, there will be reduced footfalls of workers in the factory on a given day thereby reducing risk and contact,” Jadhav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/industries-get-nod-for-12-hr-shifts-in-lieu-of-8-hr/articleshow/83383826.cms||---

The victim, Ganga Goswami, had torched herself using the sanitizer that her son had got for her when she was infected with Covid-19 about a month ago. She had also recovered from Covid, but was suffering from illnesses that were causing a lot of body pain. Police suspect it to be suicide and have started investigation after registering as case of accidental death in Varachha police station Her family members told police that she was fed-up due to prolonged illnesses and took the extreme step due to unbearable pain. “She was suffering from diabetes and other related illnesses. She was suffering from severe aches as well,” said sources in Varachha police station. The family told police that they were getting her treatment done properly and had arranged for required medicines, but she got no relief from pain. “She told me on Saturday evening that she had severe pain. We were planning to take her for a check-up on Monday, but before that she took this step,” her son Pravin told TOI. Pravin, a diamond artisan, said his mother went to the gallery of the apartment and torched herself after dousing sanitizer. “I woke up hearing her screams and rushed to save her. After dousing the fire, we called 108 ambulance,” she said. “She had recovered from Covid a month ago and I brought the sanitiser when she had tested positive,” he said.  The investigation will continue once the family returns from their native village Bhaguda in Bhavnagar after performing the last rites. Police will register statements of the family members and relatives,” said police. Goswami had been living with her son’s family for the past few years. Her husband passed away in 1995.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/fed-up-of-illness-woman-torches-self-with-sanitizer/articleshow/83379024.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Goa||Goa: Pramod Sawant-Nilesh Cabral meet today over power woes||PANAJI: A day after power minister Nilesh Cabral slammed the government for refusing to sanction electrical infrastructure upgradation works, CM Pramod Sawant has called for a meeting to discuss the issue on Thursday. “A meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday),” Cabral told TOI on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Cabral had said Sawant’s finance department was sending back his department’s proposals with a note that it should be sent after the budget. Cabral had said if this continued, it would be better for him to “sit at home”. Earlier in the day, Sawant tried to downplay Cabral’s outburst against his department and said he would speak to his power minister. “The finance department must have taken their decisions based on some rules,” he said without giving any reasons for stalling the electricity department’s proposals. Sawant also said the government would “mostly call for an assembly session on July 19, and in that session the full budget will be passed”. Currently, the government has only taken a vote on account and is yet to pass the full budget. Cabral had said that even after the budget is passed, the finance department will send another circular curtailing expenditure. Cabral said the issue isn’t shortage of funds but the indifference of finance department officials that is hindering the work of underground cabling in the state among other infrastructure projects. The power minister had said that it had been decided by the state government to give priority to underground cabling of 33KV and 11KV lines, but the work has not progressed as planned. “I am asked all the time and I keep assuring that the work is being done. I feel ashamed of myself. If we lay underground cables, our people will not be inconvenienced as much. I will ask the CM how works like underground cabling are to be taken up,” Cabral had said. The Power minister had said the issue wasn’t shortage of funds but the indifference of the finance department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-cabral-meet-today-over-power-woes/articleshow/83383536.cms||---

Samastipur SP Manavjit Singh Dhillon said an FIR against Shrinarayan Singh has been registered with Rosera police station under relevant sections of The Prevention of Corruption Act. “The SI was posted at the Rosera police station. He was sent to Muzaffarpur for production before a vigilance court there,” Dhillon said. The SI has confessed to his crime. The SP said Singh had picked up the bike of one Basant Mandal from his residence on Monday. Mandal was evading arrest in a liquor smuggling case registered with Rosera police station on July 27 last year. “The SI didn’t make a station diary entry of the bike being brought at the police station,” the SP said. Dhillon said Mandal later contacted Singh, who demanded Rs25,000 for releasing the bike. “One Suraj Kumar negotiated with Singh on Mandal’s behalf. He also informed us before finalising the deal for Rs9500,” he said. Suraj also shared the call recordings in which the SI was heard demanding money. “The currency notes were photographed with their serial numbers visible. Suraj handed them over to Singh at his quarter at around 12.30am in the presence of independent witnesses. Soon after the money exchanged hands, a raid was conducted and Singh was arrested,” he said. Rosera police station SHO Sitaram Prasad said the FIR against Singh has been registered on the basis of a written complaint of Suraj. Prasad said Singh had hardly three years’ service left. He had become SI from constable. “Two accused in the liquor smuggling case which Singh was investigating were already arrested. Only Mandal was evading arrest,” he said. Prasad said 315 litres of IMFL smuggled from Haryana and West Bengal were seized from a pick-up van while being unloaded at Mahisar Tola under Rosera police station on the July 27 night last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cop-nabbed-for-taking-rs-9500-bribe-from-liquor-smuggler-in-samastipur/articleshow/83379012.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Raghopur police station SHO Mukesh Kumar said the slain person was identified as Salim alias Bhola Khalifa (44). Salim had four sons and Meraz is married. The SHO said that Salim’s younger son Sameer Kumar had lodged an FIR against his brother for shooting their father dead. “Salim was shot in the chest resulting in his death on the spot. After quizzing, we came to know that Salim frequently used to thrash his wife and hurl abuses over petty domestic issues which Meraz used to protest,” the police officer added. The only reason which police could ascertain behind the murder was that Meraz was annoyed with his father’s ill behaviour. “However, further investigations would continue to find out the details. No one in the village is ready to believe that Meraz was of such a mentality that he could kill his father,” the SHO said. A fortnight back, Salim had thrashed his wife after which mukhiya other people from the village had intervened to settle down the issue. “On Tuesday night, Sameer had caught hold of Meraz when he was trying to jump from the terrace after shooting Salim. However, he let him flee after Meraz threatened that he would shoot him also if he was not allowed to escape,” Kumar said. Salim’s body was handed over to the family members after postmortem and raids are on to nab Meraz, who is evading arrest. The SHO said that Salim was a butcher by profession and his sons are involved in trading of goats and sheep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youth-kills-father-in-vaishali-village/articleshow/83379169.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Patna: Son-in-law among four held in retired banker’s murder case||PATNA: Four persons, including the son-in-law and daughter-in-law of the deceased, have been arrested for killing State Bank of India’s retired deputy manager Shailendra Kumar inside his car on NH-30 near Bhikua under Fatuha police station area in rural Patna on Sunday. The car driver, Anil Kumar (55), was also shot at and injured. SP (rural) Kantesh Kumar Mishra said besides Shailendra’s son-in-law Pawan Kumar (25) and daughter-in-law Nibha Devi (23), police also arrested Pawan’s brother Tinku Kumar (22) and shooter Amar Kumar (21) on Tuesday night. Shailendra (60), who retired from SBI Bhagwat Nagar branch at Agamkuan in Patna City on February 28, was shot dead when he was coming to Patna from his residence in Biharsharif. SP (rural) Kantesh Kumar Mishra said besides Pawan and Nibha, police arrested Pawan’s brother Tinku Kumar (22) and shooter Amar Kumar (21) for involvement in Shailendra’s murder. Amar was paid Rs40,000 as advance for the contract killing and he was going to take the remaining Rs60,000 when the police nabbed him in Ramkrishna Nagar police station area in Patna. One pistol, a live cartridge, both two-wheelers used in the killing and three cellphones have been seized, he said. Mishra said the murder was a fallout of extramarital affair and Rs50 lakh Shailendra had paid to Pawan for buying a plot of land in Biharsharif. “Pawan was married to Shailendra’s mentally challenged daughter with apromise that his father-in-law will keep helping him financially to look after her. However, Pawan didn’t receive the assistance as per his wish,” he said. The SP said Pawan developed an extramarital affair with Shailendra’s elder son’s wife Nibha and they clandestinely got married in a court in February this year. “The elder son is physically challenged. Shailendra had no knowledge about Pawan’s affair with Nibha,” he said. Mishra said Shailendra wanted to purchase a plot for his younger son who works in a bank. Pawan grabbed the opportunity and took Rs50 lakh from Shailendra in the last four months in the name of buying him a plot in Biharsharif. “However, the land could not be registered and Shailendra was coming to Patna to meet Pawan when he was killed,” he said. The SP said police have documentary evidence of Rs23 lakh paid to Pawan and Tinku. “Investigation is on to know how the rest amount was paid and where it was invested,” he said. He said Tinku and Amar were on a bike while Pawan was on a scooty behind Shailendra’s car that day. “Amar had opened fire. He is a resident of Kankarbagh in Patna. Police are trying to ascertain his criminal antecedents,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/son-in-law-among-4-held-in-retired-bankers-murder-case/articleshow/83379170.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Goa||Deaths may be higher than official numbers in Goa: Michael Lobo||CALANGUTE: Ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo on Wednesday said the number of people who have died due to Covid-19 is probably much higher than what has been reported. “A lot of deaths have not been reported as Covid-19 deaths. Someone dies of a heart attack and then a few days later, his wife and children test positive for Covid-19. Then we come to know that the death was due to Covid-19,” he said at Parra. The minister said that Covid-19 has shown that most rural areas are ill-equipped to deal with a situation like a pandemic. “During the pandemic, people from different villages were calling others in other villages seeking ambulances because there were no ambulances available in their own villages. Every panchayat should have an ambulance, which is not there at the moment. Instead of spending money on this and that, I feel the government should provide one ambulance to each of the panchayats,” Lobo said. Corporates readily sponsored two ambulances — each costing Rs 26 lakh — as part of their CSR when he contacted them for help, Lobo said. “We’re giving one to Saligao and the other to Siolim. We already have ambulances in Calangute, Candolim and Parra,” he said even as he urged panchayats and MLAs to request corporates to donate ambulances as part of their CSR, “because they’re ready to do so and many lives will be saved”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-deaths-may-be-higher-than-official-nos/articleshow/83383717.cms||---

His body was recovered from the outskirts of the village. A member of the forensic science laboratory team, which collected the scientific evidences, did not rule out the use of explosives as the high-intensity blast had razed a part of the building to the ground. Surprisingly, most of the men of the village have gone into hiding and even women did not cooperate with the police team in the investigation. DIG (Bhagalpur zone) Sujeet Kumar, who visited the site again on Wednesday, said: “It is really unusual that local residents are not available today in the locality. It is also a matter of investigation as to why people have gone underground after the incident.” The DIG said the the FSL team has gathered evidences and it is still under investigation as to the reasons behind explosion and what material was there at the madrassa that led to the massive blast, demolishing major parts of the building. The explosion had occurred inside the madrassa at the Noori Islampur mosque building under Banka Sadar police station area. The DIG told reporters that the investigation was underway and it will be too early to come to the conclusion as to how the incident occurred. “The death of one person and his background is being investigated,” he said. The deceased Maulana Abdul Momin Ansari, son of Md Abdul Sattar, was a native of Kalijor locality under Sarath block in Deoghar district of neighbouring Jharkhand. He was stated to be associated as imam of the madrassa. He had received serious injuries in the blast. Fearing police action, some miscreants hurriedly carried him away for medical treatment by some local health practitioners. But when he succumbed to his injuries, the body was thrown out from an unidentified vehicle on the outskirts of the village in the evening, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-clue-in-madrassa-blast-case/articleshow/83379084.cms||Kumar Rajesh

He said a screening committee appointed for the purpose had given its approval in March and the process for its establishment started soon. He said the FSL will start functioning by the end of this year or early next year. He said a sum of Rs4.35 crore has already been sanctioned for the purchase of necessary equipment, including genetic analyser, DNA cold room for preserving DNA samples at minus 80 degree C, DNA extraction automation, RTPCR among others.

The state government has allowed private offices to function with 50% capacity till June 15. The government offices, which were functioning with 25% staff in the office, are now allowed to work with 50% staff. However, outsiders in the government offices are not allowed. Pritish Kumar Sinha, who works as a service manager at a private firm, said, “As we have worked from home most of the days in recent past, we become accustomed to that situation. I think, the offices should run with 33% staff as there are still chances of getting infected,” he said. An executive at a private pharmaceutical company, Gaurav Agarwal said the attendance was low on the first day of reopening of the office. “Many people failed to turn up due to emergency reasons,” he said. “All the Covid-19 protocols were followed on the first day at office,” said an insurance agent Pradeep Singh. He said the office admin has instructed all the staff to wear double-mask all the time. “Body temperature was checked and sanitizer was also given to all staff. Extra face-mask was kept in case if someone forgets to bring one,” he added. Ravi Ranjan (39), who works at a service centre, said the staff had been asked to take the anti-Covid vaccine as they have to come in customers’ contact. “The office has allowed only vaccinated staff to come. Those who have not taken the vaccine have to work from home. I have yet to take the vaccine, so I am still working from home,” he said. Most of the private establishments were still chalking out a plan to take precautionary measures and allow 50% of employees on alternate days. Ashish Agarwal, manger at a development agency, said as the news of reopening of private firm came late, they were not able to make necessary arrangements. “Many staff had gone to their home towns and were working from home. So, we have decided to reopen the office from the third week of June,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/private-offices-reopen-with-thin-attendance/articleshow/83379512.cms||Faryal Rumi

To clear the hurdles for the inauguration of the project, the government has released Rs 1,365.30 crore for the rehabilitation and resettlement package under the programme. The government issued the order on June 8, releasing Rs 1,301.56 crore for the R&R package and another Rs 110 crore for land acquisition for Theegaleru and Eastern Main canal works. The project is aimed at providing drinking and irrigation water for less-developed regions of Prakasam, Nellore and Kadapa districts. It was planned to give water to 29 mandals in the three districts, exclusively covering the areas of Markapuram in Prakasam, Udayagiri in Nellore and Badwel in Kadapa districts, benefiting 4.38 lakh acres for irrigation and 15 lakh people for drinking water. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu laid the foundation for the project on March 5, 1996. A technical advisory committee had given its feasibility report in 2001, following which Naidu assigned the contract to a Swiss company with an estimated cost of Rs 2.5 crore in the later part of 2001. However, the Swiss company did not begin the work as the state government could not get clearances from the Centre. Later, Y S Rajasekhar Reddy laid the foundation stone on October 27, 2004 and the project cost went up to Rs 5,500 crore. Though the link canals in Nellore and Kadapa districts were completed by 2009, the tunnel work could not be completed due to political uncertainty in the state and the subsequent bifurcation. On February 20, 2020, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy visited the project site for the first time. The government later handed over the work to MEIL, which completed work on the first tunnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/work-on-first-tunnel-in-veligonda-project-ends/articleshow/83380018.cms||Gopi Dara

Hero Cycles started with only 50 outlets offering financing five years ago but it has now hit 300 plus with a target of hitting 700 outlets very soon. In urban markets cycle ticket sizes have gone up from Rs 6,000-Rs 7,000 to Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 on average with financing helping dealers close the deal. Financing is also picking up speed in the electric cycle segment where ticket sizes are around Rs 25,000. In rural markets, where the roadster bikes cost around Rs 5,000, the financing footprint is still low but microfinance institutions and some NBFCs are offering bike loans with the objective of increasing the share of the financed commuter cycle from 1% right now to 15%. “Financed cycles comprised around 1% of the bicycles sold by the industry in FY21. Higher end premium cycles comprise about 20% of the financed bikes. We are seeing that customers are inclined to buy high end products and we believe financing will help achieve their aspirations,”said Pankaj Munjal, CMD, Hero Motors Company Group of which Hero Cycles is a part. At the other end of the market though the financing push has faced problems due to the pandemic. “Some micro finance institutes are doing cycle financing but the ticket size is so small and the segment so risky, big players don’t want to bet on it despite RBI guidelines on priority sector lending and the overdraft facility under Jan Dhan Yojna,” said KB Thakur, secretary general AICMA (All India Cycle Manufacturers’ Association). The good news is some NBFCs are now testing the rural market as well as an extension of their personal loan network. “We already have 2 million plus customers spread over 4,00,000 villages so we are looking at cycle financing as a local opportunity We are exploring the requirements and viability,” said Ramesh Iyer, MD Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services. Cycle makers themselves are also tying up with micro finance institutes to push financing of rural bikes as well. “The industry is open to strategic partnerships but a larger drive is required from various banks,” said Munjal. “Financial institutions should consider this product as a livelihood enhancer in rural areas,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/as-demand-for-cycles-rises-financing-is-picking-up-speed-too/articleshow/83381447.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
---||Business||Reliance Infratel ‘fraud’ tag to go after sale: Lenders||Mumbai: In a bid to get the resolution of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Infratel back on track, lenders led by SBI have said that the ‘fraud’ tag on the company would go once it is acquired by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio. However, the criminal investigations would continue in respect of the erstwhile promoters. Last month, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm had moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), seeking disclosures of a forensic audit report of Reliance Infratel after some lenders classified the loan as ‘fraud’. This classification happened after the NCLT had approved Jio’s resolution plan to pick up the tower and fibre assets of the Anil Ambani group company for around Rs 4,400 crore on December 3, 2020. This turn of events had resulted in the resolution plan getting delayed. According to banking sources, it is already established by law that after implementation of a resolution plan under the bankruptcy code, the fraud tag on the company facing bankruptcy proceedings is removed and criminal proceedings will apply only against the erstwhile promoters of Reliance Infratel. The NCLT had in April reiterated that rules under the code will hold precedence over other laws and actions, such as attachment of property by the Enforcement Directorate. The court had also held that the ED cannot attach properties of Bhushan Steel and Power — a company sold under the bankruptcy process to JSW — for frauds committed by the previous management. Lenders have informed the court that once Reliance Jio takes over by implementing the resolution plan, banks would strike the name of the company from the fraud or wilful defaulters’ list. However, this would not have any impact on the action against the erstwhile management or promoters. Reliance Infratel owns around 43,000 towers and 1.72 lakh kilometres of optic fibre network. This infrastructure would help Reliance Jio to boost its tower infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reliance-infratel-fraud-tag-to-go-after-sale-lenders/articleshow/83383382.cms||Mayur Shetty

The high court said a vigilance probe is required against the official who granted permission. Justice Narayana Pisharadi R declined to stay the probe after considering a petition filed by Anto Augustin and Josekutty Augustin of Vazhavatta in Wayanad, who are accused in the case filed by forest department. Through their plea, the accused contended that the trees were cut from leased land on the basis of a government order. Trees were cut only from land that was attested by the village officer as non-forest, the plea said. However, prosecution argued that the tree felling was done by misinterpreting the government’s order and only a tip of the iceberg has been revealed yet. Only a preliminary enquiry has been conducted and the involvement of several government officials, including those in higher ranks, is suspected in this case, prosecution submitted while arguing not to issue a stay. Justice P Gopinath, who was considering another tree-cutting case, said a vigilance probe is required against the official who granted permission in the Wayanad case. The court was considering a petition filed by Lisamma Sebastian of Kasaragod seeking to cut a tree adjacent to her house as it poses danger to her home. During the hearing, justice Gopinath asked who was the official responsible for granting permission and why no vigilance enquiry is being conducted against him. As the government has sought time to respond, the court has scheduled a hearing on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/why-no-vacb-probe-against-officials-hc/articleshow/83381113.cms||---
---||Nashik||Malegaon municipal body cancels hospital’s registration||NASHIK: The Malegaon Municipal Corporation has cancelled the registration of a private hospital and initiated a similar process against another hospital for allegedly producing fake documents and causing financial loss to the civic body. The corporation has lodged a First Information Report against the hospital with the Malegaon Camp police station for cheating the corporation. Malegaon civic commissioner Bhalchandra Gosavi said both the private hospitals were owned by the same person and that the fire no objection certificate (NoC) required from the fire brigade was obtained only for one of the two hospitals. The move comes following state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse’s visit to the hospital in the last week of May after he received complaints regarding the high bills being issued to Covid patients admitted there. “The minister asked us to carry out a thorough inspection of the hospital’s papers. Our teams visited the hospital and the discrepancies were found,” the commissioner said. On November 11, 2020, the owner of the hospital had presented documents to the civic body’s medical officer for getting the registration under the Bombay Nursing Home Registration Act, 1949. At the time, the fire NoC was attached. The documents had mentioned that the fire NoC was for both the hospitals. “However, when probed, it was found that the fire brigade had given the NoC on February 8, 2020, to only one hospital. The certificate was manipulated to include the name of both the hospitals. Our deputy commissioner Raju Khairnar has thus lodged an FIR against the owner for cheating the corporation,” Gosavi said. The FIR also noted that the owner had cheated the corporation causing financial loss. “The live and licence agreement — presented to the tax department for property tax — showed the agreement for rent between hospital owner and the property owner as Rs 70,000, while the registered live and licence agreement showed the agreement was for Rs 1.10 lakh. This has caused a financial loss of Rs 2.30 lakh since January 2020,” Raju Khairnar alleged. Sapna Thakre replaced by Hemand Gadri as medical officer The Malegaon commissioner has transferred the medical officer of the corporation Dr Sapna Thakre. The charge has been handed over to Dr Hemant Gadri. “Dr Thakre had been handling the responsibility as the medical officer of the corporation during the Covid situation so far. She has now been relieved and Dr Gadri is taking over,” said the commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/malegaon-municipal-body-cancels-hosps-registration/articleshow/83376483.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Work to start on medical college in Piduguralla||GUNTUR: The decks have been finally cleared for the launch of the works on the Government Medical College (GMC) at Piduguralla. The medical college is coming up with a super specialty hospital at an estimated cost of Rs 475 crore. The judicial preview committee has cleared tender documents filed by the government. “The medical college is coming up with an 800 to 1,000-bed super specialty hospital. We have already acquired about 70 acres in Piduguralla for the medical college which is going to be the lifeline of the Palnadu region,” said Gurazala legislator Kasu Mahesh Reddy. The medical college was one of the key promises made by Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy during his assembly election campaign. People in Gurazala and Macherla constituencies have to travel about 150 to 200 kilometres to reach district capital for better healthcare facilities. After clearing several hurdles, including a technical process, land acquisition and clearances, the government has given the green signal to launch the works. “There are about eight lakh people are in Gurazala and Macherla constituencies. Most villages are located in remote areas and access to towns is very difficult. All hospitals in the region have a collective bed strength of 120. The medical college will change the scene,” said Mahesh Reddy. The hospital would have quarters for resident doctors and student hostels. The medical college with an initial intake of 100 students is expected to begin classes from 2023 as the government is aiming to complete the civil structures by 2023. “Nagarjuna Sagar project is in north Palnadu, and the government medical college will come up in the south. This is going to be a lifeline for the entire Narasaraopet Lok Sabha constituency,” said Dr K Narasima Murthy of Piduguralla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/work-to-start-on-medical-college-in-piduguralla/articleshow/83379979.cms||Samdani MN

The two members Raj Kumar Bhargava and Lalit Bhasin cited, among other reasons for their resignations, the chairperson’s refusal to convene a board meeting to discuss the company’s financial problems. Bhargava said he doesn’t see any future in the company as no funds were coming from the promoters, while Bhasin said that there is an atmosphere of hostility among the promoters and that he did not wish to remain a part of this environment. The company informed the stock exchanges about the two independent directors’ resignations on Wednesday. Property manager Hyatt suspended the operations of the Mumbai hotel as Asian Hotels (West) had stopped supporting the business. JW Marriott Delhi Aerocity, on the other hand, remains operational. Bhasin, an advocate, further said in his resignation letter that Asian Hotels (West) was not only in default of bank loans but also of statutory dues. “No remedial steps have been taken to meet the financial disaster the company is facing,” he said. Asian Hotels (West) has outstanding borrowings of Rs 263 crore. The company had said that the default was because of Covid impacting its business severely. Besides, the lender (Yes Bank) held all its funds including daily hotel collections in an escrow account, and the company was not allowed to make any payments towards government taxes, salaries (to more than 300 employees) and vendor payments. Yes Bank has only made some payments from the escrow account towards the hotel’s electricity, water and gas charges, Asian Hotels (West) had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/2-directors-quit-co-that-owns-hyatt-regency-mumbai/articleshow/83383485.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Patna||HAM(S) demands coordination panel in NDA||PATNA: The Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday demanded a coordination committee of the Bihar NDA partners. “The HAM(S) urges the top NDA leadership to constitute a coordination committee of the alliance partners in Bihar. Otherwise, the situation will become ‘bhayanak’ (terrible) for the combine,” HAM(S) spokesman Danish Rizwan said on Wednesday. “Some leaders have been trying to destabilise the government (led by Nitish Kumar) by issuing statements against it,” Rizwan said. “These leaders, by issuing statements, have been giving an opportunity to the opposition to attack the government,” Rizwan said while obviously referring to BJP state chief Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and MLC Tunna Ji Pandey, who was suspended by the saffron party recently for his utterances against Nitish. Interestingly, Manjhi had kept demanding a coordination committee in the grand alliance led by RJD before joining hands with Nitish to be part of the NDA government after the state assembly elections last year. The Bihar NDA never had any coordination committee. If at all, JD(U) and BJP had the state NDA’s convener in former minister Nand Kishore Yadav during 2005-10, but not after that. Even as the number of the NDA constituents increased from 2013, with the Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) joining it, the NDA did not have even its state convener after Nitish dismantled the NDA government in June 2013 and joined the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance), though only to walk out of it in July 2017 to be with the BJP, again. Ironically, during the 2015 assembly elections, even the HAM(S) was a part of the NDA, but there was no coordination committee to manage the pulls and pressures of the constituents BJP, LJP, RLSP and HAM(S). The BJP enjoyed the role of the ‘big brother’. In this backdrop, Rizwan’s warning has acquired a portentous note, observers feel. For, the BJP and HAM(S) leaders have been having ugly spat for the last ten days, playing it out in the public through the media outlets. To make the situation more critical, the HAM(S) is within the NDA by virtue of being close to Nitish and, like it, Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) led by minister Mukesh Sahani by being close to BJP. Therefore, a section of the BJP leaders countered Manjhi’s barbs against the BJP top brass by saying that he was in the NDA and its government on the basis of “anukampa” (compassionate ground). Implicitly, it was a stark message that if the BJP willed and pressed for it, HAM(S) could be out of the NDA. Recently, both Manjhi and Sahani were closeted together, pointing to the persistence of fluid situation within the NDA. On Wednesday, the BJP chose to come in the damage control mode and described Nitish as the NDA “coordinator,” taking the NDA partners along with him within the combine. BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said, “The NDA in Bihar is working on a common agenda of crime and corruption-free sustainable development of the state. Sri Nitish Kumar Ji as CM is leading excellently the (state) government, coordinating well with all the alliance partners. All the alliance partners are a part of the cabinet, also maintaining good rapport with each other. The NDA is rock solid, unaffected by individual statements.” Dismissing the “individual statements” made by one or the other leader, Anand also said, “The high expectations of any individual leader, as well as the leaders working under pressure to fulfil the high expectations of the common masses, is obvious (read natural), which is the reason of some on and off statements.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hams-demands-coordination-panel-in-nda/articleshow/83380047.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Kolkata||STF officer shot, admitted in hospital with nerve damage||Kolkata/Suri: Kartik Mohan Ghosh (48) was part of the advanced STF team that had knocked on the door of the second-floor flat, asking the residents to surrender. They responded with a hail of bullets, one of which hit Ghosh on his left shoulder near the strap of his bullet-proof vest and exited through his left arm. As the impact threw Ghosh off, his colleagues covered him and returned fire. Ghosh was taken to AMRI Hospital, Salt Lake. The bullet had entered through the left ‘shoulder cap’ and exited through the left ‘mid-arm’. “He has suffered nerve damage and can’t move his left wrist. An MRI and an NCV test has been done to assess the damage. Depending on the reports, doctors will take a call on whether he needs surgery,” a hospital spokesperson said. Ghosh is being treated by neuro-surgeon Dibyendu Kumar Ray and cardio-vascular surgeon Jayanta Das. A Karimpur resident, Ghosh has always been in the thick of things. Three days ago, he was part of a team which intercepted a Bihar-bound truck on National Highway-60 at Suri and recovered 20kg of explosives, 30 rounds of ammunition, five improvised 7mm pistols and 10 magazines. Three persons were arrested in this connection. Before being drafted into the Bengal STF, he worked in the Special Operations Group (SOG) of Birbhum Police. A CU postgraduate, Ghosh joined STF around the time it was formed in September 2019. Earlier, only the Kolkata Police had an STF unit. But down the line, it was felt that a dedicated unit was required for Bengal, in addition to Kolkata. Due to the nature of its operations, the officers were hand-picked from various units across the state. Ghosh had applied as an STF inspector. “An encounter in one of New Town’s biggest complexes is always fraught with risk. The STF officers were supported by Bidhannagar cops to ensure that none came close to the target location. By a rough estimate, around 45 rounds were fired. The two gangsters had 89 live ammunition left. This was a well-coordinated and well-executed operation. Hand-picked personnel led the operation and there were several units on standby who would have moved in quickly,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stf-officer-shot-admitted-in-hospital-with-nerve-damage/articleshow/83382153.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Overall, 121 transactions — including PE deals — aggregating to $8.2 billion were reported during the month. As against this, the activity was muted in May last year due to a nationwide lockdown during the first Covid wave. There has been a 39% increase in deal volumes, with a robust 15% in transaction values year-to-date. Deals continued unhindered this year as corporates were in advanced stages of negotiations, and had adapted to the Covid situation, industry experts say. Since lockdowns are more ‘localised’ now, the deal activity is expected to continue this trend. In the M&A space, the information technology sector with nine deals leads in volumes, while in terms of value, it was energy & natural resources. There were a total of 37 M&A transactions totalling $5.3 billion, with 84 PE deals valued at $2.9 billion struck in May, according to latest data collated by Grant Thornton. The M&A space is led by Adani Group’s $3.5-billion acquisition of SB Energy, one of the largest deals in the renewable energy space. In the PE space, startups are driving volumes with a 62% share, while transports and logistics capture values with 25%. PE major Blackstone Group’s acquisition of Embassy Industrial Parks at an enterprise valuation of Rs 5,250 crore is the largest PE deal for the month, as well as the largest investment in the Indian logistics and warehousing segment. Further, IT & ITeS, consumer technology and healthcare will continue to be hottest sectors, driving M&A activity, while BFSI is set to recover, industry experts say. Healthcare — which witnessed a surge with big-ticket deals in pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients last year — will be a hot favourite. According to Bain & Company’s India Private Equity survey 2020, investors expect increasing interest in digitally accelerated opportunities such as digital health (65%), fintech (57%), and edtech (52%). Recent deal activity indicates that deal makers have recognised that there will be short-term hiccups and disruption from Covid, but the growth prospects of select sectors/businesses are strong. Government’s impetus to the manufacturing sector and infrastructure is likely to bring in deal interest in those spaces too, the Grant Thornton analysis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/over-8bn-ma-deals-struck-in-may/articleshow/83383431.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

The voting process is likely to be completed by June 15. Ares SSG with Asset Care Reconstruction Enterprise, Authum Infrastructure, Avenue Capital and Capri Global are ahead in the race to acquire the housing finance company. Ares and Avenue Capital are global funds, while Authum and Capri Global are domestic non-banking finance companies. Unlike other large defaults where creditors have initiated bankruptcy proceedings, the RHF debt resolution is under the June 7, 2019 circular of the Reserve Bank of India, which provides for out-of-court restructuring under the prudential framework for resolution of stressed assets. Bank of Baroda as the lead bank and other banks have entered an inter-creditor agreement to facilitate the restructuring. Other lenders include Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India and Indian Bank.

It is learnt that Chouhan remained calm during the melee, but Mishra opposed the proposals for additional relief to the pipeline projects worth Rs10,369 crore in the Narmada basin. Mishra’s contention was that when the state government was trimming down the budget of every other departments, why the largesse on these projects. Secondly, he asked when the dams were not yet constructed, what was the need to hurry with the pipeline project. Several senior ministers, including Gopal Bhargava, supported Mishra while the others at the meet urged for passing the proposals unanimously. The home minister did not budge and said he wanted to register his protest on record for these projects. Thereafter heated exchanges were reported between the ministers. Amid the chaos, Mishra left the cabinet meeting midway and later visited the state BJP headquarters and held closed- door meeting with state BJP chief V D Sharma. The state cabinet passed the proposal after he left. Meanwhile, Congress on Wednesday claimed the tussle was over the division of commission from the contracts of pipelines that are to be laid. “There was a massive clash in the state cabinet meeting held on Tuesday,” said PCC spokesman Narendra Saluja. “The fight was over the division of commission over the pipeline work”, Saluja said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/heated-exchange-at-state-cabinet-meet/articleshow/83383200.cms||---

In a letter written to the Chief Justice, Anshul, whose father was murdered by the dera chief, has requested that the parole granted to Gurmeet on June 6 on medical grounds be cancelled and orders given to return him to the isolation facility at the jail premises. If any kind of medical assistance is required by the accused, the same may be arranged within the jail premises, Anshul has written in his letter. Anshul has written that it is a matter of record and a known fact that the accused has been kept in solitary confinement in jail and as such, it becomes highly unlikely that he would contact Covid-19 from within the premises. The fact that the accused refused to be treated at one of the top medical institutions of the state, PGIMS Rohtak, and insisted on treatment at a private facility raises doubts on his intentions, he has stated in his letter. The Chief Justice has also been apprised that Honeypreet, the socially adopted daughter of the dera chief who has been deployed as help for assistance on special request was the perpetrator and prime accused of violence that took place in Panchkula on August 25, 2017, when Gurmeet was convicted in rape cases. This pattern of seeking paroles one after the other could be a part of a devious plan that could turn dangerous and life threatening to the general public at large, since the accused has a history of creating public nuisance in large, Anshul has stated in his letter. Tests not available in Rohtak: Minister Haryana jail minister Ranjit Singh said the dera chief was admitted to Medanta hospital in Gurugram as some of the tests prescribed for him by doctors were not available in the local hospitals. He said that initial test suggested that the convict was Covid-19 positive though subsequent tests had shown him negative. “Whenever doctors at Medanta declare him medically fit, he would be taken back to jail,” the minister told media persons in Chandigarh on Wednesday. Regarding Honeypreet’s presence with the dera chief at Gurugram hospital, the minister said the jail department has nothing to do with those attending patients in the hospital. “We are only concerned with the security of the inmate,” he concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-giving-special-treatment-to-convict/articleshow/83383172.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19: In 110 days, Andhra Pradesh added cases totalling first wave||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh reported 8.88 lakh Covid-19 cases when the curve in the first wave reached a plateau with 30 new daily infections on February 15. The state took almost 11 months to sustainably flatten the curve. But during the catastrophic second wave, the state added the latest 8.88 lakh infections in just 110 days. The intensity of the transmissions can be gauged from the fact that the state accumulated about 5.91 lakh fresh cases in May alone, or nearly 35% of the total infections reported in the state since the onset of the pandemic outbreak in March last year. The manifold jump in the daily infections caught the state off guard in May. However, the daily case numbers started to thin out in the past two weeks. The state, which reported 20,000 to 24,000 cases a day during the first three weeks in May, is now recording 5,000 to 8,000 cases a day. The early signs of waning has led to an improvement on all parameters such as bed availability, case positivity rate and oxygen consumption. The pandemic outbreak posted complex and grim challenges to the state in terms of preparedness and management during the first wave. The state officials had to deal with different challenges during the different phases of lockdown and unlocking process last year. From the initial days of panic to stabilisation of cases in October to November, the state saw it all in the first wave. The same first wave, however, presented a unique opportunity to scale up health infrastructure and medical care for Covid-19 patients. Apart from improving its testing capacity to one lakh samples a day, the state added oxygen lines to nearly 30,000 beds in the first wave. The state has also augmented its tracing and treating mechanisms. The early signs of a potential second wave emerged in the second half of March and it reached the point of overwhelming the state’s health system in May. The challenges were different during the second wave. Liquid medical oxygen management took the centrestage in the second wave as oxygen consumption touched the roof. The state drew about 800 metric tonnes of oxygen for several days in May, compared to the peak consumption of 260 MT during the first wave. Hundreds of black fungus (mucormycosis) cases also surfaced in the second wave, leading to acute shortage of injections needed for treatment of the fungal infection. There was also a serious shortage of oxygen and ICU beds in the first three weeks of May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/in-110-days-ap-added-cases-totalling-1st-wave/articleshow/83379433.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

In the initial days of the pandemic in April 2020, Sharia rules were ignored during the last rites of Muslim Covid-19 victims. At the time, Fathulla, a former co-option member of the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC), and his team requested the government to hand over to them the bodies of Muslim Covid-19 patients for performing final rights in accordance with Covid-19 guidelines and Islam. “Every religion preaches respecting the dead and bidding them a respectful farewell. But the pandemic changed the situation. Even family members didn’t come forward and municipal authorities cremated bodies by setting them blaze, as per Hindu customs. At that point of time I decided to take up the responsibility of carrying out the final rites of Muslims who died of Covid-19 if their families face difficulties in doing it,” Fathulla said TOI. Fathulla and his team have so far carried out the last rites of 482 Covid-19 victims, of which 450 are Muslims and 32 are Hindus. “Humanity is more important than religion and we followed this. We have helped Hindu families who approached us for cremation,” Fathulla said. The team does not charge anything for its services. “We spent our own money. We thank VMC for providing an earthmover at the cemetery and government hospital authorities for providing free ambulances to shift bodies to cemeteries,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ensuring-a-dignified-farewell-to-covid-deceased/articleshow/83379803.cms||Venu Lanka

The state is expected to receive very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall for a week starting from June 11. “We are expecting a significant increase in rainfall from June 11 onwards, and the activity is likely to continue for almost five to six days. We are monitoring the situation and updates about the same will be shared,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. The IMD has attributed the reason for this phenomenon to the low pressure area that formed over north Bay of Bengal and surrounding areas on June 7 which is likely to become “more marked” on June 11. The southwest monsoon is very likely to strengthen further over the west coast of India, including Goa from June 11, as a result. The increased rainfall activity is likely to continue for about a week from then. Heavy to very heavy rainfall (115.6-204.4mm of rainfall in 24 hours) is very likely with scattered distribution over Goa during this period. Also, extremely heavy rainfall (higher than 204.4 mm in 24 hours) is likely at isolated places during the period from June 12 onwards. “Winds of speed of around 40kmph are likely along with rainfall spells. With increased rainfall activity to continue, the areas vulnerable for landslide, flooding may be kept under monitoring and necessary precautions may be taken,” IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/very-heavy-rain-alert-for-goa-from-jun-11-13/articleshow/83383574.cms||---

Mines and geology minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy said that the decision has been taken in view of the department’s inability to pull the plug on tax evaders. The government is also switching to the weightage basis seigniorage from the existing value metric basis to pool more revenues. The minister reviewed the performance of the department with senior officials here on Wednesday. Speaking to the media, the minister said they would engage private agencies on an outsourcing basis to collect seiniorage from the licencees. “Mining activity is going on in 6,388 locations in the state and has become extremely difficult for the department to directly oversee the operations to collect the seigniorage. The exchequer is heavily losing due to the lack of proper supervision by the department,” said Peddireddy. The minister said the department does not have the required personnel to closely supervise the operations and prevent illegal mining activity in the state. He said they have studied policies adopted by various states to collect the seigniorage and found the Rajasthan model as the most scientific. Switching to outsourcing of seiniorage collection would improve the revenue of the exchequer, he said. He said that they would shortly handover the responsibility of seiniorage collections to outsourcing agencies by fixing the revenue targets. He said that they would get 35-40 per cent additional tax collection from the minor minerals. The minister said that properly weighing stocks before transport from the quarry would easily fetch 15 per cent additional revenue. Similarly, they were expecting to get another 15 to 20 per cent additional revenue by preventing illegal mining and illegal transport of minerals by the lease holders. “We collected Rs 1643 crore through seignorage collection during 2020-21 financial year and are hopeful of improving the revenue by 40 per cent through the new system,” said Peddireddy. The minister said they would conduct e-auctions for all minor minerals in the state to garner about Rs 476 crore revenue in the current fiscal. He added that they have already received 2,694 applications for grant of leases on 21,577 hectares. Granite and marble under part-A of minor minerals have been identified, kept 31 minerals in part-B and remaining minerals in part-C. The minister said they would conduct e-auction for the leases where operations were not launched within the prescribed duration. The minister said that the government would provide coupons to get free sand to beneficiaries of YSR Jagananna housing colonies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-outsources-seigniorage-collection-ropes-in-pvt-bodies/articleshow/83391749.cms||Samdani MN

It also stated that onset of south-west monsoon in Bihar is likely in next two to three days. The yellow code alert stipulates that the authorities should be prepared for extreme weather development. Rainfall and overcast skies were witnessed at Patna and in many other parts of the state on Wednesday. Places which received significant rainfall included Forbesganj (94mm), Patna (40mm), Valmikinagar in West Champaran (37mm), Motihari (24mm), Supaul (20mm) and Chhapra (17mm). The IMD stated that scattered rainfall occurred in Bihar on Wednesday and its intensity will increase to fairly widespread on Thursday and Friday and furthermore on Saturday and Sunday. The rainy and turbulent weather conditions have been attributed to a cyclonic circulation over east-central and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal, which is likely to lead to formation of a low-pressure area over the north Bay of Bengal by Friday. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said the low-pressure area is likely to move in the north-west direction, which will lead to rainfall in Bihar and most eastern states. “Sufficient moisture is available in the atmosphere. Maximum temperature is in the range of 35 to 40 degrees C and mixing of easterly and westerly winds is happening in the state. Under the influence of all such factors, heavy thunderstorm along with gusty winds and rainfall is expected at many places in the state,” the official said. He added that the frequency of lightning will reduce with advancement of monsoon in the region. With regard to monsoon, the IMD stated that it has advanced to entire central and some parts of the north Arabian Sea, Konkan, including Mumbai and most parts of interior Maharashtra, some parts of south Gujarat, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, most parts of the central Bay of Bengal and some more parts of the north Bay of Bengal on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/imd-issues-yellow-alert-for-rainfall-in-bihar-over-next-three-days/articleshow/83379960.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Patna||Bihar: ‘Third wave may not be severe, but stick to Covid safety norms’||PATNA: In view of a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is likely to affect children the most, health experts urge parents to remain cautious, instead of panicking. They also lay emphasis on getting a large number of adults inoculated for ensuring the safety of children. A Muzaffarpur-based paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, claims that kids may defeat the virus easily because they have a strong immunity. He, however, asks all adults to “take all necessary precautions”. “A large number of people, especially those with children, should be vaccinated before the third wave hits the state,” Dr Arun says. According to another paediatrician, Dr Vivekanand, the new Covid strain found in Singapore recently is harmful for children, but “it is not a matter of great concern”. If kids have received other vaccines, they are likely to fight Covid-19 as well. Talking about the role of Covid-appropriate behaviour, Dr Vivekanand says, “When you return home from office, make sure that you do not meet your children without changing your clothes and washing your hands properly.” He adds, “Keep your kids happy and give them a protein-rich diet along with fruits that have antioxidants.” Echoing similar views, paediatric surgeon, Priti Kashyap, says the third wave will not be as severe as the second one, but “one should be cautious”. She asks parents to stick to safety norms such as double masking, social distancing, and hand sanitization and teach Covid-appropriate behaviour to their kids as well. Meanwhile, many parents claim that the closure of schools for the last 15 months has made it difficult for them to control their kids. They do not allow children to meet their friends or step outside, as a result of which they get irritated and even disobey their parents at times. “It is difficult to convince my two kids that they will be able to attend school soon and play with their friends. Online classes fail to enthuse them,” bemoaned a homemaker residing in Sri Krishna Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/third-wave-may-not-be-severe-but-stick-to-covid-safety-norms/articleshow/83379999.cms||B K Mishra

After taking lessons from the second wave, the state has geared up for the likely third wave. Whether it is medical resources or infrastructure or increase in manpower, the department is taking all measures,” he said. The minister said the department has set a target to complete the work of setting up oxygen plants and other related work in the state hospitals in three months. “For the ease and convenience of the people of the state, 839 Tika Express vans are being run for vaccination in urban and rural areas of the state,” he said. Pandey claimed that Bihar is the first state in the country to carry vaccination through mobile vehicles.

Although they were trying to bathe in the river, none of them knew swimming. According to circle officer RS Rautela, the eight youngsters were returning from a wedding in the family in Seraghat village when they decided to take a bath in the river. They initially stayed at its shallow end but then went into a deep and dangerous point without realising the depth and current of the water. “At first they played around in the shallow end. Then one of the boys decided to bathe in a pool of water in the middle of the river and got trapped in a strong current. Trying to save him, four other boys got caught in the current and drowned after him. The incident happened around 11am,” Rautela said. He added that the other three boys rushed to nearby villages to raise an alarm for help. “News reached police by 12pm and we reached the place then. Villagers were able to fish the boys out of the water but they were declared dead by the time they were taken to Seraghat hospital.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/8-teens-go-for-a-bath-in-river-in-pithoragarh-5-drown/articleshow/83378940.cms||Prem Punetha

NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said a zero-tolerance attitude will be maintained for people violating guidelines during the wedding celebrations, especially as there are no wedding ceremonies allowed on the weekends in the Nashik district. The wedding hall and the lawn owners can conduct events but with not more than 50 people in attendance. Any violation in the number would result in a hefty fine for the establishment and people hosting the events, that include weddings, birthday parties and others. “The event has to be conducted with the prior permission of the divisional officer of the NMC and the local police station. Any of the permissions missing will be termed as a violation,” said Jadhav. The owner of the halls and the lawns must seek permission at least three days before the event from the police. The families of the bride and bridegroom also have to seek permission for the event from the divisional officer.

---||Rajkot||Marks for jab: Saurashtra University’s move to counter rural vaccine hesitancy in Rajkot||RAJKOT: Vaccine hesitancy is proving to be a big hindrance for Covid vaccination drive in rural areas. With almost 70% of colleges affiliated to it coming from these areas, the Saurashtra University is mulling awarding 5-10 internal marks to its students for taking both the shots of the Covid vaccine. The SU is going to discuss this idea in the upcoming syndicate meeting scheduled to be held around June 20. The varsity plans to not only motivate its students to take jab but also ask them to convince their family members and other people living in their locality to take the shot. If a decision regarding this gets approved in the syndicate meeting, around 2.25 lakh students of the varsity will benefit from the move. Vijay Desani, pro vice chancellor of SU, confirmed the move. “Students get 30 internal marks based on extracurricular activities, sports activities and regular attendance. This year, because of Covid, attending the online classes was not mandatory as students in rural areas faced network problems. We can use that quota of marks and award it to students who have taken both the shots of the vaccine,” Desani said. There are 230 colleges affiliated with the SU of which almost 70%, barring those in Rajkot and Jamangar, are in rural areas. The SU is also working on motivating colleges to get their students vaccinated. The varsity is planning to award an appreciation certificate for the first 11 colleges whose 90% students have got both the shots of the Covid vaccine. The SU has asked principals of the colleges to put the students’ vaccination data in the Whatsapp group created for the information exchange between varsity and colleges. A few days ago, Desani circulated a video among all the principals and head of departments asking them to motivate as many students as possible to take the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/marks-for-jab-sus-move-to-counter-rural-vax-hesitancy/articleshow/83379048.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Pune||NCRA, TIFR scientists discover 535 fast radio bursts from deep space||PUNE: Scientists from Tata Institute for Fundamental Research (TIFR) and National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) discovered 535 new fast radio bursts (FRB) in 2018 and 2019, the largest since 2007 when 140 bursts were first detected. The Indian scientists will present the FRB catalogue at the American Astronomical Society meeting this week. These FRBs are extraordinary cosmic events that generate as much energy in a thousandth of a second as the Sun does in a year. They disappear in much less than the blink of an eye, according to NASA’s website. The bright flashes of light that register in a radio band and blaze for a few milliseconds make it difficult for astronomers to track or know what causes them. To catch sight of a fast radio burst is to be extremely lucky in where and when you point the radio dish. With more observations, astronomers hope to pin down the extreme origins of these bright signals. So far, their origins are unknown and their appearance is unpredictable. When the Indian scientists mapped their locations, they found the bursts were evenly distributed in space. From the FRBs that Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) was able to detect, the scientists calculated that bright fast radio bursts occur at a rate of about 800 per day across the entire sky—the most precise estimate of FRBs overall rate to date. The TIFR and NCRA scientists have collaborated to form the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) to assemble the catalogue. Member of the experiment, Shriharsh Tendulkar, said before CHIME, different telescopes had observed a handful of FRBs each, but with their own selection criteria and software. “By observing a large swath of the sky all the time, we were able to detect FRBs at an unprecedented rate and gather the first large sample with a single instrument. This allows us to get a far better understanding of the FRBs as a population,” he added. Kiyoshi Masui, assistant professor of physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology leading the group’s conference presentation, said for each of the 535 FRBs, he and his colleagues measured its dispersion, and found that most bursts likely originated from far-off sources within distant galaxies. The fact that the bursts were bright enough to be detected by CHIME suggests that they must have been produced by extremely energetic sources, he added. As the telescope detects more FRBs, scientists hope to pin down exactly what kind of phenomena could generate such ultra bright, ultra fast signals. Scientists also plan to use the bursts, and their dispersion estimates, to map the distribution of gas throughout the universe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncra-tifr-scientists-discover-535-fast-radio-bursts-from-deep-space/articleshow/83381122.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid deaths under 100 for 2nd day||KOLKATA: The state recorded less than 100 fresh Covid deaths for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, bringing some relief for health officials and doctors concerned about the high mortality rate despite the reduction in cases over the past three weeks. The 95 deaths recorded on Wednesday was the lowest in over a month. Measures taken by the health department, like forming smaller units of 35-45 patients in bigger Covid hospitals to ensure better monitoring, appears to have yielded results. With cases continuing to decline sharply, experts said deaths will also continue to go down. But they cautioned against complacency. Daily deaths in the state had crossed the century mark for the first time in the pandemic on May 1 when 103 deaths were reported. Though deaths in the two days that followed were 92 and 98 respectively, it crossed the three-digit mark and stayed that way throughout May and the first week of June. The first time it again dipped below 100 was on Tuesday when 98 deaths were reported. “Even as cases declined after the restrictions, deaths kept mounting because there was still a cumulative number of serious patients,” said infectious diseases specialist Yogiraj Ray of ID Hospital. The high fatality was a concern for doctors. While the highest death toll during the first wave was 66, recorded on a few occasions last October, the highest deaths till date in the second wave has been 162 on May 20, 2021. “Mortality staying below 100 for two consecutive days is a good sign. This second wave seems to be waning. But we must be prepared for the third wave, expected to hit by October-November. Vaccination to cover at least 60% of citizens before that is important,” said senior physician Sukumar Mukerjee, a member of Bengal’s global advisory board on Covid management. Occupancy by critical-care patients in Covid hospitals is about 90% even though general bed occupancy is 50%. “Cases will start rising again once the restrictions are eased. The rising curve can be sharp if the chain of transmission has not been broken and gradual if it has. We need to stay alert,” said Ray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-deaths-under-100-for-2nd-day/articleshow/83381132.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Ahmedabad||Half of Ahmedabad’s highrises lack fire NOC: AMC||AHMEDABAD: A little over half of the highrise buildings in Ahmedabad city do not have valid fire NOCs and they include the city’s iconic building of Patang Hotel. The situation remains so for more than two decades, even after repeated pushes by the Gujarat high court to ensure fire safety measures in all such buildings. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) furnished details about these buildings in an affidavit filed in the high court on Wednesday in response to a PIL filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal seeking action against those responsible for the fire tragedy in Shrey Hospital, in which eight Covid-19 patients died in August 2020. The civic body has stated that of the 5,777 highrises in the city, only 2,984 have not got themselves audited for fire safety in recent times. There are 3,165 residential buildings, all of which had previously obtained fire NOCs complying with all fire prevention equipments in place at least once. But as on June 1, as many as 1,876 buildings were found without valid fire NOC. The defaults were fewer in commercial buildings and in those which are used for mixed purposes. In the group of defaulting residential highrise buildings, there are as many as 122 buildings recently constructed by government agencies like the Gujarat Housing Board. There are over 20 commercial buildings housing government offices which are not fire audited and lack certification. They include two out of four major court complexes in the city, the City Civil & Sessions Court at Bhadra and the Mirzapur Judicial Complex. Other government buildings include Shram Bhavan, Regional Passport Office, a multistoried building at Vastrapur, various banks, telephone exchange buildings, Gaekwad Haveli etc. Despite an exercise initiated since last year to ensure fire safety measures in hospitals after the Shrey Hospital incident, 374 hospitals of 1,852 in the city still lack fire NOC. AMC claimed that 584 hospitals had been found without fire NOC in March end, but the sustained efforts on part of the authorities to spread awareness has reduced the number of defaulters in two months. AMC has also stated that though 1,353 schools were found without valid fire NOC, there would be nearly 500 school buildings in AMC limits which fall within the criteria of height up to 9 metre and do not require certification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/half-of-citys-highrises-lack-fire-noc-amc/articleshow/83383214.cms||---

New cases of Coronavirus have come down below 500 in the state and weekly positivity rate has come down to less than 2% in 50 districts. The state ranks 23rd in the country in terms of Coronavirus infection. The recovery rate of the state has gone up to 98%, he said. Chouhan said that efforts should now be made so that the third wave of Coronavirus, even if it does hit the state, may not have any serious effect or may have only negligible impact. The basic mantra to prevent Coronavirus infection is more and more testing, he said. Testing should be done by reaching out to the people and treatment should be provided by isolating the infected persons. Efforts should be made to identify every Coronavirus patient and provide them treatment, the chief minister said. He further said that vaccine is a protective shield against Coronavirus. Intensive campaign of Coronavirus vaccination should be carried out in the state. Chouhan was reviewing the Coronavirus situation in the state at Mantralaya. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang, chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains, additional chief secretary, health, Mohammad Suleman and health commissioner Akash Tripathi were present in the meeting. On Wednesday, 453 new cases were reported while 1,329 patients recovered. Active cases have come down to 7,071. The seven-day positivity rate is 0.8% and Wednesday’s positivity rate was 0.6%. In at least six districts, more than 10 new Coronavirus cases each were reported — 144 new cases have come in Indore, 104 in Bhopal, 39 in Jabalpur, 13 in Ujjain, 12 in Betul and 11 in Ratlam. No new cases of Coronavirus infection were reported in 10 districts of Alirajpur, Bhind, Datia, Dindori, Guna, Harda, Mandla, Sheopur, Singrauli and Tikamgarh. Alirajpur district is completely Corona-free. Active cases of Corona are in single digit in Burhanpur and Chhatarpur districts. In only two districts of the state — Indore and Bhopal — the weekly positivity rate is more than 2%. The weekly positivity rate is 2.1% in Indore and 2.2% in Bhopal. In the state, 3,135 patients of Corona are being treated in hospitals. Out of these, 1,315 patients are in ICU, 1,227 patients are on oxygen beds and 593 patients are on normal beds.

According to officials, the trees on both the sides of the Udumbanchola-Rajakkad road were cut illegally last week. Devikulam range officer Arun Maharaja said the contractor had sought permission to cut 21 trees along the Cardamom Hill Reserve (CHR) stretch. The request was sent to higher officials as it needed special sanction. But before hearing from them, the contractor chopped down the trees, as many as 48 of them, along the route. The contractor also submitted a letter to the district collector seeking permission to cut 10 trees under the disaster management act as they posed threat to residents. The collector directed Udumbanchola tahsildar Niju Kurian to verify the matter. Kurian, who visited the spot found that six trees were posing threat to life and property of the people. But the contractor chopped down over 50 trees in the area without approval from the revenue department or the forest department. “There was no need for cutting down so many trees,” said a revenue official. Maharaja said the contractor clearly violated CHR acts and that a case has been registered against him and officials of PWD. However, PWD officials informed the collector that they have filed a complaint against the road contractor for illegal tree felling. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pwd-contractor-officials-booked-for-felling-trees/articleshow/83381209.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Moshi-based businessman duped of Rs 7.8L in online fraud||PUNE: Cybercrooks duped a 49-year-old businessman from Moshi of Rs7.8 lakh on the pretext of helping him secure a petrol pump licence. The suspects asked the complainant to make online transfers between December 2020 and April 2021. After realising that he had been duped, the businessman filed a complaint with the Bhosari MIDC police station on Tuesday. The complainant said, “I wanted to set up a petrol pump on a piece of land I own. While checking on how to acquire a petrol dealership online, I came across a cellphone number and contacted the person in December.” The businessman said that the person offered help in getting the licence for the petrol pump and asked him to transfer Rs 10,500 as license fees. “I transferred the amount to the bank account number provided. After a few days, the person said that the company had inspected the land and would give me the dealership. He even sent me a copy of the license,” he stated. The suspect then allegedly sought Rs6.1 lakh to issue No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the company. “I was reluctant to give the money but he lured me claiming that the company had offered 20% discount on NOC charges. Until April, the suspect had taken Rs 7.8 lakh under the pretext of different charges. I became suspicious when he started demanding more money as security deposit,” he said. The businessman finally realised he was being duped and approached the cybercrime cell of the Pimpri Chinchwad police. “A probe revealed that my money was transferred to bank accounts located in other states,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/moshi-based-businessman-duped-of-rs-7-8l-in-online-fraud/articleshow/83381169.cms||Mihir Tanksale

---||Pune||RTE admissions restart in Maharashtra from tomorrow||PUNE: The state has decided to restart the admission process for 25% reserved seats in entry-level classes under the Right to Education Act 2009, from June 11. However, the primary education department has told the district administration to decide about restarting the process after taking stock of the Covid-19 cases in their respective areas. The RTE is the only hope for many parents aspiring to send their children to better schools in their area. School managements have been told to stagger the date of admission for the eligible students from the list which they have received on the RTE portal to prevent crowding. Parents have also been told to visit the schools on the prescribed date with the original documents and photocopies to confirm their ward’s provisional admission. “Many parents write the wrong distance between the school and their homes while filling the form for admission in a school of their choice. The distance between the school and residential address should be verified from the documents. The school should not grant temporary admission if it is observed that the student’s address doesn’t match with the address shown in the portal or if the distance does not match. Such parents should be told to apply to the taluka-level committee or education officer. After verifying the applications and complaints from the verification committee, the school will be told to admit or refuse such cases,” Dattatray Jagtap, director of primary education, said. Jagtap further added that parents of children who are unable to come to the school directly due to Covid-19 and lockdown-like restrictions should complete the admission process by contacting the school within the stipulated time by phone, e-mail and WhatsApp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rte-admissions-restart-in-state-from-tomorrow/articleshow/83381157.cms||---

More manufacturers are expected to jump into the fray for churning out sachets of the oral drug that is found to help speed up recovery and reduce oxygen dependence. Not only has Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), which is part of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) has licenced the process knowhow for synthesis of 2-DG to Hyderabad-based Lee Pharma through a non-exclusive agreement, the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) too has invited expressions of interest (EoIs) from pharma companies interested in manufacturing this drug. The drug was developed by scientists at DRDO’s Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences and licenced to Hyderabad-based pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories with a promise of ensuring accessibility and affordability. Lee Pharma will be filing an application seeking approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for manufacturing and commercialising the drug from their formulations facility located at the Duvvada SEZ in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. CSIR-IICT director Dr Srivari Chandrashekar said CSIR-CCMB played a role in the development of 2-DG as they tested it on SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and said the agreement with Lee Pharma is aimed at increasing affordable treatment options. On the other hand, DRDO has set June 17 as the last date for submitting applications for EoIs for transfer of technology for manufacturing 2-DG. “The EoI submitted will be scrutinised by a committee. Only up to 15 industries will be given ToT on their capabilities, technical handholding capability of DRDO and on First Come First Served Basis,” DRDO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iict-licences-2-dg-process-knowhow-to-lee-pharma/articleshow/83383246.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The order of the local civic body under ‘Break the Chain’ order dated June 7 has made such testing compulsory for reopening of shops and also asks for RT-PCR testing after every 15 days. It adds that stringent action would be taken in case of non-compliance. President of the local merchants’ body Jagannath Kale said that Covid testing should be encouraged but it must not be made imperative. “All commercial establishments have already been made to take proactive measures to ensure safety of their staff as well as customers. In fact, shop-owners insist on Covid testing if they or their staff develop any symptoms. Amid heightened awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic and it’s dreadful consequences, mandatory testing is a waste of resources and time,” he said. With the city falling in the ‘Level 1’ category due to effective check on the pandemic situation, commercial establishments in Aurangabad city do not have any regulated working hours since June 7. Head of the civic response team of AMC Pramod Jadhav said that the trader community should follow the order issued by the civic administration in letter and spirit. “At the very outset of the unlock process, we have deliberately not taken any action against shops so far for possible violation towards not ensuring Covid testing. However, such testing is mandatory considering the public safety,” he said. Jadhav said that the businessmen community should not have any qualm about Covid testing which is free. “Also, unlike in the past, there is no rush at Covid testing facilities,” he added. Aurangabad reported 37 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the tally of active cases to 314.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/amc-traders-differ-on-mandatory-covid-testing/articleshow/83376715.cms||---

A student of government higher secondary school, Vettuvakottai, Thanjavur, Gowri appeared before the court through video conferencing on Wednesday. She said that her project titled “National Rural Development Research Project” was aimed at development of villages and redressing the issues faced by the villagers. She said that usually when people from villages have to submit representations to the authorities, they lose their income for a day as they have to travel to the concerned government office. However, if a post of ‘village collector’ is created in all villages to redress the grievances of people, it would save them much difficulties. When the judges pointed out that officials such as VAOs were already available for this purpose, Gowri replied that the post of village collector with knowledge about the rural areas would go a long way in redressing the grievances of the villagers directly. The judges appreciated the efforts taken by the girl who had shown interest in the development of villages in the state. They asked her to submit a revised report highlighting the salient features of her project so that it could be looked into by the authorities. The case was adjourned to June 16 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/student-impresses-hc-with-development-project/articleshow/83381204.cms||Kaushik Kannan

We are hoping to start by this week itself or by next week,” state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne told TOI. Pune’s regional transport officer Ajit Shinde said on Wednesday that the standard operating procedures (SOP) were being finalised and the details would be shared soon. According to the present system, one needs to go to the Sarathi option on the Parivahan portal (Parivahan.gov.in) and seek an online appointment for the learners’ licence test. One needs to fill in a form, provide address documents, pay the fees after which an appointment is given to appear for a test at the RTO office. “While we have received the circular regarding online tests, we are awaiting further details,” another RTO official said. The daily appointment quota for a learners’ licence has been reduced from 700 to 350. “Once the application is filed, the test date will be informed to the examinees on their mobile phones and they will receive an OTP. They will have to log on to the Parivahan Portal, click on the learners’ licence test tab, key in their OTP and start the examination. We don’t expect any cheating to take place as the duration of the exam will be short,” the official said. Meanwhile, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations has thanked the transport department for making vehicle registration process online and paperless.  There is no physical verification for the first registration of new fully-built motorcycles and cars and all document are allowed to be e-signed by the dealers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/online-test-for-learners-licence-to-start-soon/articleshow/83383243.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||PMC schools to start without online access to 43% students||PUNE: Schools are expected to restart online for the next academic year from June 14, but there is no clarity on how the institutions affiliated to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will fare since at least 43% of their students have no access to online education. Minakshi Raut, primary education director of the PMC, said they had at the end of last academic year around 93,000 students registered from Standard I to Standard VIII. “Of these around 40,000 students do not have access to any kind of device to access online education. Another 10,000 students could not be contacted when teachers tried, probably due to migration,” she said. Siddharth Dhende, social activist and former deputy mayor of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said more than 80% of the students enrolled in PMC schools come from poor families. “These students can hardly afford three meals a day due to the persistent lockdown. They are in no position to buy a device and pay for internet. Hence, even if they have phones or even smartphones, not many of them are actually able to attend classes,” he added. A PMC school principal from Hadapsar said the attendance is extremely poor in the junior classes from Std I to IV as compared to the higher classes. “Parents are mostly daily-wage labourers or autorickshaw drivers who take away the sole cellphone in the house leaving the children with no access to online classes. Most parents have two or more children and they have to decide whom to give the phone to if it is available at home. Moreover, the pandemic has rendered many people jobless which means, recharging their phones is the least of their priorities. This, in turn, means, an even smaller number of students attend online classes,” the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-schools-to-start-without-online-access-to-43-pupils/articleshow/83381212.cms||Ardhra Nair

Moreover, the concern of third wave is already growing. Therefore, the district administration is working on a two-pronged strategy — monitoring of markets through Covid Safety Teams for compliance of Covid-19 protocol and keeping a tab on Coronavirus infection cases ward-wise in the city and put any ward with 70 Coronavirus patients in a week under containment restrictions, so as to insulate the area from rest of the city and thus, check the spread of infection. This in addition to hectic attempts to vaccinate as many people as possible. The city has now been divided into four zones — green, yellow, orange and red zones, there is a deep green zone also, which signifies areas with the least Coronavirus cases. Talking to TOI, additional collector, Dileep Yadav, said, “A ward is kept in dark yellow category if it has 0 to 5 cases daily, in yellow category if the cases are between 5 to 10. Orange category if the cases are 10 to 20 and red category, if the cases go beyond 20 every day.” Yadav said that 10 cases daily in a ward makes it 70 cases a week and if it happens, the ward concerned is put in the containment zone and restrictions on movement of residents of the ward is imposed, markets in the area may also be closed. The restrictions could be harsher if an area goes into the red zone. As of now, none of the wards of the city are in the orange or the red zone. Ward no. 54 in Bawadia Kalan was in the orange zone till Monday but on Tuesday, it came into the yellow zone after the cases in the ward receded. On the other hand,the district administration is gearing up to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol in bigger markets when they open up on Thursday. Covid Safety Teams (CST), comprising officials of revenue, municipal corporation and police, have been formed to monitor the situation and take immediate action, if the Covid-19 norms are flouted by a shopkeeper or a customer. The penalty could be a spot fine of Rs 1000 to sealing of the shop for 24 hours or both. “CST personnel would also be deployed at tourist and picnic spots when they open up”, said district collector, Avinash Lavania.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ahead-of-possible-third-covid-wave-dist-admin-preps-strategy/articleshow/83383239.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has started recruitment of teaching and non-teaching staff for Bharatratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical College. The training infrastructure is being built but students cannot be admitted without the medical council’s permission. The central scrutiny committee’s visit and subsequent permissions have been delayed due to Covid-19 restrictions. Civic officials said that a primary assessment by the state authorities has been completed. The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has cleared the proposal. PMC had sent the proposal for the college to the national medical commission for final approval in December 2020. “A Union government team was expected to visit the site for final approval but the visit has not happened. The process of actual commencement of the course will be started once the green signal is given,” said Hemant Rasane, chairman of the PMC standing committee. “The approval was expected in February but was postponed for a couple months. The visit was slated in April, but even that has not happened. Unless final approval comes, we will not be able to include details about the number of seats in the NEET exam system and start other admissions formalities,” said a senior official of PMC. Earlier this month, the civic body decided to increase the number of members in the trust constituted for the municipal medical college. In total, 11 people, including leaders and civic officials were added to the board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/slim-chance-of-municipal-medical-instt-starting-soon/articleshow/83383231.cms||---

Is e-pass required for travel between Pune and Mumbai via expressway?  - Sameer A: Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta says e-pass is not required for travelling from Pune to Mumbai via expressway. An e-pass is not required if a person is travelling between Level 1 and Level 4 districts in the state, an officer says. But one has to apply for an e-pass for travelling through a Level 5 district. If anyone wants to travel to a district falling under Level 1 to Level 4 categories, and there is no level 5 district falling in between, then the person is not required to apply for an e-pass. He/she can travel to that district without an e-pass. The move is in line with the state government’s five level unlocking plan that is based on a district’s weekly positivity rate and Covid bed occupancy. Q: Is e-pass required to travel from Mumbai to Pune from public transport like bus or train?  - Mita Bharatkar A: Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta says an e-pass is not required to travel from Mumbai to Pune using a public transport. The police had earlier this week made it clear that no e-pass would be needed for inter-district travel. Q: As restrictions ease now, I want to travel from Pune to Ahmedabad.

However, uncertainty looms large over official nod to resuming tourist footfall at the World Heritage Sites of Ajanta and Ellora caves. Superintending archaeologist with Aurangabad circle of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Milan Kumar Chauley on Wednesday said that he would be writing a letter to district administration seeking reopening of monuments. “As per official directives, local ASI authorities can request the respective district administration for reopening of heritage sites and monuments, depending upon the pandemic situation. We would be establishing communication with Aurangabad district administration on June 14 seeking entry of visitors at tourist places,” he said. While municipal limits of Aurangabad have been facing no Covid-related curbs at present, rural areas are still under ‘Level III’ category as per the latest ‘Break The Chain’ order and continue to have some restrictions. When contacted, collector Sunil Chavan said that the demand for reopening Bibi Ka Maqbara and Panchakki would be considered positively. “The World Heritage Sites of Ellora and Ajanta caves, among other monuments, fall in rural areas of Aurangabad district and, therefore, are least likely to witness reopening. We will declare the final decision on reopening of different monuments once the formal proposal from ASI is received,” said Chavan. The district collector, who heads the District Disaster Management Authority that is empowered to take local policy decisions regarding pandemic management, also said that weekly review of Covid-19 situation on every Thursday would also have bearing on necessary call. Founder president of Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation (ATDF) Jaswant Singh said that even Ajanta and Ellora caves should be reopened shortly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bibi-ka-maqbara-panchakki-may-reopen-by-mid-june/articleshow/83376670.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Police seize Mukhtar’s Rs 24Cr property in Mau||Revised Varanasi: The police confiscated jailed gangster turned MLA Mukhtar Ansari’s property worth Rs 24 crore in Mau district on Wednesday under the Gangster Act. The confiscation was done in compliance with the district magistrate’s order of June 7. According to ADG Varanasi zone, Brij Bhushan, earlier police actions have caused a loss of over Rs 263 crore to Mukhtar and his gang. Mukhtar, who is the kingpin of the inter-state gang IS-191, had purchased a piece of land with the money earned through criminal activities in Dakshintola area of Mau district in the name of his mother Rabia Begum in January 2015. After the demise of Rabia Begum, the property was inherited by Mukhtar’s sons Abbas and Umar. There are two constructed buildings and one under-construction building on this piece of land, which is situated near a four-lane road. Following the order of the Mau district magistrate, this property was seized by the police. The Mau police had initiated Gangster Act against Mukhtar and three others in March this year for getting arms licences on the basis of forged documents. During verification in 2020, it was found that arms licences were obtained by furnishing fake and forged documents. It also came to light that they had threatened the public servants. An FIR was lodged with the Dakshintola police under sections 419, 420, 467, 468 of IPC. The charge sheet against them was submitted in the court. A case of misuse of the arms against them was also registered with the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow. Besides, 50 cases of murder, abduction, loot and other grave crime were registered in Varanasi, Ghazipur, Sonbhadra, Chandauli, Agra, Delhi and Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/police-seize-mukhtars-rs-24cr-property-in-mau/articleshow/83381930.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Officials may have been influenced, says report||Kozhikode: The inquiry report submitted by the divisional forest officer (flying squad), Kozhikode, has said that there have been lapses on the part of officials in granting property mark registration to Surya Timbers owned by Roji Augustine, the key accused in the Muttil illegal tree felling scam. The report submitted by DFO P Dhanesh Kumar said that during the inquiry it became evident that the firm did not have the needed physical infrastructure or documents needed for granting property mark registration. The report submitted to CF(I&E), Kozhikode, in February said that the activities carried out by Surya Timbers for getting property mark and to transport timber, which was government property, using the sanctioned Form IV was part of a very carefully-planned operation. Property mark is granted by the forest department to timber merchants for identifying timber handled by them and enabling them to transport timber using Form IV. The Kerala Forest Produce Transit Rules, 1975, says that merchants or other persons trading in timber may register their property marks and it shall not be lawful to use any property mark that is not registered. All timber covered by passes issued by timber merchants shall be stamped with the property mark registered by them with the DFO. The inquiry report said that the lapses on the part of officials in granting property mark to the firm is understood to have happened either by external influence or pressure. “It is clear that the officials who undertook steps for granting of property mark registration made lapses by considering the matter in a casual manner. It is understood to have happened either due to external influence or pressure,” the report said. The report also has a series of suggestions to enhance surveillance and monitoring to prevent such incidents. It has called for steps to ensure that the Form IV passes should be issued to the timber depots having property mark registration commensurate with their stock. Also, it said that the Lakkidi forest checkpost situated on Wayanad-Kozhikode border didn’t have enough staff strength for effective functioning and called for steps to enhance the staff strength. It says that there are many roads in Wayanad district which do not have checkposts and night-time vehicle checking should be enhanced on those roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/officials-may-have-been-influenced-says-report/articleshow/83381279.cms||---

A division bench of Justice T S Sivagnanam and Justice S Ananthi observed they are surprised to see that Malarvizhi had granted permission to the woman, S Shanthi to draw water by laying pipelines, after her predecessor T Anbalagan had rejected permission for the same. The collector, who is an officer of the government, should act in a proactive manner to preserve the natural resources, however, in this case, contrarily she had acted otherwise in a manner which is unbecoming of a public servant, observed the judges. The judges observed the court was shocked by the action of Malarvizhi in appointing a jumbo committee with 15 officials who have acted in such supersonic speed and submitted a report on November 17, 2020, and the collector had passed the order the next day. The judges observed it is rather surprising and shocking to find that the district administration had taken a stand that the land is situated 220.8m away from the river, oblivious of the fact that river water is found percolating beneath the soil. “We can safely conclude that the entire revenue administration of Karur headed by collector Malarvizhi has worked for the personal benefit of the woman to water trees planted in her farm,” the judges said. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by P Mani, treasurer of the Village Drinking Water and Health Society, a resident of Coodalore village, challenging collector’s order and to forbear Shanthi from laying pipelines to draw water from one village to her farm in another village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-expresses-shock-over-abuse-of-power-by-ex-karur-collector/articleshow/83381243.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Children, who volunteered for the trial, were administered Covaxin under the guidance of expert doctors on Wednesday. In the last two days, 15 children have been administered the first dose of Covaxin, said principal investigator for Covaxin trial for children, Dr JS Kushwaha while talking to TOI. Dr Kushwaha said that children between 2 years and 18 years of age have been divided into three groups---12-18, 6-12 and 2-6 years age groups for carrying out the trial. To begin with, children between 12-18 age were given the first Covaxin dose, he said, adding that the second dose would be administered to them after 28 days and thereafter their blood sample would be collected to check out whether antibodies have developed or not. Dr Kushwaha said that soon the first dose of the vaccine would be administered to children of the 6-12 age group followed by trials on the age group of two to six years. “We have already conducted successful trials of Covaxin on adults at the hospital in 2020.

The technique is to pre-determine sex of a calf. State is second in the country after Uttarakhand to have the facility for the sex-sorted-semen technique. The target is to make 3 lakh sex-sorted-semen straws. Officials said over 90% demand in the livestock market is for productive animal — cow and bulls are only required for reproductive purpose — the demand for which is less than 10%. In the sex sorting technique X and Y chromosome is sorted out and separated. The sorted semen can be stored in the liquid nitrogen for years. Depending upon the demand, frozen semen straw of the desired sex can be inseminated in the cow, officials added. Cost of a semen straw in the international market is roughly 13 US dollars, but the Madhya Pradesh government subsidized the cost to make it affordable for farmers. Officials said the cost of a semen straw is Rs 950. For scheduled caste and scheduled tribe members it is provided at a cost of Rs 400 and for general category it is for Rs 500 per dose or semen straw. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan inaugurated the state-of-the-art sex-sorted-semen production laboratory set up at a cost of Rs 47.50 crore under the National Gokul Mission in Bhopal in April. HBS Bhadoria, managing director of Madhya Pradesh Rajya Pashudhan Evam Kukkut Vikas Nigam (MP State Livestock and Poultry Development Corporation) said, 90% female calves of high genetic quality such as Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar cows and Murrah buffaloes will be born in the state in the sexsorted-semen facility at the Central Semen Institute, Bhopal, he added. Due to the high number of female calves, there will be an increase in milk production and the number of male calves will also not increase. Farmers will get good quantity of milk and their income will also increase significantly, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/semen-straws-to-now-determine-sex-of-calf-in-state/articleshow/83383251.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Online system for schools to upload SSC marks soon||Mumbai: Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education (MSB-SHSE) on Wednesday directed schools to complete assessment and upload marks of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students by June 30. The board will create an online system for schools to upload final marks from June 21 to 30. Teachers have to complete assessment and tabulation by June 20. The seven-member results committee in each school will have time till June 24 to finalise marks to be uploaded. Sealed physical copies of final marks have to be submitted to the board’s Vashi office by June 30. The board will begin work on finalizing SSC results from July 3. Board officials stated that results will be announced by mid-July. A YouTube video on marking process has been scheduled for Thursday for teachers and principals. From Friday, schools have to get down with tabulation of marks and evaluation of students who could not be assessed due to unavoidable circumstances. While tabulating marks, teachers have been told to round off percentages (for eg, 13.01, 13.50 or 13.51 will be counted as 14). Assessment is underway in schools. Teachers are in a dilemma with bright and average students scoring similar marks in online exams conducted throughout the year in class 10. Results will be declared based on 50% weightage in marks scored in classes 9 and 10. Class 9 scores were before Covid-19 and are more realistic. These marks have been uploaded on the government education website (SARAL) and cannot be altered. While tabulating online written exam marks of class 10, teachers said most students scored high marks. “We know our students’ capabilities. This time bright and average students are at par with high scores in written tests. It could be due to unfair means adopted while writing exams, but we have to allot marks,” said a teacher. Schools are having a tough time ensuring students are assessed fairly. Earlier, schools would allot a maximum of 20% marks of internal assessment to students. “This was done to help average students score above 60%,” said a teacher. Now, schools have been told to keep internal assessment marks for final stage of tabulation. Teachers found that while average students have scored good marks in written tests, they are lagging behind in submitting their projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-online-system-for-schools-to-upload-ssc-marks-soon/articleshow/83384665.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Pall of gloom descends Lalepur, Ishwariganj||KANPUR: A pall of gloom descended in Lalepur and Ishwariganj villages on Wednesday when dead bodies of 18 villagers, who were killed in a road accident in Kisan Nagar area of Sachendi on Tuesday, arrived there. While 13 victims belonged to Lalepur village, five were natives of neighbouring Ishwariganj village. Eighteen people had died and four sustained critical injuries when a private double-decker bus collided head-on with a tempo on the highway near Kisan Nagar area of Sachendi on Tuesday evening. While the passengers of the bus had a miraculous escape, the 18 occupants of the tempo met a tragic end. Locals thronged the mishap site and also the two villages on Wednesday. Heart-rending scenes were witnessed when the last journey of the accident victims headed for cremation at Bithoor Ghat. The mortal remains were carried on four tractor-trolleys amidst heavy police presence. As the pyres were lit, the grief-stricken family members of the victims could not control their emotions and were seen wailing inconsolably for their near and dear ones. Prior to that, senior district and police officials visited the two villages to take stock of the situation. What was even more tragic was that three real brothers--Ram Milan (24), Shiv Bhajan (22) and Luvlesh (20), sons of Dhaniram of Lalepur, were killed in the accident. "It seems the fate was not kind to Dhaniram, who lost his three sons in the accident" said a villager. "The three brothers had promised to gift expensive sarees to their mother Gita Devi on June 15, their salary day. Also, as the victims' duty timings were the same, they used to leave their respective villages in a tempo together for a biscuit factory daily at 7:30 pm. On Tuesday, they had again left their respective homes, but never returned again", he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/pall-of-gloom-descends-lalepur-ishwariganj-when-dead-bodies-of-18-villagers-arrive/articleshow/83382017.cms||Faiz Siddiqui
---||Allahabad||Railway stations to have hi-tech surveillance system||PRAYAGRAJ: In a first, railway journey in the country is all set to be more secure courtesy of a high-tech internet-based video surveillance system which has been installed at 269 railway stations of the country including 16 stations of North Central Railways (NCR). Besides, the central control monitoring room has been activated in 10 zones of the country, including NCR. This is part of the major initiative of the Railway Board wherein 6,049 railway stations across the country, of all categories, are being equipped with this state of the art system. The work has been assigned to RailTel and the system is being installed from the funds allocated under the Nirbhaya Fund of the central government. Talking to TOI, senior manager of RailTel, Sucharita Pradhan said, “The feed from the network of cameras being installed in this system is being centrally monitored and the footage can be stored for 30 days. To enhance security at railway stations, the system has been installed to cover main entrance/exit, platforms, foot overbridges, waiting halls, parking areas etc. based on-site and security requirements and threat perceptions”. These CCTVs are attached to the networked optical fibre cable (OFC) and the video feed of the CCTV cameras is being displayed not only at local RPF posts but also at a centralised CCTV control room at divisional and zonal level. Pradhan further informed that of the 269 stations, where the system has already been installed, 16 each are from NCR and North Eastern Railways (NER), 47 from Northern Railways (NR) and so on. The system works based on video analytics and facial recognition which means that while monitoring the feed if any suspicious-looking person is picked up, the facial recognition system would identify the same based on the existing data of the system. This facility would be added to the system in the coming time, explains an official. For this purpose, high-tech cameras are being installed which include bullet, fixed dome, Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) and 4K ultra high definition cameras. “Network Management System (NMS) has also been provided for monitoring the footage of the cameras which are stored in a server and backed by UPS. The feed can be viewed from any web browser, be it laptop, mobile phone etc., by authorised personnel," she added. Pradhan added that work at 31 more stations is in progress and will be completed soon. RailTel has also floated tender for this work at 456 additional stations. “In terms of NCR, the control room has been recently activated at the zonal headquarters at Subedarganj wherein live feed is being watched on two 55-inch display screens”, said CPRO, NCR, Dr Shivam Sharma. Of the 16 stations of NCR, the system has already been installed at Babina (20 cameras have been installed), Datia (21), Aligarh (40), Gwalior (15), Mahoba (27), Phaphund (27), Tundla (40), Orai (38), Etawah (40), Raja ki Mandi (38), Agra Fort (40), Lalitpur (40), Sikohabad (40), Firozabad (15), Banda (40) and Murena (40), informed the CPRO. Talking about this project, Puneet Chawla, CMD/RailTel, said, “We will be completing the work at 756 stations by March 2022. We are installing four types of IP cameras to ensure maximum coverage inside the Railway premises. This will give an extra edge to the RPF officials to improve security.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/railway-stations-across-country-to-have-hi-tech-surveillance-system/articleshow/83382151.cms||---

Moreover, the marriage season is practically over and the new season begins only after Diwali,” Oswal said. Around 40,000 weddings were cancelled in the last two months in the district owing to stringent measures to curb the second wave of Covid-19. The latest norms allow a maximum of 50 attendees for weddings and other functions but the banquet halls and lawns owners have very little to cheer about. “The losses suffered by the marriage industry, which includes 55 types of businesses, are close to Rs250 crore in Pune district in last two months alone,” Kishor Sarpotdar, a representative of the Marriage Halls and Lawns Association of Pune, told TOI. “We have two wedding seasons — March to July and post-Diwali till February. There are only a handful of muhurtas left in this season. Thus, at this point, relaxations in rules make no difference to the industry,” Sarpotdar, also the president of the Maharashtra Catering Association, said. The district has over 1,000 banquet halls and lawns, besides over 30,000 caterers. A representative of a banquet hall in Hadapsar saw 15 bookings cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/another-season-lost-for-marriage-business/articleshow/83383255.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Allahabad||Now, Allahabad University students to get digital marksheets||PRAYAGRAJ: Here’s good news for the students of Allahabad University and its constituent colleges. In a first, the students would be issued digital marksheets (statement of marks), which they could download from the university’s website. In the arrangement made by the AU examination department, a student now has to enter just the roll number and enrollment number and get the digital marksheet in the new format. On Saturday, the marksheet of final year back paper examination of UG courses was released in digital mode by the controller of examination Prof Ramendra Kumar Singh. Prof Singh said on Wednesday, “Till now, the examination results which were issued on the website used to have the roll number, names and marks of 25 students in one page. Now, the students will get the result in the new format after entering their roll number and enrollment number on the official website of the university.” This will be considered as the digital mode of the original marksheet wherein, in addition to subject-wise marks, marks obtained in the previous year and the total marks will also be mentioned. This digital marksheet would be valid at all places if the students have to attach or present the same. The original marksheet would be made available from the department later. The results of the promoted students of the final year (of UG courses) will also be released on the website soon. This result is set to be released before June 15. Earlier on Tuesday, a group of student leaders, belonging to the National Student Union of India (NSUI), had picketed the controller of examinations while pressing for acceptance of their five-point charter of demands. After about half-an-hour agitation, the CoE heard their demands and assured that a decision would be taken in around a week’s time. The student leaders submitted a memorandum to the CoE wherein they have demanded that the first year students of yearly courses (BA, BSc and BCom) as well as the results of first and final semester exams of PG courses should also declared and students should be promoted. They claimed that the criteria for promoting the students was not clearly explained. Besides, the III year students should be promoted by awarding 6% marks. In case students are not satisfied with the awarded marks, they should be given a chance to appear in the examination, said Abhishek Dwivedi of NSUI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-au-students-to-get-digital-marksheets/articleshow/83382063.cms||---

The big cat was under treatment since the evening of June 4 when it was found inactive in the enclosure during a routine check. During primary examination it was found paralytic either due to snake bite or presence of neurotoxin in the body. “Its blood report revealed that the liver was compromised, so we were giving lifesaving treatment and fluid therapy. But there were no signs of recovery and it eventually died during treatment around 4 am on Wednesday,” said Dr R A Patel, in-charge zoo superintendent. The tigress’s post-mortem report revealed snake bite or neurotoxin poisoning as the cause of death. Its viscera samples were sent to Navsari Veterinary College for further examination. “There is presence of venomous snakes like cobra and vipers in the zoo, so snake bite could be one of the causes and neurotoxin poisoning could be because of bacteria present in the soil,” Patel said. He added that due to its age its immunity was also low and the post-mortem also revealed that the liver was completely damaged. Patel told TOI that Sambhavi was brought from a zoo in Mangaluru in 2014. After Sambhavi’s death, only a 10-year-old tiger now survives at the nature park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/14-year-old-tigress-at-surat-zoo-dies-due-to-liver-failure/articleshow/83379210.cms||---

She is an accused in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi. The court was hearing a plea for a direction to release her in a Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act case relating to an alleged larger conspiracy that led to the northeast Delhi riots in February last year. The police said that the habeas corpus petition filed by Fatima was not maintainable and was nothing but a blatant abuse of the process of law and deserved to be dismissed with cost. A vacation bench of justices Rekha Palli and Amit Bansal listed the matter for further hearing on June 18 after advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, representing Delhi Police, claimed that the plea filed by the woman was false, frivolous and abuse of the process of law. “The petition has been filed on baseless, concocted, motivated and absurd facts and circumstances of the case. There is no cause of action in the present matter. The petition is absolutely misconceived, unmerited and being devoid of merits of the case,” police contented.

The survey is crucial in finding whether immunity against the pandemic virus is developing in the population and to what extent. Chief medical officer Dr. VB Singh said, “Sixteen teams have been engaged for the survey in 31 rural and 18 urban areas. During the random survey, these teams will collect 1,392 samples, including 744 from the general population and 648 from the slum population. The collected samples will be sent to the microbiology department of KGMU, Lucknow on a daily basis.” The CMO said each team of the health department has a doctor, a lab technician, an ANM and an ASHA worker. These teams would collect samples by dividing the identified area of the general population into four sectors. Six samples including two from adult males, two from adult females and two from boys/girls of 5-17 years age bracket would be collected from the general population. Similarly, nine samples including three from adult males, three from adult females and three from boys/girls of 5-17 years age bracket would be collected from the slum population. He said that the objective of the seroprevalence surveys is to find the presence of antibodies against coronavirus in humans. It will also help in understanding how much of the population is infected with the Covid-19. As many cases are asymptomatic and therefore liable to be missed by RT-PCR testing, seroprevalence surveys could be a significant step in the ongoing battle against the pandemic. The findings will help in further planning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/covid-19-seroprevalence-survey-begins-in-dist/articleshow/83381909.cms||Binay Singh

---||Kolkata||Suman Sector V traffic dispersal plan 09.06.21||Kolkata: The Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA) plans to engage a consultant firm to come up with a traffic dispersal plan scheme for Sector V to reduce traffic congestion at different crossings and quick dispersal of vehicular traffic in the IT hub. Officials said that traffic volume in Sector V has increased in the last few years. The number of vehicles coming in the IT hub have increased manifold with more work opportunities and better connectivity with the airport, New Town and EM Bypass stretch. With East-West metro also have started from Sector V end, traffic volume is increasing rapidly and the authorities have felt the need to initiate steps to lessen the traffic congestion at important crossings of the IT hub with a system that will quickly disperse vehicular traffic in the area. Keeping this mind, the authorities have floated an expression of interest to invite agencies for recommending a scheme for dispersal of traffic management for Sector V. The selected agency will do a study of the traffic access, traffic data, signalised crossings, intersections that do not have have traffic signals and pedestrian movement on the stretches at peak hours in the morning and evening on the weekdays and weekends along with the traffic origin and destination data and parking data within Sector V. The study will also include the existing traffic infrastructure and conditions along with recommendations as to how the traffic dispersal plan could be implemented. The traffic data that the agency will prepare will be analysed to suggest a smooth dispersal of pedestrian traffic from the metro station during morning and evening peak times. The traffic dispersal plan will also include suggestions on infrastructural changes such as parking bays, no parking zones and cycle lanes that will facilitate dispersal of traffic and also suggestions on the transport options such as electric vehicles, e-bikes, public bicycles, e-cycle docking stations and golf carts that NDITA can organise. Already keeping with the increased traffic, NDITA has set up a multi level car parking plaza that can accommodate about 700 cars. This has been done to stop cars being parked on road side, thereby reducing congestion. Also to facilitate easy office access, NDITA is planning to introduce one or two circular route using electric bus or electric vehicles and also having dedicated cycle lanes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-sector-v-traffic-dispersal-plan-09-06-21/articleshow/83381330.cms||Suman Chakraborti

The arrested person has been identified as Muhammed Mansoor alias Manju (36) of Kallurutty, Thiruvambady, Kozhikode. He is the 35th accused in the NIA case. He was absconding and was employed in the UAE. On his arrival from Dubai on a Wednesday morning flight, he was intercepted by immigration officials based on a lookout circular issued against him. Later, NIA officials reached the airport and recorded his arrest. As per a chargesheet filed by NIA in the case, Mansoor was among those who ‘assisted the main conspirators, while being in India and the UAE, besides facilitating the smuggling of gold and in the disposal of the contraband’. According to sources, Mansoor was arraigned as accused based on the statement of a witness in the case. He was in Dubai for more than one year and the agency expects him to name persons who assisted him in Dubai, sources said. It is yet to be confirmed whether Mansoor returned to Kerala with the intention to surrender. NIA had filed a chargesheet against 20 accused persons in the case in January this year. As many as six persons connected to the case are still absconding. NIA is likely to seek Mansoor in custody. HC dismisses Ramees’s plea The Kerala high court dismissed a petition filed by KT Ramees, an accused in ‘diplomatic gold smuggling’ case, challenging his detention under Cofeposa Act. A division bench comprising justices AK Jayasankaran Nambiar and P Gopinath considered the validity of the order issued on November 19 last year. The court held that the advisory board that considered the petitioner’s challenge to detention was legally constituted and the board had considered the contentions of the petitioner. Therefore, there is no illegality in the advisory board’s decision upholding the detention order, the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nia-arrests-one-more-in-tpuram-gold-smuggling-case/articleshow/83381361.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though a majority of cabbies have given up the profession after feeling the pinch of continuous restrictions and lockdowns, it is not an option for Birajdar. “I came back from my village on June 1 and have taken up driving again. I left Pune at the start of May and took up farming in my village. I came back as soon as I heard about the restrictions easing,” said Birajdar. Earlier, he had left Pune for his home town in March last year, just before the lockdown was imposed. “With little to no business for more than a year now, I have contemplated taking up farming full time but it doesn’t appeal to me as much as driving does. I stayed in my village in Latur from March till October last year, trying my hand at farming on my three-acre land. Excessive rain damaged the crops but I somehow continued. When the unlocking started, I rushed back to Pune and took up driving again. Things were looking up since November, but all that changed once the the second wave arrived in March,” he said. Guru Katti, the president of the Swarajya Vahan Chalak Sanghatna (an association of cab drivers in Pune), said, “There are close to one lakh cabbies, including those driving Ola and Uber cabs, in Pune district. Roughly 15% of them have left the profession permanently and around 50% have gone back to their villages. Also, cabs of 20% drivers have been confiscated by finance companies and banks as they have not been able to pay monthly instalments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cabbie-returns-with-will-to-drive/articleshow/83383263.cms||Joy Sengupta

Additional sessions judge (fast track and special court) Gurvinder Kaur has once dismissed the bail petition. Farmer Dalbir Singh of Jind district’s Bibipur village was booked under sections 294 (obscene songs), 500 (punishment for defamation), 504 (insult to provoke breach of peace), 505 (1) (statements of public mischief) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). His 2016 sedition case from the Jat agitation, when he had commented against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Haryana CM, was clubbed with the current matter. Moved the bail application, Surjewala claimed that the Haryana government had implicated the farmer because he had joined the Tikri border agitation. He argued that all the IPC sections applied, except 505 (1), were bailable, and the man had no role in circulating or publishing the YouTuber’s posts. Surjewala said the man had neither called a press conference nor made a public statement. He claimed: "While the YouTuber was shooting in his field, Dalbir was busy sowing cotton." The ASJ dismissed Surjewala’s arguments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/surjewala-defends-farmer-who-trolled-cm/articleshow/83383258.cms||---

The system will also log out users who make more than 20 searches within 15 minutes. “If somebody is doing more than 20 searches for slots in a 15-minute duration, there could be something fishy. The idea is to ensure those booking slots manually do not end competing with bots,” said the official. The official said at least 6,000 users have been blocked nationwide over the last few days for suspicious activity. “We are tracking all such users. If they are found doing this often, they may even be blocked permanently. We are counting the number of searches to prevent bot activity. We also introduced Terms of Service on CoWIN recently to clarify this,” he said. If they’re blocked, users will get phone calls from CoWIN support to alert them about unusual activity in their accounts. Other sources said the new terms of service on the portal make use of bots or automated scripts to book slots illegal. “Mobile numbers involved in such illegalities will be on our radar and legal action may be taken,” the central official said. However, there are fears the new security controls could especially impact citizens desperate for the second dose. Thane’s Chetan Mathapati said he has been blocked. “I wanted my second dose, but was not able to log into CoWIN. Initially, it showed a “Generate OTP Failed” message. Now, it’s saying, ‘Your Account is Blocked Due To Exceeding Our Search Limit, Please read our terms of service’.” Mathapati said he ended up generating OTPs over a 100 times in a few hours. “I had to generate OTPs so many times because the system kept logging me out after 20 or more attempts at finding a slot. So I had to log in multiple times,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cowin-blocking-users-logging-over-1000-slot-searches-50-otps-in-24-hrs/articleshow/83383298.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Allahabad||Union minister Nitin Gadkari assures all help to Uttar Pradesh to meet medical challenges||PRAYAGRAJ: Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said Covid-19 has thrown up new challenges and we should be ready for the third wave as we have already lost many lives due to lack of medical oxygen “during the second wave of the pandemic”. “He also assured UP of all possible help in meeting the shortage of medical oxygen and injections for the black fungus infection. Gadkari was speaking virtually at the foundation stone laying ceremony of an oxygen plant being constructed by Prabhavya Industries at Saraswati Hi-Tech City, Naini, on Wednesday. Gadkari spoke about the need of oxygen in Uttar Pradesh and lack of vital injection for black fungus infection. “If there is any need in UP, that deficiency will be filled by the injection bank set up in Maharashtra by us,” he assured. As and when UP would want, we can supply 50,000 injections and that too at cheap rates,” he added. He also said that it is a good sign that a road construction company is setting up a plant where 1,500 cylinders of oxygen, per day, will be ready by September. The Union minister said that vaccination will also have to be accelerated. In such a situation, make big malls, parking lots as vaccination centres where people can get vaccinated by sitting in their car. He added that preparations should be made in advance regarding ventilators as well. The ventilator that comes from abroad costs Rs 12 to 15 lakh. “We have prepared ventilators in collaboration with MSMEs of Visakhapatnam at a cost of Rs 1.48 lakh and if UP needs it, we will make it available at the same cost,” he assured. Speaking on the occasion, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that there had been some problems regarding oxygen and ventilator in the second wave of the corona pandemic, but now the government is well prepared for the possible third wave and the people of the state will not face any kind of inconvenience. State minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that the Yogi government is setting up oxygen plants in the entire state and health facilities are constantly being expanded. Umesh Jaiswal, owner of Prabhavya Industries, got emotional during the foundation stone laying ceremony. He announced that he would also provide free oxygen from this plant to Kaushambi district hospital too. He has already announced to give free lifetime supply of oxygen to three government hospitals of the district. Even Gadkari praised Jaiswal for setting up an oxygen plant and giving it free to the government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/gadkari-assures-all-medical-help-to-up/articleshow/83382130.cms||---

Gopal dairy, a member union of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets brand Amul has started micro ATM facilities for fourteen milk co-operative societies in those villages where there is no banking facility. These milk producers can withdraw cash from their village in three days of the month now. The facility was inaugurated at Anandpara village of Rajkot taluka. The district dairy union deposits the milk procurement price paid to milk producers in their accounts. But bank branches are often around 10 km far from their villages. The secretary of village co-operative society will be given a small machine like PoS (point of sale) terminal, similar to the machines that banking correspondents use. The account holder can deposit or withdraw money through this machine using a debit card or Aadhar card linked with the bank account. “We have received requests from 37 other cooperative societies to start this facility. We will replicate it after the success of this project. We will provide this facility to only those villages where the bank branch and ATM is 8 to 10 km far,” said Gopal dairy’s managing director Vinod Vyas. There are 890 milk co-operative societies in Rajkot, Morbi, Junagadh and Amreli districts under the milk shed area of Gopal dairy. Out of that 600 have banking facilities in their villages. Nearly 45,000 milk producers are attached with this dairy union that collects an average of 4.50 lakh litre milk per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-dairy-takes-atm-to-doorstep-of-milk-producers/articleshow/83379329.cms||---

The ward is equipped with all facilities including oxygen beds to treat the young children, GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel said. There would be zero delay and children being brought to the facility would be attended to immediately, he added. The dean said the number of children brought for Covid treatment was low. Only six children had come for treatment in the second wave. “Four of them are under treatment in the new facility now. They are being monitored round the clock,” he said. Meanwhile, the Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre has also established a paediatric Covid ward. Chairman of the hospital Dr S Gurushankar said the facility will help treat prolonged fever, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock (a condition in which the blood pressure fails). According to the national family health survey-4, nearly 36% of the children under five are underweight, 38% are stunted and 28% are wasted. There is also a high incidence of anaemia among children. In this context, India needs to strengthen its healthcare infrastructure for paediatric Covid-19 care on a warfooting and be prepared for any adverse scenario in the future, he said. Though children are vulnerable to infections in all seasons, the first wave did not see a large number getting affected. It is estimated that only 3% to 4% of the patients admitted to hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 in the second wave were children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/grh-sets-up-50-bed-paediatric-covid-treatment-facility/articleshow/83381362.cms||---

---||Madurai||Availability of oxygen beds in southern Tamil Nadu up by 169%||MADURAI: The drop in the number of fresh and active Covid-19 cases have reflected an increase in the number of oxygen beds available in the government and private hospitals in the 10 southern districts. According to statistics from the health department, out of the 10,809 oxygenated beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients in government and private hospitals in the region, 4,927 were available as on Tuesday. It was a mere 1,833 on June 1. Of the 2,462 beds in government hospitals in Madurai including 1,771 oxygen beds 1,672 were vacant on Tuesday. It included 1,230 oxygen beds. In all, of the 3,197 oxygenated beds in government and private hospitals in Madurai 1,786 were vacant on Tuesday, against 440 on June 1. The four government Covid-19 treatment facilities in Madurai – Government Rajaji Hospital (20kl), trauma centre (6kl), old GRH building (11kl) and Thoppur hospital (2kl) – have a capacity of 39kl. GRH sources said that during the peak of the second wave 16kl oxygen was required to maintain the 1,700 oxygen beds in the above said facilities. Now, it has come down to 12.5kl to 13kl a day. Despite a sharp dip in the number of cases in Tuticorin there is only a marginal dip in oxygen utility at the government medical college hospital. The hospital with 700 oxygen beds has a 16kl oxygen tank. Earlier, last month the hospital was on the verge of running out of oxygen due to shortage in the supply due to inability to meet the requirement of 4 KL a day. “The shortfall was made up and we were receiving 4kl a day, which was completely getting utilised. Now the requirement has dropped to 3kl, thereby registering a 25% drop in requirement. We continue to get 4kl a day and the surplus 1kl has increased the storage for future use in case of emergency,” Tuticorin district collector Dr K Senthil Raj told TOI. Medical college hospital doctors said it would take a couple of more weeks for the oxygen requirement to drop drastically – provided there is no increase in fresh cases. “Among those under oxygen support are people who tested positive up to two weeks ago and were under home quarantine and needed oxygen now,” a senior doctor said. While there is a 45.6% availability of oxygenated beds the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds is much lesser. Of the 2,383 ICU beds in the region only 573 (24%) are available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/availability-of-oxygen-beds-in-southern-tn-up-by-169/articleshow/83381452.cms||M K Ananth

Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of the state's public health department, said a high number of fatalities from the past are surfacing now because death reporting isn't quick in remote areas. “Our death reconciliation data is a continuous process. We have to, at times, wait for laboratory reports before adding a death to the Covid list. At other times, there isn't enough manpower to regularly update death charts in some districts,” he said. For the third day in a row, Maharashtra reported under 11,000 cases on Wednesday. Fatalities for the day were under 300, but the state is reporting more deaths from the past. It added 10,989 cases and 261 deaths taking total cases to 58.6 lakh and the death toll to 1,01,833, but including 400 more casualties from the past. While deaths in many states has dropped drastically, daily toll is relatively slow to decline. "Our case fatality rate is 1.72% which is close to the national average. So it cannot be said mortality is worse in Maharashtra than other states,'' said a n official. Meanwhile, after a daily toll of seven on Tuesday, Mumbai registered 27 deaths on Wednesday. The city's daily toll has been 20-30 since May 28.On Wednesday, the city had 788 fresh cases, taking the tally so far to 7.12 lakh. The toll in Mumbai stands at 15,033.

Though she was appointed as a sweeper and worked for more than a year, salary was not paid to her. Since no steps were taken on her representation to the district administration officials, she had filed the petition before the SHRC.Similarly, Mariammal had paid Rs 20,000 and Rs 1.2 lakh on two occasions to Murugan for getting building permission and for allotment of a group house. Since Murugan did not take steps and failed to return the money, she moved the SHRC.In his counter affidavit, Murugan denied all the allegations by both women. However, the Tenkasi district collector had submitted a report stating that an inquiry was conducted and Murugan was placed under suspension. During the pendency of the inquiry, Murugan had returned the money to both the women.Taking into account the submissions, SHRC member A Chittaranjan Mohandoss said that based on the report of the collector, it is clear that Sundarammal was appointed as a sweeper by Murugan in his personal capacity without any appointment order. Salary of Rs 45,000 was also paid to her without any records after she had made a complaint to the commission.The commission said that it indicates that Murugan, by abusing his position as a public servant, had obtained money from both the women. This is a serious misconduct by a public servant. Murugan also submitted a false counter affidavit by denying that he had not obtained money from the women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shrc-directs-to-recover-rs-20k-from-suspended-official-for-cheating/articleshow/83334445.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘Lung transplant not common in country and never been done in Pb’||Ludhiana: The death of deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Harjinder Singh on Wednesday, whose lung was compromised post Covid, has brought the spotlight once again on how India is unprepared for other complications that Covid brought in its wake. For instance, the DSP had to undergo lung transplant but health experts indicate that such procedures are not very common in India. In fact, according to them, not a single such procedure has been done in Punjab till now. “Though lung transplant is not difficult, but it is not common. In India, about less than hundred persons may have undergone such transplant and in Punjab not a single such procedure has been done till date. It is life saving, despite the problems associated with it. There are two main difficulties, one is there is less availability of donors of lung at appropriate time when recipient needs it as it (lung of brain dead person) cannot be done kept beyond six hours. The second is there are certain problems after the transplant,” said Dr Baldev Singh Aulakh, a transplant surgeon, who is founder president of Gift of Life-Organ Donation Awareness Society (GLODAS), which promotes organ donation. “There were two such cases in India in recent times wherein the recipients had died on the way to Hyderabad to get lung transplant. Apart from being very expensive (Rs 80 to 90 lakh), the survival rate over five years is 50%. There is risk of infections, including fungal and viral,” said chest disease specialist at Christian Medical College and Hospital Dr Neeru Mittal. Health experts said as the foreign body has been implanted, there are acceptability issues with lung transplant. “Even in the United States of America, there are very few centres that do lung transplants. Apart from chances of infection being high, the body may reject transplanted lungs immediately, months after or even after years,” maid medical superintendent at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital Dr Sandep Sharma. He added that such transplants are done in India at Hyderabad and at Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/lung-transplant-not-common-in-country-and-never-been-done-in-pb/articleshow/83379391.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Mumbai||Govt med colleges had nearly 25% of all deaths in Maharashtra in 2021||MUMBAI: A preliminary audit in Covid Care Centers attached to 19 government medical colleges in Maharashtra has revealed records of 11,301 deaths between January 1 and May 31, which is nearly one-fourth of all Covid deaths registered in the state (45,823) in the same period. The figures suggest that more than 40% of all casualties in these facilities, which are the tertiary care centres in their respective regions, may have been the outcome of patients not reaching on time– 1,350 were brought dead to these hospitals, 2,280 died within 24 hours of admission, and 2,611 persons died within 1-3 days of admission. The remaining 5,060 persons died three days after admission. The audit by the medical education department revealed that the oxygen saturation levels of 10,170 among the deceased were below 90 (95 is the safe level). The largest number of deceased were brought to Pune’s BJ medical college (517), followed by Government Medical College, Nagpur (368) and the Indira Gandhi Medical College, Nagpur (232). The newly opened Jalgaon Government Medical College had no cases of patients brought dead. Speaking of the audit, director of medical education and research T P Lahane said, “We have analysed the deaths, taken note of causes and in days to come, we will enhance level of treatment in all medical colleges. We will ask the deans to study each and every death and take corrective measures accordingly.” Lahane felt infrastructure needed to be strengthened on top priority to reduce Covid-19 deaths. “We will have to ensure availability of beds, ICU beds and address issues of fire audit and structural audit for safety and security of patients,’’ he said. Lahane said stringent infection prevention measures, uninterrupted supply and optimum utilization of medicines, equipment as well as trained human resources to provide services to all age groups were the key requirements to tackle the situation. He said the pressure on healthcare staff needed to be eased by utilizing services of alternative medicine doctors, such as those with BAMS, BHMS, BUMS degrees, and paramedics. Redefining the role of alternative medicine doctors and training them to use their services with immediate effect was the need of the hour to be prepared for the third wave. In addition, an assessment of hospital preparedness at regular intervals and availability of 8-10 weeks of medicines and oxygen stock was needed to handle a surge, he said. Lahane said on 25,000 cases were recorded on September 25 last year, while on April 14, when the second wave peaked, there were 68,000 in a single day. Now the department is prepared to tackle up to 80,000 cases in the event of a third wave. “We have adequate infrastructure, we have 20,000 ICU beds, one lakh oxygen beds, 15,000 ventilators and 4.5 lakh regular beds,’’ he said. A former dean said that the medical education wing will also have to aim for early identification of disease, identification of patients with co-morbidities, institutionalise steady monitoring for red flag signs and for prompt treatment to prevent deaths. “We need stringent preventive measures to halt the hospital deaths. In several cases, it was found that patients did not take the initial symptoms seriously and rushed to the hospital when it was too late,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/govt-med-colleges-had-nearly-25-of-all-deaths-in-maharashtra-in-21/articleshow/83383353.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Oppn demands subsidy to mitigate fuel price rise||Thiruvananthapuram: The opposition demanded that the government provide fuel subsidies to the most eligible, so as to provide some relief from the upward spiralling fuel prices. The suggestion from opposition leader V D Satheesan came after the ruling front and the opposition locked horns over the fuel prices increasing daily. Seeking leave for adjournment motion, N Shamsudheen raised the matter, which then turned into a political blame game on who offered tax relief more number of times to reduce the impact of fuel price increase to the public. Shamsudheen claimed that Oommen Chandy-led UDF government had waived additional taxes on petroleum fuels on seven instances to give up Rs 619.17 crore that could have been added to the state treasury, to provide relief to the public. He demanded that the state should demand the Centre to bring petroleum fuels also under the ambit of GST so that there is a cap on taxes. Replying to the opposition, finance minister K N Balagopal said that the UPA government began deregulation of fuel prices, and the NDA government continued it. He said that compared to Kerala, the taxes on fuels imposed by other states, including Congress-ruled states, are much higher. He said that the previous UDF government increased the taxes on petrol 13 times and five times on diesel, and had taken the rate of state taxes to 31.8% and 24.52% respectively for petrol and diesel. This was then reduced by the previous LDF government to 30.08% and 22.76% in 2018, which is the state’s current tax rate for petrol and diesel. He said that the prices of petrol and diesel and extra-neutral alcohol (ENA) are the only two products that are left out of the ambit of GST, and if these are also included, the state will not have anything left on its own for taxation. He said that the Union government’s economic policies should be opposed together by LDF and UDF, setting aside political differences. Satheesan, meanwhile, said that the state government had no moral right to attack the Centre as it was enjoying the share of benefits of excise duty on fuel. He said that instead of ensuring “policy accrued economic rights” of the people, it is “tax terrorism” that is going on in the country. He demanded that if the state does not want to waive taxes on fuels, the state should at least provide fuel subsidies to the most affected. However, the opposition later staged a walk-out after speaker M B Rajesh denied permission for the motion, based on the finance minister’s reply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-demands-subsidy-to-mitigate-fuel-price-rise/articleshow/83381606.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A three-member team of Crime Investigating Agency (CIA) — ASI Bhagwan Singh, ASI Dalwinderjit Singh and home guard Rajwinder Singh — had on May 15 gone to New Grain Market at Jagraon in Ludhiana district after a tip-off that some liquor smugglers had sneaked in with a consignment of illicit liquor. Acting on the input, the CIA team found a White i10 and a Canter parked there. When the cops insisted on checking the two vehicles, the occupants opened fire and two ASIs were killed. ASI Bhagwan Singh’s widow, 43-year-old Jaswinder Kaur said on Wednesday she is proud of the fact that the gangsters, who had murdered her husband and another police officer, were killed in less than a month after the incident. She added the family is at peace now. “My husband would work very hard and for him, duty came first. When he died, we wanted that those who did this to him should be arrested and they have been brought to book in less than a month,” said Jaswinder Kaur, with her lone son Sukhminder Singh sitting nearby.

The figures suggest that more than 40% of all casualties in these facilities, which are the tertiary care centres in their respective regions, may have been the outcome of patients not reaching on time– 1,350 were brought dead to these hospitals, 2,280 died within 24 hours of admission, and 2,611 persons died within 1-3 days of admission. The remaining 5,060 persons died three days after admission. The audit by the medical education department revealed that the oxygen saturation levels of 10,170 among the deceased were below 90 (95 is the safe level). The largest number of deceased were brought to Pune’s BJ medical college (517), followed by Government Medical College, Nagpur (368) and the Indira Gandhi Medical College, Nagpur (232). The newly opened Jalgaon Government Medical College had no cases of patients brought dead. Speaking of the audit, director of medical education and research T P Lahane said, “We have analysed the deaths, taken note of causes and in days to come, we will enhance level of treatment in all medical colleges. We will ask the deans to study each and every death and take corrective measures accordingly.” Lahane felt infrastructure needed to be strengthened on top priority to reduce Covid-19 deaths. “We will have to ensure availability of beds, ICU beds and address issues of fire audit and structural audit for safety and security of patients,’’ he said. Lahane said stringent infection prevention measures, uninterrupted supply and optimum utilization of medicines, equipment as well as trained human resources to provide services to all age groups were the key requirements to tackle the situation. He said the pressure on healthcare staff needed to be eased by utilizing services of alternative medicine doctors, such as those with BAMS, BHMS, BUMS degrees, and paramedics. Redefining the role of alternative medicine doctors and training them to use their services with immediate effect was the need of the hour to be prepared for the third wave. In addition, an assessment of hospital preparedness at regular intervals and availability of 8-10 weeks of medicines and oxygen stock was needed to handle a surge, he said. Lahane said on 25,000 cases were recorded on September 25 last year, while on April 14, when the second wave peaked, there were 68,000 in a single day. Now the department is prepared to tackle up to 80,000 cases in the event of a third wave. “We have adequate infrastructure, we have 20,000 ICU beds, one lakh oxygen beds, 15,000 ventilators and 4.5 lakh regular beds,’’ he said. A former dean said that the medical education wing will also have to aim for early identification of disease, identification of patients with co-morbidities, institutionalise steady monitoring for red flag signs and for prompt treatment to prevent deaths. “We need stringent preventive measures to halt the hospital deaths. In several cases, it was found that patients did not take the initial symptoms seriously and rushed to the hospital when it was too late,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-med-colleges-had-nearly-25-of-all-deaths-in-maharashtra-in-21/articleshow/83395097.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Chandigarh||Students happy with decision to allow second dose after 28 days to enable travel abroad||LUDHIANA: The decision to allow a second dose of Covishield vaccine before the prescribed time interval (after 28 days but before 84 days) has made life easier for students intending to study abroad. At the moment, based on the recommendations by the national expert group on vaccine administration for Covid-19 (NÉGVAC), the schedule of Covishield vaccine under the national Covid-19 vaccination strategy is to administer the second dose at 12-16 weeks interval (i.e. after 84 days), after administration of first dose. The Union ministry of health and family welfare has received several representations for allowing administration of the second dose of Covishield for such persons who have only taken the first dose of Covishield and are seeking to travel abroad for educational purposes or for employment or for part of India’s contingent for the Tokyo Olympic games, but whose planned travel dates fall prior to completion of the currently mandated minimum interval of 84 days from the date of the first dose. The state government has not announced any decision, but the students planning to fly in July want this to regularised. Ministry has stated that government will designate a competent authority in each district for giving permissions for such administration of the second dose of Covishield. A student of hotel management, who is planning to go Brampton, Ontario in Canada, who could get his second vaccination on June 6 according to 28-day rule, said, “The online portal doesn’t pick the beneficiary ID before 84 days of the first dose. My flight is rescheduled for July 4 and my online classes are going on. I want to complete my vaccination at the earliest so that there is no issue. I am glad that the Cowin system will soon provide the facility for the administration of the second dose in such cases. ” Another student who got vaccinated on May 27 at Mohan DaiOswal Hospital and planning to go abroad for his studies said, “It is an appreciable move, as other countries are demanding complete vaccination before entering the borders.” D. Puneet Juneja, district immunisation officer, said, “This will be done after the authorisation from the district and once notified by the state government.” Another official stated that SOP is made and the new rule will probably be implemented after June 21. BOX Passport to be ID document Vaccination may be availed in such cases by showing passports as ID document — passport number will be printed in the vaccination certificate. However, if passport was not used at the time of administration of first dose, the details of the photo ID Card used for vaccination will be printed in the vaccination certificate and mention of the passport in the vaccination certificate is not to be insisted upon. Wherever necessary, the competent authority may issue another certificate linking the vaccination certificate with the passport number of the beneficiary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/students-happy-with-decision-to-allow-iind-dose-after-28-days-to-enable-travel-abroad/articleshow/83379440.cms||Mehak Jain

Assistant professor of history at Rajus College in Rajapalayam, P Kandasamy, said that he found these two structures near a local tank near Karivalamvanthanallur village. He said that they were on a field visit near the Paravakudi tank in the village when they spotted a boundary stone and an idol in a sunflower field. The boundary stone has a conch, chakra and ‘namam’ on it indicating that it is a Vaishnavite boundary stone. The stone is four feet in height and two feet in width and one foot in thickness. On the left side of the stone, the words— Paru tharai kudi kaal ru-- is engraved in Tamil. Kandasamy said that from what is available, it may be inferred that this place, which is now known as Paravakudi, was known as Parutharaikudi in the past. Iconography of the symbols and the style of the script are proof that it belongs to the 13th Century. The words, ‘kaal’ may refer to a channel and ‘ru’ to the number five, which may indicate that this was the fifth sluice of the Paravakudi tank or the supply channel, he said. The idol of Ayyanar has been found with its hair let down. From the iconography of this idol, in which the right leg is seen dangling, it can be inferred that it belongs to the 17th Century, Kandasamy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/13th-century-boundary-stone-and-17th-c-idol-found-in-rajapalayam/articleshow/83381629.cms||---

Education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy, who opened one such facility at the Vikarabad government hospital, said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s plan was also to establish the diagnostic centres in the remaining 13 districts.b“Not only will the required tests be done, the idea is to refer patients to specialist doctors for required treatment. All the tests that are done in corporate hospitals will be done in the diagnostic centres in the government hospitals,” she added. As per the plan, the blood samples would be collected at the primary health centres and taken to diagnostic centres for conducting the tests. Each diagnostic centre has been established at a cost of Rs 3.5 crore. Endowments minister A Indrakaran Reddy, who inaugurated a diagnostic centre at the government general hospital in Nirmal, said the test results would be sent directly to the mobile phone of the patient. Transport minister Puvvada Ajay, who inaugurated a diagnostics centre at the government district hospital in Khammam, also flagged off a vehicle which would be used to ferry blood samples from primary health centres to the hospital. “We have seen that due to Covid, people are forced to undergo several tests which are expensive. In this situation, patients will benefit as the tests will be done free of cost,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/modern-diagnostics-centres-open-in-19-dists/articleshow/83383368.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad schools newly-affiliated with CBSE hit scoring hurdle||HYDERABAD: City schools newly affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), have hit a hurdle in scoring their class 10 students. Managements say that the new tabulation policy rolled out by board has restricted their students from securing high marks in many subjects — unlike those enrolled with CBSE schools for a longer period of time. There are about 200 CBSE schools in Hyderabad. Of them, 10 to 15 have their first batch of class 10 students passing out this year. As per the policy, curated to grade students in the absence of exams, all CBSE-affiliated schools have to consider their historical performance — best overall performance in the last three years — as reference, while marking students for 2021. And since these new schools have no such data to refer to they will have to consider the district average as the reference for assessment. The problem: Extremely low district average that can prove unfair to students who have otherwise scored high marks in their previous tests. “The district average for subjects such as English and Maths is 37 and 36 respectively. Our students have performed much better than that. How can we reduce 20 to 30 marks in each subject, because we have to consider the district average? It’s very unfair,” said Caroline Ross, principal of Springfields International School, Bandlaguda. Given the dilemma, many CBSE schools have now written to the board seeking an alternative to evaluate students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-schools-newly-affiliated-with-cbse-hit-scoring-hurdle/articleshow/83394526.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Mumbai||Sputnik V vaccine makes debut in Mumbai as part of pilot project||MUMBAI: The Russian vaccine Sputnik V has made its debut in the city this week. It has been administered to 667 people over the past two days as part of a pilot project carried out at Ashirwad Heart Hospital in Ghatkopar east.  It may be a few weeks before Sputnik is available for everyone. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had started inoculation with Sputnik V as part of a soft launch after it obtained clearance in April for emergency use. The first dose of the vaccine was administered in Hyderabad on 14 May under a pilot. Civic officials said that people cannot book slots for Sputnik on Co-win yet.  A spokesperson from Dr Reddy’s said this was a pilot programme and not the full commercial launch.  “It is a limited launch involving small numbers to test our cold storage arrangements (since Sputnik V requires -18C storage), CoWin integration, track-and-trace and logistical arrangements,” said the spokesperson. The commercial launch of the vaccine is expected to commence later in June.  This pilot launch that started in Hyderabad has now been scaled up and extended to Visakhapatnam, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata.  The company said that other cities will follow shortly. “As it is a limited launch right now, members of the public cannot register for the Sputnik V via the usual portals/apps. This will become possible at the time of full launch later in June,” the company told TOI.  Dr Mahendra Khandade, medical officer of health of N ward, said that the doses are being given to people chosen by the company along with doctors from Ashirwad Hospital.  Authorities from Ashirwad didn’t wish to comment on the project. It is not clear if other hospitals too are a part of the pilot in the city.  Developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia, the vaccine has an efficacy of over 91%.  The vaccine is priced at Rs 995 with GST, the second highest in the country. The Centre has capped its cost for private vaccination centres at Rs 1,145.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sputnik-v-vax-makes-debut-in-city-as-part-of-pilot-project/articleshow/83383394.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Sudhakaran, who met the outgoing president Mullappally Ramachandran on Wednesday, has also called on Congress MLAs. Sources close to Sudhakaran said he would leave for Kannur on Thursday and after attending a series of programmes on his home turf, he would return to the capital next week to officially begin his new role. Meanwhile in a series of interactions with the media, Sudhakaran reiterated that for Congress in Kerala, its main opponent was CPM and not BJP. “In national politics, BJP is the main foe. But political reality is different in Kerala. Here BJP is weak. It hasn’t grown here. My first fight is against Communist fascism that rules the state. Fascist Communists have slain a number of Congress workers and it still denies organizational rights to others,” he added. Soon after Congress announced Sudhakaran’s appointment as the party chief in Kerala, CPM leaders raised allegations against Sudhakaran that he was soft on BJP and may even switch over to that party. “CPM politburo member MA Baby or anyone who raises questions over my political integrity should clarify on what basis they made wild allegations. It shows their cowardice and worry,” he said. MP K Muraleedharan expressed happiness over the setback faced by the political groups led by Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-is-main-opponent-not-bjp-sudhakaran/articleshow/83381668.cms||---

The TOI had first reported about Harjinder’s medical condition and the help he needed for the transplant that cost Rs 80 lakh. The matter had also reached chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who had assured to bear all expenses. But before the transplant process could start, the DSP passed away. Harjinder’s kin said he died due to delay in the transplant process. DSP Harjinder was posted at Ludhiana Central Jail when he contracted Covid-19. He was admitted to SPS Hospital on April 6. Till April 21, he remained admitted in the Covid ward, and then was moved to a non-Covid ward. Though he defeated the virus, his lungs were badly affected. His cousin Hardeep Singh said, “Harjinder’s life could have been saved if the transplant had started in time. On June 2, Harjinder’s mother, son and a friend had gone to the CM residence, where they were assured help. The CM had also tweeted that the government would bear all the expenses of his treatment. A panel of doctors was formed under the supervision of Dr KK Talwar, but the transplant process did not start.” “After the CM’s announcement, we were again asked to provide the breakup of treatment, including the charges of airlifting Harjinder to a hospital in Telangana. Thereafter, the doctors’ panel made him go through check-ups. They should have immediately airlifted Harjinder and saved the precious time,” he added. Dr Gurpreet Singh from the department of pulmonary and critical care medicine who was treating the DSP at SPS Hospital said, “I would not say that he died due to delay in treatment. He was getting proper treatment here. Covid-related hypoxia, diabetes, other health problems and the lungs’ infections caused Harjinder’s death.” On the process of transplant, Dr Gurpreet said, “Immediate transplant is not possible. Generally, it takes four to six weeks, moreover it depends on the condition of the patient and availability of organ.” DSP Harjinder is survived by his 78-year-old mother and two sons of 18 and eight who live in Mohali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/waiting-for-lungs-transplant-dsp-dies/articleshow/83379536.cms||Payal Dhawan

Presiding over a meeting with representatives of the various political parties, deputy commissioner and district electoral officer (DEO) Varinder Kumar Sharma said the Election Commission of India (ECI) has decided to limit the number of voters in each polling station to 1,000 and the auxiliary station will be established wherever the number of voters exceeds 1,000.

Sharma said Ludhiana will have 4,059 polling stations out of which 3,894 can be created in the existing buildings where polling stations persist currently and 133 polling stations can be set up in nearby buildings. For remaining 32 polling stations, directions have been issued to the assistant returning officers (ARO) to immediately finalise the locations. He told the representatives of political parties to meet the AROs of all 14 legislative assembly segments and must check the locations of these 1,310 auxiliary polling stations so that they can be prepared for the upcoming assembly elections due in 2022.

In parts of the city, the mercury crossed 44° Celsius. Track the pollution level in your cityMeanwhile, the dust raising winds sweeping across the capital at a speed of 35 kmph led to deterioration in the air quality to the ‘very poor’ category. An improvement in air quality is expected from Saturday as IMD has predicted rain from June 12 to 15. Parts of Delhi touched the 44-degree mark on Wednesday with Pitampura being the hottest station at 44.3° C, followed by Najafgarh at 44.1° C. The minimum temperature was recorded at 31.4° Celsius, four notches above normal. Met officials said the temperature rose mainly due to dry winds and clear sky. The Air Quality Index of Delhi was recorded at 305 in the ‘very poor’ category on Wednesday as against 205 in ‘poor’ category on Tuesday. The capital’s AQI on Monday was 180. Experts said gusty winds at a speed of 35 kmph transported dust from Rajasthan side to Delhi and PM10 was the lead pollutant. Similar conditions have been predicted for Thursday. LS Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “Delhi has witnessed high PM10 levels in the range of 300-700 ug/m3 in the last 32 hours. The highest PM10 level was recorded at 10pm on Tuesday. This rise is attributable to the long-distance transport of dust from nearby arid regions owing to the prevailing westerly winds.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seasons-hottest-day-at-42-2c-air-very-poor/articleshow/83381669.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Agra||Giving cellphones to girls leads to rape, says UP State Women’s Commission member||AGRA: A member of the UP State Women’s Commission has said that girls should not be given cell phones as it leads to rapes while appealing to parents to keep the devices away from their daughters. “Girls talk on phones and later run away with boys…,” said Meena Kumari during a Mahila Jansunwai (public hearing of women related complaints) in Aligarh on Wednesday when she was asked by a reporter about an alleged increase in rape cases in UP. Kumari also added that parents, especially mothers, should monitor their daughters as crime against women was a result of “their carelessness”. The state commission has distanced itself from Kumari’s statement. Anju Chaudhary, vice chairperson of the commission, said that Kumari’s statement was wrong and that taking away cellphones was not a solution to sexual violence. “Instead of saying that we should not give mobile phones to girls, we should be teaching them not to chat with strangers and educate them on safe use of cellphones,” she told TOI. Asked about her statement, Kumari told TOI that she meant that minors and girls from villages don’t “know how to use phones in the right manner”. “They use phones to make male friends and later run away with them,” she said, adding that smartphones were also being used to watch inappropriate content. When further pressed on how rapes were linked to mobile phones, Kumari, who was elected twice as a zila panchayat member from Aligarh, said, “I listen to grievances of 20 women on average daily and at least five to seven cases are related to friendships over cellphones and their after effects. In many cases, girls were lured to a certain place and then sexually assaulted,” she said. In the past as well, authorities have blamed just about anything — from chowmein to jeans — for rising incidences of rapes in the country. In January, National Commission for Women member Chandramukhi Devi had stoked controversy with her comment that the gangrape and murder of a 50-year-old woman in Badaun, UP, could have been avoided if she hadn’t gone out alone in the evening. She later withdrew her statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dont-give-girls-cellphones-it-leads-to-rape-up-state-womens-commission-member/articleshow/83379559.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vax price cap makes drives at offices, housing societies unviable, says private hospitals||MUMBAI: Vaccination at workplaces and housing societies is likely to take a hit with private hospitals saying the Centre’s new vaccine price cap will make it unaffordable to hold drives outside their premises. They have sought clarity on whether the cap applies to offsite drives too or only at hospitals. The Union health ministry on Tuesday fixed the rates private hospitals can charge: Rs 1,410 for Covaxin, Rs 780 for Covishield and Rs 1,145 for every dose of Sputnik V. The price includes a 5% GST above the landing cost of vaccines and a service charge of Rs 150. The private hospitals are also jittery about the stipulation that state governments would aggregate the demand for vaccines from private hospitals and pass it to the Centre, which will facilitate supply. Payments will be through the National Health Authority’s electronic platform, the system that had existed prior to May 1. The Centre said it was to ensure equitable distribution between large and small private hospitals as well as to strike a regional balance. The private hospitals are wondering if it means they can no longer contact the manufacturers directly. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, told TOI that the state was seeking clarity from the Centre. “The issue is not very clear at the moment. We are asking for clarity,” he said. N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission, said an online meeting was scheduled with the Centre on Thursday to discuss the new guidelines and its implementation. Reacting to the price cap, Gautam Khanna, president, Association of Hospitals (AOH), which includes Mumbai’s major trust-run hospitals, said: “At these rates, vaccination next-to-doorstep is not going to work out since it involves the cost of transporting an entire team to a separate location, maintaining the vaccine cold chain and deploying team of doctors and nurses for an entire day.” Dr Prince Surana, CEO of Surana Group, whose hospitals have been holding 8-10 offsite drives in a day, said a minimum of 15-20 people, including standby doctors, nurses, ambulances, have to be sent to facilitate drives. “If we are expected to charge the same amount for vaccination in hospitals as well as doorstep, it won’t be feasible,” he said. People have been shelling out Rs 900 to Rs 1,500 for a single dose of vaccine at private offsites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-price-cap-makes-drives-at-offices-housing-societies-unviable-says-pvt-hosps/articleshow/83383443.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Police pat for super cop who adopted 50 kids, got Covid patients beds, oxygen||MUMBAI: Rehana Shaikh, 40, is fondly called ‘Mother Teresa’ by her cop-husband Nasir. Not only does she look after their family of six, manages her job as police naik and recently passed the sub-inspector test, Rehana has shown a rare humanity and energy to help those in need during the pandemic. If it started with adopting 50 poor children in a school, it naturally expanded to helping 54 persons with plasma, hospital beds, blood and oxygen. Acknowledging her zeal for social work, police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Tuesday felicitated her with a certificate of excellence at his office. “Last year, we were about to celebrate my daughter’s birthday, when I learnt about Dnyani Vidyalaya in Raigad’s Waje taluka. I spoke to the principal and he invited us. The small kids mostly come from poor background. Some of them didn’t even have footwear. I was overcome. We used money saved for my daughter’s birthday and Eid shopping to help them,” said Shaikh. She has promised to take care of their education till Class X. In 2020 itself, Rehana got a call from a constable who was struggling to get an injection for his mother. Shaikh dialled the police control room, the BMC control room and finally got the contact number of the place where the injection was still available. “This encouraged me and I began helping people anyway I can. Many cops began calling me for blood, plasma and beds in hospitals for their relatives. I also joined a blood donors’ WhatsApp group and whenever we get messages about blood requirement from anywhere in the state, we try to arrange through this group,” said Rehana, who joined the police force as a constable in 2000. Often, the blood requirement is for cancer patients, she added. Rehana’s father, Abdul Nabi Bagwan, retired as sub-inspector from Mumbai police and she herself has so far worked at the local armed police, V P Road and Bhoiwada police stations, and protection and security branch. Little seems to faze her, but underneath all that beats a compassionate heart. Last month, Rehana was in hospital for her elder sister’s treatment; she had just been diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. She received a call, with a request for blood. Rehana didn’t dither. “I called up Appa Ghorpada in Satara, who is from Shiv Shambhu Trust, and helped arrange the blood. The same day, I also helped arrange plasma for a couple of others who needed it,” she said in a matter-of-fact tone. A pat on the back is not new for Rehana. She used to be a volleyball player and an athlete and won two gold medals and silver while representing her force in Sri Lanka in 2017, garnering praise from then police commissioner Dutta Padsalgikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-pat-for-super-cop-who-adopted-50-kids-got-covid-patients-beds-o2/articleshow/83383464.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Agra||Licence of Agra hospital suspended, kin of dead patients demand murder case against owner||AGRA: The licence of Agra’s Shri Paras hospital was revoked on Wednesday by the Uttar Pradesh government amid an ongoing probe against its owner whose videos purportedly showing him bragging about cutting oxygen supply of serious patients on April 26 took social media by storm and drew widespread condemnation. The private hospital had been sealed on Tuesday and its patients shifted to other health facilities. An FIR was also registered against its owner Arinjay Jain under sections of IPC and under the Disaster Management Act 2005 and Diseases and Epidemic Act, 1897. Meanwhile, Jain and the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Agra chapter have refuted the administration’s claim that there was no shortage of oxygen in Agra in April. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh had said there was “no shortage of oxygen in the district during the peak of the pandemic.” IMA’s Agra president elect OP Yadav said, “The entire incident has certainly brought a bad name to the medical fraternity. A five-member committee comprising senior doctors has been constituted to investigate the matter and bring out the truth. The committee will submit its report within two days. The claim of the district administration that there was no shortage of oxygen is completely baseless. Most hospitals suffered acute shortage of oxygen during the peak pandemic period. Doctors tried their best to serve patients amid the crisis.” A lawyers’ group has also given a police complaint against the owner of the hospital demanding his arrest. This came even as two families of patients who had died at the hospital on April 26 demanded registration of a murder case against Jain. One of them, Ashok Chawla, said, “I was told about my father’s death in the evening on April 26. I saw six other bodies being taken away in an ambulance from the hospital. On April 27, my daughter-in-law died at the same hospital. It is shocking to see the owner of the hospital narrating the inhuman act of switching off oxygen supply to patients in critical condition. I have handed over a formal complaint against the hospital owner to the SSP. We want an FIR to be registered against him under IPC section 302 (punishment for murder)." Etawah resident Raju Yadav said, “My brother-in-law was admitted at Shri Paras hospital on April 19. We were informed about his death on the evening of April 26. At least 27 people had died at the hospital on that day. I had filed a formal complaint to register an FIR against the owner at the SSP‘s office on May 17, but no action was taken. Now the viral video has confirmed that oxygen supply was cut off. We want murder charges to be lodged.” TOI could not verify the claim of Yadav independently. Jain was caught on camera saying that on the morning of April 26 he got the oxygen supply of 106 critical patients snapped for five minutes “as an experiment to know who all are going to survive”. “Twenty-two patients started gasping for breath, they began turning blue. So we became sure that they will not survive,” Jain was heard saying in the video clip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/licence-of-agra-hosp-suspended-kin-of-dead-patients-demand-murder-case-against-owner/articleshow/83379645.cms||---

---||Kochi||Cochin airport to augment non-aero revenues by 2030||KOCHI: The Cochin International Airport Ltd (CIAL) aims to be the India’s first airport with zero landing/ parking fees for airlines by 2030, said VJ Kurian, who stepped down as its MD on Wednesday after nearly 20 years at its helm. Kurian said the company’s vision is to expand non-aero revenue sources by 2030 so that the airport doesn’t need to collect landing or parking fees, which constitutes around 30% of current revenue from the airlines. The plan is achieve it by implementing CIAL’s Land Utilization Plan (LUP), which aims to transform around 100 acres of unused land owned by the company along the National Highway into an airport city. In the first phase, a restaurant hub will be created. Kurian said the matter was already under the consideration of the CIAL directors’ board and the company is hoping to achieve the target within nine years. “CIAL has been making profit but the pandemic has had its impact on the revenue of the company. Covid has taught us a lesson that CIAL’s income should not be dependent on aero-revenue, which is depended on number of passengers. If the planned airport city becomes real with so many commercial establishments, it will be a major source of income for the company. The restaurant hub, which would feature outlets of all international food brands is one among them. CIAL is already a zero-user fee airport and it aims to be a zero-landing/parking fee airport by 2030. It will only increase the airport revenue as more airlines will be willing to use Kochi airport,” Kurian said. Kurian said the company has proposed to offer 1 acre to the Thiruvananthapuram-–Kasargod Semi High Speed Rail Corridor project and to construct a railway station. “The proximity of airport to the rail will increase the number of air passengers as people from even Kasaragod will be ready to use Kochi airport. CIAL also plans to avail low-cost accommodation for passengers and crew in the T2 Terminal,” he said. He said by December 2021 the impact of the Covid will fade and the airport will continue its growth. He also said the solar power projects undertaken by CIAL at various places are nearing completion. When asked whether there is any scope for more airports in Kerala, Kurian cited the example of New Zealand that has six international airports serving a population of around 49 lakh people, which is almost similar to the population of Malappuram district. “If more people are ready to travel by air, the state can always have more airports,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cochin-airport-to-augment-non-aero-revenues-by-2030/articleshow/83381713.cms||Anantha Narayanan K
---||Kochi||Kochi: Row over bid to divert drain through Parade Ground||KOCHI: Causing damage to the historic Parade Ground in Fort Kochi, the Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) authorities are diverting a drain through the ground. The move is apparently to avoid a big tree that was coming in the way of the drain that is being constructed along the road near the Parade Ground. According to former mayor K J Sohan, the contractor constructed a drain through the ground without securing the nod from the authorities concerned. “The CSML is constructing drains and roads in an unscientific manner. They are constructing the drain through an area where there is no requirement for it. The drain work had stopped following protests over the possibility of felling the around 200-year-old tree. It was then that they decided to construct the drain through the middle of the ground. This will lead to storm water from an entire area being channelized into the Parade Ground, thereby causing waterlogging in the ground,” Sohan said. Meanwhile, CSML authorities denied giving nod for the change in plan. “We will be conducting a meeting with the local councillor and other officials to sort out the issue, on Thursday,” a CSML official said. Antony Kureethra, the councillor from Fort Kochi division, said that CSML has constructed similar drains in other areas as well. “They have constructed a drain near Pattalam area which ends abruptly. They haven’t secured permission from agencies like Kochi Corporation,” Kureethra said. The Parade Ground, where the flags of all colonial forces that ruled India have been hoisted, had been witness to many historic moments. Ahead of the Under-17 Fifa world cup held in Kochi, the authorities had raised the level of the ground by two-and-a-half feet. At that time they had constructed a drain to empty the rainwater that may accumulate in the ground. “The drain was connected to another one which passes by St Francis Basilica and other heritage areas. This unscientific construction caused waterlogging in these areas. Then, based on a court order, around 100 truckloads of earth had to be removed from the Parade Ground,” Sohan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/row-over-bid-to-divert-drain-through-parade-ground/articleshow/83381730.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Officials in some districts have also begun making plans on how to take care of half-orphans, those having only one living parent. In Karimnagar district, officials identified six children whose parents had died of Covid-19, while as many as 157 children have lost one of their parents to the virus. District collector K Shashanka held a meeting with the officials to discuss ways and means to join the orphans and half-orphans in various residential educational institutions. Shashanka also discussed the issue of property and asked officials to chalk out a plan so that the property in the name of their parents could be transferred on to the children’s names. District welfare officer Ch Sharada said there are a total of 248 orphan and half-orphan children in Karimnagar district. This number includes children whose parents or one of the parents had died of other ailments. All these children would also be joined in residential educational institutions. In Narayanpet, two sisters turned orphans as their mother had died of the virus. Their father had died of a kidney ailment earlier. Collector Dasari Hari Chandana spoke to the girls and promised to help them pursue their education. The girls were told that they could join residential educational institutions and all their other needs would be taken care of. Their father had four acres of land on his name and officials said they would see to it that the land is transferred on to the girls. District welfare officer D Venugopal told TOI that the administration has identified 70 half-orphans. While details are being gathered on how one of their parents have died, the children will be provided the necessary help. “The first thing we did was supplying groceries to the orphans and half-orphans,” Venugopal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/officials-focus-on-edu-needs-of-orphaned-kids-of-covid-victims/articleshow/83383473.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

They claimed that due to ongoing work, their business will remain affected for over four years and after Covid-19 they are not in position to endure more financial losses.  “They are creating barricades due to which we will have to close our shops,” said Pragnesh Chhatriwala, a shop owner. Businessmen claimed that around 1,000 shops will be affected due to this work. “Not only the shops, but their employees, nearly 5,000 families, will also face financial crisis if the businesses remain closed for four years,” said Dharmesh Bodhanwala, another shop owner.  The businessmen met mayor Hemali Boghawala and chairman of SMC’s standing committee Paresh Patel with their demands.

Families of 16 brick kiln workers — who hailed from Bihar and died after consuming toxic liquor dumped along the Upper Ganga canal by the liquor mafia while fleeing police— have received compensation of Rs 2 lakh each from owners of brick kilns in Aligarh that the men worked at. At least 100 people died last month after consuming spurious liquor in various villages of Aligarh. Shakir (who only uses his first name), owner of a brick kiln, told TOI that he has paid Rs 22 lakh ex-gratia to families of his employees who died while Rs 6 lakh has been spent on treatment of those who fell ill after drinking hooch. “At least 28 of my workers were hospitalised after drinking hooch, 11 died while 17 have recovered and gone home.” According to Shakir, he decided to help out the families since they belonged to Bihar and had no one to look after them in UP. “Our kilns run on seasonal labour from Bihar, we can’t just abandon them. When they are here, they are our responsibility,” he said. According to estimates, around 15,000 labourers — many of them from Bihar — are employed in 500 brick kilns in the city every year when the units are operational from January to June. The families of 16 labourers who died after drinking hooch are not eligible for compensation from the UP government, which is providing Rs 5 lakh each to kin of 65 victims, according to Aligarh district magistrate C B Singh. Pooja, from Bihar’s Gaya, whose husband Chhote worked at Shakir’s unit and was among those who died on June 3, said the ex-gratia would keep her family of two minor daughters afloat until she finds work. “The money can’t bring my husband back but it will help us meet our daily needs. I was in shock when I lost my husband but our employer arranged everything, including our tickets back home.” Another brick kiln owner, Guruvachan Singh, has paid Rs 2 lakh each to three families who lost their loved ones while Vishal Agarwal has offered combined financial help of Rs 4 lakh to two families. Both of them have also helped out families with hospital bills. Aligarh chief medical officer B P Kalyani said autopsies have been conducted on 106 people who died of suspected hooch consumption and their viscera report is awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/brick-kiln-owners-offer-rs-2l-each-to-kin-of-up-hooch-tragedy-victims-foot-hosp-bills/articleshow/83379728.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Coimbatore||Tirupur collector orders probe into ‘vaccine sale’ issue||COIMBATORE: A controversy broke out on Wednesday based on Tirupur corporation’s decision to administer around 800 doses of Covaxin, initially allotted to four urban primary health centres, to employees of three garment factories’ instead. There were media reports of the civic body taking away vaccines meant for the public and selling them to private garment factories. However, the district administration denied the accusation. District collector K Vijaykarthikeyan said he had ordered a probe into the complaint of “vaccines being sold” to garment factories by the deputy director of health services, Dr Jegadeesh. “After enquiries, we have learned that the corporation had scheduled institutional vaccination for three garment factories on Saturday, in which there is no wrongdoing. Especially because reopened factories, which were earlier sources for Covid-19 clusters, are high-risk sectors,” he said. “The issue seems to be the diversion of the vaccines allotted to the UPHCs, without informing the medical officers. However, the written report will be submitted to me later in the night,” he added. He said that there was no evidence or pointers towards vaccines being sold. The issue arose after an internal communication from the health department surfaced showing 728 doses of vaccines remaining unutilized across four primary health centres on Saturday. The four UPHCs were—Sundamedu UPHC which had 205 doses, Anna Nesavalar Colony UPHC which had 99 doses, Kovilvali UPHC which had 174 doses and Periyandipalayam UPHC which had 261 doses. “Based on this, we think many residents gathered in front of these urban PHCs for their shots but had to be turned away because the vaccines did not arrive on Saturday,” a corporation official said. “So, people misunderstood that the 728 doses remaining were sold off to three garment factories,” he said. The corporation confirmed that they had organized vaccination camps on Saturday at three garment factories MS Garments, Prisma Garments and Network Clothing Company and administered 770 doses in total. “It was a case of miscommunication because the corporation took the decision to divert vaccine stocks without informing the UPHCs’ medical staff, which the public got wind of and misunderstood,” said an official. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan also said that prioritizing institutional vaccination over public was a district’s priority and unless there was evidence of “sale”, there was no controversy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tirupur-collector-orders-probe-into-vaccine-sale-issue/articleshow/83381806.cms||---

While the centre was proposed in 2019, Kufos former vice-chancellor late A Ramachandran was tasked with preparing the master plan for submission to Kufos governing council for approval by the state government. The draft plan will be submitted soon to state fisheries minister Saji Cherian for government approval, said Kuofs vice-chancellor K Reji John. The centre is coming up at the Kufos’ fisheries station at Puthuvype which is spread over an area of 50 acres and is home to some of the rarest mangrove forests in the country. It is a natural habitat and breeding ground for a variety of mangroves, aquatic fish, crabs and migratory birds. “Mangroves are of paramount importance in maintaining the ecological balance of Kerala and in coastal protection. They play an important role in maintaining the ambient temperature and oxygen availability, especially in cities like Kochi,” he said. The presence of mangroves is also essential for the survival of saltwater fish such as mullets, sea bass, milk fish, etc. Although these saltwater fish breed in the sea, they remain in the mangroves until the larval stage is complete. Coastal mangroves can reduce the severity of environmental impacts caused by sea surge. Mangrove forests can also prevent sand erosion and beaches from disappearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kufos-to-submit-master-plan-for-mangrove-centre-soon/articleshow/83381822.cms||---

The MSRTC has been incurring accumulated losses to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore and in recent times, amid the second Covid wave, it suffered loss of business, with less than 2,000 buses operating on road with 50% occupancy. The MSRTC has a total fleet of 18,000 buses. The Rs 600 crore will help in paying salaries of nearly a lakh staffers in the MSRTC and in meeting other expenses, including fuel and maintenance of buses, said Parab and thanked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for expediting the files for the financial aid. The state government has been lenient towards its bus corporation lately. A few days back, it had directed 17 government departments, including agriculture, to give 25% of its transport business to MSRTC trucks—these are buses modified into special trucks to carry essential and non- essential goods across Maharashtra in a bid to earn more revenue. The MSRTC expects additional annual revenue of Rs 150 crore by to this decision. In 2020, the MSRTC received Rs 550 crore aid in September and Rs 1,000 crore in November. “For paying salaries every month, we need up to Rs 150 crore and there have been a few months in the past when employees did not get their salary. We want to avoid this as nearly 70,000 staffers on field risking their lives during Covid,” a senior official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-okays-bailout-package-for-loss-making-msrtc/articleshow/83384907.cms||Somit Sen

A primary inquiry had revealed that as per KSRTC’s audit, the irregularities in fund management had begun 2010. The audit report had pointed at serious lapses on the part of KSRTC officials, including the accounts officer. The irregularities went on till 2013 with the corporation not maintaining records of its bank or treasury transactions. A finance team led by an additional secretary had identified the officials responsible. One of them is still serving in KSRTC. While another official has retired, two others were on deputation. HC dismisses plea The high court, meanwhile, has dismissed a petition seeking a probe against the former executive director of KSRTC and others for the alleged ‘missing’ of Rs100 crore in the loan deal with KTDFC. A petition by Jude Joseph of Thiruvananthapuram, a vehicle supervisor with KSRTC, was considered by the court. The petitioner alleged that despite complaints being filed, no action has been taken so far. The petitioner had relied on the alleged revelation by KSRTC MD about the irregularities that took place during 2013-15. State government contended that though a probe is required into the MD’s revelation, the petitioner should not be allowed to interfere with the probe. The petitioner has approached the high court directly without adopting other measures first, government had argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cm-okays-vigilance-probe-into-irregularities-in-ksrtc/articleshow/83381853.cms||---

Kumar is currently lodged in prison in connection with the Chhatrasal Stadium brawl case. Chief metropolitan magistrate Satvir Singh Lamba, in his order, also said, “Right to equality is a basic feature of Indian Constitution. It implies the rule of law. It also implies absence of any special privilege to any person due to his rank, status, whether rich or poor, etc. The law should be equal and should be equally administered.” The plea filed and argued through advocates Pradeep Rana and Ankit Rana, stated that Kumar was an Olympian and Padma Shri recipient and has led a “very disciplined life” throughout. Kumar reportedly consumes supplements such as “isolate whey protein, Omega 3 Capsules, Jointment Capsules, Pre-Workout C4 and Hyde, Multivitamin GNC, etc.” and requires a special nutrition diet owing to his profession. “The supplements are extremely necessary for the applicant to maintain his health and performance. Denial of these basic requirements will have huge implications on the career of the applicant,” his application said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-rejects-sushils-plea-for-special-diet/articleshow/83383496.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore district records highest positivity rate in state||COIMBATORE: Though ministers visiting the district have been trumpeting the rapid decline in cases and positivity rate, Coimbatore at 29.9% recorded the highest positivity rate in the state between June 1 and 7. This means that until as recently as Monday, nearly one out of every three people tested were positive. Though it is a sizeable drop from the previous week’s high of 36%, the figure is a cause of worry for administrators. Data shows that the district tested 67,042 people for the virus during the period, of which 20,055 tested positive. The district, which reported the second and third highest positivity rates since May third week, topped the table for the first time on Monday. Surprisingly, Tirupur which topped the table at 38.1% in May last week, has managed to bring down the numbers drastically to 24.9%, taking up the second spot. “With cases declining, the positivity rate is also declining. In fact, it has come down to 26% in the last few days,” said collector S Nagarajan. “There are no clusters coming up and cases from all sources are being brought under control. Primary contacts are also being tested and isolated even if results are yet to arrive.” To further bring down positivity rate, administrators have chosen to follow Chennai’s model. “Coimbatore corporation’s results are very encouraging. They have brought it down to 16%. We have already begun following Chennai corporation’s model in our rural areas which includes fever surveillance and early isolation,” said the collector. “We have assigned one person to survey every 100 households for fever cases daily, and thus 3,200 volunteers for 3.4 lakh households,” he added. Meanwhile, the district recorded 62 deaths, the highest single day death toll since the pandemic began in March 2020. The total toll shot up to 1,638. The deaths included four people in their 30s a 33-year-old man and a 32-year-old man who died three days and 11 days after hospitalization respectively at CMCH, a 31-year-old man who died two hours after admission at ESI Hospital and a 37-year-old diabetic, who died two days after hospitalization. As many as 2,319 fresh cases were recorded on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 1,95,362. With 4,992 people getting discharged, the number of active cases fell below the 25,000-mark to 24,022. With 1,69,702 people getting cured, the recovery rate rose to 86.8%. Rural development minister K R Periyakaruppan inspected the Covid care centre at Tejaa Shakthi College and interacted with patients. He also visited a medical camp and interacted with residents of Vinobhaji Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/district-records-highest-positivity-rate-in-state/articleshow/83381818.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Covid beds to make way for rain ills at BMC hospitals||MUMBAI: With the arrival of rains in the city, the BMC seems to be caught between arranging beds for monsoon ailments and the need to keep medical infrastructure ready for the third Covid-19 wave. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that number of beds for Covid care in BMC hospitals will be reduced as the second wave is declining, while field hospitals will be kept in a state of readiness for the third wave. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s task force on Covid, said, “We now have a spot of worry as far as our non-Covid cases are concerned. With monsoon setting in, we will need beds for patients suffering from monsoon ailments.” A senior doctor of a BMC hospital said it would be tragic if oxygen-support beds for Covid care are kept vacant despite there being an outbreak of some monsoon ailment. Patients suffering from bacterial infection leptospirosis or dengue viral fever need oxygen support at times. In BMC-run Sion Hospital, while one-third of the hospital is under renovation, another third is earmarked for Covid care, the rest for non-Covid patients. However, it only has around 100 Covid patients. Many public hospitals have started non-Covid procedures but haven’t yet scaled up to the pre-Covid numbers. Kakani said, “Covid-19 cases are down. Admissions to hospitals have dropped drastically. Even in our biggest Covid facility at the moment, Nesco field hospital in Goregaon, we have less than 300 patients admitted now.” The idea is to keep 200-odd beds in BMC’s big hospitals as standby for Covid. With speculation that a third Covid wave could hit in the next two months, BMC doesn’t want to take any chances. At BMC-run Nair Hospital, 500 beds were marked for Covid patients during the second wave. Covid beds will be cut to 300 so monsoon ailments get priority.

The crime occurred on June 7 and the traumatised girl lodged a complaint the next day. In the complaint, she said the men kept her in confinement and violated her. All the three men are from Sambhal. Two of them have fled while the third has been arrested. The young girl belongs to a labourer family. Her father passed away years ago. She was raised by her mother and her wedding was finalised with a youngster from the neighbouring village. Her elder sister is married and had invited her along with her fiancé to attend a small function. Police said the couple was on a bike when the two-wheeler suffered a glitch near Kubri Bhud village. They decided to take a break. Three unidentified men suddenly appeared and started misbehaving with them. They forcefully confined the couple and dragged the girl to a cane field where they took turns to rape her. The accused then threatened the couple and left. Later, a local resident told them that one of the accused was Pramod Yadav, a resident of Kubri Bhud, while the other two were identified as Satendra and Bhanu who belong to Chapra under the jurisdiction of Dhanari police station in Sambhal. On Tuesday evening, the girl reached the Behjoi police station with her mother and lodged a complaint. Behjoi SHO Ravindra Pratap Singh took the girl to the crime spot as part of the investigation. The case has been assigned to circle officer Ashok Kumar Singh. When contacted, additional SP Alok Jaiswal said, “We have registered an FIR under IPC sections 376d (gang rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) along with the SC/ST Act. A medical examination has been conducted and the girl's statement will be recorded before a magistrate." "The main accused, Pramod, has been arrested while the other two will be nabbed soon,” Jaiswal added. On May 31, an 18-year-old Dalit girl who went for a ride on her scooty with her two school friends was allegedly dragged from her two-wheeler, assaulted and gang-raped by six men in Bhagwanpur Dhimri village of Bareilly district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dalit-girl-19-confined-gang-raped-by-three-men-in-up/articleshow/83379806.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In the interim claim petition jointly filed by Dharmarajan, Sunil Naik and Shamjeer demanding that the amount recovered by police so far should be returned to them. Shamjeer is the owner of the car and Naik claimed that he had given Rs 25 lakh which was looted. However, the magistrate returned the petition citing that the complainants have to file separate applications, as the relief sought by them are different. Dharmarajan’s claim was that he had lost Rs 3.5 crore in the attack, while Shamjeer demanded that the car, seized by police after the looting incident, be returned to him, and Naik is pleading for the return of Rs 25 lakh he had given. The petitioners submitted that the police had reportedly recovered Rs 1.40 crore and some gold ornaments bought using a portion of the looted money. They are demanding that the money be returned to them. Dharmarajan is claiming that the money looted from the car belonged to him and Naik, and was meant for business purposes. Dinesh R Shenoy, the counsel for the petitioners, said the technical issues will be resolved and three separate petitions will be filed on behalf of Dharmarajan, Naik and Shamjeer on Thursday. Meanwhile, sources said the special investigating team (SIT) probing the highway heist case said that there are divergences in the submissions made by Dharmarajan before them and the court.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: High court yet again expresses concerns over opening of Char Dham Yatra||NAINITAL: Citing reports that the state government is considering opening of Char Dham Yatra for pilgrims, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday yet again expressed its concerns on the issue, warning that this may lead to spurt in Covid-19 cases in the state. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma also expressed its displeasure over the affidavit filed by tourism secretary, Dilip Jawalkar, and non-compliance of its suggestion to the officer to visit the shrines personally to take stock of the situation as well as non-adherence to the SOPs. The Chief Justice, again, verbally asked Jawalkar to take a chopper and visit the shrines personally. The observations came while the HC was hearing a bunch of petitions dealing with the Covid situation in the state. Though the cases have been listed for further hearing on June 23, the court has directed Jawalkar to be present through virtual hearing on Wednesday and explain the situation. “Due to paucity of time, this court has not had the opportunity to interact with Mr Jawalkar, the learned secretary for tourism. However, as the court is concerned with the possibility of the opening of Char Dham, as being contemplated by the state government, this court directs Mr Dilip Jalwalkar to be present before this court on 16th of June,” the court has said. As reported by TOI earlier, the HC had in its previous hearing also warned the state about the opening of the Char Dham shrines and the possibility of these holy sites turning into breeding ground for Covid. The court had said that Kumbh has already caused enough embarrassment to the state of Uttarakhand and people are now wondering why the state can’t learn from its mistakes. The court, meanwhile, also cited reports of the seers at these shrines protesting and called for a “harmonious relationship” between the Char Dham management and the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-yet-again-expresses-concerns-over-opening-of-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/83379794.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kattakkada assault: Cops may face disciplinary action||Thiruvananthapuram: There is finally some news of hope for the families of four minor boys who were allegedly physically assaulted by Kattakkada police on Sunday. The officers involved in the case are likely to face disciplinary action. According to sources in the police, the inquiry report submitted by Kattakkada DSP has recommended disciplinary action against the officers involved, including the inspector in charge of station house officer and sub-inspector of the station, for the alleged lapses committed in handling the underage boys. The report is being perused by IG (South Zone) Harshita Attaluri before taking a final decision. As per the report, the police officers found the boys when they reached Anchuthenginmood responding to a call from locals who complained that a group of anti-socials were gathered there and they were indulging in substance abuse. However, there was an error of judgement from the part of the officers while dealing with the boys. They failed to realize that they were minor boys and used force when the boys resisted their attempts to take them to the police station. Later, they were released without any charges being slapped on them.The alleged incident took place on Sunday afternoon. By evening, the boys complained of pain and uneasiness after reaching their respective homes. It was then they revealed that some police officers thrashed them using a cable. Meanwhile, the families are concerned by the delay in registering FIRs based on separate complaints filed by the parents of the four boys. The opposition party members in the locality too are unhappy over the slow police proceedings. They have even informed the police that they would even break the lockdown protocols and launch strong protests if the cases are not registered soon. Speaking to TOI, Rural SP P K Madhu said in such cases police would register a case only after a thorough preliminary inquiry. ‘’It is common that conflicts arise while police officers discharge their duties. In this particular incident too, the officers confronted the boys as part of discharging their duty,” the SP said. “Any further action would depend on IG’s decision ,” he said. Child Rights Commission chairman K V Manoj Kumar and Kattakkada MLA visited the students and promised swift action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kattakkada-assault-cops-may-face-disciplinary-action/articleshow/83381876.cms||---

With such a low manpower, it is impossible to do business as it will create a lot of problems. The state government should have discussed with industrialists before taking the decision,” president of the association Viking A C Eswaran said. “More than half of the workers have already left for their native places. Those who are staying at industries’ hostels want us to send them back to their native places or provide them work at least for a few hours a day. If we allow them to return to their native places, they might not come back. If we resume the business, we will face labour shortages, which will add to our burden. Already, industries are reeling under severe labour shortage,” Eswaran said. “To hold back the workers and to resume business operations in a smooth manner, we request the CM to allow us resume work with 50% workforce from Tuesday.” Meanwhile, Coimbatore south MLA Vanathi Srinivasan met Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar and submitted a memorandum on behalf of industrial associations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/allow-us-to-resume-production-with-50-workers-industries-urge-cm/articleshow/83381849.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Official opens up on bearing burden of death||Thiruvananthapuram: Crematorium officials and workers encounter nightmarish moments constantly and one expects them to be hardened by deaths. But the fact is they are never really prepared for what they see. Santhikavadom charge officer, Shaji MS and his team, on Tuesday brought the body of a three-day-old baby which was lying unwanted at the medical college hospital for cremation and the experience moved him so deeply that Shaji recounted it in his Facebook post. “For the past one year, we have been receiving and cremating bodies of so many people who died of Covid. Even if no relatives are around, we would do whatever we could to bid them an honorable farewell. But receiving the body of a three-day-old baby (who was apparently unwanted) was emotionally stressful for us,” Shaji said in his post. “We thought the least we could do was to keep the ashes, we hope someone would come for it,” he said. “The baby was born prematurely and we understand the father had demanded a post-mortem. After that the parents didn’t receive the body and it had to be kept at the mortuary,” said a corporation official. Shaji’s team had to deal with the cremation and transportation of two other babies on the same day. The team got a call from the mayor’s office saying that a couple couldn’t afford money to transport their baby’s body to Varkala from the Medical College. The team transported the body in a corporation ambulance along with the parents. “For the last few months, I have been receiving calls mostly related to deaths. So, in a way I was emotionally hardened when I took charge at Santhikavadom. I had thought death wouldn’t scare me anymore having handled around 250 bodies in the last one year. But Tuesday, I lost my sleep after receiving the baby’s body. Death really hurts. There was another small coffin waiting at Santhikavadom. I saw two parents the same day; one who wouldn’t take their baby home and left it in the mortuary and another couple who wept all the way home with their baby’s body,” Shaji said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/official-opens-up-on-bearing-burden-of-death/articleshow/83381935.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid vaccination drive should be like a surgical strike: Bombay HC to Centre||MUMBAI: The Centre’s approach in vaccinating people agai-nst Covid-19 should be like a “su-rgical strike”, the Bombay high court observed on Wednesday. In its 12-page order, a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said, “If one has to combat Covid-19 treating the situation to be war-like, the ‘near-to-home’ vaccination policy takes the war against the enemy to the borders but falls clearly short of a ‘surgical strike’ on the virus which is the need of the hour and could have been possible by administering vaccines to the bedridden. The policy, though formulated by experts, does appear to have a chink in the armoury to combat the enemy.” The bench said the central government’s ‘near-to-home’ vaccination scheme was like waiting for the virus carrier to come to the inoculation centres. “You are standing at the borders waiting for the virus carrier to come to you. You are not entering the enemy territory...the decision, if you had taken earlier, would have saved many more lives,” it said. “The policy of arranging for vaccination of citizens who can reach the centres, but making no provision for bedridden citizens has an element of discrimination laced on it.” The HC’s observations were while hearing a PIL by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari seeking a door-to-door vaccination of those above 75 years of age, and differently abled and bedridden people. “You have to find out how Kerala has been handling it,” the bench told additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh, who represented the Centre, after Kapadia cited how the Kerala government was conducting doorstep vaccination. The HC bench remarked: “... If there are no AEFI (adverse effects following immunization) …why should it not be for other states also to do it.” Referring to an additional municipal commissioner’s quote in a newspaper about having sought Centre’s permission to give doorstep jabs, the HC asked senior counsel Anil Sakhare, representing the BMC, whether it was true. Sakhare said the BMC’s affidavit doesn’t mention any such permission being sought. “We have been saying BMC is a model for others,” said the HC, expressing dismay that it was not willing to start a door-to-door vaccination drive without Centre’s nod. Kapadia said, “J&K is an excellent example, they have given doses to leprosy patients by going on two-wheelers too... why can’t it be done in Mumb-ai?” Looking at the compilation she submitted, the HC remarked on door-to-door jabs in Kerala, Jammu, Bihar and Odisha and even in parts of Maharashtra, including Vasai-Virar. The CJ asked the state and BMC if it is being done in “South, East, North, why not in the West?” The ASG said the Centre is soon coming out with an amended uniform policy on vaccination for the entire country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-vaccination-drive-should-be-like-a-surgical-strike-bombay-hc-to-centre/articleshow/83383523.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||Pune||Plant had huge stock of sanitizer, inflammable chemicals: Cops to court||(Slug: Pirangut Fire Tragedy) Strap: Court orders custodial remand of arrested partner till June 13 Pune: The prosecution told a magisterial court on Wednesday that the Pune rural police wanted to investigate the safety measures expected to be taken in the wake of a huge stock of sanitizer and inflammable chemicals at the SVS Aqua Technologies plant at Urawade near Pirangut — the site of Monday’s fire tragedy. Haveli’s sub-divisional police officer Saee Bhore-Patil and her team produced the company’s arrested partner, Nikunj Shah (39), before judicial magistrate first class S B Ganapa and moved a report through prosecutor Nilesh Ladkat, seeking Shah’s custodial remand for 14 days. The court later ordered Shah’s remand in police custody till June 13. The prosecution submitted that the police wanted to investigate the company about the various permissions it did or did not take from the government and regulatory authorities related to production and commencement of business, storage and handling of inflammable chemicals, fire brigade’s NOC, source of procurement and the quantum of raw material, production capacity allowed and other relevant aspects. Besides, the police also want to arrest two more suspects booked in the case. The remand report stated that the company went ahead with production and business between 2016 and 2020 despite not having any permissions from the state agencies concerned. The police wanted to investigate this. Also, the police wanted to establish if the company had necessary permission for storage of sanitizer, it added. Lawyers Harshad Nimbalkar and Shivam Nimbalkar, representing Shah, argued that the police erred in applying the culpable homicide charge under Section 304-II of the IPC in the case as irrespective of the enormity of the loss, it was at best a case of negligence. They cited a couple of Supreme Court judgments, including the one in the Union Carbide case, and submitted that prior knowledge about the action was critical to attribute the culpable homicide charge in such matters. They submitted that their client had been with the police ever since the incident and has cooperated with them by sharing all the relevant documents and also did the same with the expert panel that gave a preliminary report to the district collector related to the fire tragedy. As such, Shah’s custodial interrogation was not required, they said. The lawyers argued that the company had a provisional fire permission issued in February this year. (INSET) Relatives’ wait for bodies continues The Sassoon General Hospital authorities on Wednesday told the relatives of the 17 victims that the bodies would be handed over to them on Thursday. Chandrakant Debhe, a relative of one of the deceased women, told TOI, “The hospital authorities informed us that the DNA tests and further legal procedures would be completed on Thursday and then the bodies would be given to us. This was after they had called us today (Wednesday) morning and we waited since 10am. We requested them to expedite the process.” A Pune rural police officer said, “From our end, the legal procedures are complete. We are waiting for DNA test reports, which will establish the identity of the deceased.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plant-had-huge-stock-of-sanitizer-inflammable-chemicals-cops-to-court/articleshow/83381969.cms||Vishwas Kothari

A “monsoon depression” is due to form on June 12. The city may receive 50mm rain over the next 48 hours but the showers will slow down subsequently even as the depression forms. The depression will hit Odisha more than Bengal, said weathermen. The civic authorities have decided to keep heavy duty pumps ready to drain out storm water from flooded streets, if necessary. “Most of our pumps are in workable condition and will be pressed into service if there is a heavy downpour,” said a KMC sewerage and drainage department official. KMC deploys sewer cleaning machine for clogged manholes in inundation-prone areasAccording to the official, around 377 pumps in 74 drainage pumping stations are ready to function. This apart, the civic body may need to take the help of a gang that will be engaged to clean the clogged manholes so that the storm water recedes fast from the inundated areas. Submersible pumps will be used to flush out water in low-lying areas. Special attention is being given to large areas located along the Tolly’s Nullah. “We have an evacuation plan for the residents staying close to Tolly’s Nullah, if it rains heavily, and the possibility of high tide over the next few days,” said a civic official. A letter has reached the municipal commissioner’s office on Monday from the state disaster management department, asking him to take all preparations in view of the IMD forecast of rain and high tide. The monsoon wave hasn’t made any progress in the eastern region, though it has advanced over Arabian Sea. The rain will continue, though it may lose intensity from June 12. “We will have intermittent showers that may not be moderate or heavy. It will keep the temperature down,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director, GK Das. He added that early monsoon rain in Kolkata is referred to as “summer monsoon” since precipitation is inconsistent and often scanty during the early part of the season in the city. “June is often dry in Kolkata and there have been occasions when the mercury has shot past 35°C after the onset of monsoon. July is usually the wettest of the monsoon months in Kolkata,” said Das. This May has been the wettest in Kolkata in at least a decade, rainier than even May 2020 when Amphan had lashed the city with a devastating effect. The city received 390. 3 mm rain last month — 212% above the normal mark of 124 mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/monsoon-knocks-on-kol-doors-kmc-gets-ready/articleshow/83382016.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Kedarnath to get a facelift at Rs 54.6 crore||DEHRADUN: In a cabinet meeting on Wednesday (June 8), the Kedarnath development plan was approved and it was decided that eight buildings of the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN) will be demolished to construct a hospital, a guest house, and a police station near the revered shrine. A budget of Rs 54.62 crore has been approved for the same. “Among the eight buildings to be demolished, four have five rooms each. These are currently being used by the district administration. The remaining four buildings have huge hall-like rooms. All these buildings will be demolished at a cost of about Rs 77 lakh. The construction work of new buildings will be done at a cost of about Rs 54.62 crore,” said Dilip Jawalkar, secretary (tourism). The hospital to be built near the temple will be equipped with the latest technology and various facilities. Along with this, a guest house, a police station and a command and control centre will also be built in Kedarnath. Meanwhile, the Public Works Department (PWD) has been entrusted with the responsibility of disposing of the debris that will be generated from construction work. An amount of Rs 33.25 lakh has been allocated for the task. The cabinet also approved the construction of a museum in the shrine. “An open museum is to be built in the Kedarnath temple where ancient idols will be kept.

With the firm not charging schools to access classes, thousands of budget schools, especially in remote areas, have decided to extend the same to parents. Another 4,000 schools, however, said that as they have to recruit teachers to clear doubts and monitor classes, and said that while they will not be able to provide free education, they are open to give fee concession on a case-to-case basis. “Last year, 12 schools in our mandal came together and tried to conduct online classes, but we were not successful. This year, we want to give virtual classes to our students at any cost,” said Ch Sreedhar, correspondent, Sri Chaitanya Public School, Mugilpete, Jagtial district. Sreedhar said that he is open to give virtual classes to all the 300 students in his schools for free or at a minimum cost so that they will continue attending school in the coming years. TRSMA said that last year lakhs of students, especially from nursery to class 7, were away from virtual classrooms due to the lack of facilities and devices. While TRSMA tied up with a firm named Ekalavya last year to provide online classes, this year they are tying up with Practically, an official announcement about the tie-up will be made on Thursday. “Services of both these firms will be available to TRSMA schools this year,” added Rao. In the state, there are about 8,000 budget schools and about 20 lakh students are studying in these schools. The TRSMA members said that they will also be conducting a drive to ensure that even government school students get benefited from this tie-up by extending access to online classes through the app via private budget schools’ login to students of state-run schools as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/states-budget-schools-mull-free-education-till-class-10/articleshow/83383526.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Social responsibility service’ to replace ‘bond’ for doctors||MUMBAI: The one-year compulsory government service that medical students serve as part of curriculum will now be called ‘social responsibility service’. As ‘bond service’ implies duty has been imposed on doctors, the state decided to replace the term in official documents. Since students studying in government colleges pay heavily subsidised fees and expenses are borne by government, using taxpayers’ money, the one-year bond service should be seen as social responsibility, said a letter by Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) to medical colleges. Colleges were told to make changes in bond letters signed by students during admissions to undergraduate, postgraduate, and super-specialty courses. DMER also directed colleges to counsel students on the role of doctors in society right from the first year of the programme and also why honouring the bond is a way to show commitment towards the profession. Dr T P Lahane, director, DMER, said the word ‘bonded’ gives a negative connotation. “Doctors working in the pandemic should treat it as their social responsibility. They are getting educated at government colleges with public money and the one-year service after education should be seen as pay-back to society,” said Lahane. The letter mentioned how several students graduating from government and civic colleges do not honour bonds, despite a written declaration. Social responsibility service will be mandatory, and government will initiate action against students failing to fulfil it, it added. Dr Anant Bhan, a bio-ethics researcher and health activist, said changing nomenclature was a good move. “But the change will be cosmetic if the state government does not respond to valid concerns from students. There is a need to include a training component in MBBS curriculum on how to function effectively at public health centres (PHCs). Working in a rural PHC is a different ballgame than studying in a tertiary medical college. There are concerns over living conditions and salaries. Those should be addressed to get more students to willingly opt for it,” said Bhan, adding that there should have been a feedback mechanism to run the programme successfully. The bond was a legal word used to represent the arrangement between students and government and it soon became the purpose of the arrangement, said Amrut Bang, program director at NGO NIRMAN, which nurtures youth for social contribution and 50% volunteers are medical students. “It is their social responsibility and doctors have to honour it in its spirit and practice. Serving at PHCs is their first chance to work as independent health professionals and is not at odds with their own learning and growth curve.” said Bang. He added that the change should not be symbolic, and government should play its part in making the process seamless and transparent for young doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-social-responsibility-service-to-replace-bond-for-doctors/articleshow/83385038.cms||Yogita Rao

Family members of the girl slammed police for its “callousness” and held a protest when they came to take away the body for post-mortem examination, saying that had they acted on the first complaint the girl would not have taken such an extreme step. “This was not the first time I had approached the police. The youths had been harassing my daughter for quite some time and I had approached Pallavpuram police station with a written complaint earlier too. But they did not bother, they didn’t act,” the mother said. According to sources, the girl was again waylaid by the four youths on Tuesday while she was returning home. She somehow managed to escape from their clutches, reached home and narrated the incident. Upset by the continuous harassment, the girl’s mother immediately left home and reached the police station to file another complaint. But she failed to gauge her daughter’s mental state. There was no one at home when the girl hung herself. “We were not at home when our mother left for the police station. We had no idea that our sister would take such a drastic step,” said one of her siblings. Superintendent of police (city) Vineet Bhatnagar has ordered a probe into the matter. “An inquiry has been set up in the case. Once we get a written complaint, we will file an FIR in the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/upset-by-continuous-harassment-up-girl-16-kills-herself-when-mom-was-in-thana-to-file-complaint/articleshow/83379997.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Notorious gangster Dharmender Kirthal arrested from Dehradun||MEERUT: Special Task Force (STF) of Uttar Pradesh Police have arrested a notorious criminal after over six months of chase from Dehradun where the 50-year-old man, who has at least 53 criminal cases registered against him, was hiding for quite some time. Dharmender Kirthal, 50, who was on bail, went missing six months ago after another murder case was filed against him in Baghpat. A reward of Rs 50,000 was also announced on any information leading to his arrest. Just two month ago, Baghpat police had seized his property in his native Kirthal village. In a statement, STF said, “Noida unit of STF, on the basis of a tip-off, arrested Dharmender Kirthal from Sahastradhara Road in Dehradun on Tuesday. His associate Subhash Singh who also carried a reward of Rs 50,000 was also arrested.” “Kirthal has been sent to Baghpat jail,” said Abhishek Singh, superintendent of police (SP) Baghpat. According to police sources, Kirthal took a plunge into the world of crime after his entire family was killed by his political rivalry in 2004. During questioning, he had narrated his story to the STF sleuths. After he became pradhan of Kirthal village, a rivalry had ensued with his opponents, Narender Chauhan and Surender Chauhan-- both brothers. Surender was married to the sister of Neetu Kail-- leader of a gang in Muzaffarnagar. On August 20, 2004, Chauhan brothers, with the help of Neetu gang, allegedly attacked the Kirthal’s family. While Kirthal was not at home, the gang killed his father, uncle, brother, nine-month pregnant sister-in-law and even their pet dog. Just his mother and wife had survived. Sources said that Kirthal picked up arms after the attack. He was arrested in 2006 for the first time and remained incarcerated until 2011. But the killing spree continued even then. He came out in 2011 but after allegedly killing a village rival he again surrendered in the court in 2013 and stayed there for another year. For the most part of decade, Kirthal remained in Bulandshahr jail. At present, he has 53 cases registered against him and the Gangster Act was also slapped against him twice. In August 2014, he returned home on bail after staying away for more than a decade. A combined panchayat of five villages welcomed him. With practically no opposition left to challenge his power, both his mother Suresh Devi and wife Sudesh Devi won the 2015 panchayat elections. During an earlier interaction with TOI, Kirthal had said, “I don’t remember … I lost count after a while. But more than 20 people were killed in his battle after the massacre of my family took place. What could I do? I was left with little choice. They were baying for my blood.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/notorious-gangster-dharmender-kirthal-arrested-from-dehradun/articleshow/83379994.cms||Sandeep Rai

The BJP MLA and minister in the UP government said, "These moneylenders charge 10%-15% interest per month from debtors and even end up harassing their daughters and wives." Agarwal cited the tragic incident in Shahjahanpur where a young couple along with two minor children had killed themselves, levelling harassment charges against a moneylender in a suicide note. Sources said there are several such unauthorised moneylenders who lend money to street vendors, small shop owners, rickshaw pullers at a high interest. A city moneylender, on condition of anonymity, said, "We give money instantly. No bank in the world will lend you as we do." Mashkoor, a city resident who runs a small workshop and owes money from a local moneylender, said, "I had taken Rs 1 lakh from a moneylender. He had fixed 15% interest. Now, I have to return over Rs 2 lakh during a certain period of time." Sources added that this illegal business is rampant in Muzaffarnagar district, particularly in places like Rampuri, Ramlila Tilla, Khalapar and Kidwainagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mnagar-mla-wants-dm-ssp-to-conduct-discreet-operation-against-moneylenders/articleshow/83379992.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||India||Covid vaccine: Rs 150 cap may not apply to off-site camps by private hospitals||NEW DELHI: Even as many private hospitals have raised concerns that the service charge for vaccination capped at Rs 150 may not be adequate for them to organise sessions outside of hospital, the ceiling may not apply to off-site camps, a government official said. “Organisation of camps is not covered in Rs 150,” a senior official told TOI. While most hospitals are ready to vaccinate people within the existing set-up, they say the ceiling may not be adequate for organising ‘near to home’ off-site camps planned by them, including those with corporates, in residential housing societies or even drive-in vaccinations. Private hospitals urged both the Centre and respective state governments to bring clarity on the issue to enable them to dedicate resources in the direction. “These are extraordinary circumstances and need extraordinary steps. While for hospitals, it should not be a matter of profitability, they would also not pay from their pocket. For vaccination within the hospital, Rs 150 as service charge should meet the costs. However, there are overhead costs for organising offsite sessions,” says Commander Navneet Bali, Regional Director, Northern India, Narayana Health. The hospital has waived off service charges for vaccination within as well as at off-site camps. Most private hospitals were so far charging a service charge ranging between Rs 200-600 within hospital premises and for those sessions organised outside of hospitals, they had suggested even over Rs 1000 as service charge. “The price cap is fine for vaccination at hospital but we have to organise camps or sessions outside of hospital that would require more manpower, resources and other overheads. Expansion of sites will be feasible only if some leeway is given at least for off-site sessions,” says Dr Charu Dutt Arora, Covid Care Expert at Sarvodaya Hospital and Research Centre. Based on the price to private hospitals declared by vaccine manufacturers, the government has notified that private hospitals will charge Rs 780 for ashot of Covishield, Rs 1,410 for Covaxin and Rs 1,145 for Sputnik V. These include taxes as well as Rs 150 as service charge. A total of 42,274 sites conducted Covid-19 vaccination on Wednesday till 10:30pm. However, only 1778 were in the private sector, rest were organised by government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-vaccine-rs-150-cap-may-not-apply-to-off-site-camps-by-private-hospitals/articleshow/83387419.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Delhi||Young at heart, Delhi needs education & job opportunities||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s population in 2041 is likely to cross 29 million based on growth assumptions across various parameters. While Economic Survey of Delhi 2019-20 shows that 30.3% of the population is between 15-30 years, making Delhi one of the cities in the world with a very high young population, in future it’s poised to see a significant increase in the proportion of persons of working age (25-60 years), indicating the need to create adequate employment opportunities. Data on Delhi’s demographic profile, population projections and development needs in the draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 indicates an increase in the proportion of persons in the age-group of 60 years and above. This signals the need for specific provisions for the elderly in the master plan. Close to 30% of Delhi’s population comprises of children and young people in the 0-18 age-group, indicating the need for Delhi to become a more child-friendly city. Delhi’s story as a melting pot that is home to migrants from across the country makes its presence felt in the introductory chapter of the draft master plan. It underlines the critical influence of this section in the way the city has evolved over the decades, starting with the surge of migrants who made Delhi their home after Partition. It is highlighted that the previous master plan had estimated that 50% of the increase in population of Delhi would be due to migration. Migration is estimated to contribute 41% of the population increase during the present plan period, highlighting the need for introducing new housing types that cater to the needs of different income groups and tenure requirements. Delhi is categorised as a multi-cultural, cosmopolitan city with second largest in-migration in the country. Census 2011 recorded nearly 2.26 million migrants who had been residing in Delhi for a duration of 0-9 years. However, over the last decade (2001-11), the total migration into Delhi has reduced. This has happened because of the evolution of National Capital Region. The Economic Survey Report (2018-19) states that substantial migration was happening from neighbouring states. The development of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat, Noida and Ghaziabad and employment promotion programmes run by respective state governments have contributed to the reduction in migration to Delhi. However, the absolute number of migrants is still quite high. According to the Census (1951-61), the decadal growth rate was 52.44%. The first time it dipped below 50% was in 1991-2001 when it came down to 47.03% and further dropped to 21.20% in 2001-11. It is estimated that the growth rate has dropped in the last two decades both in terms of natural growth and migration. However, in absolute numbers, NCT of Delhi accounts for about 1.39% of India’s population and is one of the most populous cities in the world. With a high literacy rate (86.2%), Delhi also has a large educated workforce with about 1.1 million people in the 15-59 age-group (2011). The draft report therefore highlights the importance of the need for opportunities and spaces for education, skilling and employment for the youth as an imperative for talent retention and to create a skilled workforce for the city and the country. More than 97% of the population was urban in 2011 as compared to 53% in 1901. At present, most people reside and work largely in the central, eastern, southern and northern parts of the city. In the plan period 2021-41, the western and northern peripheries of the city are slated for large-scale development. Gender dynamics and safety concerns are crucial to any planning exercise. While the share of population of women in the working age in Delhi has increased over the last decade, the female labour participation rate is just 14.3%, five times lower than the male workforce. “The city has to focus on facilitating more women to join the workforce by providing safe and gender-friendly streets, public spaces and workplaces with adequate childcare facilities. It can be expected that financially independent women becoming a norm in Delhi may help improve the sex ratio, albeit indirectly,” says the draft master plan document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/young-at-heart-city-needs-education-job-opportunities/articleshow/83382170.cms||Ambika Pandit

The agency, pressed into service by KMDA to pull the structure down, marked out a 115m stretch between Nawab Lane and Posta Crossing to cordon it off with barricades. Over the next two days, the area will be secured for the dismantling work to commence. Nylon nets will also be strung up around the demolition zone to ensure any debris does not fly off and hurt someone. The two days will also be used by traffic police to streamline the movement of trucks to the trading hub at Posta. The KMDA and cops have decided to split the first phase of the four-phase demolition drive into three sub-phases so that multiple street intersections are not hampered at one go. Once the work on the Posta-Crossing and Nawab Lane is over, the Old Mint stretch may be taken up next. The KMDA engineers and cops said the pre-demolition work will be important to ensure the safety of locals and motorists in the area. The agency will be using advanced equipment like diamond cutters, heavy duty lifting machines, trestles and earth movers to carry out the dismantling work without compromising safety, said a KMDA official. Meanwhile, work on other bridges, undertaken by PWD and KMDA across the city, is also nearing completion before the end of the enhanced restriction period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pre-demolition-work-starts-at-posta/articleshow/83382105.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In order to boost immunity among kids during monsoon season, which is their most vulnerable period of the year, paediatricians have recommended flu shots for children to minimise influenza and other respiratory cases. “There are multiple vaccines that can keep seasonal diseases such as flu, dengue, and pneumonia at bay during this period,” said Dr K Ramkrishna, consultant paediatric intensivist, Rainbow Hospitals, Banjara Hills. Even as the wait for Covid vaccination for children continues, paediatricians suggest that although flu shots may not directly have any impact on Covid-19, it may help differentiate symptoms. “There are many parents who are now coming forward to administer flu shots to their children in the age group of two to eight years. Several Covid-19 and flu symptoms are much the same. Once flu shots are administered, one can rule out influenza and focus on other symptoms that may implicate Covid-19,” said Dr Altaf Naseem, senior consultant, Neo-Candy Children’s Hospital, Tolichowki. Even Indian Academy of Paediatricians has recommended flu shots for all children as it will prevent onslaught of flu cases which could further increase load on infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-docs-recommend-flu-shots-for-kids/articleshow/83383561.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Committee favours exam in varsities, to submit report today||JAIPUR: The committee formed to analyse the situation for conducting examination of universities and affiliated colleges in the state has completed their work and will submit its report on Thursday. The five-member committee consisting of the various vice-chancellor of the state and senior educational officials said that majority of them are of the opinion that exams should be conducted even if the dates are moved further. A member of the committee anonymously told TOI that most people are in support of conducting the examination of all the years. “For final year students, examination is a necessity, but even for first- and second-year students we think that examination must be conducted although we can shift the dates further. The issue is that without conducting the examination, future of these students will be at stake,” said a member anonymously. The problem in evaluating students without examinations is faced in universities where the semester system is not being introduced. In universities and colleges with semester system, internal marking in the entire year with various tests can be helpful to evaluate students. But in majority of institutions where more than 14 lakh students are studying, have just final examinations and to universalize a formula for everyone is a difficult task. There were several complaints in the past, when every university chart out its own formula of evaluating students where many students claimed it to be unfair. The members will finally submit their report to the government on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/committee-favours-exam-in-varsities-to-submit-report-today/articleshow/83383556.cms||---

In an order issued on Wednesday, the forest department decided to continue to keep two prominent tiger reserves, Ranthambore and Sariska, closed for tourism after the NTCA recently wrote to chief wildlife warden (CWLW). Stakeholders associated with tiger reserves claimed that the state government should take cue from Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra and proactively support the industry. A wildlife expert said, “On Wednesday, Maharashtra requested to open the safaris. The parks were reopened in MP and no cases surfaced. People do not go close to tigers during safaris and transfer the virus. The tourists should be allowed to enter after following appropriate protocol.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tiger-reserves-need-to-open-stakeholders/articleshow/83383562.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: High court concern over opening of Char Dham yatra, says could trigger Covid spurt||NAINITAL: Citing reports that the state government is considering opening of Char Dham Yatra for pilgrims, the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Wednesday yet again expressed its concerns on the issue, warning that this may lead to spurt in Covid-19 cases in the state. The bench of Chief Justice (CJ) R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma also expressed its displeasure over the affidavit filed by tourism secretary, Dilip Jawalkar, and non-compliance of its suggestion to the officer to visit the shrines personally to take stock of the situation as well as non-adherence to the SOPs. The CJ, again, verbally asked Jawalkar to take a chopper and visit the shrines personally. The observations came while the HC was hearing a bunch of petitions dealing with the Covid situation in the state. Though the cases have been listed for further hearing on June 23, the court has directed Jawalkar to be present through virtual hearing on Wednesday next and explain the situation. “Due to paucity of time, this court has not had the opportunity to interact with Mr. Jawalkar, the learned secretary for tourism. However, as the court is concerned with the possibility of the opening of Char Dham, as being contemplated by the state government, this court directs Mr. Dilip Jalwalkar to be present before this court on 16th of June,” the court said. As reported by TOI earlier, the HC had in its previous hearing also warned the state about the opening of the Char Dham shrines and the possibility of these holy sites turning into breeding ground for Covid. The court had said that Kumbh has already caused enough embarrassment to the state of Uttarakhand and people are now wondering why the state can’t learn from its mistakes. The court, meanwhile, also cited reports of seers at these shrines protesting and called for a “harmonious relationship” between the Char Dham management and the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-concern-over-opening-of-char-dham-yatra-says-could-trigger-covid-spurt/articleshow/83380061.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Hyderabad||Monsoon to cover Telangana today, Hyderabad to get evening showers||HYDERABAD: The southwest monsoon, the lifeline for millions of farmers, made its official entry in Telangana and is set to cover the entire state on Thursday, marking the commencement of a four-month-long rainy season. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, the onset of monsoon over Telangana began around June 5, marking an early onset by almost a week. Last year, the onset of monsoon began on June 11 and covered the entire state by the next day. This year, it took almost a week for the monsoon to cover the state. With the advancement of the northern limit of monsoon further towards Arabian sea, conditions are becoming favourable for complete coverage of the south-west monsoon into remaining parts of the state by Thursday. “The northern limits of monsoon extends up to Bhadrachalam and is likely to advance further. Complete coverage of monsoon is likely to occur by June 10, as remaining parts of the state are yet to be covered,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad. Following the onset of southwest monsoon, Hyderabad city is likely to receive light to moderate rains at isolated places during evening or night hours over the next few days. Due to the cloud overcast, the maximum temperature dropped by a sharp six degree Celsius on Wednesday to 31 degree Celsius and the humidity levels rose up to 60%. According to the IMD, an upper air cyclonic circulation lays over the east central and adjoining north east Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, a low pressure area is likely to form over north Bay of Bengal on June 11. “The low pressure area will become more marked by June 12 resulting in heavy to very heavy rainfall in many districts of Telangana. Red warning has been issued for district Komaram Bheem, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Peddapalli, Mulugu, Bhadadri Kothagudem as they are expected to witness extremely heavy rainfall on June 12 and June 13,” said Naga Ratna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monsoon-to-cover-t-today-city-to-get-evening-showers/articleshow/83383568.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Amid crisis, Centre allocates more mucor drugs for Rajasthan||JAIPUR: With the state reeling under the shortage of liposomal amphotericin B injection, an investigational drug for the treatment of black fungus or mucormycosis, the Centre made an additional allocation of 17,120 vials of the drug on Wednesday. The allocation includes 13,500 vials from Mylan Pharmaceuticals, 2,120 vials from Bharat Serum, 1,000 from Sun Pharma and 500 vials from Lyka Labs. The Centre had made an additional allocation of 13,350 vials of liposomal amphothericin B injection for Rajasthan last week. The state received around 14,350 vials of the drug last week. According to data received from RMSCL, 2,520 black fungus patients are under treatment and 213 patients have been cured. While there have been 110 deaths due to the fungal infection, 45 patients have left against medical advice (LAMA). Considering the number of black fungus patients under treatment (2,520), the state would require 1.5 lakh vials of a substitute for liposomal amphotericin B injections. “Now, only 9,000 vials of the drug is available with us. We are managing with that,” said an official. “There is a huge shortage of liposomal amphothericin B injection in the state. The distribution of the drug to the private hospitals is also controlled by the government. The state receives just 20-25% of the required quantity of the drug per day. Moreover, the drug is not available in the market for trade. But, with the state having its control over distribution, it has put a check on black-marketing,” said another official. The state government had also placed a purchase order for 20,000 posaconazole tablets and injections — a substitute for liposomal amphotericin B injection and 10,000 lipid amphotericin injections as an alternative arrangement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/amid-crisis-centre-allocates-more-mucor-drugs-for-raj/articleshow/83383566.cms||---

The girl was suffering from insomnia, lethargy and had frequent vomiting as a result of her condition. The girl’s father, Pulluri Kishan of Kamareddy district’s Bhawanipet, had consulted several local doctors before bringing her to a private hospital in the city. Upon diagnosis, doctors discovered that the girl had a tumour. She was examined and put on treatment but while undergoing treatment for cancer, she also tested positive for Covid-19. “The tumour had reached a part of the brain called the insula — the part responsible for control on arm and leg movements. It occupied about 30% of the brain and required complex surgery for removal. While removing the tumour from affected area, we had to make sure the good side didn’t experience a stroke or we could have lost the child,” said Dr Manas Panigrahi, senior consultant neurosurgeon at KIMS Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-give-4-yr-old-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/83383569.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||High court asks Uttarakhand to explore ‘door to door’ Covid vaccination in hill areas||NAINITAL: The population in the state’s hilly regions is “unevenly distributed” and “highly dispersed”, the Uttarakhand high court observed, asking the state government to explore the possibility of initiating door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination in those remote areas. “The state government should consider the possibility of creating a system which will permit a nurse accompanied by an ASHA worker and a home guard to go door to door and inoculate eligible persons in each village,” the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar said on Wednesday. The bench was hearing a bunch of petitions concerning the Covid-19 situation in the state. Till Thursday evening, Uttarakhand had administered about 31 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses. Hill districts are yet to catch up. Within the state, the hill district of Rudraprayag had administered just about 99,000 doses. Champawat had administered about 1 lakh, Bageshwar 1.1 lakh, Pithoragarh 1.4 lakh, Uttarkashi 1.5 lakh and Chamoli 1.6 lakh. Dehradun, on the other hand, has given 6.6 lakh doses and Haridwar 4.3 lakh. The high court also took cognizance of a letter highlighting the plight of the Van Rawat community in trying to get vaccinated and issued a notice to the state government, asking it to explain what steps are being taken to address this. The bench asked the government counsel to make sure the person in charge of the tribal welfare department is present in court “to explain what is being done for the inoculation of the most vulnerable groups and people living in the most remote parts of the state.” The high court then asked health secretary Amit Negi about the vaccination status of the Nepalese workers in the state who do not have identity proof. Negi told the court the state has written to the Centre “seeking guidance” but is yet to receive a response. The judges also asked Negi about the efficacy of vaccines against new variants. “Will the vaccines make us immune to other variants?” the Chief Justice asked. Cautioning the state about the third wave of Covid-19, the bench asked the state to prepare a plan as soon as the high-powered committees and the committee headed by the director-general (health) make their recommendations. “The government must implement the said recommendations in letter and spirit,” the court said. The state has also been asked to cap private hospital fees for Covid treatment, see that death audits are accompanied by death certificates because deaths caused by Covid-19 might be attributed to other causes, audit functioning of life-saving equipment across district hospitals and ensure steady supply of drugs against black fungus. The case has been listed for hearing on June 23 and the government response has been sought by June 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-asks-ukhand-to-explore-door-to-door-covid-vaccination-in-hill-areas/articleshow/83380067.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Pune||Unrest over western ring road land measurement||Pune: The government’s move to go ahead with its exercise to measure land to be acquired for the 69km proposed western ring road project triggered unrest among villagers at Ranje and its surrounding areas along the Khed Shivapur-Kondhanpur road in Bhor taluka, about 30km from the city, on Wednesday morning. A heavy police deployment and the presence of senior revenue and police officers at various spots along the road ensured that there was no untoward fallout like protest or violence during the measurement exercise. “We had deployed adequate manpower to see that the situation remained under control and the exercise was carried out without any hitch,” Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI. A large number of police and government vehicles was seen around the village The villagers opposing the land acquisition on various grounds said they would protest at an appropriate time. “Most of us (villagers) were asleep when the police and the state vehicles moved in early morning. and spread out in different parts before we could stage any protest,” said Mahesh Jayekar, sarpanch of village Ranje that has a population 1,300 people and 250-odd homes. “We have already submitted our written objections, as the government is acquiring 60 acre of fertile land in the village. Our farmers are dependent on this land. We have urged the officials to go for the land on the southern side, across the Shivganga river that flows through the village,” he said. Sandeep Patil, executive engineer of the Maharashtra state road development corporation (MSRDC), told TOI, “A 2km stretch of the proposed ring road will pass through Ranje. We measured 21 hectare (52 acre) land and the measurement of properties and trees will be done in the next two days. Changing road alignment is difficult, as the proposed ring road needs to be suitable for the vehicles to maintain the 120kmph speed limit.” The MSRDC will implement the project. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh told TOI, “Our sub-divisional officers and the MSRDC officials have been conducting meetings with farmers and villagers for the last few months to explain the finer details of the project. Our effort is to acquire land in a smooth and transparent manner. The farmers need not worry about the rate of acquisition or the compensation to be offered. It would be finalised in a proper manner. For now, land measurement is being done in a scientific manner.” Tehsildar and land acquisition officer Rajendra Jadhav said, “We have so far served three notices to the farmers in the last six months and conducted counselling sessions. We will continue with our counseling sessions.” Local farmer Ashish Konde said, “My brothers and I woke up to notice policemen moving around. We don’t want to part with our five acre land for the project, as we survive on it by growing paddy, vegetables and other fruits that are supplied to Pune market. We will protest against this acquisition and will request the authorities to acquire ‘gayran’ (grazing) land, instead of our irrigated land. One of us attempted to protest against the measurement but the police took him into a nearby police van and released him after the work was over.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/unrest-over-western-ring-road-land-measurement/articleshow/83382198.cms||Gitesh Shelke

He was appointed as the CEO of T-Hub in January 2019. The Telangana government and T-Hub have started scouting for his replacement and an announcement is expected to be made by September 2021, when he is expected to depart. “T-Hub has transitioned from being just an incubator to an ‘Innovation Ecosystem’ enabler and is now striving to build a future-ready innovation ecosystem. As I plan to transition out, I am looking for a worthy successor to lead T-Hub for this next phase,” Narayan said in a statement. While T-Hub did not mention the reason for Narayan's stepping down from the key post, a senior government official said it was due to family reasons. Telangana IT and industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan credited Narayan with a number of successful initiatives, both in T Hub and Telangana State Innovation Council (TSIC). “Re-jig is one example which helped nascent startups during difficult pandemic times,” he said, adding that Narayan also played an instrumental role in promoting social and rural innovations, and designing innovation programmes focused on assistive technologies. During Narayan’s tenure, Telangana stood fourth in the innovative states ranking by NITI Aayog.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Red flags up in Mussoorie as Centre plans 3-km tunnel through ‘fragile’ hill town||DEHRADUN: The Centre has announced its plan to build a nearly 3-km-long tunnel at a cost of Rs 700 crore to “decongest” the hill town of Mussoorie. Forest officials, scientists, and environmentalists, however, flagged concerns about what it could do to the fragile geography of the region — they say they were not consulted, a large part of the hill town is landslide-prone, and the water system across the country could be affected by the disturbance to the Mussoorie Ridge. “For easier and congestion free connectivity to Mussoorie town, Mall Road, and LBSSNA (IAS ACADEMY), Project Management Consultancy has been awarded for 2.74km long Mussoorie Tunnel which is being with a budget of 700 Cr on NH 707A. #PragatiKaHighway,” Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari tweeted on Tuesday. TOI has learnt the ministry’s Mussoorie “bypass” will be built below the main town and will connect Cart Mackenzie Road to a point right before Kempty Falls. “It will decongest Mussoorie for tourists. Movement of people from Chakrata and Jaunsar Bawar region, who often face traffic jams, will improve,” a MoRTH official said. “The connectivity will extend till Yamunotri. Movement will be hassle-free and tourists will get to explore more hill towns beyond Mussoorie.” But neither forest officials nor scientists from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) have been in the loop for the project which, a forest official said, would entail the loss of 3,000 maple, oak and deodar trees. Mussoorie divisional forest officer Kahkashan Naseem said, “We have not been consulted yet.” Kalachand Sain, director of WIHG, said the same: “I have no idea about the proposed tunnel. We were not consulted.” Scientists at WIHG told TOI any construction in and near Mussoorie must be done after a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment. “About 40% of the town is highly vulnerable to landslides,” Dr Vikram Gupta, senior scientist at WIHG, told TOI. The reason is that a large part of the town sits on “highly fractured Krol limestone”, with many areas “exhibiting slopes of more than 60°.” An IFS officer said, “Unplanned development activities exacerbate that. There was a reason limestone quarrying in Mussoorie was banned in 1983.” Should the project go ahead, the officer added, “It would be the end of Mussoorie.” The locals, too, are worried. “Have they estimated the carrying capacity of such a small hill town? Without scientific assessment, how can they touch such a geomorphologically sensitive zone?” asked Dr. Aanchal Sharma, who has launched a campaign against the plan. And just because the tunnel will pass below the town is no reason it might be safer, veteran travel writers Hugh and Colleen Gantzer, who have made Mussoorie their home, said. “Major earthquakes start many kilometers below that depth (at which the tunnel will be constructed),” they told TOI. The project, environmentalists said, could also end up disrupting water systems. Reenu Paul, a Dehradun-based environmentalist, said, “The Mussoorie Ridge is a natural divide between the Ganga and Yamuna river systems. Touching the dolomite rocks in the ridge would cut off (or dry up) the aquifers (water-bearing rocks) and disturb the water system of the entire country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/red-flags-up-in-mussoorie-as-centre-plans-3-km-tunnel-through-fragile-hill-town/articleshow/83380074.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Second wave more fatal for Covid positive pregnant women than first||JAIPUR: As many as 34 Covid positive pregnant women died at mahila chikitsalaya in the second wave as most of them reached the hospital late with complications having oxygen levels below 70%. In the first wave, six such patients had died in the same hospital. At the mahila hospital, approximately 70 near-miss cases have been reported. In the second wave, more cases of intrauterine fetal death among severely Covid affected pregnant women were reported and more cases of terminating of pregnancies and pre-term deliveries have also happened. Gynecologists said Covid positive pregnant women who came to the hospital early had more chances of recovery. “If Covid is diagnosed early, chances of complications in mother and her yet-to-be-born baby are few and in such cases no surgery like abortions are required. But in pregnant women with severe symptoms, fetal outcome is poor,” said Dr CP Dadhich, director, obstetrics and gynecology at a private hospital. City’s gynecologists have found that since the second wave is highly infectious and virulent compared to the first, pregnant women bore the brunt of it. “In the second wave, pregnant and peripartum women have experienced more severe illness of Covid than the first wave. There have been at least 10 times more ICU admissions and mechanical vaccination requirements than in the first wave. During the second wave, most of the affected pregnancies are in second trimester or early third trimester, whereas in first wave, these were mostly in 3rd trimester,” said Dr Shalini Rathore, incharge Covid at government-run Mahila Chikitsalaya. According to the doctors, patients who came in late have prolonged recovery time and some of these hospitalised patients also manifested with miocarditis and acute renal failure, which was a rarity during the first wave among admitted patients. “Patients first have mild symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhoea and then breathlessness. They come only when there is breathlessness. Therefore, pregnant women must consult with their doctors when they get fever. Any fever unless proved otherwise is Covid. They have to come when they have fever because when there is breathlessness, ARDS sets in and oxygen saturation falls rapidly and it is difficult to save patients or their recovery time is prolonged with multiple complications such as septicaemia, pneumothorax, myocarditis, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and thromboembolism,” said Dr Rathore. Due to fear of Covid, a lot of pregnant women do not go to hospitals for regular checkups. “Though patients are reluctant in visiting hospitals in the current situation, it is still advisable that patients should overcome their fears and visit hospitals for antenatal checkups. If they avoid their visit for a longer time, then there are chances of missing important check-ups and investigations of themselves and the baby,”said Dr Arti Mahla, consultant obstetrics and gynechology at a private hospital. Dr Mahla said patients are more worried about fetal outcome in Covid infection as there are more chances of fetal hypoxia, premature delivery and even intrauterine fetal death in case of decreased oxygen saturation and pneumonitis cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2nd-wave-more-fatal-for-covid-ve-pregnant-women-than-1st/articleshow/83383578.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, cooperative minister Balasaheb Patil, agriculture minister Dadasaheb Bhuse and minister of state for cooperation Vishwajeet Kadam on Wednesday called on NCP president Sharad Pawar to discuss the proposed legislation. “We will draft a new legislation and protect the interest of farmers. The bill will be introduced during the ensuing monsoon session of the state legislature,” Thorat said. Thorat said the discussion revolved around the Centre’s three farmer legislations, the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act and crop insurance schemes. “It appears that the NDA government is acting against the interest of farmers. There are several flaws in the legislation pertaining to farmers. In the new act, there is absolutely no protection for farmers,” he said. Bhuse said the crop insurance scheme largely benefited the insurance companies. “A total of Rs 5,500 crore was deposited. While the farmers received only Rs 800 crore, insurance companies received Rs 5,000 crore. It appears entire scheme has been drafted for the insurance companies,” he said. Bhuse said the state government will bring in a law to put a ceiling on profits of the insurance firms. Kadam said he was in touch with the heads of the urban cooperative banks on the banking amendment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mantris-meet-pawar-on-state-alternative-to-farmer-laws/articleshow/83385226.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

"The initial probe has revealed that the syndicate, run by a group of Chinese scamsters, cheated almost 5 lakh people to the tune of over Rs 350 crore through a 'quick-earning' app Power Bank that was being run in the garb of an online multi-level marketing campaign," said Uttarakhand director general of Police (DGP) Ashok Kumar. As reported by TOI, a team of the STF had on June 7 arrested Pawan Kumar Pandey, one of the directors in a shell company used by primary investors--believed to be from China--for taking money from Indian nationals and then routing it to foreign countries before converting it to cryptocurrency. The app 'Power Bank', which was available on Google Play store until May 12, offered, through different schemes, lucrative returns on investment with claims of doubling the investment. “Till date, we have received 25 complaints of fraud through the app from across the state,” said Ajay Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP), STF. Uttarakhand Police officials said that after receiving a complaint from a person based in Haridwar, they registered the first FIR in the online scam on May 18. Delhi police's cyber cell registered the first FIR in the matter on May 29, followed by Bengaluru police on June 1, they added. “We are seeking help from CBI, IB and ED in the investigation and also planning to contact Chinese embassy regarding the matter,” DGP Kumar said. Notably, the cyber cell of Delhi Police also busted a similar scam worth Rs 150 crore run by Chinese nationals on Wednesday and arrested 11 people, including a Tibetan woman. Bengaluru police, on a complaint filed against 13 companies by payment gateway Razorpay, have arrested six persons in connection with a similar scam worth Rs 120 crore which was being carried out through the Power Bank app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/almost-5l-indians-fell-prey-to-online-scam-through-which-rs-350cr-swiped-by-chinese-syndicate-claims-ukhand-police/articleshow/83380080.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||Hubs around Metro stations get a big push in Delhi master plan||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority’s transit-oriented development (TOD) policy, which focuses on high-density, mixed-use development around transit nodes such as Metro stations, was approved in 2019. The development control norms of TOD have now become part of the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041. The TOD policy promotes development of compact, walkable, mixed-use developments within influence zones of transit stations, which could be Delhi Metro station or an upcoming Regional Rapid Transit System one. It aims at improving public transit ridership, reducing vehicular congestion and greenhouse emissions and pollution in the long term. “TOD is also an important strategy for unlocking the latent economic potential and land values in the city,” MPD 41 states, adding that it will facilitate development and regeneration of select areas through planned intensification of uses and activities, infusion of new infrastructure and improvement in public realm. This will also allow Delhi to capitalise on the large-scale investments made for public transit infrastructure. DDA intends to implement the policy strategically in select TOD nodes with high development potential. “This will enable the creation of well-planned growth centres, developed as per sustainability principles, capable of developing into future economic drivers and cultural hubs for the city,” the draft says, adding all transit-oriented development will be designed to ensure denser street networks, better public areas and active public frontages to ensure safer, walkable, cycling-friendly and vibrant areas throughout Delhi. The high FAR and mixed-use that will be allowed will ensure creation of more dwelling units, including those for the economically weaker sections. The projects are planned to provide highest priority to pedestrians and non-motorised traffic, through various strategies such as traffic management plans, street improvements, creation of a network of pedestrian and non-motorised traffic routes, and restricted and high-priced public parking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hubs-around-metro-stations-get-a-big-push-in-master-plan/articleshow/83382202.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The maximum temperature in Shivajinagar on Wednesday dropped to 25.8°C, exactly 8.5 degrees below normal, and the minimum temperature was a close 23.2°C. Lohegaon recorded a day temperature of 25.3°C (7.7 degrees below normal) and a minimum of 23.2°C (2.2 degrees above normal). The city’s overcast skies had 8 okta clouds throughout Wednesday, in the run-up to the wet spell. India Meteorological Department has forecast moderate to heavy rain in isolated places in Pune city on June 13, 14 and 15. The city’s temperature dipped significantly with rain and monsoon onset over the past few days. The maximum temperature has been pleasant, around 30°C, on most days since the monsoon onset. It dropped below 30°C on Wednesday. The maximum temperature at all the three locations — Shivajinagar, Lohegaon and Pashan — has been below normal in the last few days, with a significant negative departure of 3-4°C before Wednesday, when the departures increased further. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, told TOI, “Shivajinagar, Pashan and Lohegaon had near-overcast skies all of Wednesday, with 7-8 okta clouds. There could be slight/marginal increase in the day temperature on Thursday, but the trend will remain more or less the same next few days because of the upcoming wet spell, with maximum temperature around 25-26°C and minimum around 22-23°C.” Kashyapi said Pune city had a light rain forecast for Thursday, but from June 11, rain here could increase to light to moderate. “On June 12, the city has a moderate rain forecast, which could be heavy at isolated places in Pune’s ghat areas. Moderate to heavy rain is expected at isolated places in the city from June 13 to 15. Ghats may witness isolated heavy to very heavy rain on June 13, scattered heavy rain on June 14 and isolated very heavy rain on June 15,” he said. He said an upper air cyclonic circulation over east-central and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal might become a low-pressure area by around June 11. “The offshore trough over north Maharashtra to north Kerala is redeveloping, while another upper air cyclonic circulation exists over east-central to north Arabian Sea. There is another trough from south Gujarat to Odisha. All these systems are like to make monsoon vigorous over Konkan-Goa, ghats of Madhya Maharashtra (including Pune district) and adjoining Vidarbha soon,” said Kashyapi. Strong westerlies and packed isobars over the Arabian Sea would aid in this process, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cloudy-skies-bring-day-night-tempereature-difference-down-to-2-6c/articleshow/83382217.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Land pooling to usher in greater private role||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) envisages more active private participation in the development and housing sector and the land pooling policy, which is now part of its draft Master Plan for Delhi-2041, plays an important part in this major paradigm shift. The draft MPD-2041 lays down the development control norms for land pooling, which promotes affordable rental and reserves 25% of the net residential FAR for small-format housing. As per the document, low density residential plots would also see more low- density residential dwelling units, retirement homes, assisted living for elderly and those with special needs, etc., come up. Although the development control norms for land pooling are now part of the draft MPD, DDA had on February 5, 2019 launched a web-enabled, single-window portal for inviting registration for participation in the policy. Despite DDA’s best efforts, the policy has not yet taken off in the way it was planned. The land pooling policy has been made with the plan that the private sector will play an active role in assembling land and developing physical and social infrastructure. Owners or groups of owners will pool land parcels for development as per prescribed norms and guidelines, making them partners in the development process. For integrated planning of a sector, the land required for development of roads, utilities, greens and other infrastructure shall be made available to DDA and service providing agencies as per approved plans. “Such areas are envisaged to be world class, ‘smart’ and sustainable neighbourhoods, sectors and zones, planned and executed as per the availability of water, power and other infrastructure,” the document states. Vertical mixing of identified land uses shall be allowed within plots and buildings to enable mix-use in building typologies and hubs, to create innovative green layouts and facilitate the provision of adequate public facilities, the document states. Non-manufacturing industries like service industry (IT, ITES, BPO and others), packaging and logistics, and non-polluting MSME units can be combined with public spaces and commerce. Also, schools can only be combined with residential use premises and other educational institutions can be combined with clean industries. All projects within land pooling areas have to be environmentally sustainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/land-pooling-to-usher-in-greater-private-role/articleshow/83382238.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Bus services have, however, not been shut,” an MSRTC official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-rain-delays-trains-buses-to-pune/articleshow/83382230.cms||Joy Sengupta

If a person tests positive, she/he faces discrimination at certain levels,” says D Naresh, a student with OU’s department of journalism and communication. Accommodation, food for patients is free of cost at the isolation centreWith the permission of the district collector, the student started the isolation centre where patients accommodation and food are taken care of free of cost. The 10-bed facility is visited regularly by doctors from the local primary healthcare centre and Asha workers. “My father and I had tested positive. Naresh not only helped us get tested but also helped us get treatment at the isolation centre. Doctors regularly visited and checked our health status,” said 48-year-old Sangi Ganesh, one of the patients who was recently discharged from the isolation centre. Many residents of the village don not have access to sanitised lavatories and in many cases, there is also no separate room in their habitations for isolation. “There is also this fear among people over visiting hospitals during a pandemic. They fear their condition may worsen if they get admitted to a hospital which is around six kilometres away from the village,” says Naresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ou-student-sets-up-isolation-centre-for-village/articleshow/83383429.cms||Preeti Biswas

Judge Aarti Vyas also ordered the convict Virsinh alias Kallu Sikarwar who had repeatedly raped the girl repeatedly by threatening to thrash her parents in 2018. Sikarwar, who lived in Kanaj village near Olpad town of Surat district, is a native village in Madhya Pradesh. “The court convicted the accused based on statements of the survivor and scientific evidence. Involvement of the convict was proved in DNA profiling of the foetus that was aborted,” said Nayan Sukhadwala, district government pleader, Surat. Sikarwar had developed friendship with the girl in 2018 and started raping her claiming that her father had borrowed money from him. Later he went to stay in his village in MP and called the girl to meet him in Gwalior. He took her to his native village Panchampura in MP and forced her to stay with him. He also promised to marry her. Following a complaint lodged by the girl’s family, Jahangirpura police traced them and arrested Sikarwar. The minor was two months pregnant when found. The court allowed her to undergo abortion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mp-man-gets-20-yrs-in-jail-for-raping-surat-girl/articleshow/83379110.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Only 10 health staff per 10,000 in Telangana: Niti Ayog report||HYDERABAD: Telangana has only 10 health staff available for every 10,000 people in the state — among the lowest in the country — as per data from the recently released Niti Ayog report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) rankings. According to it, the state stands at the third spot from the bottom, only ahead of Jharkhand (with four staff for every 10,000) and Nagaland (one for every 10,000) in this crucial parameter of the third SDG goal, which pertains to good health and well-being. The revelation comes at a time when experts are hinting at the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19. While Telangana is positioned as a ‘front-runner’ in its overall achievement of the goal, the poor health staff ratio has pulled the state down to the 17th spot, the report shows. Other south Indian states, in comparison, are much ahead. While the figure in Andhra Pradesh stands at 95 (no of health staff for every 10,000 population), Kerala has 115, Karnataka has 70 Tamil Nadu has 65. Professor Subodh Kathamuthan, centre director for health management, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), attributes this to Telangana’s excessive focus on tertiary care management over the past decade. “This has helped the state in tackling the Covid-19 situation in urban pockets. But along with setting up institutes, it is extremely important to manage staff availability at the primary health care level too so that crises in rural areas can be handled effectively.” The other parameters under the third SDG include maternal mortality ratio, under 5 mortality rate (children between 9 and 11 months), HIV incidence per 1,000 uninfected population, death rate due to road accidents, institutional deliveries among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-10-health-staff-per-10k-in-t-niti-report/articleshow/83382736.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Mumbai||BEST driver holds umbrella in wet lease bus, video goes viral||MUMBAI: A video of a bus driver holding an umbrella in one hand while driving with the other went viral on Wednesday morning as the city experienced heavy downpour. Sources said the driver belonged to a wet lease bus. Wet lease buses are hired from private contractors along with drivers. The contractor is also responsible for the fuel as well as maintenance of these buses. The driver of this bus was in khaki uniform. “It was a midi AC bus which was being driven from Backbay depot and was meant to ferry passengers in south Mumbai. There was rain water leaking from the bus roof at two places (as seen in the viral video) and one of them was exactly over the head of the driver,” said an official. The video shows water leaking from the roof near the exit door while the person filming the incident then focuses on the driver who is finding it difficult to drive while holding an umbrella. Viral video: BEST driver in Mumbai holds umbrella in wet lease busWhen contacted, BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade said the video clip has been sent to the depot manager of Backbay and the department has started a probe into the matter. BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya alleged the video clip was proof of the “sorry state of affairs” in the undertaking. “This is uncalled for. If it is a wet lease bus, it should be new and in a good condition. The video proves what I have been saying in the past at committee meetings. Some of these wet lease buses are not brand new. They are slightly older buses which are re-registered as new buses,” he alleged. Ganacharya plans to take up the issue at the next panel meeting. A senior BEST official said wet lease buses were normally in a very good condition and passengers have given good feedback too. “We will inquire about this particular bus and what went wrong,” he said. Ganacharya said every bus in the 3,300-plus fleet should be checked to ensure each is in good working condition without any leakage that could inconvenience the passengers as well as the drivers and the conductors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-driver-holds-umbrella-in-wet-lease-bus-video-goes-viral/articleshow/83378914.cms||Somit Sen

In a statement on Wednesday, TRPS founder-president and former MLC S Ramulu Naik brought to the notice of the governor non-availability of sufficient number of specialist doctors, nurses and other supporting staff. The nonfunctioning of some of the medical equipment at the hospital has become a curse to the patients, especially tribals who mostly use this facility. There is a shortage of beds and isolation wards. Stating that earlier too he had written a letter to the governor on the issue, Ramulu Naik sought the intervention of Tamilisai Soundararajan to improve the facilities at RIMS. “Owners of private ambulances are exploiting the tribals due to non-availability of government ambulances. There is a shortage of oxygen supplies too. Totally, the situation needs urgent focus of the government in RIMS as poor tribals have been left to their fate,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tribal-body-requests-guv-to-visit-rims/articleshow/83383024.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mulund society flooded with 2-feet water as ‘nullah was diverted’||MUMBAI: Mulund’s Lok Rachana society was flooded with two feet of water during Wednesday’s downpour as a nullah was allegedly diverted by a private builder next to it. The BMC had to step into action by bringing in an excavator to demolish a wall, allegedly constructed by the developer, to allow the water to flow out. “There was major flooding at Lok Rachana Society in Mulund due to faulty approvals given by the BMC’s storm water drain (SWD) department to the adjoining under-construction project. All adjustment approvals given by the BMC are getting exposed just like in the fire at Bhandup’s Sunrise Hospital. A disaster was averted due to timely action by assistant municipal commissioner Kishor Gandhi of T Ward,” said Mihir Kotecha, BJP MLA from Mulund. Gandhi said, “The builder had diverted the original drain. A sump (pit) and a bund were created to change the course of the drain. The water started overflowing into Lok Rachana society. The SWD department had given some permissions for diversion of the nullah. We have neutralised the diversion for now and have called for a meeting to see what went wrong.” BMC officials said due to diversion of the nullah, the entire society was flooded and the water level had risen up to two feet. Ashish Saxena, secretary of Lok Rachana Federation, too, said there was two feet of water in the compound. “We did not have any electricity the entire day and the elevators were shut since there was water in the elevator ducts. People could not move. There are 76 flats in the building. Water had reached the staircase and the level kept rising. The BMC had issued notices to the builder to demolish the bund and sump but that was not done. The nullah was diverted just months ago, which led to flooding in our society.” Kotecha said, “If the builder violated permissions, then an FIR must be filed. Had the BMC not demolished the wall, the building would have been inundated, posing a major risk of a short-circuit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mulund-soc-flooded-with-2-ft-water-as-nullah-was-diverted/articleshow/83379232.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Hyderabad||‘Covaxin Phase-4 trials to check real-world effectiveness’||HYDERABAD: Bharat Biotech will be conducting Phase-4 clinical trials of indigenous vaccine Covaxin to check its real-world effectiveness and will also apply for full licensure after data from final analysis of Phase-3 studies is available in July, it said on Wednesday. The company said the phase-4 trials are also being done to “ensure its vaccine met every rigorous scientific standard for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization (EUA)”. Covaxin had received EUA in early January while Phase-3 trials were underway, resulting in a controversy. “It is important to note, the inoculation, which began in mid-January and with several million doses administered, will have credible and sizeable data soon. It is critical to understand and further emphasise the Phase-3 data will first be submitted to Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), followed by peer reviewed journals...and Phase-3 results full trial data will be made public during July,” it said. “Covaxin is the only vaccine to have conducted and completed one of the largest ever Phase-3 efficacy trials in India, most other Covid-19 vaccines have only conducted immunogenicity studies and not efficacy studies in the Indian population,” it added. Bharat Biotech’s statements come in the wake of a Twitter spat between Bharat Biotech’s business development and advocacy head Raches Ella and Kolkata-based endocrinologist Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh over the latter’s study comparing immune responses of Covaxin and Covishield. The exchange saw Singh and other Twitterati demand that Covaxin Phase-3 trials data be made public. Explaining the reasons for the time being taken to make the data public, he said the Covaxin Phase-3 trial was the largest efficacy trial conducted in the developing world with a sample size of 25,800, with the last volunteer being vaccinated in mid-March. Bharat Biotech also slammed the Singh-led comparative study as flawed. “This is not a peer reviewed publication, nor statistically and scientifically designed study, the study design and conduct reflect an ad hoc analysis, rather than a predetermined hypothesis,” it said. Covaxin showed an overall interim efficacy of 78% and 100% efficacy against hospitalisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-phase-4-trials-to-check-real-world-effectiveness/articleshow/83382874.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

As per the bulletin released by the medical and health department on Wednesday, GHMC’s case tally of 179 new Covid-19 cases was surpassed by Khammam district which reported 180 cases. While Khammam’s daily case numbers exceed that of Hyderabad’s by only one case, the trend is being seen as a significant one by the authorities. In view of the continuing rise in cases, the government has decided to continue lockdown restrictions in several assembly segments of the district without relaxation, even after June 10. Khammam, along with Warangal district, had witnessed civic body polls but the number of cases is yet to come down in the former. Overall, the state reported 1,813 new cases of Covid-19 and 17 deaths as on Wednesday, taking the cumulative case load and death toll to 5,96,813 and 3,426 respectively.

---||Jaipur||Acute crisis of hoopers in Jaipur adds to trash trouble||JAIPUR: Ward councillors have blamed shortage of garbage collection vehicles (hooper) as the reason for degrading sanitation situation of Jaipur. They said despite repeated requests, the number of vehicles has not been increased. According to officials, every ward in the city must have five hoopers but most have two. According to the garbage collection company, around 600 hoopers are functioning in the city, but councillors said these numbers are not enough to cover every household. Ward 9 councillor of, JMC-Heritage Rajat Bishnoi said that the world heritage site has become the world garbage site. “I think every ward needs five hoopers to perfectly cover all the houses. These hoopers have no fixed timings and don’t go in every household for collection which gives rise to garbage depots,” said Bishnoi. JMC-Heritage ward 8 councillor Mahendra Pahadiya said his area has many slums that can be covered only with hand-pulled carts and cycle-rickshaws. Despite demanding it many times, the issue was never resolved. Ward 73 councillor Amar Gurjar said three vehicles and three men on each vehicle can resolve garbage depot and garbage collection complaints of his ward. JMC-Heritage recently signed a new contract with the garbage collection company asking them to increase the vehicles, but until the problem related to payments was resolved, no further decision will be taken. Omkar Sapre, project head of garbage collection company, said hoopers are allotted in the city according to 2011 population, but councilors demand according to 2021 population. “We have no problem in increasing the number of hoopers but then our payment should be made on time and as per 2021 population. When you demand quality of work, where will payment come from as we have not been able to pay our employees for four months,” said Sapre. In JMC-Greater as well, the situation is not good. Ward 45 councillor Santosh Chaudhary has the biggest ward in the city. “With 35,000 population, I require around five hoopers, but two have been provided which are not able to cover the entire area. I get around 10 complaints daily and sometimes these hoopers don’t play music and have no fixed timings,” said Chaudhary. Ward 89 councillor Giriraj Sharma and ward 141 councillor Abhishek Saini expressed similar concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acute-crisis-of-hoopers-in-city-adds-to-trash-trouble/articleshow/83383586.cms||---

The report stated that the security personnel of the commissioner said that assault took place on June 4. Home guard Ram Singh in his statement said, “At a meeting called to discuss BVG firm sanitation work, I along with a gunman and another employee Mukesh Sharma accompanied the commissioner to the mayor’s office. We were stopped at the glass door by the mayor’s security. After a while, we realized someone was trying to open the door from inside as it was pushed back and froth. We heard commissioner’s voice and entered inside where the councillors were stopping him from coming outside.”The statement of the guard appointed at the mayor’s office also hinted that the councillors blocked the commissioner’s way. A source said, “The mayor’s guard, Mohan Singh, said the commissioner was livid after his way was blocked. It means the councillors had obstructed his way.” The report also stated that Gurjar remained a mute spectator while councillors Ajay Singh, Paras Jain and Shankar Sharma manhandled the commissioner. Deputy director (regional), local bodies, Renu Khandelwal who spearheaded the probe issued notices to 20 people including corporation staff, officials, councillors and mayor.

TOI in a report published on June 1 had highlighted agonies of the family along with families of other healthcare workers fighting for compensation which should have been given to them without any delay. The deceased, identified as Dr Mahendra Pal, was posted at a Covid hospital in Moradabad and succumbed to the virus on September 2. Moradabad chief medical officer had forwarded a compensation application, but the insurance company rejected it, stating that he had turned Covid negative before his death. His family members had been fighting for 10 months for compensation. Both the state and the Central government had promised to give monetary support to the kin of healthcare workers who lost their lives due to Covid. Dr Pal is survived by his 37-year-old wife Anita Rani and three children, the eldest being seven-year-old. “Life has been difficult without my husband. He was the only earning member. After his death I stayed at my inlaws’ house in Moradabad and then shifted to my father’s house in Budaun. I had to stay at my brother’s place for some time as I did not have any house of my own,” said Anita. The young widow, who has done BEd course and a diploma in computers, is currently a housewife, tending to children from the marriage of nine years. “She hopes to get a job in the NHM department on compensatory grounds as her late husband, too, had worked there,” said her father Jagan Singh. President, National Child Health Programme Employees Union, Dr Anand Singh said, “It was a long fight. But finally the needy family got the compensation.

Of them, about 200 to 400 have been affected with Covid-19 so far while 200 archakas and purohits have succumbed to the virus. “Yet, the state government has still not chalked out plans to administer the Covid-19 vaccine to priests, even as most government departments are organising special camps and drives for their staff,” said C S Rangarajan, convener of of the Temple Protection Movement and head priest of Chilkur Balaji temple.

But there was no need to take him to the police station. The on-duty cop should have noted his address and taken the fine later. I have transferred Patel and ordered an inquiry against him to find out if he had assaulted the boy,” said Shamsher Singh, police commissioner.  On Tuesday, the teenager Ritham Patel’s car was stopped near Polo Ground as he wasn’t wearing a mask. Ritham said that when he pointed out that two cops sitting in the police control room van nearby were also not wearing face masks, he was allegedly beaten by the policemen including Patel. He was taken to the police station and allowed to leave after his uncle paid the fine. Ritham later got admitted to SSG Hospital as he felt uneasy.  Patel is the same cop who had allegedly assaulted former Vadodara MP, Satyajit Gaekwad over face mask issue near Polo Ground last year. An argument ensued between Gaekwad and Patel as the cops didn’t have challan book. Patel then allegedly assaulted Gaekwad.

A cop even disguised himself as a labourer to keep an eye on the suspected building. Lucknow police had assisted in ground surveillance. The victim, Preeti Shukla, was abducted while on an evening stroll outside her apartment in Sushant Golf City, where she stays with her husband Anurag, also a lawyer, and their 15-year-old son. The captor was identified as Santosh Chaubey. Nine of his accomplices are at large. ADG STF Amitabh Yash said that the woman was recoveredin Mohanlalganj from a two-storey building. “Chaubey hails from Ghazipur and was preparing for competitive examination. So far, his motive appears to be money only,” said Yash. His interrogation is underway. Around 7.20pm on Sunday, 47-year-old Preeti was walking when a group of five men pulled her into a car, gagged her and pushed her into a sack. They took her to a rented house in Mohanlalganj where she was kept, said deputy SP STF Deepak Singh. In the meantime, Anurag kept looking for her. A little later, someone called him from Preeti’s number, saying that she was safe but Rs 1 crore would have to be given at a stipulated place for her release. Anurag then informed police and a friend of his got in touch with STF. “On the directions of ADG STF, we started a probe. We first engaged the captors to lower payment demand. Simultaneously, we traced them through surveillance. The captors often called at odd hours and sent a video in which Preeti was seen with her eyes covered saying she was safe,” added Singh. “Posing as workers of the electricity department, we conducted a recce and zeroed in on the building where the woman was held. A cop posed as a labourer and kept an eye. In the meantime, Anurag was asked to make a payment of Rs 25 lakh. We added trackers in the cash bag to record a video of the accused and give us a GPS location,” said Singh. Police and STF then placed cops atop three buildings. Using night-vision cameras, they checked for activity in surrounding buildings. Infrared sensors were used to trace the location of the woman who was spotted through a window lying on a cot with her hands and legs tied. The accused said that the gang had targeted the family because he was aware they were planning to buy a house and were in possession of a large amount of cash. A Kafkaesque nightmare:His mother’s kidnapping was a “Kafkaesque” nightmare for the family, said 15-year-old Arya. “It was for the first time since the birth of Arya that we were separated as a family,” said Anurag Shukla. “We were shocked at the incident,” he added. “I had firm faith that my father would get back my mother. I also believed that she would return,” he told TOI. “She was not given food to eat or water to drink for 48 hours in this humid weather. Her hands were tied, she was packed in a sack and her eyes were taped. They were so inhumane and cruel,” he added. Anurag added that even he did not touch water until Preeti was traced by the cops. “My son and I stayed awake for 48 hours while we got immense support from DCP south Khyati Garg, who kept hope alive in us,” he added.

Khachariyawas said, “Half of the BJP is supporting Sheel Dhabhai and half are standing united with Gurjar. They are fighting among themselves and BJP should confirm who are they supporting and then took to street for protest. This is dual policy of the party.” Meanwhile, Rajasthan Gurjar Samaj, Jaipur, organised a press conference and said that suspending Gurjar from the post is government’s way of targeting a woman of Gurjar community. They said that in the entire state, crimes against Gurjar women have increased and the government is being a mute spectator.

---||Delhi||Green and blue... two colours that will shape Delhi’s future||NEW DELHI: The green and blue infrastructure — Delhi’s green belts and waterbodies — will play a key role in shaping its future, the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 envisages, focusing not only on their protection but also on increasing their net area. The draft plan states these assets will help in mitigating climate change and play a key role in reducing air, noise, water and soil pollution. A database will be maintained by the government and Delhi Development Authorty to periodically assess their “health”. To bring people closer to these natural assets, MPD 41 aims to provide public access to a few by developing them as recreational sites consisting of “interactive” zones where temporary activities such as yoga, nature classes, environmental research, picnics, camping and biodiversity tours will be permitted. Buildings will face these green-blue assets and maintain active faces in the form of balconies, windows and pedestrian entries. Cycleways and walkways in and around these sites have also been encouraged. For the Yamuna, a 300-metre-wide green buffer will be required along the edge, with a 30-metre area left for grasses and ground cover, while development of 75-100-metre-wide greenways with cycling and walking trails have been suggested. However, no permanent structure will be allowed in the floodplain. “The health of all environmental assets shall be monitored from time to time,” the draft plan states. Growth in Delhi’s green cover will be carried out by using only native plants and species, which will act as pollution filters, while techniques such as Miyawaki forests and smog absorption towers can be adopted at hotspots. A “tree directory” will also be maintained, with each agency identifying unique tree corridors or heritage trees in its area. Pavements, roads and roofs will be constructed or coated with light-coloured materials, with a high albedo value wherever possible. “This can reduce local temperature by 3-5 degrees Celsius. Road sections shall include appropriate trees and buffers to reduce air and noise pollution, as well as sustainable urban drainage components.” To further reduce air pollution, MPD 41 prescribes adoption of mix-use and transit-oriented development to reduce average trip lengths and bring jobs and homes closer to transit networks. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, says for the first time, new principles of urban planning have been adopted explicitly to control vehicular pollution, which is a good sign. “However, there is still scope and need for further tightening of the action targets for all pollution sources and overall air quality,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-and-blue-two-colours-that-will-shape-delhis-future/articleshow/83382273.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Pune||Old nullah uncovered during pre-monsoon work||Pune: A chamber, built over 20 years ago, and a nullah that had been hidden due to road work for almost three decades were uncovered during the annual pre-monsoon work conducted in Kalyaninagar over the past month. The civic team has taken up maintenance of the drainage system. In 15 days, the team discovered two important drainage systems that had been blocked for several years. The blockages were leading to flooding during the monsoon. Assistance provided by local residents led to the ‘discoveries’. Since May, local corporator Yogesh Mulik had ordered that the drainage system in Kalyaninagar be cleaned and trouble spots be identified. Residents were asked for feedback on spots that have proved dangerous due to flooding in the past few years. Local resident Ajay Bulbule said, “Kalyaninagar has primarily been built on a water body. The chambers, pipelines and nullahs are at least 15-20 years old and constant construction, repair and reconstruction of roads has led to the disappearance of some chambers.” He added that the two important spots found during the pre-monsoon works will help reduce flooding in the area. However, he said that the main nullah flowing from the Palace View Society requires more attention in order to resolve the issue for the long term. Kalyaninagar resident Tejal Joshi said, “This effort might reduce water-logging but the issue will not be resolved. We need bigger underground storm water drains that are accessible so they can be cleaned on regularly.” Local corporator Yogesh Mulik said, “We are now trying to open up the nullah fully so that the flow of water is streamlined. However, further investigation is underway on the outlet to this nullah. In the last few years, many residential complexes have come up in the area, so tracing the route will be a challenge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/old-nullah-uncovered-during-pre-monsoon-work/articleshow/83382291.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

---||Lucknow||Monsoon may hit Lucknow by weekend||LUCKNOW: The city may have an early date with the monsoon — as early as Friday-Saturday, 10 days before the scheduled date of June 20. Pre-monsoon thundershowers are expected on Thursday, followed by light to moderate rainfall on Friday and Saturday, the weather office has predicted. Widespread heavy rains may occur on Sunday, though rainfall activity would decline on Monday and Tuesday. Last year too, the monsoon had arrived five days early in UP, but thereafter lost steam and was delayed in the city by four days. However, Met officials said, this time there are a couple of weather systems that are pushing monsoon currents at a faster pace. “Monsoon is expected to arrive in UP by Friday-Saturday and cover the entire east UP upto Lucknow within a day. It will then expand to west UP, which means the entire state will get monsoon rains by Sunday,” said state Met director JP Gupta. The reason for the rapid advancement is the formation of a trough — a stream of small cyclonic circulations — which is running from over southeast UP to Bay of Bengal across Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal. Extra push will be provided by a low pressure area that is expected to generate over the Bay of Bengal on Friday, he added. Prior and during the onset of monsoon, intense thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds measuring between 30-50 km per hour are expected in east UP. Rainfall can be heavy at isolated places, said the met director. By Tuesday, monsoon had advanced into Maharashtra, some parts of south Gujarat, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, he added. The impact of the changing conditions was visible in the city on Wednesday. Cloudy sky and strong winds kept maximum temperatures four degrees below normal at 35.6 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/monsoon-may-hit-city-by-weekend/articleshow/83383710.cms||---

I have already found admission in the Statistics department of the Texas A&M University in PhD programme. The university authorities have instructed all international students to join latest by August 30,” said a PG fourth-semester student of CU’s Ballygunge Science College campus. She added that requests for exemptions from the foreign university are not being entertained. “They have rather suggested us to defer joining by six months which will delay my doctoral degree,” she added. When around three students from the same department — one who is moving to Illinois and another one starting a program at Rutgers University in New Jersey, tried to reason with CU officials, no assurance was given. “Instead we have been told that the UGC academic calendar will have to be compulsorily followed. This is creating a severe stress on foreign-bound students since we’ve to quarantine ourselves after reaching the campus,” a student rued. Some of the students even pointed out that a few foreign universities have asked the newly admitted students to submit a compensation if they fail to join classes within a stipulated deadline. Some students also said that attending online orientation program while giving final semester examinations is impossible as the time zone is different. CU sources said that the university is open to requesting foreign universities to allow students joining late given the UGC rules can’t be violated. “All efforts will be taken in the matter of publishing the final semester results in order to facilitate those who are taking national and international admission,” said Registrar of Presidency University, Debajyoti Konar. Jadavpur University authorities also confirmed that final semester exams in both UG and PG will be completed by July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/exam-delay-worry-for-foreign-bound-students/articleshow/83382297.cms||Somdatta Basu

The newly-elected body of JHCHBS and its secretary B Ravindranath filed a complaint with Jubilee Hills police against former president of JHCHBS T Ravindranath Choudhary and other executive members of the society in April this year stating that the property (bearing No. 853F) on Road No. 44, Jubilee Hills, ad measuring 1,519 square yards was fraudulently alienated to Ch Sirisha in June 2020 and further alienated within two days to another person which was illegal. Jubilee Hills police inspector S Rajasekhar Reddy submitted his report to the Telangana high court saying that the issue was in the purview of the Registrar of Cooperative Societies and should be resolved by the cooperative body. In his report, the inspector said Sirisha was allotted the property by the JHCHBS in November 1991 and paid fee and development charges. But, the society did not register the property in view of the restrictions imposed by the government that barred the society from transferring or issuing any NOCs to its members without approval of the government. The police report said that apart from the case being civil nature, the high court is also looking into the matter which is pending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-give-clean-chit-to-jubilee-hills-society/articleshow/83383715.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi Mater Plan 2041 : Mobility to switch gears, app-based transport all set to take centre stage||NEW DELHI: Keeping with its overall tenor of making Delhi “future ready”, the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 spots the trend of people shifting towards app-based mobility and plans to change gears from building for transport to managing travel demand. The “Transport and Mobility” section focuses on four key areas — improving connectivity and transport infrastructure, shifting from private to shared mobility, making Delhi walkable and cycle-friendly, and managing parking in Delhi. MPD 41 states that shared mobility offers flexibility and an alternative to owning a car. “Emergence of these shared mobility options complemented by the expansion of the Metro network is gradually changing mobility choices made by commuters from private ownership to shared or public transport-oriented options.” The draft plan also recommends further integration of public transport system at every level to provide a seamless travel experience. This includes institutional and multimodal integration, last-mile connectivity, etc. and systems integration such as bus route rationalisation and intelligent transport systems. While these measures have been initiated by Delhi government, MPD 41 stresses the need to strengthen them. The document also notes e-mobility is gaining momentum in Delhi and recommends that public charging infrastructure for electric vehicles be made available throughout the city at various public places, on-street parking areas and public parking sites. The draft focuses on making Delhi “walkable and cyclable” and recommends safe pedestrian and cycling networks both for short and long distances through barrier-free and continuous non-motorised network of footpaths and cycling tracks. It also states that points of conflict of pedestrians or cyclists with motorised vehicles will be minimised through infrastructure provisions like pedestrian signals, at grade crossing etc. “This is a good MPD because it talks about disincentivising private transport unlike previous MPDs,” said urban mobility expert Anuj Malhotra, adding that active travel routes for pedestrians and greenways will attract more people towards walking. “When the city has a policy, the agencies have to start thinking on those lines.” “This MPD has the right content but how do you operationlise it? World over, the focus is on strategic plan. The proposed Unified Metropolitan Transportation Authority is there, but it will be difficult to create it. But otherwise, it will be a piecemeal approach,” said Amit Bhatt, director of integrated transport at WRI India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mobility-to-switch-gears-app-based-transport-all-set-to-take-centre-stage/articleshow/83382305.cms||Sidharatha Roy

We will see about drinking water arrangements as well.” The district administration also claimed that the deceased child’s grandmother appeared to be mentally unstable. The duo had left their village to see a family member in Roda village on foot on Sunday afternoon. On the way, they felt thirsty due to the scorching heat. They were not carrying water and failed to find any around as the place was uninhabited and later fell unconscious. Some shepherds spotted the two and informed the sarpanch, who informed police. Though both were rushed to the hospital, the grandmother survived while the girl was declared dead. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has written to chief minister Ashok Gehlot as well as the chief secretary and asked the government to take action to prevent such incidents in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/death-of-girl-jalore-admn-sends-report-to-rights-commission/articleshow/83383748.cms||---

Students said that the pandemic had completely disturbed their studies and hardly any classes were held in colleges in the past two months. In such a scenario, they could not write the examination, they said. On Tuesday, the state government had announced to promote all first-year undergraduate and postgraduate students and conduct examination for second- and final year students. “Less than 40% of our syllabus has been covered so far. How can they ask us to prepare six months of syllabus when classes have been held for just a month,” said BA (IIIyear) student of Lucknow University Ayush Shukla. Besides, no practical classes or remedial classes have been held. “Our subject teachers were admitted to hospital after getting infected. A number of them had post-Covid issues. Hence syllabus is incomplete,” he said. “Classes are held by the university but what about affiliated colleges like mine. In the past 60 days, an average of 18 classes have been held in every subject. Offline classes were never held timely in college; forget about online classes,” said BSc (IIyear) student Raj Kumar. “Online classes lasted barely half an hour. The teacher would ask to write answers to five questions and in the next class, they started a new topic,” said BCom (IIIyear) student Ritika Pant. “Our teachers were not teaching us, assuming we would be promoted. Now, they will try to complete sixmonth syllabus in 20 days. What will we learn?” said BCom student Avantika Nigam. She said the government should seek data from colleges on how many teachers have taken online classes in the past three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/syllabus-incomplete-how-can-we-take-exams-students/articleshow/83383750.cms||---

---||Lucknow||West Uttar Pradesh districts fare worst as state reports 354 child marriage cases amid pandemic||LUCKNOW: Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the child rights protection group has been intercepting an average of six incidents of child marriage every week during the last 14 months, with majority of cases reported from west UP districts. Even in one of the most developed districts of the state, Noida, at least 15 cases of child marriage were intercepted. In April and May this year, when the entire state was in the grip of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the child protection group rescued 62 minors, mostly girls, who were being married off by their families. According to the officials of the department of women and child development, a total of 354 teenagers, mostly girls, were rescued across UP between April 1, 2020 and June 1, 2021. The highest number of cases were reported from west UP districts. According to Satya Prakash, the chief operations officer of FXB India Suraksha, which runs child protection campaigns in Noida, 15 cases were detected in the district during the pandemic. “Though Noida is a developed district, child marriage is still a major cause for concern —especially in rural and industrial parts of the district,” he said. Explaining the reasons for the prevalence of child marriages in cities like Noida, Prakash said: “Migrants from Haryana, Bihar, West Bengal and other states reside in Noida. Many have 3-4 children and prefer to marry off their daughters early due to poor financial condition. Sometimes, they find men who do not demand dowry. We have come across cases where parents tried to fix the marriage of minor daughters along with the elder one to save cost. Even if we try to stop them in Noida, they go to their native places and solemnise the marriage” “Some parents suffer from social stigma and fear that their minor daughters may get distracted by social media or may have an affair with someone which may bring shame to the family,” he said. Deputy director, women and child development (UP), Vijendra Niranjan, said: “There has been no decline in cases of child marriage as these are often driven by social pressure. Noida, which is one of the wealthiest districts, recorded the highest number of calls informing about child marriage. Irrespective of the pandemic situation, people in west UP, especially in Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Meerut, believe in early marriage of girls.” “The mindset can be gauged from the fact that this Akshay Tritiya, 15 child marriages were intercepted. In east UP too, we have seen cases of child marriage in Sonbhadra. Over 80% of child marriage victims are girls,” he added. Child marriages are prevalent in other parts of the state too, including the state capital. According to the Lucknow unit of Childline, a total 34 teenage girls were rescued between April 2020 and the first week of June this year. Last week, a 16-year-old girl, eldest of the four siblings from an underprivileged family in Bakshi Ka Talab in Lucknow, was rescued by the child protection unit. Her parents, who worked as labourers, had stopped getting work during coronavirus curfew. Reeling under extreme poverty, they decided to solemnise the marriage of their daughter to reduce the financial burden on the family. “The family took the decision in distress. Due to the alertness of local residents, the marriage was stopped after the intervention of the child protection unit,” said Uday Bhan, representative of the local gram pradhan. The girl had discontinued studies a couple of years ago to support her family. Childline counsellor Varsha Sharma said during the pandemic, more people were trying to reduce their financial burden by marrying off their teenage children, mostly daughters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/west-up-dists-fare-worst-as-state-reports354-child-marriage-cases-amid-pandemic/articleshow/83383798.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan govt to pay Rs 1,000 per month to metered agri consumers||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has approved the draft of Mukhyamantri Kisan Mitra Energy Yojana (MKMEY) under which the state government will give a grant of Rs 1,000 per month and maximum Rs 12,000 per year on electricity bills to metered agricultural consumers. This will cost the state exchequer Rs 450 crore. The benefit of this scheme will start from May 2021. Under the scheme, electricity bills will be issued by the discoms to the eligible agricultural consumers on the basis of bi-monthly billing system. Sixty per cent of the bill will be payable on a pro-rata basis by the government, subject to a maximum of Rs 1,000 per month. Central and state government employees and income tax payers will not be eligible for agricultural consumer subsidy. Eligible consumers will have to get their Aadhaar number and bank account linked with the scheme. The grant amount will be payable only if the electricity distribution companies do not have arrears against the consumer. After paying the arrears, the subsidy amount will be payable to the consumer on the upcoming bills. The outstanding bill amount before the month of implementation of the scheme will not be adjusted in the grant. If a farmer consumes less electricity and his bill is less than Rs 1,000, then the difference between the actual bill and the grant amount will be deposited in his bank account. This will encourage farmers to save electricity. TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-to-pay-rs-1k-per-month-to-metered-agri-consumers/articleshow/83383776.cms||---
---||Delhi||Right mix: How heritage sites may be turned into spaces for cultural activities||New Delhi: Strengthening the ties between heritage and culture, the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 proposes to convert heritage properties and clusters in the capital into spaces for cultural activities. Delhi government also hopes to involve local bodies in conservation and promote heritage walks and similar initiatives by heritage building owners and other stakeholders. Describing heritage as a mixture of tangible — monuments, buildings, streets, gardens etc — and intangible —— festivals, traditional crafts, art forms etc — elements of historical and cultural values, the plan “adopts a holistic approach and envisages improvement of heritage assets as well as cultural hubs through conservation and adaptive reuse of heritage assets”. Socio-cultural activities and heritage trails will be promoted at cultural precincts and archaeological parks. “Trails may be integrated with nightlife circuits and cultural festivals to increase their vitality,” MPD 41 states. It also proposes setting up of restaurants/cafes, libraries, interpretation/exhibition/training centres, tourist centres, souvenir stores and temporary public art in these places. The authorities will be allowed to identify any building or cluster of heritage and cultural value, including old markets, pre-1962 structures and isolated premises such as a school adjoining Jama Masjid and a church at Kashmere Gate, where conditional alterations will be allowed. Heritage building owners will be encouraged to conserve such structures and make their adaptive use in conformity with the historic context, while local bodies will levy a penalty in case of failure to undertake committed repairs and maintenance or any damage. Local bodies will also be encouraged to set up heritage cells to manage assets, monitor status of their upkeep, and promote complementary economic/cultural activities. A portal has been suggested with lists of heritage structures, empanelled technical experts on heritage buildings, artists, executing agencies, undergoing projects, and identified potential investors. The new plan expands on the previous one as it also talks of integration of intangible culture, night life and public spaces, said A G K Menon, conservation consultant and architect. However, he pointed out, both Shahjahanabad and Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ) have been mentioned as important heritage zones while these are “under threat right now”. He added, “Already the plans for LBZ are outdated as there is change going on there.” Besides these two, cultural precincts and archaeological parks like that of Mehrauli and Sultan Garhi have been identified as the third heritage cluster. For the Walled City of Shahjahanabad, the local body will prepare a plan identifying all major markets, and commercial and mixed-use streets. All hazardous trades, godowns and wholesale activities generating freight movement will be shifted to designated areas in 10 years, the plan states. Its stakeholders will prepare a traffic management plan and promote walking and cycling. Chandni Chowk Market Association president Sanjay Bhargava said the government could have set up an autonomous authority like Lahore’s Walled City body. Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation will have a role in planning, “but local bodies will only be limited to planning transport and traffic”. While supporting the shift of wholesale businesses, he said some of them with cultural values could have been accommodated by creating multi-level markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/right-mix-how-heritage-sites-may-be-turned-into-spaces-for-cultural-activities/articleshow/83382326.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

These co-ventilators, manufactured by Boston Scientific in the USA, have already reached Delhi and should be arriving in Bengal in the next few days. State finance secretary Manoj Pant told TOI, “The academy has been kind enough to send us these co-ventilators. This will greatly help to enhance our infrastructure in the government’s fight against Covid. The academy has given us a list of hospitals where these can be distributed,” Pant said. According to Indranil Basu Ray, who is the chairman of AAYM, co-ventilators are “non-full functional ICU ventilators”. “It requires patients to be intubated and connected to the ventilator and oxygen supply connected to it just as any ventilator. Using a simple mechanism, it then delivers breath under pressure. The number of breaths can be modulated with a simple mechanism. This ensures delivery of oxygen under pressure to patients,” said Basu Ray, who is the staff cardiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist of Memphis VA Medical Center. “However, physicians trained in its use must ascertain its correct usage,” he added. Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra told TOI, “An organization has offered to sponsor such machines for us. This will certainly be helpful for transporting critical patients.” Pritimoy Chakraborty, director of disaster management and relief operations of the Bengal chapter of AAYM, said, “The state government has taken special effort so that the customs duty for importing these machines are waved off.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/us-based-yoga-academy-helps-bengal-in-cov-fight/articleshow/83382311.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

It was the 13th heart retrieval from Nagpur. The heart was transplanted on a 44-year-old man admitted to Mumbai’s Reliance Hospital.Man donates organ in NagpurThis was the first organ donation after the second wave of Covid-19 and 5th for 2021. Office-bearers of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Center (ZTCC), Nagpur, said Dinesh Sakharam Sonawane, who owns a photo studio and an optical shop at Takalghat, was admitted to Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences on Tuesday. “He had complaints of giddiness, blurred vision, slurred speech, and unconscious state. His test reports diagnosed circularity stroke,” said Dr Sameer Paltewar, director of Meditrina Institute. In spite of all the treatment, his condition deteriorated neurologically, and a team of doctors declared him brain dead on Tuesday evening. Dr Sanjay Kolte, ZTCC secretary, told TOI that family members themselves came forward to donate organs. “Sonawane’s nephew Suyog and son Suyash gave formal consent. They told that Dinesh was a very helpful person. It was indeed heartening to see the young boys in their twenties. They had elaborate knowledge as well reaffirming commitment to the cause of organ donation,” said Dr Kolte. Zone coordinator Veena Wathore said a team of doctors from Mumbai’s Reliance Hospital reached through a commercial flight to Nagpur. A green corridor was created from Meditrina Institute to Nagpur airport and the heart reached the airport within 4 minutes. “For one kidney, a green corridor was created from Meditrina Hospital to Archarya Vinoba Bhave Hospital in Sawangi. Nagpur city, rural, traffic, and Wardha police helped us a lot,” she added. ZTCC Nagpur president Dr Vibhawari Dani said after a setback to the organ transplant movement due to Covid 19, the Nagpur team is at work again. “Community awareness is need of the day for getting more organs to save lives. We respectfully appreciate the relatives, who graciously consented for organ donation,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1st-organ-donation-after-2nd-covid-wave-man-gifts-life-to-5/articleshow/83382333.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Lucknow||Children better at neutralising Covid-19, says expert||LUCKNOW: After Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concern over the safety of children in view of coronavirus pandemic, Prof Ram Shanker Upadhyaya, an expert on infectious and communicable disease, said children are safer than adults so far as the virus is concerned. “As the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 increased, the number of children contracting infection went up. However, we have not seen a sudden spike in the overall percentage of children getting affected by Covid-19 in India,” he said. Asked how safe the children are in ongoing pandemic, he said in the second wave, it was noticed that the entire households got infected with the virus due to which children were also affected. “According to UNICEF report, India has witnessed very few severe cases of Covid-19 among children where they required hospitalization. Data from across the world, and India, has shown that infection in children has been very mild,” said Prof Upadhyaya, who hails from Agra. Comparing the severity of infection between adults and children, he said about 60-70% children who got infected were asymptomatic. “Of the children who were symptomatic, only around 1-2% required treatment at the intensive care unit. This number is less than the percentage of adults requiring intensive care,” he said. “A small population of children may develop severe infection, though this is less common than in adults and the elderly,” he said. Speaking on the reason behind better response by children against infection, he said: “Children produce antibodies aimed at SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which the virus uses to enter cells. Adults generate similar antibodies, but also develop antibodies against nucleocapsid protein, which is essential for viral replication.” “Children lack nucleocapsid-specific antibodies which suggests that they aren’t experiencing widespread infection. Children’s immune responses seem to be able to eliminate the virus before it replicates in large numbers. It is a myth that children are superspreaders,” Prof Upadhyaya said. Asserting that children are better at neutralizing the virus, he said: “T cells in children are relatively naive. T cells are part of the body’s adaptive immune system, which learns to recognize pathogens it encounters over a lifetime. As T cells are untrained, they might have a greater capacity to respond to new viruses. Children also have a strong innate immune response since birth.” Asked about his views on the nature of the possible third wave of pandemic, Prof Upadhyaya said the gap between the first and second peak in India was about six months. “It is expected that in the absence of any new variant, the third wave may be anywhere between 3-6 months. By that time, India will be placed in a better scenario as nearly 20-30% population would be completely vaccinated (higher if vaccination is ramped up),” he said. He said if no new variants appear, it can be presumed that either the same or lower number of infections would occur. Asked about suggestions, he said the government should be proactive in testing and constant realtime monitoring of cases. “At the initial hint of an upcoming wave, controlled lockdown is the only way to prevent catastrophic outcomes,” he said. “The third wave is believed to have started in UK. Given that nearly 40% of population is fully vaccinated and nearly 60% have received first dose, the epidemiological turnout in UK remains to be seen. On the basis of the situation in UK, India can plan to contain the effect of third wave,” Prof Upadhyaya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/expert-children-better-at-neutralising-covid-19/articleshow/83383836.cms||---

AICC general secretary Ajay Maken, chief minister Ashok Gehlot, PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra, fomer PCC president Sachin Pilot and Bhanwar Jitendra Singh attended the meeting virtually. Maken said the party was preparing a pamphlet detailing the ‘loot’ of the Modi government by raising the excise duty of fuel repeatedly and comparing it with that of the UPA government. It was the Congress which came out with the policy of linking petrol and diesel prices with wholesale international crude oil prices to benefit people. But the Modi government has been resorting to consecutive hike in excise duty and circumvent the decline in crude prices in the international markets and thereby denying benefit of low crude price to the people, he said.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: First Covid autopsy lays bare lung, kidney damage||KOLKATA: The first pathological autopsy on a Covid-deceased has revealed that the virus had struck the lungs and the kidney of the victim. The report on the first such autopsy has been submitted to the state health department on Tuesday that lays bare how the infection had affected the two major organs of the deceased. The autopsy was conducted on organ and body donation movement pioneer Brojo Roy’s body at the state-run RG Kar Medical College. According to report the prepared by a team of three doctors —forensic medicine head Somnath Das, pathology head Tushar Kanti Das and Manas Bandyopadhyay, professor of microbiology — the virus had attacked the lining of the lungs causing fluid accumulation while it had damaged the tubules in the kidney — tube shaped structures that filters out waste products and fluid. “Two major findings as a consequence of the infection, we observed, are that the lung lining of the respiratory unit was damaged causing fluid accumulation. This had prevented the oxygen from going into the body causing hypoxia. Also, the virus had caused tubular necrosis in the kidney due to which toxins got piled up,” said Das, the forensic medicine head. After Roy, 84, died during treatment for Covid in mid-May, his widow had appealed to the state health department — through Ganadarpan, an organization which Roy headed — to conduct to an autopsy on his body to find out how the virus affects different organs. Officials subsequently conducted the first pathological autopsy on a Covid-19 body for research on May 14. “We have conducted more such autopsies and more findings will be unearthed in the days to come,” said Das. After Roy, the team at RG Kar Medical College has conducted pathological autopsy on at least four more Covid victims, including one who died after getting both doses of vaccine. Reports of these are still being prepared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1st-cov-autopsy-lays-bare-lung-kidney-damage/articleshow/83382348.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: ‘As firing went on, 10 minutes seemed like a lifetime’||KOLKATA: Techie Saptadip Sanyal was on the terrace of his building, speaking on a conference call, when he suddenly saw policemen running around with guns outside his building. Maitreyee Sen was taking a break from her work from home schedule, scrolling through Facebook, when she was jolted by a loud gunshot bang. Sutirtha Pramanik hurried out of the bathroom on hearing gunshots and ran to the balcony. Gun-toting cops rebuked him and told him to go inside immediately. For residents of Shukhobrishti complex in New Town, scenes from Bollywood encounter movies and the last episode of current OTT bigwig ‘Family Man 2’ came alive on Wednesday afternoon as they witnessed a shootout between police and gangsters. Two of the most-wanted criminals from Punjab were shot down, while one policeman was injured. “The sound of bullets is still ringing in my ears. The firing went on and on and I lost count of the bullets that were shot. I shut all the doors and windows, as instructed by the cops, and sat beside the balcony. It had possibly lasted for only 10 minutes but it felt like a lifetime,” said Pramanik, who lives in the building opposite the scene of the encounter on Wednesday. According to sources, a team of officers conducted a recce of the complex around 1pm. Around 3pm, a team of plainclothesmen stationed themselves outside eight buildings surrounding B-153, the building where the gangsters had been staying on rent, and by 3.30pm, the operation began. Sen, who lives a building away, said she was scrolling though Facebook, when she heard the gunshots. From the balcony, she found the road outside empty with some gun-toting cops making a dash, yelling at people to stay indoors. “Within moments, information and questions started flooding our Telegram group about the gunshot. It was very scary. The fact that we were living with gangsters scared the life out of me,” she said. In the Manoj Bajpai-starrer ‘Family Man 2’, the protagonist is seen entering a flat of a residential complex in Mumbai to rescue his kidnapped daughter by terrorists, when two of the accused manage to escape. The next scene shows the cops chasing the gangsters around the residential complex, the two sides shooting at each other. The residents look from balconies and windows as the two gangsters are shot down. At Shukhobrishti, residents were spared the horror of watching the gangsters being killed but many saw the cop, who was injured by a bullet, being helped away by two of his colleagues. “I had no clue what was happening and wondered about so many armed men in our complex. Then I heard gunshots, which sounded like crackers initially. But then I saw a cops being taken away by his colleagues to a police jeep. He seemed in a lot of pain and then, the gunshots escalated. I have never seen anything like this and will never forget this day,” said Saptadip Sanyal, who lives next to the shootout site. “I still can’t digest that we had been sharing space with gangsters and that a shootout broke out here. I am still trembling. I thought living in a gated communities was safe. After Wednesday, I feel disillusioned,” said Priyanka Sengupta, who has been living in the complex on rent for the past three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/as-firing-went-on-10-mins-seemed-like-a-lifetime/articleshow/83382373.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao is expected to visit the state in the coming week ahead of an organisational shake-up within the state Congress unit. Rao is expected to hold meetings in each of the 40 constituencies to take stock of the party’s presence at the grassroots level. Congress insiders suggest that a “major reshuffle” is expected based on a “performance-based audit” of the party office-bearers. “AICC in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao will be arriving in Goa next week and will tour the entire state, holding meetings with Congress block committees in all 40 constituencies. These meetings will follow a major reshuffle in the party,” said opposition leader Digambar Kamat. Rao held a virtual meeting with the state co-ordination committee, which was constituted in January this year to increase the party’s membership. State party president Girish Chodankar, Kamat, chairman of the co-ordination committee Ramakant Khalap, co-chairman of the co-ordination committee MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha, Alexio Sequeira and other members were present for the deliberations. “The AICC incharge has given directions to all the five MLAs, GPCC office-bearers to come down on the field and develop a direct connect with the people. He has also categorically stated that a performance based audit will be done of all the party office bearers and only those who are active shall be promoted whereas the non-performing members will be given some other task in the party,” said Kamat. The review will lead to a revamp at the block level, district and state level with re-constitution of the committees. There will be review of the district committees as well as the frontal organisations and necessary changes will be done wherever required. Rao reportedly said that the Congress party is focusing on all the forty constituencies and will work hard to win the trust of the voters ahead of the coming polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/major-reshuffle-in-congs-goa-unit-on-anvil/articleshow/83383875.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Blotter paper part of LSD mixture, must be weighed too: NCB||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday asked the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to amend its petition on the LSD drug weight issue after its counsel, additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, said it was challenging the validity of an earlier high court order, which held blotter paper to only be a carrier material and not part of the mixture. Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), a hallucinogenic narcotic drug, is placed as small dots on blotter paper for consumption. The NCB also relied on a US Supreme Court majority 7:2 judgment in Chapman Vs United States which held that “it is the weight of the blotter paper containing LSD, and not the weight of the pure LSD, which determines eligibility of minimum sentence”. Singh said that since the paper is consumed too, it forms a part of the mixture and when seized, its weight has to be factored in too. But Rizwan Merchant, counsel for alleged peddler Anuj Keshwani (30) said the paper can be separated from the drug and hence it cannot be considered part of the drug or its mixture and its weight has to be discarded, under the law. The battle over the weight of the drug and the legal point on whether blotter paper weight matters assumes importance as offences under the Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) depend on the drug weight for punishments. If the amount is ‘small’, punishment is less; for ‘commercial’ value, the sentence is severe. The commercial value of LSD is 0.1gm due to its potency. Last September, Keshwani was found in possession of 0.62gm, said the NCB, when 31 blotter papers with LSD were recovered during a search, apart from other drugs. He has been in Taloja Central prison since his arrest last year. The NCB is relying on a recent Supreme Court ruling in Hira Singh’s case which said that the weight of mixtures of drugs sold on street ought to be considered including a neutral substance, not just its pure form. Singh said the HC order of December 2020 holding blotting paper to be a mere carrier and not neutral part of a mixture in a Pune case for bail, was per-incuriam (through lack of regard to the law) with a finding in the SC April 2020 judgment which dealt with the intention of the legislature behind NDPS Act, and hence not good law. Justice Ajay Gadkari was hearing the NCB petition against an April 30 order of a special NDPS court judge which had directed the sample seized from Keshwani to be sent for fresh forensic test to Gandhinagar. The HC gave the NCB a week to amend its petition since it would have to weigh in on an important legal issue. Keshwani, through Merchant and advocate Taraq Sayed, had said the first forensic report, which said the seizure was 0.62gm, was silent on whether the paper was weighed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ncb-blotter-paper-part-of-lsd-mixture-must-be-weighed-too-in-mumbai/articleshow/83385495.cms||Swati Deshpande

There are more than 600 standalone grocery and vegetable shops in the two taluks. Razak, secretary, Gudalur and Pandalur Traders’ Association, said the shops were crowded when they reopened on Monday after the lockdown without any relaxations ended. “We were not able to maintain the standard operating procedures. Our decision to open the shops till 1pm the next day also didn’t help, as we witnessed larger crowds. There are already more than 250 containment zones in the two taluks, which are heavily affected by the second wave. Hence, all the traders decided to close the shops till June 14.” He said they would, however, supply the groceries and vegetables to the residents if they place tele-orders. “We hope our measures will complement the district administration’s efforts to contain the virus spread.” Every shop has left the contact numbers on a notice board. “Once the order is packed, we will inform the customer, who can come and collect the same. This will do away with large crowds,” Razak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shops-down-shutters-in-gudalur-pandalur/articleshow/83382350.cms||---

A division bench comprising Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath ordered the release of the protesters after considering a petition by Sayed Mohammed Koya through advocate R Rohith. It was contended by the petitioner that the protesters were remanded by the executive magistrate for no reason even though the case registered against them by Kilthan police if for bailable offences. Lakshadweed Island’s standing counsel submitted that the station house officer and executive magistrate were prepared to release them on bail but they refused to get released on bail. However, the petitioner’s counsel refuted this submission. Stating that the court is not going into the merits of these aspects now, the bench said liberty of the persons in custody is the most important concern and said they should not be deprived of the means of access to justice. Further, the court ordered the CJM of Amini to take up the case on Tuesday and order their release on execution of self bond or on conditions CJM deems fit to impose. The court will hear the case again on Wednesday. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dweep-hc-orders-release-of-protesters/articleshow/83173878.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Allopathy & Ayurveda: Needed, greater synergy||LUCKNOW: While the word ‘Allopathy’ was used for the first time in 1827 by Samuel Hahnemann, Sushrut was born in 800 BC. As most of us are not even aware how conditioned we are, it is not easy to choose the better out of the two. We see what we want to see, and love the status quo. For example, even during the 18th Century, people opposed efforts to such an extent that Jonas Hanway was attacked when he carried an umbrella in London in 1780. There was a gap of 78 years in acceptance of small pox vaccination. Let us understand how allopathy has flourished globally so well. Mainly due to research and usage of modern technology for precise diagnosis, followed by quick cure by using new medicines. The dictum is: what is measurable must be measured; and what is yet not measurable, efforts should continue to make it measurable. However, within the best of medical fraternity abroad also, there have been near cruel opposition to creativity and brilliance due to prevailing conditioning among them. The pioneer of laparoscopy in 1960s, Kurt Karl Stephan Semm, was fiercely opposed; while he was in the middle of a slide projection, his projector was unplugged with the explanation that such unethical surgery should not be presented. He had even to undergo a brain-scan because colleagues suspected that only a person with brain damage would perform laparoscopic surgery. However, his journey of excellence continued. Mahesh Yogi published his research on Transcendental Meditation in Scientific American and his professionals presented their research paper in the International Congress of Physiology in Frankfurt. Another success story is of Padma Shri Professor KN Udupa, founder-director of the Institute of Medical Science, BHU. He had a degree, both in ayurvedic medicine and MS from the University of Michigan in 1948 and FRCS from Canada. He was an icon. The Government of India had appointed a committee under his chairmanship which was called Udupa Committee. What best can we do today? First, the government should take care of the report submitted by the Udupa Committee in April 1959. Second, we must follow what Nobel Laureate Francis Crick wrote in Nature (UK) in February 2003: “In nature, hybrid species are usually sterile, but in science the reverse is true. Hybrid subjects are often astonishingly fertile whereas if a science discipline remains too pure it usually wilts.” We have hope that our learned Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan will ensure that holistic and integrated medicine authentically helps us with lesser “tol-mol” and more “tal-mel”, etymologically true to his name: “Enhancement of Joy”.

---||Mumbai||‘Abusive’ son must leave home, 85-year-old father to pay him Rs 50,000 a month, says Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday, in an interim order, directed a 50-year-old man to vacate his father’s tenanted house within four weeks after the senior citizen petitioned it for relief, alleging harassment and abuse for a decade. The father will give the grownup “educated and able-bodied” son Rs 50,000 per month till the matter is finally decided, said the HC. A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and S P Tavade had, on May 21, reserved the order in a “petition filed by an 85-year-old father in distress”. In its order pronounced on Wednesday, the HC noted in June 2020, in another matter, it had observed how India has always been proud of progeny such as Shravan Kumar who had carried his blind and aging parents on his shoulder in two baskets to fulfil their wish for a pilgrimage and how unfortunately in the past several years, it is “repeatedly witnessing old parents knocking at its doors, in the twilight years... for redressal against their children”. The father, represented by senior counsel Nitin Thakker with Chandu Mehta, said “because of harassment and torture inflicted” by their son, the mother suffered health conditions and “ultimately lost her life in March 2020”. He said as parents, earlier they “could not gather courage” to report their plight to authorities and they also feared social stigma in their community till the “harassment” became “unbearable”. The HC said the father has been knocking on the doors of all the concerned authorities since 2018 “with a sole prayer that he be allowed to live in peace in his own house” and having failed to get any respite, in exasperation, he has now knocked the court’s doors. The son said he feared his sister would “usurp” the tenancy once he is out of the house. His lawyer questioned what proof was there that he misbehaved with his father. The HC, in turn, had said, “What proof is expected from any old feeble and helpless parent whose child ill-treats and misbehaves with him within the four corners of their house?” The HC said there was “enough evidence’’ that the father had shown in the form of complaints to the police, to the department of maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens, and “most importantly the audio recording...showing the rude and abusive language used by (the son)”. The bench spoke to the father at a virtual hearing and was convinced of his sound mind and that he did not intend to deprive his only son of the tenancy. To buy peace, the father offered to pay the son Rs 25 lakh to help with down payment for a leave and licence flat during the pandemic. “Maintenance of a senior citizen has been held by our courts to include not just the right to live, but the right to live with dignity and in an atmosphere of safety and security,’’ said Justices Kathawalla and Tavade. The father’s petition is pending before the special tribunal, which despite being empowered to evict son has been “inactive” in the matter, the HC noted, adding it is “duty-bound to hear’’ and grant interim relief. The HC directed the son to vacate, posting the matter for final hearing on August 30. It clarified if the father pays the son Rs 25 lakh towards a home, monthly Rs 50,000 would cease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/abusive-son-must-leave-home-85-yr-old-father-to-pay-him-rs-50k-a-month-says-hc/articleshow/83380417.cms||---

Coming days before the elections for panchayat heads, the development is being seen as a factor that may help SP consolidate its position in Banda. Akhilesh said the policies of the BJP government had added to the woes of farmers as it aim at helping the corporates at the cost of the poor. “The farm laws that the government is forcing on the farmers is an example. In Fatehpur, wheat procurement centre at Asodhara Mandi (Haat branch) is lying locked since May 29. Farmers are waiting to get their wheat weighed. In Sambhal, procurements centres are not buying more than 50 quintals wheat from one farmer. In Agra, wheat procurement has stopped since April 4,” Akhilesh said, adding that it was being done to force the farmers to surrender to the new farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-ex-mla-from-banda-joins-sp-fold/articleshow/83383945.cms||---
---||Kolkata||28 years after face-off, Bengal, Punjab cops work in tandem||KOLKATA: The Bengal Special Task Force operation in New Town on Wednesday, which was carried out based on real-time feedback from the Punjab police, comes 28 years after a face-off between Bengal and Punjab. In 1993, cops from the Punjab Police had carried out an operation in Bengal, keeping the local police in the dark. The case, which landed in the Supreme Court, had reportedly led to then Punjab chief minister Beant Singh assuring his Bengal counterpart, Jyoti Basu, not to repeat such “overreach” in future. In May 1993, a Sikh couple was reportedly gunned down by a Punjab Police team in Tiljala. The victims were alleged police deserter Bashir Ahmed and his wife, Rani, both members of a terrorist outfit. Without informing Bengal police, uniformed Punjab Police personnel had entered the couple’s home, shot them dead while they slept, and bundled the bodies in a van and left. On coming to know, the Bengal authorities had shot off letters to Punjab and Delhi, reminding them of the rule book and the brutality of the act. Responding to a PIL, the Bengal government later took its cause to the Supreme Court. The subsequent CBI probe indicted the personnel for murder, abduction, and destruction of evidence. Just 13 months later, a Punjab Police team shot another suspect in Uluberia. The Bengal police had detained the officers. The stand-off was resolved when the CMs of the two states intervened. Wednesday’s encounter, however, laid out a real-time coordination between the top officers of Punjab Police and Bengal STF. The STF moved into New Town’s Shukhobrishti once they corroborated the Punjab Police’s inputs on the location of the two dreaded gangsters from Punjab. A Punjab Police team has also flown down to the city to assist the probe. “The entire operation was carried out by Bengal STF, with inputs from the Punjab police,” said ADG (STF) Vineet Goyal. “The CrPC states that the local police have to be informed about any operation. Cops from any other state must produce a warrant, or at least a requisition, take the local police along, arrest the accused and take him back on transit remand. But often, police from outside Bengal had failed to alert the local cops,” said a former chief of the detective department. He remembered at least two occasions when UP STF returned empty-handed as both “were cautious” of the fallout of an encounter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/28-yrs-after-face-off-bengal-punjab-cops-work-in-tandem/articleshow/83382437.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The police also detained two cars used in transporting ganja. In the first case, police got a tip off that two persons were bringing ganja in a car from Chhindwara. The police laid a trap on Koradi Road and stopped the car (MP-28/CA 2387). They found 35kg ganja worth about Rs5.5lakh hidden in two gunny bags in the back of the car.

Some 83 complaints of misconduct against police officials are pending and new ones will be filed by the aggrieved citizens for redressal. To give justice to the citizens, it is the duty of the government to ensure that GSPCA functions smoothly.

Education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy, who has officially announced the cancellation of exams, said the decision was made keeping the safety of students in mind. “Students and parents were worried about exams during the pandemic. To ensure that they are not under stress anymore, the state has decided to cancel the examinations,” said the minister. Sabitha said that a committee would be constituted to finalise the modalities for results. “Based on recommendations of the committee, results will be announced,” she added. Syed Omer Jaleel, commissioner and secretary, Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education said that orders were expected to be released on Thursday. The move would benefit some 4.73 lakh Intermediate second-year students. The decision comes after CBSE and CISCE boards cancelled class 12 examinations. This year, the state had already cancelled Intermediate first-year and SSC examinations and promoted all students to the next class. Parents and teachers welcomed the move and said that under the current circumstances, cancelling exams was the right decision. “It’s not worth risking students' lives by asking them to appear for exams in the pandemic. We were very worried until today as the state has not made any decision despite CBSE cancelling exams, but are relieved now,” said K Anitha, whose son is a second-year MPC student. KS Rama Rao, president, Telangana Government Junior Colleges Principals Association, said that although promoting students without exams is not an ideal solution, the state had no other option. P Madhusudan Reddy, president, Telangana State Junior Lecturers Forum, said that the state should only consider first-year marks to announce second-year results. “For practical examinations, 100 per cent marks should be awarded to all students,” he added and said the state should start planning for the next year exams so that the same situation is not repeated again in 2022. As of date, the state is planning to go ahead with common entrance for admissions into various undergraduate and postgraduate courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-scraps-inter-2nd-year-exams-panel-to-decide-result-process/articleshow/83385562.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Chief minister Pramod Sawant said the proposal has already been submitted to the Centre and that some changes to the scheme would be made. Post-facto approval was granted for a report prepared by PwC, the consultant, with regard to the queries raised by the Industrial Finance Corporation of India Ltd (IFCL) over the medical device park proposed for the state. The report was subsequently submitted to the IFCL, which is the project management agency for the medical device park scheme under the Union department of pharmaceuticals. In 2019-20, Goa, along with Gujarat, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh were trying to woo Japanese manufacturers to invest and manufacture drugs and medical devices in bulk. In November 2019, the Centre gave the go-ahead for four medical device parks to come up in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. Goa’s industries department was in talks with the Centre to explore the possibility of setting up a manufacturing cluster for medical devices. The moves are in line with the state government’s attempt to make Goa a healthcare hub, where medical tourism and production of healthcare equipment go hand-in-hand. India’s medical device sector is currently valued at $11 billion, according to the national investment promotion and facilitation agency, Invest India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/eye-on-healthcare-hub-status-cabinet-oks-proposal-for-medical-device-park/articleshow/83384021.cms||---

Janhit founder Abhijit Jha said the organization had made several complaints to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and local corporators, but nothing happened. The NGO activists completed the task of repairing potholes in Surendragadh and other areas within a few hours, which the NMC did not do in months. Senior citizens in the vicinity also supported the group by streamlining the traffic ensuring that the work did not disrupt vehicular movement. Jha said, “We will continue this in the days to come so that citizens benefit.” He stressed that this initiative was necessary for the safety of motorists. According to Surendragadh residents, they have been running from pillar to post to get NMC’s Dharampeth zone and local corporators, including former mayor Mayatai Iwnate, into action. Jha said the material for the road repairs was procured with the help of donations raised from Janhit members. “We purchased cement, sand and other material to fill up the potholes as a temporary measure,” he said. The NGO’s efforts have been widely appreciated by the commuters and general public from this part of the city. Meanwhile, citizens have expressed anger over negligence and delay by the civic authorities to provide better road infrastructure in the city. The inaction by the concerned agencies to repair potholes is not new. In the past, city NGO Janmanch too had carried out patchwork of potholes across the city, especially on busy roads like Kamptee, NADT etc. Last year, the traffic police had carried out road patchwork in many areas. Recently, Janhit had replaced damaged manhole covers in West Nagpur assembly constituency. So far, it has replaced as many 42 damaged drainage covers in this part of the city. Despite repeated attempts, Iwnate was not available for her comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/civic-agencies-fail-to-act-ngo-repairs-potholes/articleshow/83382468.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Villagers from Chinnachettiyapalayam, Nallakattipalayam and Malayapalayam have decided not to open shops till the cases are reduced. “We convened a meeting on Monday with the village heads from the three villages and all political party functionaries,” S Govindan, one of the villagers, said. He said that they had decided to start a complete lockdown from Wednesday until the cases are reduced to zero. According to the villagers, at least 200 people from these villages tested positive every day for the infection and most of them were admitted to the government and private hospitals for treatment. “Most of the villagers are weavers and farmers and they’re struggling to recover from the infection,” Govindan said. The self-imposed lockdown was brought as many villagers didn’t follow Covid-19 protocols such as wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing. “We have decided to close all the shops including factories and companies,” V Suresh, another villager, said. During this complete lockdown, medical shops, vegetable shops, petrol bunks and milk parlours will be functioning till noon and the rest will remain closed until further orders. “We will take severe action with the help of government officials if anyone violates our decision,” he said. Pamphlets were circulated to villagers requesting them to extend their support to bring down the number of Covid-19 cases in their villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/erode-villages-go-for-self-imposed-lockdown-to-break-covid-chain/articleshow/83382432.cms||---

On Wednesday, an online training programme was held where district minority officers and UP Secondary Education Board officials gave subject training to madrassa teachers. During the session, teachers were given tips on simple ways of teaching. Government officials said efforts are on to rope in former vice-chancellors and retired administrative officers in the training programme. “Online education is the need of the hour.

---||Delhi||Web of deceit: Delhi cop goes deep inside to bust global racket||NEW DELHI: For about a month, a young cyber cell officer became an avid user of the malicious Chinese apps offering quick income to people. He devoted hours to know their operations and even invested — and lost — money to help in following the money trail and bust the international syndicate. With a decoy having infiltrated the network, police could identify the linked payment gateways, UPI and transaction IDs, and bank accounts used by the fraudsters. The cops also got the connected mobile numbers — a majority of them being operated from China — and managed to unearth 25 shell firms so far in whose accounts the money was getting transferred. “These companies were located in different parts of India and the money was being moved from one account to another to hide the trail. This pointed to the involvement of professional accountants,” police commissioner S N Shrivastava said. Police picked up the first and key suspect, Sheikh Robin, from Uluberia in West Bengal. Two chartered accountants, Ronak Bansal and Avik Kedia, were held from Gurgaon and Delhi’s Katwaria Sarai. Five others, Umakant Akash Joys, Ved Chandra, Hari Om, Arvind and Abhishek Mansaramani, all residents of Delhi who acted as directors in the shell companies, were also arrested. Two others, Sashi Bansal and Mithlesh Sharma, were caught for providing bogus companies and bank accounts. A Tibetan woman was also held from IGI Airport in coordination with Bangalore Police. Kedia is learnt to have created around 110 shell firms for the syndicate. His social media profiles also revealed details of his foreign travel. Thirty active mobile phones were seized from Robin, who was contacted allegedly by Chinese fraudsters through Telegram. He had initially opened a bank account for them, but later started acting as an operative whose primary task was to manage the fund transfers. At the time of his arrest, Robin had the custody of 29 bank accounts. Bansal and Kedia said they would create shell companies in the name of their family members, friends and employees and then sell them to Chinese nationals for Rs 2-3 lakh each, DCP (cyber) Anyesh Roy said. They were in touch with the Chinese through Telegram, Dingtalk, WeChat, etc, he added. The gang used sophisticated software and financial tools for automated fund transfer. The Chinese syndicate, police said, created an elaborate network of operatives across the country to launder the money. Their footprints have been confirmed in West Bengal, NCR, Bengaluru, Odisha, Assam and Surat, the cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/web-of-deceit-cop-goes-deep-inside-to-bust-global-racket/articleshow/83382493.cms||Raj Shekhar

He also said that it was due to cost factor that most of the bundhs were damaged. The revenue department has notified about 500 bundhs as protective bundhs. A cabinet note said that these bundhs are very old and protect agriculture land on the coast of rivers by blocking the ingress of sea water. From times to time, the agriculture department undertakes repair of these protective bundhs, the note said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-bear-90-of-bundh-repair-cost/articleshow/83383976.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: More rapes in five months of ’21 than for same period in last two years||JAIPUR: Rape cases in first five months of this year surpassed the numbers for the same period in the last two years in Rajasthan. From January till May this year, the state police registered a total of 2,461 rape cases. Last year, the number during the same period was 1,807. In 2019, the state had logged 2,298 such cases in corresponding months. The figures also show that compared to last year, the lockdown during the second wave did little to slow down rape cases. In April last year, the state had recorded 193 rape cases. In April this year, a staggering 494 rape cases were registered at different police stations of the state. Rajasthan had entered a state of heightened curbs and restrictions in May. Ideally, this should have created a deterrence leading to a decline in cases. However, despite all the curbs on movements, 390 rape cases were registered last month, compared to 384 in the same month during last year when a similar lockdown was enforced. Additional DG (crime) Ravi Prakash Meharda said unlike previous year, a staggering lockdown was enforced this year. “There were curbs on movements of people. But there were actually some exemptions in which people did step out,” he said. The state police attributed the rise in cases to the mandatory FIR registration rule which made it difficult for local police stations to decline a complaint. Also, in 2019, the SPs and DCPs were empowered to directly register FIR from their offices in case a police station turns away the complainant. While the ease in the filing of FIRs may have pushed up rape figures in the state, increase in cases at a time when the state was under lockdown does raise questions. “Police were completely engrossed in lockdown enforcement due to which there was a little room for other cases, inter-district travel had also become impossible,” said an official of the city police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/more-rapes-in-5-mths-of-21-than-for-same-period-in-last-2-years/articleshow/83384043.cms||---

A letter signed by Shiv Sena ministerAnil Parab, who is also a vibhag pramukh, MP Arvind Sawant, who is also a chief spokesperson of the party, and other functionaries wrote to Thackeray saying the implementation of tenancy act would adversely affect over 25 lakh tenants in Mumbai. “There is no need of Model Tenancy Act for Mumbai-Maharashtra ... . [T]he existing Bombay Rent Act and Maharashtra Rent Control Act is the complete act to give protection to tenants,” the letter said. Last week, the Shiv Sena protested against the Model Tenancy Act in south Mumbai and south central Mumbai. The protests were led by local MPs. MP Rahul Shewale also wrote to PM Narendra Modi, requesting him to cancel the Model Tenancy Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-men-ask-uddhav-not-to-adopt-model-tenancy-act/articleshow/83385579.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore city corporation gets new chief||COIMBATORE: At a time when the district continues to record the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases in the state, the government on Wednesday transferred the city corporation commissioner. Raja Gopal Sunkara, who is working as regional deputy commissioner (south) of the Greater Chennai Corporation, is posted as the new corporation commissioner replacing P Kumaravel Pandian. Pandian took charge as the 25th corporation commissioner on August 31, 2020, when Covid-19 cases were increasing steadily in the city. Pandian had spent most of his time working to contain the infection rate. He did his BSc in Physics at PSG college of Arts and Science in Coimbatore in 1990. He is a native of Kallimandayam near Ottanchatram. During his stint, many of the smart city projects – lake rejuvenation projects at Valankulam, Ukkadam big tank and Selvachintamani, and model road project on DB Road – were completed and inaugurated for public use. Apart from strengthening door-to-door survey to identify people with symptoms at their doorstep and other containment measures, he had also launched a mobile vaccination drive which aimed at vaccinating people at large numbers at their locations. But within weeks, it had to be called off due to vaccine shortage. As the corporation has been focusing only on containing the pandemic, the new commissioner might have to spend time in shaping projects like model road project at Race Course, biomining project, other lake projects, 24X7 water supply project and integrated bus stand – whose work had slowed down due to the pandemic –, improving the civic infrastructure and financial stability of the civic body in addition to controlling the spread of the infection. This year, the corporation had tabled a budget with surplus revenue of just Rs 1.04 crore and had not announced any new projects. The corporation aims to make a revenue of Rs 2,630.2 crore and of which, it plans to earn Rs 180.3 crore by collecting taxes. Similarly, the state government has also transferred the Tirupur corporation commissioner. Kranti Kumar Pati, who was working as the executive officer of Arulmigu Dhandayuthapani Swamy temple in Palani, will replace the existing commissioner K Sivakumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-corporation-gets-new-chief/articleshow/83382472.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Retired high court judge Nutan Sardessai to head police complaints body||PANAJI: The state cabinet on Wednesday appointed retired high court judge Nutan Sardessai as the new chairperson of the State Police Complaints Authority (SPCA). The SPCA was non-functional without a chairman for almost three years. Rules stipulate that the chairperson shall hold office for the term of five years from the date on which he/she enters office, and no chairperson shall hold office after he/she has attained the age of 70 years. The tenure of the last SPCA chairman, Justice (retd) R M S Khandeparkar, ended on April 13, 2018. The three-member SPCA comprises a chairman and two other members. Even after the chairman’s retirement, the two other members of SPCA had continued hearing cases but were unable to pass orders without a chairman. In November last year, with over 83 pending complaints filed against police personnel, the state government closed down the functioning of SPCA till it was reconstituted. In 2014, the state government issued a memorandum restricting SPCA from taking suo motu cognisance of misconduct by police personnel. The move had drawn widespread criticism from activists and citizens as there is an increase in the number of cases filed against the law enforcers over the past five years. SPCA had recommended disciplinary proceedings against some personnel and even directed some of the men-in-uniform to perform social service. This required them to educate members of 10 village panchayats about SPCA, it’s function, purpose and utility as well as the procedure followed by SPCA to dispose complaints in case the police failed to file a first information report (FIR). Most of the complaints with SPCA relate to police refusing to register FIRs. Other complaints are of police personnel assaulting complainants when an FIR was asked to be registered. In one such case, the complainant had stated he had been harassed by the police while registering an FIR. Other complaints include abuse of power and arrest without valid reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/retd-hc-judge-sardessai-to-head-police-complaints-body/articleshow/83384042.cms||---

Continuing with this drive, the civic body tested 90 coolies at the main railway station on Tuesday. NMC's steps to curb Covid spread.With second wave of the pandemic receding from beginning of May, NMC was expecting unlocking by the state government from June 1. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Owners or staffers of essential or non-essential shops or restaurants may infect people in large numbers in case they are carrying the virus. The same is the situation with hawkers, vendors and home delivery boys. Therefore, we tested around 70,000 such people engaged in commercial establishments in the city in third and fourth week of May. We got help from police as well as associations related to these commercial establishments.” Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had made testing mandatory for these people once in a fortnight. Joshi said around 3% of these 70,000 people tested positive. “Timings of essential shops were increased from 11am to 2pm from June 1. Also, non-essential shops were allowed to reopen from June 1. Testing helped contain the spread, as around 2,100 were identified and isolated. It also helped them get early treatment,” he said. Despite increase in timings of essential shops and resumption of non-essential shops on June 1, cases have continued to drop in the city. There were 190 cases in the city on May 31, which dropped to 81 on June 8. On Tuesday, a team of NMC Mangalwari Zone in association with Central Railway conducted tests on 245 people, 155 passengers and 90 coolies, at the main railway station. The main idea behind testing coolies was they meet and interact with multiple people at railway station on daily basis. Divisional railway manager Richa Khare, senior divisional commercial manager Krishnakant Patil, divisional commercial manager Vipul Sarkar, Dinesh Nagdive, Pravin Rokde, and Purushottam Kamalkar extended necessary help to the NMC team for the tests. Under the guidance of assistant commissioner Vijay Humne, the team of NMC that conducted the tests comprised Dr Radhika Brijwar, Dr Roshan Ingle, Dr Vivek Nimje, Dr Nitesh Kanoje, Dr Gunjan Malviya, Dr Snehal Pawar, Karan Gupta, Tarun Nirmal and Anirban Ghosh. Collector Ravindra Thakre has started visiting major towns of the district and holding meetings with officials to prevent rise in cases. He visited Kamptee, Butibori, Hingna, Wadi, Wanadongri, Saoner, Khapa, Mohpa and Kalmeshwar. A team of 52 members has also continued visiting villages in rural parts of the district and monitoring the situation. As per press release of the district administration, necessary preparations are on for projected third wave. “There were 989 beds for Covid patients in the district in April last year. Number of beds increased to 7,730 as on May 30 this year. Oxygen beds were 805 in April last year which are now around 4,810. Number of beds in ICU has increased by 92%. The ICU beds increased from 184 in April last year to 2,314. Similarly, beds with ventilators increased from 87 to 579,” the press release said. The press release added capacity of oxygen increased from 58 metric tonne last year to 160 metric tonne this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-detected-2k-superspreaders-before-the-unlock/articleshow/83382558.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

With the Telangana government announcing that orphans and women who lost their spouses to the virus would get government help, many turned up to share their heart-wrenching stories. Hyderabad collector Sweta Mohanty could barely hold back her tears as some kids as young as three years walked inside clutching the hands of their caregivers. Sunitha* and Anitha* were two such siblings who lost both their parents and had come to meet the collector after a survey team traced them. “Death has come as a shock to me. I never expected my grandchildren to become orphans. I am 65 years and I am taking care of their welfare, but how long,” their grandmother wept, as she narrated her tale. Ten-year-old Sanjiv*, who until a few months ago was playing at a park with his dad, now depends on his neighbours. “There is no smile on his face. He has become stoic,” said his caregiver. City officials of women development and child welfare (WDCW) had carried out a survey with Anganwadi teachers in Hyderabad district to identify children who lost their parents to Covid-19. “A total of 200 children have been identified as orphans. These children have lost either mothers or fathers and become semi orphans. Some children became orphans after they lost both mother and father,” project director, WDCW & disabled welfare T Akkeshwar Rao told TOI. All these orphans hail from different city areas such as Charminar, Saidabad and Falaknuma. A helpline has been created to identify such orphans and numbers are being displayed in some 500 hospitals, he said. Collector Mohanty distributed grocery kits, which contains 18 essential commodities, to the custodians of these orphans. “Free education will be provided to all these orphans. Apart from this, scholarships will also be provided to them,” the collector said. She also assured jobs to widows (who lost their spouses to Covid-19) in WDCW department as ‘outsourcing employees’ and directed officials of the department concerned to work out modalities and recruit them on priority. “Survey on orphans will be continued, and dependents can approach us directly, to get assistance,” said Mohanty.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Sikar boy humiliated, forced to dress up as woman in public||JAIPUR: A minor boy in Sikar was publicly humiliated by villagers who forced him to dress up as a woman and made him wear bangles. The alleged incident was shot on a mobile phone by one of the suspects present at the spot and it quickly went viral on local social media groups. An FIR was registered at Patan police station on Tuesday when the family saw the video of the public punishment. According to the local police, the villagers had accused the boy of trying to elope with a married girl. They decided to teach the boy a lesson by allegedly penalising him in front of other people. The incident is said to have taken place sometime earlier this month. As per the complaint, iron chains were put around the boy’s neck before a few villagers allegedly put bangles on his arms. The boy was later forced to dress up as a woman when villagers handed him over a ghagra. Police are treating the boy as a minor because his age could not be verified. He comes from a nomadic family and the police said they likely to rely on medical experts to confirm the age. Additional SP Ratan Lal said while an FIR was registered against the suspects involved in publicly humiliating the boy, a complaint was also filed against the boy by the girl’s relatives. “The girl’s relatives have also filed a complaint against the boy. We are investigating the matter. The FIR was quickly registered when the video came to our notice,” he said. Patan police said a few suspects had been detained. Attempts are being made to identify other unnamed suspects who attended the incident and participated in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sikar-boy-humiliated-forced-to-dress-up-as-woman-in-public/articleshow/83384073.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: CCP plans to replant more trees hit by Tauktae||PANAJI: After the successful replanting of the uprooted Copper Pod tree on 18th June Road in Panaji on Tuesday, CCP is exploring if other fallen trees can be revived and will even plant new ones in the place of those lost. There were a total of 132 big and small trees uprooted in Panaji due to the impact of Cyclone Tauktae last month. A team of botanists are currently in the process of voluntarily checking the rest of the fallen trees for signs of life. “If they are fit and worth restoring, we will replant them. If they are unable to survive, we will plant new trees there. We intend to double the plantation to make up for the lost trees,” CCP commissioner Agnelo Fernandes told TOI. TOI had reported on Wednesday that the century-old Copper Pod tree was replanted in its original spot after horticulturist Daniel D’Souza discovered it to be living, and appealed to the CCP to help save it. Citizen volunteers from the Goa Green Brigade—who were present at the re-rooting of a 90-year-old banyan tree in Arambol last year—joined hands to help restore the Panaji tree back to its former glory. D’Souza said that CCP must compile a list of all the trees that have been uprooted to keep a detailed inventory. “The CCP must plant the fallen trees in a phased manner as soon as possible. These are old heritage trees that have seen the rise and fall of Panaji over the decades. If we can save an entire tree, there should be efforts made to salvage it, because planting a young sapling will take decades to reach its prime. Replanting the same tree will also retain the streetscape,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ccp-plans-to-replant-more-trees-hit-by-tauktae/articleshow/83384088.cms||Nida Sayed

Members of All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) and the Tamil Nadu Ambedkar Sanitary Workers Association took part in protests across the state. Workers are not provided safety gear, mainly gloves, said AITUC district secretary N Chandran. “Corporation officials should check oxygen level of the workers using oximeter every morning and ensure that the workers have safety gear before deploying them for work,” he said. Seven sanitary workers had died of Covid-19 in the city, said general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Ambedkar Sanitary Workers Association R Tamil Nadu Selvam. “But the death certificate of only one of them state that he died of Covid. According to authorities, others had died of kidney failure and breathing trouble even though they were admitted to hospitals after testing positive for the infection. Because of this, their families won’t be able to get the government’s financial assistance.” “The government order states that the benefits are extended only to those directly involved in Covid-19 work. We don’t know whether all workers are included in it. The government should extend the benefits to all the workers of the municipal administration department,” Selvam said. “The government should give preference to sanitary workers and take steps to vaccinate all of them. It should provide government job to one of the family members of the deceased and provide Rs 25 lakh ex gratia.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sanitary-workers-stage-protests-seek-benefits/articleshow/83382526.cms||Nivedha Selvam

Santosh on Wednesday held a meeting with MLAs to assess the organisational strength in the respective constituencies. Santosh’s two-day trip is part of his visits to poll-bound states to review the political situation ahead of elections. Sources said that he will hold one-on-one meetings with the ministers to take feedback on the government functioning and political situation. Later, he will also meet the BJP core committee. Sources said that he will assess the political situation, and accordingly a strategy would be formulated for the assembly elections. Ministers speaking openly of lack of firm decision and non-clearing of files is also one issue Santosh will have to deal with as it comes six months before the next assembly polls. The government’s handling of the Covid situation, especially during the second wave in which more than 2,800 persons have died, is one issue of discussion. Differences of opinion between CM Pramod Sawant and health minister Vishwajit Rane over Covid management had led to severe criticism against the government.

In an appeal filed in the apex court through advocate Nitin Saluja, the petitioners said they were not opposed to the project and only wanted stay on construction during the lockdown as it had the potential of being a super spreader of Covid-19 but the HC wrongly passed adverse observations against them and called their petition "motivated". Terming it as a “vital and essential project of national importance", Delhi High Court on May 31 dismissed the plea against the Central Vista project. "The construction of the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project cannot be seen in isolation. In fact, the whole project is an essential project of national importance. Public is vitally interested in this project," it had said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pil-on-central-vista-now-in-apex-court/articleshow/83414222.cms||---
---||Mumbai||BMC to trace 50,000-60,000 in Mumbai who skipped 2nd shot||MUMBAI: As many as 50,000-60,000 people in Mumbai have not turned up for their second shot of the Covid-19 vaccine despite completing the interval between two doses. The BMC, which has allowed walk-ins for those eligible for the second shot, has now launched a drive to trace the ‘dropouts’. Of Mumbai’s 93.5 lakh adult population, 31% have taken the first shot while 8% have taken both (7.9 lakh). Ward offices have now been entrusted with calling up people to inquire why they have not taken the second shot. Dr Sheela Jagtap, who heads the city’s immunisation department, said it was important to probe why second dose numbers were low and if it was due to glitches, duplications in registration, simply fear or some other factors. “We have created seven categories listing the probable reasons why one may not have got vaccinated. It includes pregnancy, Covid infection, unwillingness to take the vaccine, willingness to take it in a day or two, those untraceable, vaccinated but CoWin doesn’t reflect complete status,” she said. So far, the share of those ‘untraceable’ appears to be high, she added. And dropouts are slightly higher among Covaxin recipients. Surprisingly, healthcare and frontline workers account for a hefty share of dropouts. Of 1.9 lakh healthcare and 2.3 lakh frontline workers who took the first dose, only 64% and 55% respectively have taken the second. Immunisation for healthcare staff started on January 16 while for frontline workers, on February 3. Duplication in entries could be a reason for these two categories, said Dr Jagtap, adding that if one has registered with different numbers or identity documents, it may not show. Calls to citizens have also yielded some interesting responses. Ward officials said one of the topmost reasons why many—particularly from slums—did not come for the second dose was lack of awareness and confusion about the specified gap between the two shots. “Several people told us they were not sure if it was 84 days or 90 days or more since it has changed so many times. Many were simply unaware that they had to return for a second shot,” said Dr Mahendra Khandade, N ward’s medical officer of health (MOH). Another ward officer said they have come across a handful saying they were wary of the side-effects. “They were not exactly reluctant to take the vaccine, but were simply delaying it fearing the side-effects. Few were travelling so they couldn't take it,” he said. Dr Bhupendra Patil, MOH of M west ward, said with cases declining, there was also lack of urgency among some. Dr Jagtap said insufficient stocks were not a reason since priority has been given to second dose recipients. They can walk in directly on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-to-trace-50-60k-in-mumbai-who-skipped-2nd-shot/articleshow/83384402.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Ahmedabad||Covid relief: Gujarat may cut school fee this year too||AHMEDABAD: After cutting school fees by 25% last year, the state government is planning to some reduction in school fees this year too. “The government is looking at reducing fees for parents of school students this year as well. The reduction will be in the range of 10% to 15% on the pre-Covid fees. The government will take a final decision after talking to stakeholders,” said a senior government official privy to the matter. This decision was taken with a view of the Covid-19 situation in the state, especially the second wave, when businesses and jobs were affected due to travel and other restrictions. There are some 20,000 self-financed schools in the state which will be affected by the government’s decision, sources said. According to Jatin Bharad, vice-president of Self-Financed School Management of Gujarat, the schools associated with them have already given reduced fees of students whose parents have died due to Covid-19. He said schools are also looking at giving relief to students whose families are facing financial issues on a case-to-case basis. In September last year, the state government directed all private schools to cut annual school fees by 25% for the academic year 2020-2021. The move was expected to benefit more than the parents of more than 30 lakh schoolchildren. The decision was taken at the state cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Vijay Rupani in view of the representation of parents of students at all private schools in the state. The government’s decision last year came after the Gujarat high court refused to intervene in the matter and asked the state government to decide on revising school fees. While disposing of an application seeking the court’s intervention on the fee issue, the HC said the government can take an “independent decision” under the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act, which are in force due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In August, the high court quashed a government order which prohibited private schools from collecting tuition fees till they reopened. The court also asked the government to sit with representatives of private schools and find a solution to the fee issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/school-fee-cut-likely-this-year-too/articleshow/83382603.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The directions referred to an action plan submitted by a committee headed by Dr MM Kutty, former chief secretary of Delhi, for controlling air pollution due to crop residue burning in Delhi-NCR and neighbouring areas. Among the directions issued, Tiwari said that a farm machinery bank should be set up since there are 14 different kinds of equipment that are required for management of crop residue. The government will provide a grant of 50% to individual farmers and 80% to farmer producer organisations for purchase of equipment. Cooperative committees, cane committees and gram panchayats will also be given a grant of 80% of purchase of machinery of up to Rs 5 lakh. The machinery should be purchased by September 30, 2021. Tiwari has said that the ‘parali lo, khad do’ system used in Unnao last year should be replicated in all districts where for two trucks of residue farmers should get one truck of manure from cow shelters. At least one lakh tons of residue should be sent to cow shelters this year. The crop residue can be used as fodder, for composting and making biofuel etc. It can also be composed in the field. Super straw management system should be attached to the combined harvester during harvesting, he said. Tiwari added that an awareness campaign should be started in villages to make farmers aware of the law against burning residue and its harmful impact on air, soil and human health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/parali-lo-khad-do-system-to-check-air-pollution-cs/articleshow/83384121.cms||---

In fact, the two states reported negative wastage of Covid vaccines by making use of the “extra dose” available as a wastage factor in each vial. Official data for May show Kerala and West Bengal standing in sharp contrast to states like Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh which recorded a high 33.9% and 15.7% wastage respectively. The wastage for other states is lower, but still on the higher side like in Madhya Pradesh (7.3%) and Punjab (7%). Doing better, but still short of the optimum 1% suggested by the Centre are Delhi (3.9%), Gujarat (3.6%), Rajasthan (3.9%) and UP (3.7%). Government sources said the closing balance of shots with various states was 212 lakh. The month saw a poor rate of vaccination due to a switch to a new procurement system — since abandoned — and a fear of infection that kept people indoors. The closing balance of vaccines was less at 80 lakh in April. However, it was higher in February and March, with the latter marked by a misplaced sense of complacency that the infection had ebbed. This had resulted in vaccination slots going unutilised. The first dose coverage of the 45-plus population stands at 38%, with Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Bihar and Assam lagging at sub- 30% levels. Better performing states include Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Karnataka. Second dose coverage among front-line workers stands at 45%, with Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Kerala and MP being the better performing states. First dose coverage is at 84%. Worryingly, second dose coverage for healthcare workers is only 56% while for first dose it is 81%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-west-bengal-used-extra-dose-reported-negative-vax-wastage/articleshow/83387809.cms||---

Earlier this week, the government’s decision to have ‘mass promotion’ on school leaving certificates of Class X students came under fire. The board had, in an earlier circular to schools, stated that the leaving certificate has to state that students were promoted to the higher class and should state mass promotion as the reason for leaving school. However, the school management association protested the decision and said the leaving certificate was a document of the student and is used to certify their birth date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-mass-promotion-tag-on-lcs/articleshow/83382634.cms||---

The state has approved revised cost of Rs268.68 crore for these projects. NMC's garbage composting project gets a nod from the state governmentMunicipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “Urban development department issued notification revising the projects a few days ago. We are contemplating whether to develop and operate the projects under engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) model, or performance oriented model. Work to prepare the tenders will start after finalizing the model. We will also table a proposal before general body informing about the model.” The civic chief said target is to commission the projects within nine months. “It will take at least two months for completion of tendering process and six months for construction,” he said. For last many years, garbage generated in the city has been dumped at Bhandewadi yard due to lack of reuse and scientific disposal systems. It is causing pollution as well as revenue loss. As per NMC’s data, around 1,250 metric tonne garbage is generated in the city daily. Under Swachh Bharat Mission, NMC had proposed to develop waste-to-energy project in 2014 and also got approval from the government. Nagpur Solid Waste Processing and Management Private Ltd (NSWPMPL), a joint venture with Noida-based Essel Infraprojects Limited and Japan-based Hitachi Zosan India Private Ltd, was awarded the contract in May 2017. Also, the plan was to develop biogas plant and compost plant. The government had approved these projects at a cost of Rs231.2 crore under Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan. NSWPMPL failed to develop waste-to-energy project. In June last year, the civic body terminated the contract with the company and submitted a revised proposal to the government. Some days ago, the government approved the revised proposal. Now, NMC will develop waste-to-compost project with capacity of 600 tonne per day (TPD), MRF with capacity of 380 TPD, and C&D with capacity of 150 TPD. Also, the government has approved funds for development of sanitary landfill sites. NMC can scientifically dispose of the waste which cannot be reused at these sites. Thus, NMC will be able to reuse and dispose of remaining unused garbage, and no garbage will be dumped as it is.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-approves-nmcs-garbage-composting-recycling-projects/articleshow/83382696.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Hyderabad||T HC strength goes up to 42, vacancies to touch 28||New Delhi: Chief Justice of India N V Ramana has approved increasing the sanctioned strength of Telangana High Court, groaning under a pendency of more than 2.3 lakh cases, from 24 to 42 judges, an unprecedented increase of 75%. However, against the current sanctioned strength of 24 judges, the HC has only 14 judges, including Chief Justice Hima Kohli. With the sanctioned strength getting increased to 42, there will be a huge vacancy of 28 posts in the HC. The increased strength of 42 judges in the HC will comprise 32 permanent and 10 additional judges. Of the 42, as many as 28 will be selected from among lawyers and the rest will be elevated from state judicial services, law ministry sources said. The proposal to increase the sanctioned strength of the HC was lying dormant for more than two years and Justice Ramana, immediately after taking oath as CJI, revived it and requested the ministry to process it expeditiously keeping in mind the large pendency of cases. The proposal for increasing the sanctioned strength was initiated by then HC Chief Justice T B N Radhakrishnan on February 19, 2019. The state chief minister and governor had endorsed the proposal, which was examined by the law ministry. However, it remained dormant as the ministry opined that it would be expedient to fill the vacancies rather than increase the sanctioned strength. The matter got revived after a letter from the chief minister to the PM. But the ministry in November 2019 said it would be better to prioritise filling up of existing vacancies. For the next two years, neither the vacancies got filled nor the sanctioned strength was increased and litigants were left in the lurch with delayed delivery of justice. “CJI Ramana, soon after assuming charge, reviewed all proposals relating to judiciary pending at different levels. He took up a host of issues with the PM and the law minister, including the proposal for increasing the sanctioned strength of Telangana HC. Both the PM and the law minister agreed to expeditiously examine the pending proposals,” a Supreme Court source said. The CJI wrote to law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on May 27 highlighting the delay in increasing the sanctioned strength of Telangana HC. “The CJI opined that the current strength, even after all the vacancies are filled, is highly inadequate to address the pendency. Pendency has gone up alarmingly to 2.37 lakh cases. Quoting from earlier communications, the CJI affirmed that the necessary infrastructure is in place to accommodate 42 judges in Telangana HC,” the source said. Within days, the ministry concurred with the CJI and took the proposal for increasing the sanctioned strength to 42 to the logical conclusion. The CJI gave his approval for the increase on Tuesday. Having achieved the desired result on paper, a more daunting task awaits the judiciary — to put in place all 42 judges in the HC. For a long time, the collegium mechanism for selecting candidates for appointment as HC judges has been out of sync with vacancy positions, even after the SC on the judicial side made efforts to fast track the process. So much so that against a sanctioned strength of 1,079 HC judges, the working strength is less than 700. Unless the vacancies are filled up expeditiously, the monster of pendency can hardly be tamed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hc-strength-goes-up-to-42-vacancies-to-touch-28/articleshow/83385731.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Registration for MHT-CET starts; exam dates not out||MUMBAI: The state’s CET cell has started the registration process for MHT-CET, even as HSC students await the government’s assessment formula for their board results. Scores of MHT-CET 2021 will be used for admissions to engineering, pharmacy and agricultural courses in the state. Aspirants can register for CET till July 7. The notification, though, did not mention exam dates. The registration process for entrance exams for other courses such as law, BEd and MBA is likely to commence in a week or 10 days. Last year, around 5.3 lakh students registered for MHT-CET and eventually only 3.8 lakh appeared for the test due to the delay. MHT-CET was held in October last year. In a recent interaction with mediapersons, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant said the state CET cell will conduct the entrance tests for professional courses by July-end or August first week. A government official said they wanted to start off with the registration process for MHT-CET as the registration numbers are the highest. Last year, more than 6.9 lakh students had registered for various entrance exams, and of these, 5.3 lakh were for MHT-CET alone. “Once we get an idea about the total number of students taking the test, it will be easier for us to schedule it, depending on the Covid situation,” said the official. The National Testing Agency is yet to declare the exam dates for two rounds of JEE (Main) and NEET taken by engineering and medical aspirants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-registration-for-mht-cet-starts-exam-dates-not-out/articleshow/83380540.cms||---

When they were returning, they were confronted by police, who did not consider it a valid reason to go out, and booked them for violation of the curfew. According to the FIR filed with Vastrapur police, the cops were deployed at Sanjivani Hospital T-junction in Vastrapur when they saw an SUV. The cops stopped the vehicle and inquird with the driver and the man siting next to him. “They introduced themselves as Bharat Ahuja, 45, and Ranjit Ahuja, 31, from Sardarnagar. They told us they went to sort a domestic quarrel of their sister’s, which took time and they got delayed,” the FIR states. The FIR says as this was not a valid reason to be out during the curfew, they were booked for violation of the curfew notification under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with charges under the Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act. An Vastrapur police officer said they have been coming across many such cases where people give such reasons which cannot be considered valid. “The curfew notification issued by city police commissioner has said we are to act sensitively with people found violating the curfew. If people give certain reasons for violating the curfew, we are to crosscheck them, and if we find them valid, we let the person go,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/brothers-go-to-solve-sisters-dispute-held/articleshow/83382645.cms||---

Singh said that farmers are getting compensation directly in their bank accounts which has shut shops of the middlemen and brokers,” he said. Akhilesh slammed the government for harassing farmers in the name of wheat procurement. He cited examples of Asodhara sub-mandi in Fatehpur where, he claimed, weighing of foodgrain was closed on May 29. “Also, the purchased foodgrain, which has been left in the open, got damaged in rains,” he said. Singh, however,maintained that the SP leader was making statements which did not hold any ground and were mainly aimed at inciting farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-says-bjp-is-anti-farmer-bjp-retorts/articleshow/83384162.cms||---

Odedara was earlier a media professional but now doesn’t have any job. Divyesh Desai, a resident of JMC Nagar near Raiya Crossroads in Rajkot, filed a complaint against Odedara. Desai, who runs a milk parlour, told the cops that he and Odedara had gotten into heated arguments two days ago over car parking issue. On Wednesday, the duo again got into arguments following which Odedara pointed a revolver towards Desai. The police said that Odedara has a license for his revolver.

---||Ahmedabad||AES files appeal over ruling that it is under RTI purview||AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Education Society (AES) has filed an appeal in the Gujarat high court against a single-judge bench’s decision that the trust falls under the purview of the Right to Information (RTI) Act because it gets government grants for some of its institutions. AES is one of the oldest and the largest education trusts of the city and runs education institutes as well as a private varsity, Ahmedabad University. On May 22, a single-judge bench turned down AES’s petition against the state information commission’s order that its institute, LD Museum of Indology, is liable to part with information under RTI laws because it is a public authority. The issue arose as soon as the RTI Act came into being in 2005. A year later, AES challenged in the high court its status as a trust falling under the purview of RTI laws. After a 15-year legal battle, a single-judge bench turned down AES’s petition holding that since its institutions receive 100% government grants from the state government, the institute and trust will be covered under the definition of public authority under Section 2(h)(d)(i) of the Act. AES challenged the order before the division bench and senior advocate Devan Parikh submitted that only seven of its many education institutes receive government grants. These seven institutes have appointed public information officers, but the other institutes are self-financed. These few institutes are not substantially financed. Merely because a few institutes of the trust are run on public money, the entire society cannot be treated as a public authority and the liability of the RTI laws can be thrust upon it. The HC issued notice to the state government, admitted the appeal and ordered that the effect of the single judge’s order as well as the state information commission’s order remain stayed. The court said that since the information commission’s order has been stayed since 2006, the arrangement may continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aes-files-appeal-over-ruling-that-it-is-under-rti-purview/articleshow/83382672.cms||---

Increase in exports of petroleum, pharmaceutical and chemical products pushed up the overall exports from the 20 SEZs operational within the state. The exports from Reliance SEZ increased by 36% from Rs 10,203 crore in April to 13,869 crore in May. During the same period, Zydus SEZ, which is a pharmaceutical SEZ, saw its exports grow from Rs 396 crore to Rs 443 crore, while Dahej SEZ’s exports moved up from Rs 585 crore to Rs 757 crore. However, exports from GIFT and TCS SEZs located in Gandhinagar as well as Surat SEZ in Surat and Sterling SEZ in Bharuch witnessed a declined in May on month-on-month basis, the government data further showed. On year-on-year basis, the cumulative exports jumped 143% due to low-base effect as the exports remained muted at Rs 7,594 crore in May last year due to lockdown-induced disruptions. “Several countries such as the US and Dubai have opened up their markets for exports. The demand from such overseas markets pushed up overall SEZ exports in May. Most SEZs in Gujarat are geared up to meet this growing demand,” said sources aware of the matter. “There has also been a diversion of orders, especially in pharmaceuticals, chemicals and other sectors, from China to India as well,” said sources. According to sources, many industrial units in SEZs have aligned themselves with the demand in the international market. Most of them have the flexibility of adapting to the international demand. SEZ are also working hard to make up for the losses incurred in last financial year due to the pandemic and the industrial units in these SEZs are capturing all the possible opportunities in the export market to cover the last year’s losses. For entire 2020-21, the cumulative exports — both merchandise and services — from the functional SEZs in Gujarat plummeted to Rs 1.27 lakh crore from Rs 1.57 crore in 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-exports-from-sezs-surge-20-in-may/articleshow/83384215.cms||Kalpesh Damor

In all, the number of workers rose from 2.5 lakh in May to 14 lakh in June, suggesting that on an average 50,000 to 60,000 workers were engaged every day during the second wave. This was a leap of around six times within a span of less than a month. Last year, UP had set an all-time record of generating nearly 40 crore man days despite the pandemic and lockdown. According to the state government records, 17,980 gram panchayats had an engagement of just over 2.49 lakh MNREGS workers on May 10. This went up to over 13.45 lakh in 53,099 gram panchayats by June 5. Additional chief secretary, rural development, Manoj Kumar Singh said that the department was working aggressively to create as many as possible man days under MNREGS. He said that developmental activities with the help of MNREGS will be accelerated in villages which are free of corona pandemic. Officials said that the rise in job generation under MNREGS got the much needed push even as the state government focussed on saving life as well as the livelihood. MNREGS has been the biggest spinner of job during the first wave of Covid pandemic. The scheme gained much traction after the Yogi Adityanath government moved in to pursue skill mapping of a large number of migrants who came back to the state following the nation-wide corona-induced lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-records-six-time-jump-in-mnregs-works-in-a-month/articleshow/83384202.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra government seeks more time to repay MBBS students’ fees||NAGPUR: The wait for 112 MBBS students from general category across Maharashtra for reimbursement of their fees just got longer. For over one year and eight months, despite a warning from the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court Maharashtra government has failed to reimburse their fees as promised in a government resolution (GR) issued on September 20, 2019. All of them had taken admissions in various private colleges after they failed to get a seat in open category due to introduction of ‘Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC)’ quota by then Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government in state and EWS (open) quota by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government at Centre. As a one time measure, the then government assured to pay their fees over and above that charged by Government Medical Colleges and Hospitals (GMCH). About Rs 32 crore were supposedly allocated towards reimbursement of their fees. Accordingly, these students paid first year fees in lakhs from their own pockets. On Tuesday, the Maharashtra government filed an affidavit seeking more time for reimbursing the fees stating that “it’s under process”. Filed by GMCH associate professor Dr Manoj Jiwtode, it informed that the cabinet led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had approved the September 20, 2019, GR by issuing another one on October 9. The Medical Education and Drugs Department has to make financial provision for reimbursement. “For this, it is necessary to obtain permission from various departments-- Finance, Planning and accountant general (AG). A proposal has been accordingly moved by the department and is under process, which may take some time. After the cabinet approval to GR, candidates’ objections have been invited. The scrutiny of objections received is under process by the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER),” he said. He added that after the orders are issued, it was proposed to start a new scheme for reimbursement to candidates. Dr Jiwtode’s affidavit was submitted in response to a plea filed by 19 MBBS students from NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences (NKPSIMS) and three others from Panjabrao Deshmukh Medical College (PDMC) in Amravati through counsel Ashwin Deshpande. The lawyer contended that the colleges were now again pressurizing the students for the payment and the amount had now accumulated to crores. Fortunately for the aggrieved students, HC had restrained the colleges from recovering the fees from students as an interim measure on July 13 last year. On November 3, 2020, the HC issued an ultimatum to the government to reimburse fees within three weeks or it will summon the Medical Education and Drugs Department’s principal secretary. Since then, nothing moved and not a rupee has been paid, the lawyer said. According to the petitioners, the total seats of 50% quota for general category students were reduced due to implementation of Maratha and EWS reservations, and they lost the chance to get admission despite scoring merit marks. Subsequently, they were forced to take admission in private colleges by paying much higher fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-seeks-more-time-to-repay-mbbs-students-fees/articleshow/83382705.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Presiding over a review meeting, Sharma said the image of the state government had improved after it acted with sensitivity during the second wave of coronavirus pandemic. “People are appreciating the efforts of the power department which is committed to providing round the clock power supply,” he said. The minister, however, expressed displeasure over reports of prolonged power outages in some parts of the state, especially rural areas. Sharma directed UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) chairman, M Devraj, to ensure power supply to rural areas between sunset and sunrise. “Electricity supply should be ensured in different areas as per the roster. Farmers should not face any power crisis for irrigation purpose,” he said. The minister also stressed on the need for fixing of responsibility on the officials of the distribution companies who fail to provide electricity bill to the consumers on a timely basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/energy-min-officials-must-be-sensitive/articleshow/83384232.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Now, offices in Dorm-15; new row awakens||AHMEDABAD: Student dormitory number 15 (Dorm-15), a part of the Louis Kahn designed IIM-A campus, will soon be turned into faculty offices. The institute revealed its decision in a recent communication to the students residing in the dormitory. “Hence, we are planning to shift the occupants of Dorm-15 to their desired rooms (based on availability),” the institute said in an e-mailed communication to the students. The decision has not gone down well with many students, alumni, architects, and other stakeholders. This is the only dorm where restoration work was successfully carried out in 2018. So the stakeholders say there is little reason to shift the students to other dormitories. “The campus was in a micro-containment zone due to the high number of Covid-19 cases in April,” said an IIM-A alumnus who is aware of the development. “The institute has switched to online classes and most of the students are home as this is the vacation time. Students are asked to move at a time like this. It’s preposterous.” When contacted, an IIM-A official did not comment. The IIM-A had in December 2020 announced its plans to demolish 14 of the 18 student dormitories citing safety concerns. The board of governors of the IIM-A put the plans on hold following a massive global outcry. The board later said it will re-evaluate the decision. Two months ago, the institute came up with a tender document to ensure ‘structural safety’ of Dorm-15 and Vikram Sarabhai Library. This decision comes two years after the library was lauded by Unesco as a model restoration project. The conservation work for both the structures was given to the same Mumbai-based architectural firm. “Dorm-15 is a good example of how renovation can work well and why there is no need to demolish the Louis Kahn dorms,” said Bakul Dholakia, former director of IIM-A. “The dorm is being vacated for faculty offices. Students have just been informed and are upset because they are losing close-knit dorm mates at a time when these relationships matter more than ever.” This is not the first time that student dormitories will house faculty offices. Way back in 1982, some dorms, including Dorm-12, were used as offices for some time, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-offices-in-dorm-15-new-row-awakens/articleshow/83384245.cms||Maulik Pathak

In just one week alone, the chief commissioner of land administration (CCLA), which is part of the revenue department, has received as many as 20,000 applications. “Most of the grievances are on non-receipt of passbooks due to digitally unsigned land records, not linking of Aadhaar number, entry of wrong Aadhaar number, private patta land registered under the prohibited land list and land encroachment, etc,” a senior CCLA official told TOI. While 17,000 grievances were received on WhatsApp number (9133089444), another 3,000 applications were filed on ascmro@telangana.gov.in, sources said. Officials said the district collectors and respective revenue officials have been asked to resolve the grievances. “Some problems such as Aadhaar linking and updation of bank number for getting Rythu Bandhu benefit can be resolved immediately. Removal of land parcels from prohibited properties list involves a cumbersome procedure which may take several weeks to resolve,” a senior revenue officer said. Interestingly, in some cases, officials are asking the complainants to apply on Dharani web portal and produce documents in some other cases. If they have already applied, they have been asked to submit a letter copy or grievance number, etc. “My one acre land was illegally transferred to another person two years ago and a passbook was also issued. My case has been pending with the revenue office for the last two years but the tahsildar office is not aware of status of my petition,” landowner Palepu Vaman Murthy, who hails from Dharmapuri in Jagtial district, said. The government, on the other hand, claims to have resolved the land issues after the Land Records Updation Programme and said 99 per cent of them have been uploaded on Dharani portal. “If the government has resolved all land issues, why did the revenue department receive thousands of applications in just one week. Our information is that the total number of applications received so far has crossed 60,000,” S Chandrasekhar, founder-member of India Against Corruption Volunteers Association, told TOI. He said the revenue department started receiving grievances on WhatsApp and through mail only after minister KT Rama Rao started getting pleas on land-related issues on his Twitter handle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ahead-of-digital-land-survey-revenue-dept-gets-20k-plaints/articleshow/83385786.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai rain: Crores spent by BMC, all washed away||MUMBAI: The BMC’s tall claims of making the city flood-free went for a toss on Wednesday as several locations reported flooding and waterlogging. While chronic spots like Hindmata and Sion’s Gandhi Market were flooded, several other areas from Andheri to Mulund reported waterlogging a day after the BMC announced it had carried out 104% desilting this year. With BMC elections scheduled in February next year, BJP slammed the Shiv Sena-ruled BMC. “The business of cut commission has been exposed in the first rain. There has been Rs 1,000 crore corruption in the last five years in desilting works. Every year, Rs 70-100 crore are spent on cleaning drains, apart from money spent on repairing storm water drains (SWD). There was flooding even in areas where it doesn’t usually flood,” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar. Times ViewEvery year, the BMC comes up with excuses when, invariably, the first burst of heavy rain exposes its claims. But this year, it had adequate time to carry out pre-monsoon work, and the lockdown meant it could not cite movement as a reason hampering works. The BMC should have ensured zero or little waterlogging at chronic spots across the city, or at least that the water recedes faster. Hundreds of crores have been spent on flood prevention initiatives, but these have failed to deliver. With the full monsoon ahead, corrective measures must be taken and stern action initiated against errant officials and contractors.While BMC chief Iqbal Chahal had reviewed the city’s monsoon preparedness on Monday, the BMC had claimed it had removed around 3.24 lakh tonnes of silt from the city’s drains and completed 104% of desilting works. The prime flooding spots of Hindmata and Gandhi Market were flooded for several hours. This year, BMC had built an underground inlet chamber or a sump at the lowest point, where excess rainwater can be stored and later pumped out via a storm water drain line to a nullah nearby. The BMC was hoping to pump out the rainwater that floods the arterial road using high-powered pumps and flood gates that would prevent sea water from entering the SWD network during high tide. The BMC is spending around Rs 16 crore for this project to ensure Gandhi Market does not flood. “The Rs 16 crore project has missed the deadline. The water at Gandhi Market did not recede even by 5 pm,” said local resident Sridhar Ramamurthy. At Hindmata, BMC is carrying out a Rs 140 crore project, building underground water tanks and an elevated road and increasing capacity of SWDs. In the western suburbs, areas like Santacruz saw flooding. Constructed at a cost of over Rs. 100 crore, the Gazdhar Bandh pumping station at Santacruz failed to give relief to citizens. The pumping station, commissioned in 2019, was intended to provide relief from waterlogging in areas like Khar, Santacruz, Juhu and Andheri. But Gautam Rao of Gazdar Scheme Residents Trust said there was flooding in Guzdar scheme and Saraswat colony despite BMC’s claims in an affidavit that there will be no flooding. BMC chief I S Chahal said, “Despite heavy rain and waterlogging, there was no traffic blockage at Hindmata due to the elevated ramp constructed by BMC. We have just got permission to pay for pipelines below the NTC Mills for the water tanks at St Xavier’s Ground in Parel and Pramod Mahajan Udyan in Dadar. This work will be fast-tracked and provide relief to Hindmata. This is the first time in 15 years that traffic was not blocked at Hindmata.” Flooding was reported in Bandra (E) in housing societies in the backyard of Matoshree, the residence of CM Uddhav Thackeray.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crores-spent-by-bmc-all-washed-away/articleshow/83382756.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NIA gets extension to file chargesheet in bomb scare case||MUMBAI: A special court on Wednesday granted the NIA an extension of 60 days to submit the chargesheet against five arrested accused, including dismissed API Sachin Waze, in the case involving a bomb scare near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia. “The offence is investigated in various dimensions. There are many folds in which investigation is carried out. Because of the complexity of the matter, it requires more time for thorough investigation...,” special judge Prashant R Sitre said. Among grounds to seek extension, the agency cited the pandemic and the lockdown for delay in investigation and in recording statements of witnesses, besides extensive electronic data that needed to be analysed by experts. The NIA’s earlier deadline was to end on June 10. If a chargesheet is not submitted within the stipulated period, the accused can be granted bail. Objecting to the plea, Waze’s advocate Sudeep Pasbola submitted the provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) are not applicable to the case. He also argued that not providing them a copy of the investigation report submitted by the prosecution was denial of their fundamental right. In a separate order, the court denied the accused’s plea to access the “confidential report.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-nia-gets-extension-to-file-chargesheet-in-bomb-scare-case/articleshow/83384292.cms||---

Revenue department seized 18.7 cu m of teak in the form of 192 teak logs from the site. A case was registered against land owner Puthenveetil Shahul Hameed from Koduvally under Kerala Land Conservancy Act and forest department filed another under Prohibition of Selling of Trees Standing on Land Temporarily or Permanently Assigned) Rules1995. It seems the trees were axed months ago and there are 17 teak trees remaining in the plot. The seized timber has been shifted to Kuppadi timber depot. According to department sources, there were 77 reserved trees when the land was assigned during 1960-65 period. Sultan Bathery tahsildar Unnikrishnan PS said that revenue department hadn’t issued permits to fell reserved trees. He said the department is yet to ascertain the date of felling and added that the caretaker of the land has said that the trees were felled as per revenue department order on Oct 24, 2020. The order allowed farmers to fell trees which they had planted in land assigned to them under Kerala Land Assignment Rules 1964 and trees that naturally grew on the land. By misinterpreting the order, a large number of rosewood trees which were up to 500 years old, were felled at Muttil and other places despite that fact that the order allowed farmers to cut the trees which were present on land at the time of assignment, except sandalwood, only if the land owners had remitted the tree value of reserved trees during the time of assignment. Following the widespread misuse of the order, revenue department had revoked the order in Feb. Meanwhile, forest department team probing Muttil tree felling seized the truck, used to transport the illegally-felled rosewood trees from Muttil to Perumbavoor, from Manipurath near Koduvally on Wednesday. It was taken to Wayanad. The truck is owned by Jinish who hails from Koduvally and he is currently abroad. The timber that was transported from Muttil to Perumbavoor was taken into custody by forest department on Feb 8. Forty three cases have been registered in connection with the felling of 101 rosewood trees and 202 cu me of timber have been seized till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/after-muttil-more-trees-felled-in-assigned-land-at-noolpuzha/articleshow/83380916.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra may have discriminated in Amphotericin-B allocation: High Court||NAGPUR: Doubting Maharashtra government’s distribution policy regarding Amphotericin B Liposomal and Lipid Complex, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday expressed possibility of discrimination between districts in supply of the lifesaving drugs. “Prima facie, the chart supplied by the government doesn’t show that distribution is in proportion to the number of black fungus patients in each district. It appears that there are chances of allocation of more injections to certain districts while others received less supply,” said a division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Avinash Gharote. While hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI report where Shreerang Bhandarkar was appointed amicus curiae along with Nidhi Dayani, the bench asked the government to clear the doubts by furnishing district-wise information of active mucormycosis patients. “Government pleader Ketki Joshi informed that the distribution chart is also published daily on the health department’s web portal. We accept her statement and direct modification in the chart format as indicated by us earlier be done forthwith,” said the judges. Earlier, central government had filed two pursis providing details about steps taken to increase Amphotericin production and supply. On June 4, the allocation for Maharashtra was 23,110 vials based on the active caseload of 4,012, which means 5.75 vials per patient. “The state also filed a chart showing district-wise distribution of Amphotericin. The basic difference between the formats adopted by the state and Centre in providing this information lies in the figure of active caseload. While the Centre specified patients under treatment, the state failed to do so. Without disclosing the patient load, any distribution may not serve the purpose. The state would have to adopt the Centre’s format so that nothing is suppressed, nothing is concealed and the distribution comes out in a very transparent manner,” said the judges. “However, the Centre’s distribution chart doesn’t inform us beyond June 4. We request the assistant solicitor general (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar to submit district-wise distribution of this drug to all the states across the country,” said the HC. NMC, pvt hospitals told to resolve issues amicably On the complaints of overcharging by private hospitals, NMC counsel Sudhir Puranik informed the court that a majority of hospitals were not responding to its notices seeking information about patients, treatment cost etc and replying in “irresponsible manner”. The HC then directed both the parties to amicably resolve all issues. Puranik said NMC had sought information necessary for appropriately dealing with more than 450 complaints of overcharging by private hospitals. Opposing his contentions, IMA counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni said all hospitals are ready to cooperate, but their concerns should be addressed by the civic body on priority. “We’re of the view that in this difficult time, instead of treading on a course of friction, it is better that this issue is resolved cordially. If patients’ complaints are provided to the hospitals, they would be in a better position to give specific replies. The authorities along with IMA and VHA representatives may sit across the table for resolving the disputes,” said the judges. The court asked NMC to provide complaints to the hospitals, who would reply within a week and if any issue remained unresolved, the HC would deal with it. “An endeavour shall be made to resolve the issues through deliberations and discussions. Any non-cooperation from the hospitals shall be viewed seriously and some penal consequences may also follow,” the bench warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-may-have-discriminated-in-ampho-b-allocation-hc/articleshow/83382799.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Roads waterlogged, traffic a mess, train & bus services hit||MUMBAI: On the very day the weather bureau declared the onset of monsoon over Mumbai, over 220 mm rain brought the city to its knees. A waterlogged city limping back to work after new Covid relaxations was halted in its tracks. Till late Wednesday night, senior citizens of Sindhi Colony in Chembur awaited help as 4 ft water entered their homes, damaging furniture and belongings. Resident Jagmohan Singh Choudhary said, “Several calls made to the civic disaster management have yielded no result. If there is an emergency, how will elders be moved out?” Trains ground to a stop on Central Railway, BEST buses broke down in numbers, road traffic came to a crawl and people could not step out as streets were flooded. Thirty-odd tree falls and 6 wall collapses were reported. Yearly flooding sites like Sion-Kurla, Chunabhatti, King’s Circle, Hindmata, Guzder Bandh, Andheri Subway, Linking Road, Asalpha Road, Govandi and Dharavi went under. CM Uddhav Thackeray visited the disaster control room at BMC headquarters and urged officers to ensure water drained quickly, traffic remained smooth and care of Covid patients was not hampered. BMC chief I S Chahal and mayor Kishori Pednekar together visited the perennial flooding spot at Hindmata. Chahal said, “Sion and Chunabhatti recorded 60mm rain in one hour from 9-10 am causing rainwater to flood the tracks. At Andheri subway, construction of Mogra pumping station is the only answer. Tenders are out and in 2 years, the situation will improve. An elevated road has been constructed at Hindmata, so even if 3 ft of water accumulates, traffic does not come to a halt.” Pednekar said they had faced shortage of manpower for pre-monsoon work amid the lockdown, yet managed to complete it in time. She said, “Only if water does not drain in four hours can it be said that pre-monsoon work is improper. That is not the case. Earlier it would take days to clear, now water drains out in a few hours.” CR services were suspended on the main and harbour lines due to waterlogging at Sion-Kurla and Chunabhatti. Here, pumps installed by BMC not only failed to work, but in some instances, pumped rainwater onto tracks. RPF helped stranded passengers. Long distance trains were rescheduled or cancelled. Trains on the fast line corridor between CSMT-Kalyan and beyond restarted at 8.15 pm. BEST commuters were inconvenienced by the ‘no standees’ rule imposed due to Covid-19. A woman stranded in Sion said, “They should have relaxed rules for emergency situations like today, when women and children were waiting in ankle-deep water.” 50 buses broke down and 88 routes were diverted, said BEST spokesperson Manoj Varade. The international airport witnessed four go-arounds. Waterlogging disrupted vaccination at a centre in Madanpura, said MLA Rais Shaikh. Some centres saw a marginal dip in footfalls, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer. Centres in Ulhasnagar will remain closed for 3 days. KDMC has cancelled vaccination for Thursday. Traffic was disrupted along Western and Eastern Express Highways, Sion, Kurla and Vikhroli. Closure of four subways- - Milan, Khar, Andheri and Malad -- affected East-West traffic movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-roads-waterlogged-traffic-a-mess-train-bus-services-hit/articleshow/83382851.cms||---

You will be able to experience the phenomenon known as Zero Shadow Day (ZSD), where shadows will disappear completely at noon. It is the general belief that the Sun is directly overhead at 12 noon every day. But this is only true twice a year for any place between of the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. Dhananjay Rawal, an Ahmedabad-based science communicator, says in Gujarat, the ZSDs of major cities are between June and July and other parts of experience it in late May. In Ahmedabad,the second ZSD is on July 2. “The Earth’s axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. Thus, at different times of the year the northern and southern hemisphere face the Sun. We thus experience seasons. The path of the Sun in our sky is not linear and thus it generally doesn’t come directly overhead,” says Rawal. “The ZSD phenomenon helped ancient Egyptians calculate the diameter of the Earth around 250 BCE,” Rawal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/your-shadow-will-vanish-today/articleshow/83382769.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath invokes Birsa Munda called ‘dharm rakshak’ by RSS||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday invoked 19th century tribal leader Birsa Munda on his 121st death anniversary, training the spotlight on a prominent figure celebrated by the Sangh for keeping aloft Hindutva ideology. In a tweet, Yogi described Munda as a popular people’s leader, an important freedom fighter who played a pivotal role in raising the consciousness of tribals through ulgulan (revolt) or the Munda rebellion against the British-imposed feudal system. RSS and Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) functionaries, however, hail Munda for aggressively countering the intrusion of Christian missionaries in tribal areas of Bengal province, now in Jharkhand. Not surprisingly, Yogi’s endorsement of Munda is seen as another attempt by the saffron mascot to raise the Hindutva bogey and bridge the social gulf amidst sabre-rattling by the opposition in the run-up to assembly elections. VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal told TOI that Birsa Munda cannot be confined to Jharkhand. He is a national hero who took on the might of British and Christian missionaries for ‘dharm raksha’ (safeguarding the religion). “Ironically in independent India, the Congress government did nothing to safeguard the interest of tribals, who were ostensibly Hindu. Their consciousness is now being awakened by the Sangh,” he said, adding RSS and VHP functionaries organize a series of functions not only in Jharkhand, but also in other parts of the country. A senior RSS leader said, invoking Munda should be seen as Yogi’s appeal to endorse saffron forces’ assorted attempt to preserve Indian culture. “Hindu Samaj unko apna adarsh aur ek devta ki tarah poojta hai (The Hindu society acknowledges Munda as an ideal and worships him as God),” he said. Bansal said, memories of many nationalist leaders were obliterated over time. “The lobby of Congress, Communist and Church never allowed those leaders to come to the limelight,” he said, adding the Sangh feels it’s time to pay tributes to these leaders and bring them back into national consciousness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-invokes-birsa-munda-called-dharm-rakshak-by-rss/articleshow/83384255.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Ahmedabad||Look into civic poll grievance: Gujarat HC to SEC||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday ordered the State  Commission (SEC) to look into the grievance expressed by an independent candidate from Bodakdev ward. Nilesh Mistry has been demanding action against other contesting candidates for furnishing false information in their nominations during the civic body elections in February. The HC has said that SEC may take action within eight weeks in accordance with law on Mistry’s complaint that was made before the commission on February 20, a day ahead of polling. Mistry submitted before the HC that he came to know that large number of irregularities and illegalities were committed by the election officer while checking Form 23 of candidates. It was found that candidates had made false statements on oath as well as in Form 23 but the concerned officer did not verify. Mistry claimed that he had demanded cancellation of election in Bodakdev ward on the ground that it was not fair election. Allowing false statements and declaration by the election authorities were not mere an oversight, but the mistakes were purposefully allowed to continue to favour other candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/look-into-civic-poll-grievance-hc-to-sec/articleshow/83384260.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Kin of health workers now on inoculation priority list||KOLKATA: The state health department has included family members of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers in the priority group for the inoculation programme. The official order on Wednesday brought much relief to these frontline workers who have been demanding for this inclusion. TOI had reported on Wednesday on the increasing demand by doctors’ organisations and resentment among the healthcare fraternity over not prioritising their family members for the inoculation. The order from Swasthya Bhawan on Wednesday identified these family members as being in the risk group and has asked districts magistrates, Kolkata Municipal Corporation and CMOH (chief medical officers) — or the official concerned — to arrange for their vaccination on a priority basis. “This order has brought a huge relief to me and my colleagues who have to go back home daily after working in the Covid ward. I will feel much at ease going back to my son and daughter once they get the shot,” said a senior nurse at a state run Covid-19 hospital in Kolkata. She was among the first healthcare workers to get the jab on January 16, the first day of the vaccine rollout. Even as the state government rolled out the vaccination drive for 18-44 age group from mid-May, the doses are currently being offered only to prioritised groups like potential super-spreaders, including transport workers, hawkers etc. “Even as my parents have got the vaccine from government centres, my sister and brother who are in the 18-44 category are yet to get the shot. Now they will be vaccinated from the government,” said a young lab technician who works in a state-run RT-PCR lab. The health department has also included informal healthcare providers who work in rural areas in its priority list. In fact, many of these healthcare providers are the first point of contact for patients in villages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kin-of-health-workers-now-on-inoculation-priority-list/articleshow/83380664.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Lucknow||Prasada’s exit an act of betrayal, won’t impact assembly polls: UP Congress||Lucknow: Minutes after Congress leader Jitin Prasada joined the BJP on Wednesday, party leaders in Uttar Pradesh termed the move as an “act of betrayal” and said his exit would have no impact on the party’s prospects in the 2022 assembly elections. UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu said Prasada had been losing all elections since 2014. “Everyone has seen the party’s poor show in the West Bengal elections which was being led by Prasada as in charge. His decision to quit shows his thanklessness as the party always gave him due respect. It’s an act of betrayal,” he said. Echoing similar sentiments, senior leader and AICC co-in charge for UP, Dheeraj Gurjar, said: “Those who do not have the ability to fight desert the battlefield. The fate of such ‘Jaichands’ (betrayers) is known to the people.” Prasada was a part of the Congress inner circle and was close to the Gandhi family. Asked if the development would affect the party’s prospects in assembly elections, the UPCC president said: “He had been losing elections in the past. It won’t have any impact because the Congress relies on ideology which is above people.” However, some Congress workers said Prasada’s exit would be a loss to the party which was struggling to consolidate itself for the assembly elections. “Prasada was the Brahmin face of the party, besides being a young leader. No matter how much the leadership denies, it is a loss,” a party worker said. According to data from election trackers, at least 10-12% of the electorate in UP is Brahmin and since Prasada had been working to consolidate Brahmin votebank through an independent organization, Brahmin Chetna Parishad, he could be propped up by the BJP to woo the community. Jitin’s connect with the youth may also go in his favour. According to a former functionary, this is the fourth big exit from UP in the past 6-7 years after Jagdambika Pal, Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Annu Tandon. “Leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindhia, Annu Tandon and Jitin Prasada have left after Priyanka Gandhi took charge and this gives the opponents a chance to corner the Congress,” a political analyst said. “He was extremely annoyed with the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh, particularly his home turf Dhaurahra. He was unhappy that he was not being consulted about matters related to his constituency. When he raised the issue with the leadership, he was shunted to West Bengal,” a close aide of Prasada said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/prasadas-exit-an-act-of-betrayal-wont-impact-assembly-polls-up-congress/articleshow/83384277.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Vaccine numbers drop in private hospitals from 1,700/day to 340/day||NAGPUR: Covid-19 vaccination has dropped at Kingsway Hospital from daily average of 1,700 to 340 on Wednesday. The hospital said the number of beneficiaries declined due to the latest announcement of free vaccination for all by the central government. District-wise vaccination centres.The government had permitted vaccination of people in 18-44 years age group from May 1. But the Centre had given responsibility of procurement of doses and inoculation to the states. At the same time, the Centre had allowed private hospitals to purchase doses directly from manufacturers and inoculate citizens. The state had started vaccination of this age group on May 1 and stopped on May 12, citing shortage of doses. From Vidarbha, Kingsway Hospital and a hospital in Akola had procured doses of Covishield directly from manufacturer — Serum Institute of India (SII) — and started vaccinations from May 31. Kingsway Hospital received huge response from people in 18-44 years age group, as they were not getting jabs at the centres run by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and government hospitals. Total 10,188 people (daily average of 1,698) booked slots and took the jab at Kingsway by paying Rs1,000 per dose (Rs100 more for registration of newcomers) in six days, between May 31 and June 5. Highest vaccination was 3,675 on June 3, which was a record in entire vaccination programme. The number of beneficiaries started to decline from June 7 with 976 taking the jab on June 7, followed by 970 on June 8. The number of beneficiaries dropped further to 330 on June 9. Director of the hospital Amit Somani told TOI, “The Centre announced procurement of doses and supply to government as well as private centres a couple of days ago. Also, the government announced revision in charges. This seems to have confused people. Now, people have gone into wait and watch mode. Therefore, number of beneficiaries has gone down at our centre.” Somani added, “Some 50% of people who took appointment online for vaccination did not turn up on June 7 and 8. Now, we are left with 39 vials. We have placed order for 60,000 more doses. But there is no communication from SII.” In the government vaccination drive, 3,377 healthcare workers, frontline workers and 45-plus took first and second dose in the district on Wednesday. Also, 920 people from 18-44 years age group took second dose. Thus, total 4,297 people took the jab in the district on Wednesday at centres operated at NMC and government hospitals. The number of beneficiaries has increased in these centres with beginning of second dose for people in 18-44 years age group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-numbers-drop-in-private-hosp-from-1700/day-to-340/day/articleshow/83382881.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Lucknow||RSS plans special tutorial classes for primary school kids||Lucknow: The Covid-19 pandemic has kept children away from schools for over a year now. Primary students have missed out more on the educational front as their studies have not gone beyond the virtual classes. Classroom reading and direct interaction with teachers are off for over a year and the same situation may continue for some more time. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh wishes to fill in the gap by bringing teachers and students together, both virtually and physically, across the country. The sangh will take up the education of primary level students as one of its major post-Covid relief measures. Every ‘prant’ will have to make its own plan. The Awadh Prant Karyawah Prashant Shukla said, “We may hold separate tuition classes for different subjects depending on the demand. It may be a class of 10 to 15 students which will be organised as per the Covid-19 protocol. There will be virtual classes as well.” Meanwhile, teachers would not necessarily be the ones who teach in schools run by the sangh, but also others who are connected with the sangh and are experts in the subjects they teach. The ‘prants’ have to create a network of such teachers who are ready to partake in the initiative. “Besides the professional teachers there are also people who do not teach, but are experts in subjects like maths, science, English and are willing to teach. We will try to rope in them as well,” said Shukla. The classes would be conducted free of cost for students up to class seventh as most of them do not have access to digital media for various reasons. The Sangh would speak to parents who want educational support for their children. “We will have to communicate at two levels for this. First, with the parents and children and find out what they want. Second, with teachers who are ready to devote time.” The students can stay in touch with the teachers for guidance even when the classes get discontinued. The students coming from varied backgrounds would benefit from the move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-plans-special-tutorial-classes-for-primary-school-kids/articleshow/83384283.cms||Neha Shukla

Many in the academic circles feel this is a step towards resuming some sort of on-campus activities later in the year. Both Calcutta University and Jadavpur University have sought details of the employees in the 18-44 years age group. Rabindra Bharati University and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology have already vaccinated many of their teaching and non-teaching staff. “On June 4, we vaccinated more than 325 across all the categories. Many staff members over the age of45 years were vaccinated earlier,” said an RBU official. At CU, those between 18 years and 44 years will have to submit their details by June 10. In April, the university had vaccinated all its employees above 45 years in Rajabazar Science College and Ballygunge Science College. At JU, the employees have been instructed to provide their details on an “urgent basis” so that the vaccination can begin at the earliest. “The vaccination will start as soon as the district administration identifies a venue and shares the details with us.

In 2019, there was 234.8mm rain on June 29, in 2018, 231mm rain was reported, and in 2015, 283.4mm was reported on June 19. In Mumbai, in the morning hours on Wednesday from 8.30am to 11.30am, over 100mm of rainfall was recorded by IMD’s Santacruz observatory.This led the weather bureau to upgrade its forecast from a yellow alert (indicating heavy rain in isolated places) to a red alert for the city and its adjoining areas, indicating extremely heavy rainfall.By evening, total rain recorded by the Santacruz observatory (between 8.30am and 8.30pm) was 222mm, which falls in the extremely heavy category as per IMD classification. The IMD Colaba observatory recorded 45.6mm, which is in the moderate category (15.6mm to 64.4mm). Thane recorded 162mm of rain. “With the likely formation of a low-pressure area over North Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood by June 11 and strengthening of westerlies, an active rainfall spell is expected over Konkan-Goa and adjoining ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra from today (June 9). Widespread rainfall activity is expected over the region during the period with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places, with extremely heavy falls at isolated places. Enhanced rainfall activity is expected to continue for subsequent 6-7 days,” said IMD. The IMD’s Doppler radar continued to remain non-functional even on Wednesday. Officials said there was an issue but would not comment on when it would be resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-yellow-alert-turned-red-in-city-with-heavy-rain-in-morning-hrs/articleshow/83382896.cms||Richa Pinto

In his most recent abduction on June 5, clues led police to a couple in Banswada district in Rajasthan, from whom the child was rescued on Tuesday. He was handed over to his mother, a ragpicker in Adalaj, after a health check-up. In the first instance, the child had been abducted in April from Gandhinagar Civil Hospital by a childless couple, Jignesh and Asmita Bharthi, from Kadi, Meshana. Local crime branch had rescued the child from them and brought him back to his mother. This time too, after the child was abducted while his mother was picking waste, local crime branch officers, who had earlier rescued him solved the case. According to the case details, while the woman was collecting waste, she had kept her child in a makeshift cradle on her bicycle. The accused, Dinesh Katara, who was passing by on his motorcycle, snatched the baby and sped off. The child’s mother then approached Adalaj police. With no CCTV footage available of the spot of offence, police collected CCTV footage along a 2km radius and checked around 200 videos mostly from Adalaj. In some of the footage police were able to spot a suspicious man on a motorcycle with the kid on the fuel tank of his bike.

The hub is home to 400 odd artisans and their families along with some 2500 odd workers and helpers who come to the city from districts like Nadia and Murshidabad. While 100 were vaccinated on Wednesday, 300 others will get the shot on June 15 and 16 during the next phase of the drive. “In the next four-five months, this idol hub will be frequented by thousands of idol makers, workers as well as customers and outsiders. Hence, vaccination was the need of the hour for artisans like us to fight against the pandemic. Also, the chief minister has instructed that work can resume at smaller units post vaccination and now that many of us have been vaccinated, I believe we can resume work,” said Babu Pal, secretary of Mritshilpa Sanskriti Samity. The vaccination drive was organized by former India captain Sourav Ganguly’s foundation. The second wave of Covid-19, coupled with the ongoing enhanced safety restrictions in the state, has made the artisans wary of their artwork with many of them claiming to be absolutely out of business this year. Last year, Durga Puja organisers had ordered smaller and cheaper idols to suit their reduced budget but this year, many artisans claimed, no orders had been placed so far. “The situation is worse than last year. Many of us have received no orders so far this year. But we hope the vaccination drive will improve situation and we will get to celebrate Durga Puja,” Ganesh Chandra Pal, who took the vaccine on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/120-days-to-puja-artisans-take-shot-at-kumartuli/articleshow/83380704.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government transfers Rs 1,000 each to 23 lakh daily wagers||LUCKNOW: The state government on Wednesday transferred Rs 1,000 through direct benefit transfer to each bank account of 23.05 lakh daily wagers as part of its scheme to assist those whose livelihoods were hit during the pandemic. The beneficiaries included dhobis, rickshaw pullers, construction workers, cobblers and halwais. Lauding labourers and daily wagers for helping the government in its fight against Covid even though they were a vulnerable section of society, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that UP had the best recovery rate and least number of deaths despite being the most populous state. After assuming power in 2017, our government introduced many schemes for the poor. We organised community marriages for their daughters and ensured that DMs and commissioners distributed marriage invites and ministers greeted guests at the venue,” the CM said, adding other schemes had been launched to educate children of labourers. Also, they have got a Rs 2lakh health insurance cover and ration cards, he said. “Before 2017, no ration cards were being issued. Those linked to the party in power had multiple cards, while the poor did not have access to even one. In 2020, when more than 40 lakh migrant workers returned to the state during the lockdown, UP was the first state to provide free ration to those who didn’t have ration cards. Our handling of the migrant crisis is now a subject of research of international organisations,” he said. The state set up a labour commission in 2020, the CM said, which the government used to ensure welfare of labourers. In the second wave, the government did not shut down industry or agricultural activity and Covid help desks and Covid care centres were set up to help workers, he added. Encouraging workers to register with the labour department, the CM said every labourer in the organised or unorganised sector, would be given an annual insurance of Rs 5 lakh during registration. The CM also interacted with some workers from various districts and handed over symbolic cheques of Rs 1,000 to five workers during the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-transfers-rs-1000-each-to-23l-daily-wagers/articleshow/83384297.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Staff in a fix over unused school stationery with J Jayalalithaa pictures||TRICHY: The change in regime in the state after a decade has put a question mark on the lakhs of pieces of stationery items and school bags with pictures of former chief ministers J Jayalalithaa and Edappadi K Palaniswami piled up in government and aided schools. Though these are distributed free by the government every year, many students don’t collect them leading to a pileup. Indeed, pending stocks can be distributed to students this year, but school education department staff are unsure about it due to the change of guard. Since 2013, the government has been giving free school bags to students in classes I-XII, crayons for those in class I and II, colour pencils for class III-V and geometry box for class VI-VIII besides notebooks. While these came with the picture of Jayalalithaa printed on it, Edappadi Palaniswami’s picture too was printed alongside from 2017 onwards. The government had procured over 71 lakh school bags during 2019-20, expected to be the number of students in government and aided schools that year. Yet, every government and aided school across the state will have unused stocks of notebooks, crayons and colour pencils running perhaps to lakhs of pieces. Though schools receive these material based on student strength, many students fail to collect them. “So far, we had no problems in giving the old stock to students in case there was delay is supply which usually happens. But the change in regime has put us in a fix this time,” said a headmaster of an aided school in Trichy. With the new academic year set to start in a couple of weeks, textbooks have arrived at the district headquarters for distribution. School education department officials refused to reveal as to whose pictures would feature in the notebooks and stationery items slated to arrive soon as the order was issued during the previous regime. When AIADMK came to power in 2011, chief minister J Jayalalaithaa had ensured that chapters on her predecessor M Karunanidhi were either removed or covered with stickers. “The same procedure may be adopted this time as well to ensure unused stocks don’t go waste,” said a senior staff at the Trichy district chief education office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/staff-in-a-fix-over-unused-school-stationery-with-jaya-pics/articleshow/83382885.cms||Sampath Kumar

Around 56 captive elephants in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) and Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) already took the test on Tuesday. A team of forest veterinary team is expected to arrive at the ERC on Thursday to test the elephants. The whole facility, raised at a cost of Rs 2 crore across 20 hectares 5 years ago, is equipped with all necessary infrastructure required for rehabilitation of elephants in distress. It was created to confiscate and rehabilitate private captive elephants that are repeatedly abused by their owners. The ERC started functioning from September 7 in 2019 following the arrival of 35-year-old Malachi from Madurai. She was confiscated by forest department from her abusive owner following direction from Madras high court. Besides her, other elephants include are Jayanthi, Sandhya, Indhu and two others. S Ramasubramanian, chief conservator of forests, in-charge of Trichy forest circle, said that the elephants will undergo Covid-19 test after captive elephants in Nilgiris were tested. ERC is an isolated location with minimal human activity. However, most of the feeds come from outside. Mahouts though are not exposed but they are in close contact with elephants, therefore it is necessary to the test the elephants as a precautionary measure, said Ramasubramanian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/six-elephants-in-trichys-erc-to-be-tested-for-covid/articleshow/83382879.cms||---

However, most of the 3,951 deaths happened during the second wave of the pandemic this year. The toll in Bihar was 5,424 till June 7 and 20 more Covid patients died in the past 24 hours. Now, Bihar jumped from 17th to 12th position in Covid deaths among all states and UTs across the country. The additional figures increased the Covid-19 mortality in Bihar by around 72.8%. As per the latest figures, maximum deaths were reported in Patna, taking the overall district toll to 2,303. Muzaffarpur reported 609 deaths, followed by Nalanda (463), Begusarai (454), Purvi Champaran (425), Darbhanga (342) and Madhubani (317). According to the additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit, the additional fatalities are mainly during the second wave of the pandemic, which also included people who died with Covid complications after recovery. He pointed out that all the data is cumulative as the death toll was around 1,600 in March 2021. Addressing the media, he said the assessment of unreported Covid-19 deaths was carried out in all the districts by constituting a team at medical college and hospitals so that families of Covid-19 victims would not be deprived of financial assistance. “The audit was important to assess the ground reality of Covid fatalities in transparent manner to pay ex gratia of Rs4 lakh to each victim’s family. So far, 3,737 families have been paid the ex gratia amount,” Amrit said. He also said during the surge of second wave, there were reports of unregistered Covid deaths in private hospitals and unfortunate deaths of patients on way to hospitals. The state government then decided to conduct death audit in all districts and issued detailed instructions for the same. The department formed a three-member team in all medical college and hospitals and at district level. At district level, a team of civil surgeon (CS), acting chief medical officer and CS-appointed medical officer was constituted for assessment of deaths in home isolation, Covid care centres, dedicated Covid health centres, private hospitals and transition (ambulance or any other vehicle). Amrit said departmental action would be taken against such people (officers) who failed to provide the Covid death data on time. “There were challenges during the second wave of Covid-19, but the information of deaths should have been sent on time with special vigilance and sensitivity,” he said. Meanwhile, Amrit also said that as many as 513 cases of mucormycosis or black fungus had been reported in the state so far and 90 of them recovered, 55 died while 368 were undergoing treatment at different health facilities. He said 111 mucor patients were admitted at IGIMS-Patna, 83 at AIIMS-Patna, 40 at PMCH, nine in JLNMCH-Bhagalpur, two at VIMS-Pawapuri and two more admitted at NMCH-Patna. He added: “The department has received 1,700 vials of Amphotericin B injection from the government of India, of which 500 each was given to AIIMS-P and IGIMS and 100 vials each to PMCH, JLNMCH and VIMS.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-covid-toll-up-to-9429-after-govt-audit/articleshow/83380713.cms||Faryal Rumi

The Amherst Street police, too, pointed it out to the Indian Coffee Workers Cooperative Society. However, those that had turned up at the haunt were allowed in on Wednesday.

Tapas Pahari, secretary of the society, claimed the reopening had been discussed at various levels. However, he added that serving guests would be suspended if it sparked a controversy. Police officers who reached the spot advised the management to stick to “home delivery” and asked the authorities to put up signage stating that only home delivery was permissible.

Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav rejected the bail plea of Rashid and Shoaib who are lodged in jail in connection with the alleged murder case. “It is prima facie clear that the applicants were part of unlawful assembly, which was responsible for putting on fire the godown in which deceased Dilbar Negi was there,” the court noted. Both men, it observed, were clearly visible carrying a rod in an agitated posture and instigating other members of the riotous mob in a video clip. Advocate Salim Malik, the accused’s counsel, argued that his clients were not at the scene of crime and were framed in the case by the investigating agency. Opposing the bail plea of the accused, the prosecutor submitted that other accused had to be identified and arrested and the conspiracy angle behind such a large-scale riot had to be unearthed. The order stated that it was also apparent that the riotous mob armed carrying lethal weapons had engaged in vandalism and looting with a main objective to cause maximum damage to the lives and properties of persons belonging to the other community. “The nature of allegations against the applicants are very serious. I do not find it to be a fit case for grant of bail to both the applicants at this stage. Both the bail applications are accordingly dismissed,” held the court. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-two-murder-accused-denied-bail/articleshow/83414467.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This dream is now beckoning as on Tuesday, Ahmedabad’s apex planning body the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority, invited proposals from consultants to assess venues and infrastructure required to host the Olympic Games. Ahmedabad is being clubbed with Gandhinagar in this Olympic quest, according to the proposal. The roadmap will be chalked out by AUDA and the Sports Authority of India. The idea is to ensure facilities for more than 40 sports within the city, including the Rs 458 crore Naranpura sports complex. The proposal also details how other Gujarat cities can be prepared to host Olympic events. The proposal states “…the consulting agency will assess sports and non-sports venues and city infrastructure for hosting the Olympic Games,” and “…Identify multiple options for host cities that could potentially host the Olympic Games.” “Within the city, the Sabarmati-Motera area, with the bullet train, metro rail, BRT and SVP Sports Enclave is a fit candidate to host the majority of these sports events,” said a senior AUDA official. AUDA’s plan comes after President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the Narendra Modi Stadium, the world’s largest cricket venue, in the city on February 24. AUDA and AMC officials had unveiled plans of a large sports complex and Union home minister Amit Shah had stated that Ahmedabad has the potential to host the Olympics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-olympic-dream-conceived-proposals-invited/articleshow/83382903.cms||---

---||Mumbai||As cases dip, Mumbai Metropolitan Region civic bodies hope more relaxation on cards||MUMBAI: With cases in Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) steadily on the decline, corporations are hopeful of being upgraded to a higher category of relaxation that would make them eligible for opening up further. As part of the state’s unlock plan, districts and corporations have been classified across five categories depending on their weekly positivity rate (WPR) and the occupancy of oxygen beds. The relaxation will depend on the category they fall into. The state government will take a review of these parameters every week and in case of a change, fresh orders will be issued by the local authorities. Thane Municipal Corporation expects an upgrade to Level 1 to secure more relaxation for the city, considering the gradual decline in the positivity rate since the past four days, officials said. Currently, there is not a single corporation from MMR that is in Level 1. Thane and Navi Mumbai are in Level 2 while Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivili and Vasai-Virar are in Level 3. A cursory tally of the positivity rate reveals the Thane city has recorded an average of 3.5% positivity rate over the past five days, starting June 4, and the oxygen bed occupancy, too, has been around 15%, raising hopes of being elevated to Level 1 in the forthcoming revision. Similarly, the BMC had missed the 5% WPR cut-off for Level 2 by just 0.6% (5.6%). Now, with the city reporting a test positivity rate below 3% for the past three days, there is a chance it could be promoted to Level 2. “But the weekly state review will look at the positivity trend over two weeks before taking a decision. So while it is heartening that the daily positivity rate is below 3%, the trend needs to be sustained for a week or more,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. TMC commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma said, “We are on the border of Level 1 and 2 and have appealed to residents and traders to cooperate with us and ensure our ranking improves by adopting Covid safety measures.” In NMMC, the positivity rate has dipped further and is hovering around 2%. Commissioner Abhijit Bangar said, “We are better in the positivity rate, which indicates our eligibility for Level-1 category. But the oxygen bed occupancy is 26%. We will review the situation on Thursday. However, we will take necessary precautionary measures to avoid a possible third wave for which some restrictions are needed at this juncture.” Palghar district collector Dr Manek Gursal said they hope to move to Level 2 next week as the positivity rate is below 5%. Despite cases steadily declining in Kalyan-Dombivli, KDMC, which is at Level 3, is still not thinking about going a level up. In Mira-Bhayander, civic officials said they will take a decision based on orders from the Thane district collector.

---||Mumbai||Downpour likely in Mumbai Metropolitan Region in next 4 days, IMD issues orange alert||MUMBAI: The India meteorological department (IMD) has issued an orange alert, indicating heavy to very heavy rain, for the next four days in parts of Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad. IMD officials said between June 11 and 13, there was a possibility of over 200mm rainfall. For June 15, a warning for extremely heavy rain at isolated places has been issued. The city woke up on Wednesday to the official onset of the monsoon, with several areas reporting close to 300mm of rain. Among the parts that saw heavy rain in a 12-hour span were Sion (283mm), Dharavi (277mm) and Vikhroli (285mm) in the eastern suburbs. Though the heavy downpour in various parts caused waterlogging at chronic spots, disruption of suburban services on Central Railway, several BEST buses experiencing breakdowns and road traffic turning into a crawl, the big positive was that Mumbai has already recorded 82% of its average June rainfall of 505mm, having seen a total of 415 mm rain since June 1. On Wednesday alone, the city got 44% (222mm) of its average June rain. Average rain recorded in the eastern suburbs on Wednesday was 214.4mm, while the western suburbs saw 191mm and the island city 138mm. “The southwest monsoon has advanced into the entire central and some parts of north Arabian Sea, entire Konkan covering Mumbai and most parts of interior Maharashtra including Vidarbha. A red alert for some places has been issued,” said Shubhangi Bhute of IMD. Yellow alert turned red in city with heavy rain in morning hrsThe onset of monsoon this year happened two days before the official onset date of June 11, which IMD officials said was owing to the strengthening of westerly winds. The 222mm of rain recorded was the four-highest one-day rain for the month of June. In 2019, there was 234.8mm rain on June 29, in 2018, 231mm rain was reported, and in 2015, 283.4mm was reported on June 19. In Mumbai, in the morning hours on Wednesday from 8.30am to 11.30am, over 100mm of rainfall was recorded by IMD’s Santacruz observatory. This led the weather bureau to upgrade its forecast from a yellow alert (indicating heavy rain in isolated places) to a red alert for the city and its adjoining areas, indicating extremely heavy rainfall. By evening, total rain recorded by the Santacruz observatory (between 8.30am and 8.30pm) was 222mm, which falls in the extremely heavy category as per IMD classification. The IMD Colaba observatory recorded 45.6mm, which is in the moderate category (15.6mm to 64.4mm). Thane recorded 162mm of rain. “With the likely formation of a low-pressure area over North Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood by June 11 and strengthening of westerlies, an active rainfall spell is expected over Konkan-Goa and adjoining ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra from today (June 9). Widespread rainfall activity is expected over the region during the period with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places, with extremely heavy falls at isolated places. Enhanced rainfall activity is expected to continue for subsequent 6-7 days,” said IMD. The IMD’s Doppler radar continued to remain non-functional even on Wednesday. Officials said there was an issue but would not comment on when it would be resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wetnesday-city-gets-44-of-avg-june-rain-in-one-day/articleshow/83384306.cms||Richa Pinto

The staff, who are paid by the government, take a commission of Rs 40 per sack of paddy, Vasan said in a statement. The collection of commission by the employees of DPCs affected farmers, he said. Vasan said the delta districts farmers were harvesting paddy cultivated with borewell water. The farmers were in deep trouble as their expenses on paddy cultivation exceeded their income, he said. They also incurred an expense of Rs 1,000 per vehicle for loading and unloading paddy, he added. Vasan demanded that the state government open more DPCs to enable the farmers to sell their produce. Vasan’s statement comes a couple of days after minister of agriculture and farmers’ welfare M R K Panneerselvam said that “if you ask a stupid question, you will get a stupid reply” when a journalist raised the issue of the commission at DPCs. Citing that the farmers were gearing up for the kuruvai cultivation, Vasan demanded that the state government expedite the process of disbursing crop loans to the farmers from primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS). TMC president also asked the government to provide agriculture equipment under subsidised price to the small and marginal farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/staff-collect-rs-40/sack-as-commission-in-dpc-vasan/articleshow/83382914.cms||---

The district has been recording an average of 924 fresh cases daily. On the other hand, Karur registered 2,388 positive cases from the 13,698 samples in the same period, registering a positivity rate of 17.4. According to the containment plan, the volunteer would check for fever, cough and cold among the residents besides oxygen saturation and body temperature every day. In case of symptoms persisting for more than a day, the resident is referred to the nearby PHC or government hospital or medical college hospital for undergoing RTPCR test. If the persons tests positive for Covid-19, he/she is to be admitted to the GH or medical college hospital. Areas, where more number of cases are identified, are given additional attention and health camps are to be held.  Though Trichy also had a positivity rate of 16.4 during the said period, the district witnessed a steady decline from 981 cases on June 1 to 548 on June 7, and 490 on Tuesday. A senior public health official in Thanjavur exuded confidence that the micro plan in force for the past one week would bring a favourable result soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/thanjavur-karur-dists-go-micro-to-check-high-positivity-rate/articleshow/83382905.cms||Gokul Rajendran

---||Delhi||Docs urge HC to postpone med test due to Covid-19||New Delhi: Citing the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the country, a group of doctors has moved Delhi High Court to postpone Foreign Medical Graduate Examination (FMGE) screening test scheduled for June 18. Association of MD Physicians, which also has as members some foreign medical graduates who have completed their primary medical courses in institutions abroad, said there were limited number of cities being notified as centres for the test, and many candidates would be forced to travel without having received even one dose of Covid vaccine. But the plea was opposed by National Board of Examination and National Medical Commission on the ground that FMGE was only a qualifying exam, which could be taken by the doctors even in December, if not in June, and the test should not be postponed at the behest of a few candidates. After hearing submissions of both the sides, Justice Amit Bansal asked the counsel to place on record certain documents and listed the matter for hearing on Friday. According to Indian Medical Council Act and Screening Test Regulations 2002, people possessing medical qualifications awarded by a foreign institution are required to qualify FMGE screening test to receive recognition for their medical qualifications and to be registered to the state medical councils to practice medicine in India. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-urge-hc-to-postpone-med-test-due-to-covid-19/articleshow/83414524.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Black fungus claims 128 lives in Rajasthan, 54 in last seven days; total cases at 1,848||JAIPUR: In the last seven days, at least 50 persons succumbed to mucormycosis or black fungus in the state. The total number of deaths due to black fungus has risen to 128 from 74 in this period. Doctors claimed that the mucormycosis patients can be saved if they get treated at an early stage. But many have been coming to hospitals only after their symptoms become severe and health deteriorates. The number of mucormycosis cases in the state rose from 1,524 to 1,848 in the past seven days. Out of these, 388 persons had both fungus and Covid at the time of hospital admission. Some 1,134 patients were found to have only mucormycosis at and tested Covid negative. The mortality rate due to mucormycosis increased from 5% to 7% from a week ago. Doctors said that a person can have both mucormycosis and Covid and it could also develop as a post-Covid complication going by the cases reported, wherein patients have been infected by the fungus after recovering from Covid.“Before Covid, mucormycosis cases were sporadic. But now, the cases have increased. The fungus and its spores spread to nasal tissues, sinuses, eyes and brain. If a patient comes to hospital early with symptoms, the chances of recovery are quite high. But if he comes after the condition deteriorates, his/her chances of recovery come down,” said Dr Tarun Ojha, head of the ENT department at a private hospital. While mucormycosis is a known ailment, there is now a surge in such cases. Doctors have to conduct surgeries to reduce the load of the fungus on affected parts. In Bikaner’s PBM Hospital, which reported 85 cases of mucormycosis, doctors are taking a conservative approach to save those who have infected eyeballs. “Our approach in dealing with such mucormycosis cases is quite conservative. Our focus is on saving the life of the patient. We also try to save the eyeball or salvage it. We have to perform exenteration or detaching eyeballs in some severe patients. But in mild cases, we give injections of Amphotericin B first and, if they still require an eye operation, we perform it. So far, only seven excisions of eyeballs and surrounding tissues have been done in our hospital,” said Dr Anju Kochar, nodal officer, mucormycosis, senior professor, department of ophthalmology, SP Medical College. In the state, cases of mucormycosis have been increasing and, now, 77 hospitals have been permitted by the state government to treat mucormycosis patients since it is now a notifiable disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/black-fungus-claims-128-lives-in-raj-54-in-last-7-days-total-cases-at-1848/articleshow/83382956.cms||Syed Intishab Ali
---||Aurangabad||Bombay high court discharges 3 in immoral trafficking case||AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court discharged a former head of a city-based mall and two others who were arrested by the city crime branch in a 2019 case under the provisions of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (PITA) and Indian Penal Code (IPC) relating to an alleged flesh trade racket. “Only presence of person at that place does not mean that he was there for committing any offence or he would have been there to procure any victim for the purpose of offence — when there was absolutely no evidence about the contact between accused (petitioners) and the persons who were arrested at the said place,” justice Vibha Kankanwadi said in a ruling on June 8. On December 8, 2019, an Aurangabad crime branch team had raided a private premises in Rajesh Nagar on the Beed bypass and claimed to have busted a flesh trade racket. In all, 10 people, including three customers, were named in the charge sheet filed under sections 370 (whoever imports, exports, removes, buys, sells or disposes of any person as a slave, or accepts, receives or detains against his will any person as a slave), 370 {2} (knowingly by or having reason to believe that a person has been trafficked, engages such person for sexual exploitation in any manner) of the IPC. Besides, sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of PITA, sections 67, 67 A of IT Act and relevant sections of Bombay Prohibition Act were also imposed. Lawyer Abhasyinh Bhosale, who represented the petitioners, told TOI, “The three “customers” moved a discharge plea before the sessions court which in December 2020 partly allowed the same by discharging them from some provisions, but retaining the remaining charges for trial. This prompted the trio to move high court. We brought to the court’s notice that the police, on one hand, booked the trio for procuring women for flesh trade and, on the other hand, claimed them to be customers. We also pointed out the statements of the rescued women, decoy customer and no relevant record were part of the charge sheet.” The HC said that the trial court’s observation about the petitioners taking some pains by using electronic media for booking and obtaining the victim girls and buying them for satisfaction of lust by contacting the remaining accused, was not supported by evidence in the form of CDR. “So also, when there is no evidence collected regarding payment of money by the customers to the brothel owner, it is stated that it would be the part of the evidence at the time of trial. When that evidence does not form part of the charge sheet, it was not appropriate on the part of the trial judge to arrive at the said conclusion. The present petitioners ought to have been discharged taking into consideration the evidence that has been gathered,” the court ruled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-discharges-3-in-immoral-trafficking-case/articleshow/83380822.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Meanwhile, the recovery rate climbed to 98% with 1,706 people beating the virus in the past 24 hours, reports Shailvee Sharda. “The Covid-19 situation is almost under control now. Covid curfew has been lifted from all the 75 districts, but the responsibility for the Covid control remains the same as the risk of pandemic infection is still there,” said additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad. Officials also noted that for the third day in a row, the Covid-19 deaths have remained below 100, while the test positivity rate has remained around 0.5%. The officials said that as a result of swift measures, micro-planning, alertness and an aggressive ‘Trace-Test-Treat’ approach to contain the virus, Uttar Pradesh has recorded a decline by more than 95% in the number of active Covid cases since its peak on April 30 when the active cases were 3.10 lakh. The number of total cases in the state crossed 17 lakh on Wednesday. Reviewing the Covid-19 situation, the CM directed officials to strengthen the containment zone policy. “The containment zones must be fixed and the strategy must be firmed up after the assessment of local conditions by district magistrates to avoid any inconvenience to the citizens,” instructed the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/at-709-daily-covid-count-lowest-in-11-weeks-in-state/articleshow/83384311.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Nashik||Second wave sees fewer cases among Nashik cops||NASHIK: While the second wave of Covid-19 wreaked havoc across the state, the city police force witnessed fewer Covid cases among its personnel compared to the first Covid wave last year. In 2020, as many as 441 police personnel attached to the city police contracted Covid-19 while seven of them succumbed to the infection. This year, during the second wave, 290 police personnel were infected and five of them died due to Covid. Deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Pournima Chaugule attributed the fewer Covid cases among the police personnel this year to the vaccination programme for the police that was undertaken in February. Cops had to be in the field all the times maintaining law and order, detecting criminals and preventing criminal activities apart from ensuring that people followed all the Covid guidelines issued by the government. Thus, the police personnel were always exposed to the possibility of contracting the infection. However, as more than 90% of the police personnel had received both the doses of vaccine, the infection rate in the city police was less compared to last year. Of the 290 police personnel, who had tested positive in 2021, 237 have recovered and resumed their duty, while 48 police personnel are undergoing treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/second-wave-sees-fewer-cases-among-nashik-cops/articleshow/83376292.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Pune||CoWIN will block those who get over 50 OTPs in 24 hours||PUNE: User accounts carrying out more than 1,000 searches for vaccine slots or those generating over 50 OTPs in 24 hours will now be blocked from CoWIN, a central official with the portal’s management team told TOI on Wednesday. The users (via their mobile phone numbers) will be blocked for 24 hours. The system will also log out users who make more than 20 search requests within a 15-minute session.  “If someone is doing more than 20 slot searches in 15 minutes, there could be something fishy. The idea is to ensure those booking slots do not end competing with bots,” the official said. He added, “We already have an option of public search for slots on CoWIN without the need to log in. Users don’t need to search 20 or more times within one or two pincodes or district in a short span of time once logged in. Doing so raises suspicions of bot activity.” The official said at least 6,000 users, nationwide, have been blocked over the last few days for suspicious activity. “We are tracking all such users. If they are found doing this often, they may even be blocked permanently. We also introduced Terms of Service on CoWIN recently to clarify this,” he said. After they’re blocked, users will receive calls from CoWIN support to alert them of unusual activity in their accounts. “Legal action may also be taken as IP addresses are being monitored,” the central official said. However, there are fears the new security controls could impact citizens repeatedly searching CoWIN for slots, especially those who are due for the second dose. Chetan Mathapati, a Thane resident, said he has been blocked. “I wanted my second dose, but I’m not able to log into CoWIN. Initially, it showed a “Generate OTP Failed” message. Now, it’s saying, ‘Account is Blocked Due To Exceeding Our Search Limit’.” Mathapati said he ended up generating OTPs over a hundred times in a few hours, after which he was blocked. “I had to generate OTPs so many times because the system kept logging me out after 20 or more attempts at finding a slot. So I had to log in multiple times,” he said. On the CoWIN portal, users need OTPs each time they need to log in. Pune resident Neeraj Shinde said, “I got my first Covaxin dose early in May. I need my second shot now. After multiple tries on CoWIN, the system stopped sending me OTPs. Fact is, we need to make more than 20 slot searches per session, given the competition.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cowin-will-block-those-who-get-over-50-otps-in-24-hours/articleshow/83382944.cms||Neha Madaan

Although vegetable and fruits stalls were provided temporary space to operate, grocery shops were not given a similar alternative. For several decades, close to 100 shops in Gandhi market were selling groceries, snacks, sweets and jaggery to hotels and small outlets in residential areas. The district administration on May 15 locked the market citing Covid-19 spread and shifted the vegetable sales temporarily to WB road. “Our inventory is locked inside our stalls, and we are unable to recover them as the market remains closed. The district administration must build a separate market for us,” A Balasubramani, president of the grocery shop owners association said. The traders have now sought a market in not less than three acres near the Gandhi market vicinity to open their shops. “Allowing only grocery shops to function inside Gandhi market will create confusion among traders, and others may also seek relaxations. So far, we do not have any proposal for a separate market,” a senior corporation official said. The association has planned to protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/grocery-store-owners-in-gandhi-market-want-separate-facility/articleshow/83382954.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ex-Union min Jitendra Singh says Sachin Pilot should get what was promised||JAIPUR/NEW DELHI: On a day the Congress suffered a jolt with Jitin Prasada joining the BJP in Delhi, the crisis in the party deepened in Rajasthan with AICC general secretary and former MP Bhanwar Jitendra Singh coming out in support of former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and MLAs close to him. Singh, who is also a former Union minister and known to be close to Rahul Gandhi, told a digital news portal – video of which went viral on social media on Wednesday – that whatever was promised to Pilot should be fulfilled. With dissent in Rajasthan Congress increasing, there were reports that chief minister Ashok Gehlot may go for a few changes in his cabinet by end-June or early next month to accommodate the Pilot camp. Sources in the Congress headquarters in Delhi indicated that Pilot is likely to be part of a reshuffle in AICC which is expected in the near future. There were reports that Pilot has sought time from the party high command but sources said that he has been in touch with Priyanka Gandhi on phone. Sources also indicated that following these developments, Pilot has dropped his plans to organise a “show of strength” along with MLAs supporting him on June 11, the death anniversary of his father Rajesh Pilot. “Whatever talks took place with the (Congress) high command or the general secretary in-charge, must materialise. If he (Pilot) has raised it now, I do not think there is anything to feel bad about. Our party says Congressmen are free to raise their issues,” Jitendra Singh is heard saying in the video clip. Pilot also raised concern over the AICC committee being unable to resolve the political issues in Rajasthan even 10 months after problems surfaced. In response to a question, Singh said there was no talk of change of CM in Rajasthan when the party central leadership intervened to end the rebellion last year. TOI tried to contact the former union minister for comments, but his staff said he was busy. There has also been consternation over the committee formed last year to resolve the issue. Headed by AICC general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal, the panel was constituted to resolve differences between Pilot and Gehlot after the rebellion by 19 Congress MLAs in July-August last year. Cabinet expansion and reshuffle as well as state-level political appointments were key demands of the Pilot faction. Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, a vocal supporter of Pilot, told TOI, “Few months back, I met AICC general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken, who is part of the committee. However, there has been no progress. The committee has not called us till date, while the government’s half term is already over.” Last month, Pilot loyalist MLA Hemaram Chaudhary sent his resignation to the assembly Speaker, but it has not been accepted so far. State BJP leaders were quick to fuel the infighting in Rajasthan Congress. Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore tweeted, “Hard work pays off, though it may take time. Today's state government exists only as a result of the hard work of Sachin Pilot ji. Today, AICC general secretary Bhanwar Jitendra Singh has spoken up.” “Dozens of Congress MLAs have raised their voices against the present government’s working style; when their voice may turn into a roar, no one knows,” Rathore’s tweet added. Pilot responded by tweeting, “Instead of making useless statements, state BJP leaders should consider their own condition seriously. Infightings and squabbles are so dominant in BJP that it is unable to play the role of opposition in the state. Public will give a befitting reply to those who abandoned people amid the crisis arising from their faulty policies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ex-union-min-jitendra-says-pilot-should-get-what-was-promised/articleshow/83382998.cms||---

The deceased, Praveen Singh, 34, slumped to the ground in a pool of blood after the bullet ripped through his skull, sending ripples in the hospital premises at Vibhuti Khand. His father, Dhruv Singh, who’s undergoing treatment for prostate cancer at the hospital, was sentenced to life on April 16 in a 1997 murder case at Misrikh, Sitapur. A search is on for the weapon. Killer cop claims threat to life, says murder weapon missing Even as eyewitnesses and police confirmed there was no immediate provocation or verbal spat that triggered the shooting, the unruffled cop, Ashish Mishra, swiftly changed his uniform, strolled into the nearby Vibhuti Khand police station and surrendered. He was deployed at the convict’s security ring on May 25. During interrogation, Mishra appeared unrepentant and claimed he shot Praveen to protect himself as the convict’s son would often hurl taunts and even threaten to kill him. Commissioner of Lucknow police, D K Thakur, who rushed to the crime scene, said the constable’s statement was unconvincing and he appeared to be mentally unsound. “Mishra, a resident of Badaun, was recruited in 2016 and has been posted at Sitapur police lines since 2017. We sought a feedback on the cop’s family background, finances and whether he had a history of mental illness with violent bouts. We also asked Sitapur SP to provide details of the convict, Dhruv Singh’s family.” On Wednesday evening, four policemen, including a head constable were deployed at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, for the convict’s security. “While two constables had rifles on them, Mishra who was on duty did not carry his service weapon. Rather he committed the crime with a countrymade pistol, which he said has gone missing. Mishra claimed he tossed it in the drain after the shooting. A search is on for the weapon,” said, ADCP, east zone, Qasim Abidi. Talking to TOI, Sitapur SP Rakesh Pratap Singh said, “We questioned Mishra’s sister whether he ever displayed suicidal tendencies or had any other psychiatric illness. She said, he was of sound mind. We also spoke to his friends, colleagues and batchmates and they all concurred he was disciplined, sharp, never an alcoholic and had a good attendance record.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/constable-shoots-convicts-son-at-rml-hosps-gate/articleshow/83384337.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

This is in connection with a case pertaining to extortion of money from at least five traders, by threatening to frame them in rape cases. Crime branch officers said the woman head constable, Sharda Khant, along with another accused, Amar Solanki, had approached various traders on behalf of the accused police inspector Geeta Pathan, when the traders came at the Women’s police station (East) in Ahmedabad city, where the gang members used to file false rape complaints. Khant and Solanki used to scare the traders saying they would be put behind bars for life and if they wanted to avoid legal action, then they should pay money to Pathan. Many traders got scared and paid money to Pathan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-cop-held-in-honeytrap-case/articleshow/83382970.cms||---

A June 2 report by the district health office said nearly 27.38 lakh beneficiaries have received their first or second shot of the vaccine and a 1.7% wastage may mean at least 40,000 doses may have been discarded so far. Separate data on Covishield and Covaxin wastage was not available. District officials said the current 1.7% wastage is a big improvement from levels in March (9.4%), April (7%) and May (2.5%). Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical) Pune circle, said, “The wastage could be attributed to data entry errors by authorities in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and rural areas. We have asked all local officials to reconcile the data they are getting on vaccine usage as soon as possible. Deshmukh said the data corrections — in supply to hospitals from vaccine storage points — will further reduce wastage numbers. Ten beneficiaries can be vaccinated with one vial of Covishield and Covaxin. Once opened, a vial has to be used within the next four hours. Doses are usually lost when a vaccination site doesn't have enough beneficiaries present for a session. Due to low turnouts, many states have reported wastage in the last vials of the day. State immunization officer D N Patil said Maharashtra has 0.5 to 1% vaccine wastage on average. Nationwide, there has been a substantial reduction in vaccine wastage — from 10% earlier this year to 5% recently. The Centre has requested all states and UTs to keep Covid-19 vaccine wastage at under 1% The wastage data comes amid renewed efforts to keep up pace of vaccination coverage in the district. The PMC said it will now be offering Covaxin on priority to those who're waiting for a second dose in the 18-44 group. The vaccine will be available at 16 centres — 60% of shots will be for those booking slots online. The rest will be for walk-ins. The PMC will also offer Covishield from 55 centres to beneficiaries up for a second dose in the 45-plus, healthcare and frontline categories. The PCMC will offer Covaxin to both — 45 plus and 18-44 groups — on priority from 16 centres on Thursday. Covishield will be offered from 49 centres to the 45-plus category. On Wednesday, a total of 27,513 beneficiaries were vaccinated against Covid-19. There were 18,876 vaccinations in PMC limits and another 5,340 in PCMC limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dist-vax-wastage-at-1-7-slightly-above-maha-avg/articleshow/83382960.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Yarn flux riddle gets textile producers’ heads spinning||LUDHIANA: Relieved though at the sight of easing lockdowns in the other states and hopeful that goods will start moving, the garment and textile producers have a new worry in the fluctuating rates of yarn, their biggest raw material. They claim that the hike is artificial. The manufacturers look to the state and central governments for help in increasing production. Sharing his concerns with the media, Bharatiya Vyapar Mandal senior vice-president Radhe Shyam Ahuja said: “In the last one year, the price of yarn increased by 64% or more. The cost of each kilogram of acrylic yarn moved from Rs 170 in September 2020 to now Rs 280. PC Yarn which, one of the commonest raw material, went from Rs 150 to Rs 240 in the same interval, while cotton yarn blew up from Rs 250 to Rs 300.” Ahuja, who also is president of the Ludhiana Yarn Dealers Association, said: “The huge increase and frequent fluctuation in the yarn rate hurts not only the garment and textile industry but also the yarn traders and general public. A handful of people engineer this fluctuation. We are trying to alert the central and state governments, along with expecting a solution.” Knitwear Club chairman Vinod Thapar said: “A pricier yarn is beyond our understanding, as the ground report suggests a huge drop in demand over the last few months due to a fall in production. Instead of declining, the rates have shot up, that too by 50 to 60%, which makes it clear that this is a man-made situation. The garment makers who lost sleep over how to dispose of the huge stock that piled up during the lockdowns now must also find a way to absorb the price shock.” Moti Nagar United Factory Association executive member Hemant Abbi said: “A costlier yarn has given us a big headache. Many members shut their factories and got into trading because they couldn’t take more losses. The rest of us also feel helpless, since the trend of unjustified increase in the yarn rates has not changed for a year and the government is unable to do anything about it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/yarn-flux-riddle-gets-textile-producers-heads-spinning/articleshow/83378829.cms||Mohit Behl

However, he did not disclose the reasons for postponement of the repair work. Had this work commenced, drinking water supply to 362 villages and 176 hamlets in nine municipalities would have been affected. According to officials, talukas like Kheralu, Vadnagar, Visnagar and Unjha falling under Mehsana district, Siddhpur in Patan and Palanpur, Ambaji, Danta and Kanodar in Banaskantha would have faced water shortage for at least three days as the water supply would have been discontinued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/repair-work-at-dharoi-dam-postponed/articleshow/83378855.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichy: National cadet corps may soon be part of academic curriculum||TRICHY: Officers from the Trichy NCC group met Bharathidasan University vice-chancellor M Selvam with a request to introduce NCC as an elective subject with the undergraduate curriculum. While NCC is imparted as an extra-curricular activity, attempts are being made to introduce NCC as credit course with an intent to transform NCC training into a curricular activity providing academic credits to students undergoing NCC training. Colonel C Elevarasan, Group Commander, Rockfort Trichy Group, said that the new education policy suggests that there should not be a hard separation between the extra-curricular activities and co-curricular activities. Taking this into view, the directorate general of NCC has suggested that NCC which is so far an extra-curricular activity be considered as part of the curriculum. We took up the matter with the vice chancellors of Bharathidasan University (BDU) Trichy and Alagappa University in Karaikudi. We explained to M Selvam, VC of BDU and N Rajendran of Alagappa University on the benefit of the schemes, he said. So far, the NCC training was given in an unstructured way. Seeing the new education policy, we have now given it a proper structure and we have framed 300 period of classroom curriculum and 240 periods for outdoor camps for a period of three years. Saying that the university has agreed to consider the request, Colonel Ilavarasan said that by making NCC part of the curriculum more number of academically bright students are expected to join. “There was hesitation among bright students in taking up NCC as they felt that their academic activity will be affected due to outdoor camps. Now that NCC is part of the curriculum, we expect more such bright students to take up NCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ncc-may-soon-be-part-of-academic-curriculum/articleshow/83382989.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy, while resuming hearing in the batch of Covid-19 PILs, made it clear to health secretary SAM Rizvi, who was present before the virtual court, they were giving two weeks to bring out a clear GO specifying charges for each service. The bench slammed the health secretary for replying that he would write to the competent authority to ensure that the capping GO was issued at the earliest. “We are not interested in seeing the movement of your file. We want to see a copy of the GO”, the bench said, asking him to bring it on June 23, the next date of hearing. Later, director of public health Dr G Srinivas Rao, while responding to a query on recovery of excess charges from hospitals, shocked everyone when he declared that he had already recovered Rs 65 lakh from the errant hospitals so far. The health secretary said they were taking the private hospitals into confidence and have received representations from the association of smaller hospitals. “We are yet to receive such a representation from corporate hospitals,” Rizwi said. The bench also came down heavily on National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) for filing an affidavit without explaining why they did not bring Covid-19 medicines under the national list of essential medicines. Rejecting the affidavit, the bench said: “Let the director of NPPA now file an affidavit explaining how he has risen to the occasion to ensure the inclusion of Covid-19 medicines in the list of essential drugs.” The director of public health informed the high court that of 14 RT-PCR labs, eight have already become functional and the remaining would become functional from Thursday.The director conveyed to the bench that the state government has brought in 19 diagnostic labs to test people quickly and also to extend them all kinds of diagnostic services free of cost. “We are gearing ourselves up for meeting the challenge that may come in form of Covid third wave. Apart from Niloufer hospital, we are upgrading several hospitals in state as children hospitals and more than 4,000 oxygen beds for kids are being made ready to meet any eventuality,” Dr. Srinivas Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-gives-govt-2-weeks-to-cap-pvt-hospital-charges/articleshow/83382993.cms||---

Sanjay Shete, president of Chamber of Commerce in Kolhapur, said, “Our shops are closed for the last two months and we all have faced heavy losses. Either give all traders some monetary relief package or allow us to open our shops. More than 2,500 traders took active part in Wednesday’s protest by displaying banners and standing outside their shops following social distancing.” He added, “All the essential shop owners, bakeries, dairies, ration shops, grocery store owners and medical shops also supported our demand by keeping their shops closed for two hours in the morning. The administration should take our demands seriously. Otherwise, we will open our shops on our own.” Kolhapur district is currently under Level 4 of restrictions. But if the number of Covid positive patients from Karnataka, Sangli, Satara, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg who are undergoing treatment in Kolhapur is removed from the tally, then Kolhapur will fall in Level 3,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/traders-protest-in-kolhapur-city/articleshow/83380845.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Chennai||Chennai: Decomposed body found in General Hospital 15 days after patient went missing||CHENNAI: Two weeks after she went ‘missing’ from the third-floor corona ward of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, a 41-year-old Covid-19 patient was found dead in a decomposed state on the eighth floor of the same building on Tuesday. Her husband had lodged a missing complaint with hospital authorities and police on May 24, but M Sunitha, a homemaker, remained untraceable. While state health minister Ma Subramanian said CCTV cameras were available on these floors to monitor and track people, police inquiry revealed the cameras were defunct. Now, police cannot trace how, when or why the ‘missing’ woman went to the eighth floor. E Theranirajan, hospital dean, said, “We had intimated police that she was missing from the second day of admission.” “We have no clue how Sunitha, who was admitted at the third floor, reached eighth floor,” hospital dean said. Sunitha, a mother of a 17-year-old boy, tested positive for covid-19 on May 22 and got admitted at RGGGH the next day. Her husband Mouli, an electronics professor at a private engineering college in Andhra Pradesh, had gone home and returned to the hospital on May 24 with food, only to be told by hospital authorities that she was ‘missing’. As the hospital staff had no idea about her whereabouts, Mouli filed a complaint with police outpost in RGGGH and also started inquiring with friends and relatives. Since total lockdown was imposed, Mouli largely contacted them over phone from his Tambaram residence. When Mouli again came to RGGGH in search of his wife, the hospital staff shooed him away citing a new rule that did not allow attendants inside covid wards. So Mouli was constrained to lodge a complaint with Flower Bazaar police the same day. On Tuesday, however, the hospital staff alerted police about foul smell emanating from the eighth floor of the covid block (Tower-III), the same block where Sunitha had been admitted. Police found a woman’s decomposed body. The floor had a conference hall which was not in use. Mouli, who was still searching for his wife, was called to identify if it was his wife. Confirming that it was indeed Sunitha, Mouli broke down and was inconsolable. He said she could have been saved if authorities had taken his complaint seriously and launched a search for her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/decomposed-body-found-in-gh-15-days-after-patient-went-missing/articleshow/83380888.cms||A Selvaraj
---||Trichy||Trichy: Crowds are back, so are faces with mask pulled below chin||TRICHY: With fresh Covid-19 infections and active cases declining for about a week now in Trichy, people have started lowering their guard and crowding on commercial streets post the lockdown relaxations. Since the enforcement drive against those violating the standard operating procedures (SOPs) has slowed down, frontline workers and doctors fear this will cause a spurt in infection in the coming days. Although standalone grocery and vegetable shops are permitted to operate between 6 am and 5 pm, shopkeepers have been seeing substantial crowd at their stores between 9 am and 11 am and ahead of closing. If distancing measures like circles were marked in front of shops during the lockdown in the first wave, these are absent now despite the city recording a rise in Covid-19 deaths. While commuters have facemask while stepping out, most of them pull it down to their chin or throat, defeating its purpose. Street vendors were among those seen without masks when stationed on commercial streets. “Crowding in commercial localities is back. People are casually smoking and spitting at public spots,” Dr M A Aleem, a Trichy-based neurologist said. Medical professionals involved in mobile screening camps pointed out that SOPs were not being followed even in banks. Many people from the low-income groups, who have made the vacant space near bridges their home, have been crowding when good Samaritans approach them for supplying food packets. With the homeless yet to be vaccinated, volunteers involved in food distribution called for streamlining the crowd which they are unable to restrict. Though the city corporation had claimed that surveillance teams will monitor the shops, the enforcement is completely absent now. “We are yet to vigorously enforce the SOPs. Police and revenue department are also involved in controlling the crowd. But penalties are being levied and collected. People must show some responsibility too,” an assistant commissioner with Trichy corporation said. The civic body has also stopped sharing details of penalties levied from lockdown violators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/crowds-are-back-so-are-faces-with-mask-pulled-below-chin/articleshow/83382967.cms||Deepak Karthik

The minister said this after reviewing the desilting and stormwater drain maintenance works across the city that have been in neglect for years. He assured that at least six tanks will be revived ahead of monsoons to harvest surplus rainwater. Opening the inlet valve to fill the Jambukeswarar temple tank in Thiruvanaikoil with Cauvery water, the minister said, “Sellakaliyamman temple tank in E Pudur is being renovated at cost of Rs 58 lakh. By storing the rainwater in tanks, we can augment the groundwater table.” Unlike Srirangam and Thiruvanaikoil temple tanks which can be directly fed by the Cauvery water, Rockfort temple’s tank is being filled by the corporation’s overhead water tanks. Corporation was insisted to make similar arrangements for feeding the Rockfort teppakulam directly from the Cauvery river. Similarly, the 11-acre tank in Periya Milaguparai and Chinna Milaguparai will be revived, encroachments if any shall be evicted, the minister added. He also reviewed the progress of stormwater drain desilting work taken up by the across the four zones. Drains for a length of 10,115m will be desilted and dredged to prevent water inundation in low lying areas, corporation said. After inspecting the urban forest grown using the Miyawaki method in Srirangam, the municipal administration minister urged the urban civic body to replicate the Miyawaki plantation in other parts of the city as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/temple-tanks-to-get-new-lease-of-life-in-trichy-city/articleshow/83382975.cms||---

However, when even 22 of these injections failed to improve the patient’s condition, the doctor refused to administer the remaining jabs and raised an alarm. Suspecting he had been sold fake injections, Parmar approached the Amraiwadi police who arrested Hitesh Makwana, a native of Surendranagar. They are also on the lookout for accused Nitin alias Rahul Rajasthani, who is on the run. Parmar told police, “My friend’s relative Chandulal Saraya was admitted to Synergy Super Speciality Hospital and was in need of amphotericin B injections. After trying to get it from government hospitals in vain, I got Makwana’s contact number. He gave us 42 injections for Rs 7.97 lakh.” The price varied from Rs 21,000 to Rs 18,500 per injection. The injections were manufactured by LYKA Labs Limited, plot 480.1 GIDC Ankleshwar in Gujarat, said police. The 31-year-old told police, “On June 5, I called Makwana and said that I wanted more information about the injection. He came to Paldi on his two-wheeler. When I raised doubts about the drug’s authenticity, he called Rajasthani, who had supplied the vials to him. Rajasthani asked Makwana to collect the vials and return the money. When Makwana said he had collected the injections and Rajasthani should come with the money, he disconnected the call.” Parmar then took Hitesh to the police. Amraiwadi inspector D B Maheta said, “The drug inspector has been called to verify the content of the vials. Once we get the report, we will know if the injections are fake.” Police have registered a case of cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property and criminal conspiracy against Makwana and Rajasthani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vile-predation-22-dud-mm-vials/articleshow/83383190.cms||---

Unable to lay his hands on a single injection from government-approved outlets, the 31-year-old was forced to check other avenues to get the medicine that his friend’s relative needed. This is how he fell in Hitesh Makwana’s trap and ended up paying almost Rs 8 lakh for 42 vials of allegedly fake medicine. Parmar told police that his friend Dakshesh Patel, a resident of Naranpura, informed him that his relative Chandulal Saraya, a resident of Rajkot, was suffering from mucormycosis and needed the liposomal injections for treatment. The patient’s family had been unable to get the medicine in Rajkot and had called up their friends and family for help. Parmar went to Civil Hospital, SVP Hospital and other places but did not get the medicine. He also called several of his friends and sent messages asking for help to procure the injection. “A friend of mine from Gandhinagar forwarded my message to his friends and someone gave him Hitesh Makwana’s number.” Parmar told police, “I called Makwana who assured an uniterrupted supply of the injections. So, Dakshesh and I paid him a total of Rs 7.97 lakh for 42 injections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/desperation-landed-him-in-racketeers-trap/articleshow/83383187.cms||---

On the other hand, some have put their cycles away, focusing on indoor methods of fitness. Thus, cyclist Anand Vanjape, who has been promoting cycling for health and environmental reasons for the last decade, has launched the Pedal Mission initiative. The mission collects such out of use cycles, repair them and donate them to the needy. So far, they have collected 130 bicycles in Pune. The initiative was conceptualized six months ago. “Daily wage workers, domestic helps and other blue-collar employees have been relying on limited public transport facilities to get to their workplaces. Our mission provides them with an efficient solution,” Vanjape said. “It is an open-ended mission. Inspired by Vanjape’s initiative, people from different parts of the country have seeked his guidane to set up a mission in their cities,” he said. The mission accepts simple, non-geared and easy-to-maintain cycles so that the person it is donated to can easily afford the upkeep of it. One can reach out to Pedal Mission on 9890998644.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cyclist-collects-bikes-not-in-use-donates-them-to-needy/articleshow/83383051.cms||---

Surendran, who left for Delhi on Tuesday night, sought an audience with Prakash Javadekar, Union minister for environment and forest, to apprise him of the magnitude of tree felling and the possibility of putting the LDF government on the defensive. He also plans to spend a few days in Delhi, meet a few more ministers and seek their cooperation in putting up a political resistance against the LDF government. BJP state unit is of the opinion that tree felling case gives an ample opportunity to Centre to put pressure on LDF government. It is Surendran’s first visit to Delhi after the drubbing in assembly election. “The state president is supposed to file a report on party’s poll performance. Owing to Covid-related emergencies and travel restrictions, the statutory visit was delayed. The primary objective of his visit must be to brief the central leadership about the reasons for the electoral rout,” said a national leader. Sources said Central leadership is distraught over BJP’s performance in assembly elections. The slew of allegations that followed, connecting leaders, has aggravated the already-brewing discontent against the state leadership. “Since allegations are a direct attack against BJP, central leadership wants to play it safe. It’s averse to a sudden rejig in the party state unit. Rather, the focus would be to earn credibility for the party in state. Central leadership has high regard for party cadres in Kerala. But they are unhappy that warring leaders aren’t competent enough to make political inroads by fighting LDF and UDF,” sources said. Meanwhile, a BJP delegation met governor Arif Mohammed Khan to apprise him of the alleged plot against BJP. “The government is charging false cases against BJP leaders to divert public attention from Muttil tree felling case. Police are trying to defame BJP leaders by unnecessarily summoning them in Kodakara heist case. BJP has publicly clarified the truth in Kodakara case,” said Kummanam Rajasekharan after meeting the governor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/surendran-seeks-centres-help-to-corner-ldf-govt/articleshow/83381039.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Covid wave ebbs: More relaxations from June 11 in Gujarat||GANDHINAGAR: With daily Covid-19 cases registering a constant decline, the state government announced more relaxations in commercial activities from June 11, Friday. The new guidelines will remain in force from June 11 to June 26 in 36 cities of Gujarat, including Ahmedabad and other municipal corporations. Gymnasiums will finally be allowed to reopen from Friday and restaurants will be allowed to have dine-in customers. Gyms had been shut down when cases were soaring in the second wave and restaurants were not allowed dine-in customers. Parks and gardens will open after a long spell of closure and social, political and religious gatherings will be allowed with limited numbers. However, there will be no relaxation in night curfew in all 36 cities and towns. Night curfew will be imposed from 9pm to 6am in all 36 cities, the government said. All shops, commercial establishments, vendors with handcarts, shopping complexes, market yards, hair cutting saloons, beauty parlours and other commercial activities will be able to remain open for an additional hour from Friday. Instead of closing at 6pm, these establishments can now remain open until 7pm. In the interest of students who want to pursue higher studies abroad, examinations like IELTS, TOEFL, etc can be conducted from June 11 with strict adherence to standard operating protocol (SOP) from June 11. Narendra Somani, president of the Gujarat chapter of the Hotels and Restaurants’ Association, said, “Resuming dine-in services in the day will help revive our order volumes which were greatly reduced, as were revenues. The restaurant industry is in a tumultuous period, because we are unable to meet operating costs. Allowing food deliveries till midnight and dine-in operations in the day will sure help us recoup our costs.” Gym owners also breathed a sigh of relief on being allowed to resume after over two months. “Meeting overheads was becoming impossible and several gyms in Ahmedabad were forced to close because they could not pay rent,” said the owner of a gym in Prahladnagar. “Orders and inquiries have begun to pour in and the further extension by an hour will help ahead of the festival season during the Shravana month,” said Kirit Patel, president of Panchkuwa Mahajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-wave-ebbs-more-relaxations-from-june-11/articleshow/83383185.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik: Private hospitals shift focus on non-Covid cases||NASHIK: With the number of Covid cases reducing fast in the city, private hospitals, that had been treating Covid patients till now, are now focusing more on treatment of non-Covid cases. Senior office bearers of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nashik, and Private Hospitals Owners’ Association said most of the hospitals have now increased the bed capacity for non-Covid patients due to the drop in Covid cases. Raj Nagarkar, the vice-president of the Private Hospitals Owners’ Association, said the private Covid care centres, that were started in the city, have been closed as they did not have any patients. Since these were only Covid facilities, non-Covid patients could not be admitted there.  However, many hospitals were treating both Covid and non-Covid patients but due to a drop in cases, the focus will be more on treating non-Covid patients, said Hemant Sonanis, the president of IMA Nashik. He said there were 180 hospitals in the city that were treating Covid patients. Many doctors said since they were already treating non-Covid patients at their centres, they have increased the bed capacity for non-Covid patients. The sections and staff for Covid and non-Covid patients are separate. Bhausaheb Nagargoje, the medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said while there are around 40 to 50 hospitals only for treating Covid patients, the question of treating non-Covid patients does not arise. In case, there is a surge in Covid cases again, the hospitals will be instructed to increase the bed capacity and the Covid care centres would also be reopened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-pvt-hospitals-shift-focus-on-non-covid-cases/articleshow/83376394.cms||Santosh Sonawane

But two days after his death, the mahant’s followers found a 20-page suicide note which mentioned names of the accused while cleaning his room. The suicide note also had details about how he was being blackmailed by the accused using a video which showed him with a woman. Police sources said that Alpesh and Hitesh had reportedly extorted Rs 20 lakh from Sadhu over the last one and a half year by blackmailing him. After the suicide note surfaced, trustees of Shree Khodiyar dham Ashram education and charitable trust approached police and lodged a complaint against accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-booked-in-mahant-suicide-case-in-rajkot/articleshow/83378909.cms||---

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had told the fire department to conduct the fire audit of all Covid and non-Covid hospitals run by the government, civic body and cantonment boards in the city, following a fire at a Covid hospital in Mumbai in March. “The audit was conducted for two months, following which it was concluded that there was no serious lapse at the medical facilities,” said Prashant Ranpise, the chief fire officer. The audits were carried out by the fire brigade with the help of private agencies. Instructions would also be given to private hospitals to complete the fire audits, for which 50 licensed auditors were available, a PMC official said.The PMC officials said that during the audits, details about the availability of fire fighting equipment, trained manpower and plan for emergency and fire exits are checked. The auditors also check the validity of fire extinguishers and whether they are filled or not. Any likely short circuit points and possible causes that could lead to a fire are identified and solutions are suggested.“Though the civic body claims that an audit has been conducted, it seems that it was carried out on paper. Had the audits been conducted physically at all hospitals, the elected members would have got information about it,” Aba Bagul, the leader of Congress in the PMC, said. He said that there was doubt about the availability of manpower and other facilities to conduct the audits. The civic body should declare the details of each and every fire audit of the hospitals, he added. “All the details of the fire audit would be available in public domain soon,” a PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-lapses-found-in-govt-health-hubs-in-fire-audit-pmc/articleshow/83383071.cms||---

The accused, Rashid Zafar, was arrested in 2018 on the allegations of being member of an IS-inspired group, which was planning suicide attacks and serial blasts, targeting politicians as also government installations in Delhi and other parts of north India. Advocate M S Khan claimed in the application, which is likely to come up for hearing on Thursday, that the incident was narrated by the accused to his father telephonically from Tihar Jail. “The accused was beaten up and forced to chant religious slogans like ‘Jai Shri Ram’ by his inmates,” the application said. The plea requested that “appropriate directions may be passed to the jail superintendent to look into the matter.” The accused was arrested along with nine others in December 2018, after National Investigation Agency carried out searches, in coordination with Special cell of Delhi Police and Anti-Terrorism Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police, at six places in Jafrabad and Seelampur in Delhi, and 11 places in UP — six in Amroha, two in Lucknow, two in Hapur and two in Meerut. The searches and the arrests came a month before the Republic Day celebrations. According to NIA, a locally-made rocket launcher, material for suicide vests and 112 alarm clocks to be used as timers were recovered from the searches.

---||Nashik||Nashik district’s Covid fatality rate marginally improves||NASHIK: The Covid case fatality rate (CFR) in Nashik district has marginally improved since the peak of the infection in April-May 2021. The CPR in the district dropped from 1.32% on April 3 to 1.29% on June 8. The difference is not much but with the drop in the number of Covid cases, the recovery rate will increase rapidly and the CPR will reduce further because the number of deaths over the past 15 days is now being uploaded on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal, the district officials said. The daily death number in the data collected from the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), Nashik rural and Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) shows a slightly higher count, but this will also reduce in a couple of days, the officers said. “Currently, the deaths that are recorded with the administration are the ones that took place over the past 10 to 25 days. We are likely to see a rise in the number of deaths ‘registered’ after updating with the ICMR till June 10,” said Ashok Thorat, the civil surgeon of the Nashik Civil Hospital. The civil surgeon has set the deadline of Thursday for the completion of the registration of all the deaths. “At present, as there are fewer critical Covid cases, the number of deaths is also low. Besides, there is no shortage of medicines, oxygen beds or ICU beds and, therefore, almost all the patients are recovering,” he said. Nashik rural has recorded 2,164 Covid deaths, while Nashik city has recorded 2,448 fatalities. The MMC has reported 319 deaths. A total of 100 people, who came from out of the district but were undergoing treatment in Nashik district, succumbed to the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dists-covid-fatality-rate-marginally-improves/articleshow/83376441.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC panel OKs Rs 84 crore oxygen plants, ignores cos’ alleged black past||MUMBAI: Ignoring all allegations of rigging and participation of tainted companies in the tender process, the standing committee of the BMC on Tuesday cleared a Rs 84 crore proposal for the installation of 16 oxygen plants in the city by a company which was said to have been penalised in the penguin enclosure project at Byculla zoo and an oxygen plant manufacturer that was allegedly blacklisted for shoddy work by Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Jaipur, in November. The standing committee approved the proposal to award the work to construct 16 oxygen plants at 12 locations to the Highway Construction Company. Times ViewThe BMC has received a lot of praise from across quarters for its oxygen management, including from the Supreme Court. Before awarding the contract, the BMC should have come clean on all allegations of tainted companies taking part in contracts for setting up oxygen plants at a cost of Rs 84 crore in the city and ensured that the work is awarded to competent firms in a transparent manner. Already, there has been a delay in this project. Now the BMC must ensure that it is completed swiftly.While tenders were invited for the about Rs 84 crore project in April and the plants were supposed to be constructed in a month, the project was stuck after the BJP raised objections to tainted companies being in the running for it. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane tweeted: “The black listed company which was never qualified to get penguins in the Byculla zoo now gets a Rs 90 cr contract to make oxygen plants in Mumbai! Nightlife gang favourite Highway Construction does it again! Utter shameless, BMC and baby penguin Gang!!” BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said he had written to additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu asking him to disqualify the blacklisted firm. “M/s Highway Construction Company, which was penalised in the 2016 penguin enclosure construction, has taken an authorised dealer/distributor contract/MOU from M/s Unissi India Private Limited so as to fulfil the tender condition that allows the authorised dealer/distributor to claim the experience of the original equipment manufacturer. Unissi India was blacklisted by Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Medical College,” Mishra said. Mishra also alleged that the BMC had inflated the estimated cost of the contract to around Rs 86 crore when the actual cost was only Rs 25-30 crore. “We will move the Bombay high court on this if the plants are not installed on time,” Mishra said. Velrasu said the BMC had taken an affidavit from the company that it was not blacklisted and that it will complete the work on time. “It is again confirmed from the agency under an affidavit that it was not blacklisted. The one-month period will start once we give the work order to the agency. BMC also has to hand over the working space to the agency,” he said. Romin Chedha of the Highway Construction Company and Unissi India did not respond to queries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-panel-oks-rs-84cr-o2-plants-ignores-cos-alleged-black-past/articleshow/83384488.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Ranchi||No uranium, radioactivity in packets seized in Bokaro: DAE||BOKARO: The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has said that the unidentified material seized in Bokaro is not uranium or radioactive in nature. It, however, did not specify what the material or mineral was. The Mumbai-based DAE’s clarification came after the Bokaro police said 6kg of a yellow mineral suspected to be uranium had been seized on June 2. Seven people have been arrested in the case. “Through spot inspection and laboratory analysis of samples of the material, it is confirmed that the material is not uranium and is not radioactive,” a DAE spokesperson said in a note. The note added that the material does not cause any radiation-related health hazard to living beings or the environment. The local police, which has booked the arrested people under sections of the Atomic Energy Act as well, had also said the material had a 'Made in USA' marking. Police sources said they will continue to investigate the matter as to why the substance was being branded for sale as uranium and to what purpose. The cops are preparing to take the accused in their remand. Bokaro SP Chandan Kumar Jha said: “We are yet to receive any official word from the DAE or from the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) in this regard. We are not in a position to comment unless we get the report.” The seizure had come within weeks of uranium recovery from a gang in Mumbai, which was confirmed to be the material used in nuclear applications. Other security agencies of the state and the Center are keeping an eye on this matter. Pakistan had also expressed concern over the recovery of uranium in India and demanded an investigation. There was panic after seven people were arrested with three sealed packets with uranium written on them. The accused confessed that the substance was uranium and they were looking for customers. One of the accused, identified as Bapi, had confessed to have received the substance from a Giridih resident, who is now absconding. Samples from the packets were collected for tests by the UCIL on June 6. Preliminary tests conducted by experts of the UCIL revealed no traces of radioactivity from the samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-uranium-radioactivity-in-packets-seized-in-bokaro-dae/articleshow/83382301.cms||---

Earlier, too, I had told the media there we don’t have any issues between us. There is no misunderstanding between us,” Sawant told reporters. Since late 2020, Sawant and Rane have locked horns over many issues. In December 2020, Rane wanted to close down all the New Year’s eve parties, but Sawant rejected the suggestion. Then, earlier this year, just before the second wave, Rane was in favour of a lockdown and imposing restrictions on tourists visiting the state to control the spread of Covid. But Sawant had shot down that proposition too, choosing instead to keep the economy running. In another instance, more recently, BJP had to intervene between Sawant and Rane after the latter sought an inquiry into the Covid deaths occurring at the Goa Medical College in the early hours every morning due to shortage of oxygen. The chief minister said that the state government is in the process of scheduling Tika Utsav 3.0 to cover the maximum number possible in the age group of 18 to 44 years. “Let people criticise the state government for organising Tika Utsav, but it is through it that the state government has been able to reach many people for vaccination,” he said. People’s response to the Tika Utsav, which are walk-in vaccination drives, have been good, he said. Talking about the high Covid mortality seen in the second wave, the chief minister said that, in Goa, 100% of the Covid deaths are recorded which is why the figure is high. “Even deaths of those in home isolation are recorded at the primary health centre,” Sawant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-dismisses-speculations-says-no-misunderstanding-with-vishwajit/articleshow/83383211.cms||---

All this while, we were just focused on board exams.” He added, “The government decision to hold four entrance examinations for JEE would give more time to students to prepare but at the same time increase the level of competition.” Pankaj Singh, a coaching institute owner, said that NEET aspirants are undergoing online coaching, tests and doubt clearing session at the moment. A significant section of the humanities students are, however, worried about the mode of awarding board marks. Sudhanshu Pandey, a Class XII student of JVM Shyamli, said, “Many students were not serious during internal examinations and they were planning to focus on improving their performance in the board exams. These students are fearing that if CBSE adopts marks them on the basis of internal examinations it would be difficult for them to get admission in renowned institutes like the Delhi University.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/with-boards-out-of-the-way-pupils-focus-on-neet-iitjee/articleshow/83394417.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Foreign-bound students queue up to take vaccine||SURAT: As many as 247 foreign-bound students took the vaccine on the first day on Monday and 296 students were inoculated on Tuesday. On Wednesday, however, only 16 students took the jab. Creating a separate system for the students helped them to get vaccinated without going through the tedious process of CoWin app and within 28 days of the first dose. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) begins vaccination drive for Foreign-bound students.However, students had to visit the centre twice only to collect the certificate of vaccination. SMC officials said that because these students’ registration was done separately, they cannot get the certificate through CoWin. A physical certificate authorized by the deputy commissioner (health and hospital) is issued to them two days after they take the vaccine. Students who are scheduled to travel abroad in July took their second shot at various designated centres in the city on Tuesday. While the vaccination process is smooth, change in travel guidelines and bans by foreign countries has left students on tenterhooks. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Tuesday began a drive to vaccinate students who are scheduled to travel abroad for higher education. Around 50 students were vaccinated across Ahmedabad on Day one itself, according to data provided by the civic authorities. “We will continue the vaccination drive on alternate days, depending on the number of requests we receive. The state government then issues a vaccination certificate to each student,” said AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/foreign-bound-students-queue-up-to-take-vaccine/articleshow/83379198.cms||---
