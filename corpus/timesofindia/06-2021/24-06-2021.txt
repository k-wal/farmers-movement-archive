The actions will build on executive orders signed in April when Biden asked the Justice Department to crack down on self-assembled "ghost guns," senior administration officials said. Executive orders allow the president to act without waiting on Congress, where Democrats hold only a razor-thin majority and Republicans generally oppose new limits on firearms. Gun rights, which are protected by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, are one of the thorniest issues in American politics. Biden also plans new steps to hold rogue firearms dealers accountable for violating federal laws, help states employ more police officers using funds approved earlier this year to help the economy recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, and strengthen efforts by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to stop illegal gun trafficking across states. Homicides rose 30%, and gun assaults rose 8% in large cities in 2020, the White House said. The "precipitous rise in homicides coincided with the emergence of mass protests after George Floyd was killed in late May by a police officer in Minneapolis," the report notes, adding "no simple connection exists between police violence, protests against such violence, and community violence." Property crimes, such as burglaries and larcenies, fell significantly in 2020. Biden will also meet on Wednesday with state leaders, mayors, a police chief, and other experts to discuss ways to make communities around the country safer. His moves come amid a growing impatience from gun-control activists that the administration has not acted more quickly to combat gun violence. Biden promised during his campaign that he would take action against gun violence on the first day of his administration but had so far only announced limited measures to deal with a problem he has called an "epidemic." "The secondary consequences of the pandemic and the proliferation of illegal guns have led to increased violence over the past year and a half," a senior administration official said. The US Treasury Department released information Wednesday on how states and localities can use funds from the American Rescue Plan Act to respond to violent crime, including by investing in community policing. US gun sales soared in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, amid social unrest over police killings of Black people and a contested presidential election. At the time, some experts warned a spike in homicides could be next. "It's pretty clear that more guns are more death," Harvard University professor David Hemenway, director of the school’s Injury Control Research Center, which studies injury prevention, told Reuters. While there is some "preliminary evidence" to support a connection between gun sales and homicides, "more research is required," the Council report notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-plans-new-steps-to-combat-us-gun-violence-as-violent-crime-climbs/articleshow/83790064.cms||---
---||World||China says border issue should not be linked to bilateral relations||BEIJING: China on Wednesday said the prolonged border issue with India should be addressed through peaceful negotiations and not be linked to bilateral relations. Asked for his reaction to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's comments at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday that China's military deployment along the disputed border with India and uncertainty over whether Beijing will fulfil its promise on troop reductions remains a challenge for relations between the two neighbours, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the border issue should not be linked to the bilateral relations. "We advocate that we should address the boundary issue through peaceful negotiations and we don't think that the border issue should be linked up to our bilateral ties," he said at a media briefing here.  "China always stands for a peaceful settlement of the boundary issue through negotiation and against linking the boundary issue with bilateral relations," the Chinese foreign ministry later updated its response on the ministry's website. Zhao said the military deployment by China in the western sector along the border is a "normal defence arrangement." "China's military deployment along the western section of the China-India border is a normal defence arrangement aimed at preventing and responding to encroachment and threat on China's territory by relevant country," he said. In his remarks, Jaishankar said that the larger issue relating to the border row in eastern Ladakh is whether India and China can build a relationship based on mutual sensitivity and respect and whether Beijing would live up to the written commitments about both sides not deploying a large armed force along the frontier.  It has been more than a year since the military standoff between China and India erupted in eastern Ladakh on May 5, 2020 during which there were fatalities on both sides for the first time in 45 years. They have made limited progress in achieving disengagement at the Pangong Lake area. The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points. India has been particularly pressing for the disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. Last month, Indian Army Chief Gen. MM Naravane said that there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-says-border-issue-should-not-be-linked-to-bilateral-relations/articleshow/83790921.cms||---
---||World||US House Republicans aim to use private sector to tackle climate change||WASHINGTON: More than 50 Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday formed a group to discuss how to use the free market to fight climate change, in an example of a growing willingness of some in the party to consider tackling global warming. Led by Representative John Curtis of Utah, the Conservative Climate Caucus includes representatives from every committee in the House with jurisdiction over climate policy. Democrats narrowly control the House. Curtis said the group, which represents about a quarter of the Republican caucus in the House, aims to bring Republicans together to discuss using innovation and resources to cut greenhouse gas emissions while boosting prosperity. "We do care about climate, and we already have solutions and plan to find more," he said. Some Republicans, however, have downplayed the severity of the climate change issue while others have branded it a hoax. Former President Donald Trump was dismissive of the problem as he dismantled climate policies and regulations on fossil fuels. But some of Trump's fellow Republicans helped pass the Energy Act of 2020, which included measures to boost technologies such as carbon capture and storage and renewable energy. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, is hoping to push through more climate initiatives in a $1.7 trillion infrastructure bill, but Republicans in the Senate, where Democrats have effective control, have said such proposals do not count as infrastructure. If the measures do not make it into the wider bill, Democrats could look to pass climate initiatives on a party line vote in legislation through a procedure called budget reconciliation. Conservatives are also organizing at a grass-roots level to promote what they say are private-sector solutions to climate change. Earlier this month the American Conservation Coalition, held what it billed as the country’s first conservative climate rally in Miami. The fixes being pushed by conservative activists and lawmakers include constructing more buildings out of wood, planting a trillion trees around the world, increasing use of emissions-free hydropower, and expanding research and development of advanced nuclear power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-house-republicans-aim-to-use-private-sector-to-tackle-climate-change/articleshow/83790275.cms||---

Gopi R, a resident of Chikka Begur near Whitefield, told police he had visited Mohith Chicken Centre owned by suspect Shanta Kumar on Sunday noon and ordered 2kg of chicken. Kumar noticed Gopi took an egg without informing him and asked the customer to place it back in the crate. Gopi told Kumar to charge him for the egg when he would make payment for the chicken. But Kumar objected to him taking the egg without his knowledge and Gopi argued he hadn’t stolen it. In a fit of rage, Kumar picked up an iron rod and allegedly assaulted Gopi. Gopi rushed to Begur police station and filed a case of assault and criminal intimidation against Kuma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-picks-up-egg-in-shop-gets-thrashed/articleshow/83791110.cms||---
---||World||Black cops seek $8 million in University of Washington racism claim||SEATTLE: Five Black officers with the University of Washington Police Department have filed claims of racism against the department and are seeking $8 million in damages, alleging they were routinely insulted and demeaned by co-workers and supervisors. Some officers said they were disciplined and denied promotions because of their race, KOMO-TV reported Tuesday. Officer Damien Taylor said a white supervisor referred to him as “(his) own negro" on a call and later laughed at me when I confronted him about it.” Officer Karinn Young said “a banana was put in front of my locker with a note reading, Here's your lunch, you monkey.'” The officers said University of Washington Police Chief John Vinson, who is also Black, was repeatedly criticized by white officers for hiring too many Black people. “White officers called Chief Vinson the n-word on several occasions,” said Officer Russell Ellis said in the claim. Vinson was later reassigned to an administrative position at the university, KOMO-TV reported. University spokesperson Victor Balta said the college is stunned by the allegations and that the institution has no record of complaints being filed with the allegations. “Any one of the incidents described here would prompt an immediate investigation and appropriate disciplinary action based on the investigation's findings,” Balta said. “We plan to initiate our own investigation into these allegations now that they have been brought to our attention." The University of Washington Police Department's website addresses racism, saying it "must be addressed and eliminated, both in policing and from our community, so all of us can live without fear of discrimination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/black-cops-seek-usd-8m-in-university-of-washington-racism-claim/articleshow/83790988.cms||---
---||World||Jury selection begins in newspaper shooting case||ANNAPOLIS: A Maryland judge carefully focused on asking potential jurors Wednesday whether they believed they could be fair and impartial in weighing the plea of guilty but not criminally responsible by a man who killed five people at the Capital Gazette newspaper nearly three years ago. Judge Michael Wachs said his goal was to have a jury empaneled on Friday in the high-profile case that traumatized the community in Maryland's state capital. The judge emphasized that Jarrod Ramos already pleaded guilty to all 23 counts against him in 2019, but he has pleaded not criminally responsible due to his mental health. Jurors in the second phase of his trial will be asked to determine whether Ramos lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct in a case that will be based largely on testimony from mental health experts. After delays in a case that will be three years old next week, an initial pool of 300 potential jurors was chosen for consideration to fill 12 seats on the jury and several alternates. About 50 of them were already dismissed, based on their responses to a questionnaire. The court ended up with about 20 qualified jurors after the first round of questioning Wednesday morning at the Anne Arundel County Circuit Courthouse in Annapolis, just a few miles (kilometers) from where the attack happened. Wachs said he is hoping to have a pool of 80 qualified jurors to choose from by the end of the day Thursday Many of the potential jurors who were dismissed said they would have a difficult time being impartial. Some cited the trouble the would have viewing a video recording of the attack that is expected to be shown. Ross Suter, senior vice president of litigation solutions for Magna Legal Services, described it as a unique case during a pandemic. ``They're really going to be looking for people that are impartial, that are reasonable, that are going to be able to listen and make up their minds,'' Suter said. Under Maryland's insanity defense law, a defendant has the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he is not criminally responsible for his actions. State law says a defendant is not criminally responsible for criminal conduct if, because of a mental disorder or developmental disabilities, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. ``My understanding is it's a difficult defense to make and to have success with,'' Suter said. Opening statements are scheduled for Tuesday, a day after the third anniversary of the shooting. If Ramos were found not criminally responsible, he would be committed to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital instead of prison. Ramos, 41, pleaded guilty to killing John McNamara, Gerald Fischman, Wendi Winters, Rob Hiaasen and Rebecca Smith in the June 28, 2018, attack on the newsroom. He had a well-documented history of harassing the newspaper's journalists. He filed a lawsuit against the paper in 2012, alleging he was defamed in an article about his conviction in a criminal harassment case in 2011. The defamation suit was dismissed as groundless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jury-selection-begins-in-newspaper-shooting-case/articleshow/83791233.cms||---
---||World||Afghan hospital burns after attack; Taliban seize border post in north||KABUL: Suspected Taliban fighters fired a rocket into a hospital in Afghanistan on Wednesday, sparking a blaze that caused extensive damage and destroyed Covid-19 vaccines though there were no reports of casualties, government officials said. In northern Afghanistan, the Taliban captured the town of Shir Khan Bandar, a dry port on the border with Tajikistan, sending customs workers and members of the security forces fleeing to safety over the border. Fighting between government forces and the insurgents has surged in recent weeks, with the militants gaining control of more territory as the last US-led international forces prepare to leave after two decades of fighting. Taliban spokesmen Zabihullah Mujahid denied responsibility for the attack on the hospital in the eastern province of Kunar, which a provincial health director said resulted in the loss of crucial supplies. "Different types of vaccine, including doses meant to fight polio and Covid-19 were destroyed in the fire," said Kunar health official Aziz Safai. Afghanistan has reported 4,366 deaths due to Covid-19 infections and 107,957 cases, as of Wednesday. Many health officials say the real number of coronavirus infections is likely much higher but many cases are not being detected because of little testing. The virus has been spreading as insecurity has been growing, especially since May 1 when the United States began the final stages of its troop withdrawal and the Taliban stepped up attacks on government forces. In Washington, the top US military officer said the Taliban controlled 81 of the 419 district centers in Afghanistan, though 60% of them were seized by the militant group last year. "It is true that the Taliban are sniping at, picking off outposts ... but there's a 300,000, plus or minus, military force, Afghanistan army and police force and it's their job to defend their country," said Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffd. He added that the Taliban did not control any provincial capitals. Tajikistan's border guard service said in a statement late on Tuesday it had allowed 134 Afghan servicemen to retreat into Tajikistan from Shir Khan Bandar, about 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the city of Kunduz. The Taliban seized ammunition and armoured vehicles in the town after Afghan authorities surrendered it to the advancing insurgents, Afghan officials said. The loss of the trading town will be a blow to the US-backed government as it struggles to stop Taliban advances in different parts of the country. In a statement on Wednesday, the Taliban said border trade ports that have fallen under the control of their fighters shall continue to operate. "All commercial import and export will function as normal and administrative work of traders will continue uninterrupted." The militant group also invited Afghan security forces and those working for the democratically elected government to "embrace the open arms of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban rule)." "We shall welcome and honor them, and send them to their homes and families with complete assurance." The group also instructed its fighters to ensure the security of public spaces, business and civilian residence are not harmed in the ongoing clashes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-hospital-burns-after-attack-taliban-seize-border-post-in-north/articleshow/83792151.cms||---
---||Goa||Sporting Clube will return to top tier soon, national title remains a dream: Natalina Vaz||Panaji: The orange was unmistakable at the Don Bosco ground in the city on Wednesday morning but the black strip on the right sleeve of Sporting Clube de Goa players’ jerseys couldn’t be ignored. It served as a reminder of Peter Vaz, a man who swam against the tide and made the club among the best in the country. The club’s founder passed away six months ago. His death on December 24 last year left everyone shell-shocked, and while questions were asked whether Sporting would continue, Peter’s wife, Natalina, has stepped up to carry forward the legacy. “It was a difficult time for all of us, not knowing whether we want to continue with football or not,” Natalina, now the club president, told TOI on Wednesday. “Peter was passionate about football. He put his heart and soul into it. I remember he used to finish work at 10pm and come home. Then, all his time was devoted to football. He was busy making calls to (club officials) Anju (Albuquerque), Victor (Fernandes). That’s the only reason why I decided we should continue with football, come what may.” Natalina’s decision to continue with the team fetched instant rewards as Sporting emerged champions in the Goa Professional League for the second successive year. Winning domestic trophies is nothing new to Sporting. The club has won all trophies in Goa multiple times but it’s the national title that Vaz craved the most. Whether it’s the National Football League, I-League, Federation Cup or Durand Cup, Sporting have made it to the final stage, only to end up with huge disappointments. Natalina, daughter Danira and son Nathan, have all seen this from close, thanks to their regular presence at football matches. It’s a shared dream too. “Our short-term goal is to win the Goa league treble (next season),” said Nathan, a junior state footballer. “We have a long-term vision of setting up an academy. Besides, a national title is something that we always keep dreaming about.” Sporting opted out of the I-League five years ago, in protest against the roadmap that made Indian Super League (ISL) the top-tier league, while providing no avenues for clubs to fight their way to the top. Since then, the club has plied its trade only domestically. “We have not lost sight of Peter’s dream. When things are a little conducive, we will return to the top and make another push,” said Natalina. Since being appointed president, Natalina has tried to get herself more involved. Her children are providing football lessons on a regular basis, but she admits it will take quite something to match the fierce passion that Peter had for the beautiful game. “Peter was hands on (as club owner). He knew the ins and outs of Indian football and interacted with the players regularly. He never shut the door on anyone and never portrayed himself as the boss. I hope to get there someday. “With the loss of Peter, we didn’t know where we were headed. For me, it’s difficult. I’m learning, trying to understand the bits and pieces of this game and the way it’s managed,” said Natalina.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sporting-clube-will-return-to-top-tier-soon-national-title-remains-a-dream-vaz/articleshow/83792432.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||World||Israel's new government Okays first settlement construction||JERUSALEM: An Israeli defense ministry body advanced plans for 31 West Bank settlement construction projects Wednesday, the first such move under the country's new government. The plans approved by the civil administration include a shopping center, a special needs school, and a number of infrastructure projects and zoning changes in existing West Bank settlements, Israeli media reported. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's new government was sworn in earlier this month, unseating longtime leader Benjamin Netanyahu after four deadlocked elections. His governing coalition is comprised of eight parties representing a wide spectrum of political positions, from Jewish ultranationalists to liberal factions and a small Islamist party. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlement construction illegal under international law and an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. Since Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war, it has constructed dozens of settlements in the West Bank, where more than 400,000 Israelis live alongside nearly 3 million Palestinians. The Palestinians seek the West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state. Peace talks between the two parties have been stalled for years. The US has urged Israel and the Palestinians to refrain from actions that could hinder peace efforts, including settlement activity. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid will be flying to Rome on Sunday to meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List of Arab parties in Israel's parliament, said following the approval of settlement construction that “the left has surrendered to the right and has put aside the diplomatic issue, but the right continues to harm the chances of peace and deepen the occupation, oppression, and dispossession of millions of Palestinians." Bennett has said that all parties will have to put ideological differences aside for the new government to function. A minister from the dovish Meretz party said the new government has agreed “at least at this stage, not to deal with” the Palestinian issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israels-new-government-okays-first-settlement-construction/articleshow/83792315.cms||---
---||Goa||FC Goa agree terms with Sporting for Kunal Kundaikar||Panaji: FC Goa have agreed terms with Sporting Clube de Goa for the transfer of defender Kunal Kundaikar. Kundaikar, who gave a good account of himself in the Goa Professional League this season, has signed a three-year deal with FC Goa. He will now join pre-season with the senior team and hope to catch the eye of coach Juan Ferrando. “(Founder) Peter Vaz always wanted the players to do well and then move higher, play in the Indian Super League (ISL). We are glad that Kunal has done enough to attract attention from ISL clubs. We wish him luck,” said Sporting Clube president Natalina Vaz. Last season, George D’Souza had moved from the club to Odisha FC. Goa are on the look out for a quality defender, crucial to the club’s fortunes with the reduction in foreign players from five to four. ATK Mohun Bagan defender Sumit Rathi was a target but the club turned down an official bid, insisting they have no intention of selling the former best young player in the ISL. “We have tracked Kunal in the Goa league and he was easily the best defender,” said one senior FC Goa official. “It could be too soon for him to make his debut in the ISL, but it’s up to him. If he does well in pre-season, he’ll make the senior squad.” Last season, Sanson Pereira moved from the Goa Pro League to FC Goa and impressed in the AFC Champions League.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-agree-terms-with-sporting-for-kundaikar/articleshow/83792683.cms||---
---||World||NIH begins clinical trial testing Covid-19 vaccine in pregnant women||The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Wednesday it had begun a study to evaluate the immune responses generated by Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant or postpartum women.  Pregnant women are at higher risk of complications including premature birth, high blood pressure with organ failure risk, need for intensive care and possible death, according to the NIH.  A research study conducted in February in Israel showed that antibodies were detected in all 20 women administered with both the doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine during their third trimester of pregnancy and also in their newborns.  Pfizer and BioNTech in February started a separate trial, with 4,000 international volunteers, evaluating safety and effectiveness of their Covid-19 vaccine in healthy pregnant women.  The NIH study, MOMI-VAX, will measure the development and durability of antibodies against the coronavirus in women vaccinated during pregnancy or the first two postpartum months.  The researchers will assess vaccine safety and also evaluate whether vaccinated pregnant women pass along protection to their babies via the placenta or breast milk.  Many pregnant women in the United States have already received the COVID-19 vaccine available under emergency use authorization.  "The results of this study will fill gaps in our knowledge and help inform policy recommendations and personal decision-making on Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy," National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director (NIAID) Dr Anthony Fauci said. NIAID is financing the study.  The trial will enroll up to 750 pregnant and 250 postpartum women within two months of delivery, who have already received or will receive a Covid-19 vaccine authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  The FDA has authorized vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson for emergency use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nih-begins-clinical-trial-testing-covid-19-vaccine-in-pregnant-women/articleshow/83792721.cms||---
---||World||Socialist Walton on track to be Buffalo's 1st woman mayor||BUFFALO, NY: India Walton, a socialist community activist, has defeated the four-term mayor of Buffalo in a Democratic primary, putting her on track to become the first woman to lead New York's second-largest city. The 38-year-old nurse and union leader captured a major political prize for the party's left wing with her victory over Mayor Byron Brown. The Associated Press called the race Wednesday after it became clear there were not enough absentee ballots for Brown to overcome Walton's lead. She had declared victory Tuesday night. As her apparent upset win sunk in, Walton paced on a darkened Buffalo street, putting her hand to her forehead and bowing in disbelief in a moment captured on camera. "Mommy!'' the 38-year-old nurse and union representative shouted into her phone, "I won! I'm the mayor of Buffalo!'' Walton is all but assured to win the general election in November. There is no Republican candidate in the race. Walton was born in Buffalo's economically depressed east side and became a working mother at 14. After earning her GED while pregnant, she went on to become a nurse in the same hospital where her twins were born. On the campaign trail, she said Buffalo's much-talked-about renaissance of recent years, marked by the transformation of the city's waterfront and medical campus, has passed too many residents by. "All that we are doing in this moment is claiming what is rightfully ours," Walton told cheering supporters inside a city nightclub. "We are the workers. We do the work. And we deserve a government that works with and for us." The victory in her first run for office came with the backing of the Democratic Socialists of America, the Working Families Party and the progressive People's Action in a campaign focused on affordable housing, health care and criminal justice reform. Asked by reporters if she identified as a socialist, she said, "Oh absolutely." "I'm just excited to be a part of this movement that is ushering progressive politics into Buffalo," she told reporters. "Being the third-poorest mid-sized city in this country, we should be considering how we begin to eradicate concentrated poverty and disadvantage, and Democratic socialist leanings are a big step in getting us there." Brown, who matched the record for Buffalo's longest-serving mayor and was a long-time ally of Gov Andrew Cuomo, did not immediately concede following a low-key campaign in which he largely ignored his challengers and declined Walton's request to debate. Both Brown and Walton are Black. A third candidate, Le'Candice Durham, finished last. Chris Kutalik Cauthern of DSA USA called Walton's victory ``hugely significant'' and said it also reflects the party's "emphasis on a bottom-up, volunteer-centered ground game.'' "(It's) the strength of Walton herself, her steady emphasis on working class politics, and the many volunteers in Buffalo who allowed a first-time candidate to beat a four-term incumbent,'' he said in an email. Bhaskar Sunkara, founding editor of socialist magazine Jacobin, said Walton's win against a well-known incumbent was ``the first and most significant victory at the executive level in modern US history'' for a candidate running as a socialist. ``We shouldn't understate that,'' he said. Sunkara said Walton's win in Buffalo - a Rust belt city once home to a thriving manufacturing base and the western terminus of the Erie Canal - could suggest an opening for socialists in similar cities nationwide. One potential opponent for Walton in the general election, Scott Wilson, filed paperwork to appear as a candidate on an independent line, Better Buffalo, but his designating petitions are being challenged for falling short of signatures. Election officials are expected to rule on the matter Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/socialist-walton-on-track-to-be-buffalos-1st-woman-mayor/articleshow/83792606.cms||---
---||World||Hong Kong's last pro-democracy paper publishes final edition||HONG KONG: Hong Kong's sole remaining pro-democracy newspaper published its last edition Thursday after five editors and executives were arrested and millions of dollars in its assets were frozen as part of China's increasing crackdown on dissent in the semi-autonomous city. The board of directors of Apple Daily parent company Next Media said in a statement Wednesday that the print and online editions would cease due to “the current circumstances prevailing in Hong Kong.” The silencing of a prominent pro-democracy voice was the latest sign of China's determination to exert greater control over the city long known for its freedoms after huge anti-government protests there in 2019 shook the government. Since then, Beijing has imposed a strict national security law — used in the arrests of the newspaper employees — and revamped Hong Kong's election laws to keep opposing voices out of the legislature. Apple Daily was founded by tycoon Jimmy Lai in 1995 — just two years before Britain handed Hong Kong back to China — and initially was a tabloid known for celebrity gossip. But Lai also portrayed the paper as an advocate of democratic values and said it should “shine a light on snakes, insects, mice, and ants in the dark," according to the paper. It grew into an outspoken voice for defending Hong Kong's freedoms not found in mainland China, and in recent years it often criticized the Chinese and Hong Kong governments for limiting those freedoms and reneging on a promise to protect them for 50 years after the handover. While pro-democracy media outlets still exist online, it was the only print newspaper of its kind left in the city. In a post on Instagram, the paper thanked its readers. “Even if the ending is not what we want, even if it's difficult to let go, we need to continue living and keep the determination we have shared with Hong Kong people that has remained unchanged over 26 years,” Apple Daily wrote. The newspaper said it planned to print 1 million copies for the final edition, up from the usual 80,000, and people lined up to buy them. The paper's announcement coincided with the start of the city's first trial under the year-old national security law that is being closely watched as a barometer of how strictly the courts will interpret the legislation. The widely expected move to close Apple Daily followed last week's arrests and crucially the freezing of USD 2.3 million of the paper's assets. Its board of directors wrote a few days ago to ask Hong Kong's security bureau to release some of the money so the company could pay wages, but it's not clear if it got a response. The paper also said it made the decision to close out of concern for employees' safety. The editors and executives were detained on suspicion of colluding with foreigners to endanger national security. Police cited more than 30 articles published by the paper as evidence of a conspiracy to encourage foreign nations to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China. It was the first time the national security law had been used against journalists for something they published. On Wednesday, police also arrested a 55-year-old man on suspicion of foreign collusion to endanger national security, according to Apple Daily, which cited unidentified sources. The paper said the man wrote editorials for it under the pseudonym Li Ping. Lai, the newspaper's founder, faces charges under the national security law for foreign collusion and is currently serving a prison sentence for his involvement in the 2019 protests. The move against Apple Daily drew criticism from the US, the EU, and Britain. The forced closure by Hong Kong authorities “is a chilling demonstration of their campaign to silence all opposition voices,” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a Twitter post. “It is clearer than ever that the (national security law) is being used to curtail freedom and punish dissent.” German Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Adebahr called the closure a “hard blow against press freedom in Hong Kong.” Amnesty International Asia-Pacific Regional Director Yamini Mishra said the police action against Apple Daily will “send a shiver down the spine of all media outlets operating in Hong Kong.” “The forced closure of Apple Daily is the blackest day for media freedom in Hong Kong's recent history," Mishra said. “The paper has been effectively banned by the government for publishing articles that criticized it, and for reporting on international discussions about Hong Kong." The law, imposed last year, criminalizes subversion, secession, terrorism, and foreign collusion. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have said the media must abide by the law, and that press freedom cannot be used as a “shield” for illegal activities. The first person to stand trial under the law, Tong Ying-kit, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges of terrorism and inciting secession by driving a motorcycle into police officers during a 2019 rally while carrying a flag with the slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times.” Several officers were knocked over and three were injured. That slogan was often chanted during the 2019 demonstrations, which began as protests against a bill allowing Hong Kong residents to be extradited to China for trial but burgeoned into broader calls for greater democratic freedoms. China was shaken by the breadth of the protests and responded with tough measures, including the national security law, which makes calls for Hong Kong's independence illegal. Tong's trial will set the tone for how Hong Kong handles national security offenses. So far, more than 100 people have been arrested under the law, with many others fleeing abroad. The result is that it has virtually silenced opposition voices in the city. A court ruled last month that Tong will stand trial without a jury, a departure from Hong Kong's common law traditions. Under the national security law, a panel of three judges can replace jurors, and the city's leader has the power to designate judges to hear such cases. The law carries a maximum penalty of life in prison for serious offenses. Tong is on trial at the High Court, where sentences are not capped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/hong-kongs-last-pro-democracy-paper-publishes-final-edition/articleshow/83792949.cms||---

The shootings occurred late Monday in the north-central state of Guanajuato, but were reported late Tuesday. The state prosecutors' office said the shop specialised in repairing motorcycles. Guanajuato has Mexico's highest number of homicides, and has been the scene of turf battles between the Jalisco drug cartel and local gangs. There was no immediate information on a possible motive in the shootings, but such attacks in Guanajuato in the past have been related to rivalries between drug gangs or street-level drug dealing. The battle for control of Guanajuato and its industrial and farming hub have continued despite increased efforts by police and the National Guard to contain the fighting. In recent months, the Jalisco cartel kidnapped several members of an elite state police force, tortured them to obtain names and addresses of fellow officers and began hunting down and killing police at their homes, on their days off, in front of their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/7-killed-in-shooting-at-mechanics-shop-in-mexico/articleshow/83793281.cms||---

It was also the first guilty plea in the major conspiracy case brought against members of the Oath Keepers. Graydon Young, who was accused alongside 15 other members and associates of the Oath Keepers of conspiring to block the congressional certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory, pleaded guilty to two counts: conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding. The second charge calls for up to 20 years in prison, but US District Judge Amit Mehta said federal sentencing guidelines call for Young to serve between 5 1/4 years and 6 1/2 years behind bars. Prosecutors could ask for even less time in exchange for his cooperation against other defendants. Young, of Englewood, Florida, was arrested in February and charged in the sweeping conspiracy case accusing members of the Oath Keepers of coming to Washington prepared to use violence and intent on stopping the certification of the vote. Authorities said in court documents that Young joined the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers in December, writing that he was “looking to get involved in helping ...” Later that month, Young reached out to a company that does firearms and combat training about a rifle class for four people, according to the indictment. Authorities say, Young, wearing a helmet and tactical vest, was part of the military-style “stack” seen on camera marching through the crowd before entering the Capitol building. Four other people — a Tennessee man, a Maryland man, and a Virginia couple — have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in the last two weeks. Judges have scheduled hearings for at least three other people to plead guilty to riot-related charges. Nearly 500 people have been charged in the insurrection where a pro-Trump mob sought to disrupt the certification of Biden's victory. Prosecutors have brought similar conspiracy charges against members of the Proud Boys, another far-right extremist group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/oath-keeper-pleads-guilty-in-january-6-attack-will-cooperate/articleshow/83793418.cms||---

The cows were reported running loose on the streets of Pico Rivera around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday after a gate at a meat packing facility was accidentally left open, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.  The herd made its way to a neighborhood about a mile (1.6 kilometers) away and one cow charged at four members of a family, knocking them to the ground. They suffered minor injuries.  A sheriff's deputy shot and killed the cow to protect the family from further injury, the sheriff's department said. The family members were taken to a hospital for treatment.  Pico Rivera City Manager Steve Carmona told KTLA-TV that at one point he had to jump onto a car to get out of the way of the herd.  "It was a pretty scary ordeal," he said.  The sheriff's unit that rides horses was dispatched to help recapture and transport the cows.  "Of the forty, thirty-eight were safely captured, one was shot, and one has not been located," the department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/40-cows-escape-la-suburb-slaughterhouse-1-charges-family/articleshow/83794025.cms||---
---||World||Calls grow to evacuate Afghans to Guam as US troops leave||SAN DIEGO: In the chaotic, final hours of the Vietnam War, the US evacuated thousands of South Vietnamese who supported the American mission and were at risk under the communist government. With US and NATO forces facing a Sept. 11 deadline to leave Afghanistan, many are recalling that desperate, hasty exodus as they urge the Biden administration to evacuate thousands of Afghans who worked as interpreters or otherwise helped US military operations there in the past two decades. Despite unusual bipartisan support in Congress, the administration hasn't agreed to such a move, declining to publicly support something that could undermine security in the country as it unwinds a war that started after the 9/11 attacks. "We have a moral obligation to protect our brave allies who put their lives on the line for us, and we've been working for months to engage the administration and make sure there's a plan, with few concrete results," Republican Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan said during a House hearing last week. Lawmakers have urged the administration to consider temporarily relocating Afghans who worked for American or NATO forces to a safe overseas location while their US visas are processed. Some have suggested Guam, a US territory that served a similar purpose after the Vietnam War. Kurdish refugees also were flown to the Pacific island in 1996 after the Gulf War. Guam's governor recently wrote to President Joe Biden to say the territory was ready to help if needed. The Biden administration for now is focusing on accelerating a special visa program for Afghans who helped US operations and pouring resources into relieving the backlog. "We are processing and getting people out at a record pace," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. "We are working with Congress right now to streamline some of the requirements that slow this process down and we're doing the kind of extensive planning for potential evacuation, should that become necessary." Zalmay Khalilzad, the State Department's special representative for Afghanistan reconstruction, warned lawmakers in May that "the departure of all educated Afghans" would "signal panic" and hurt the morale of the country's security forces. "This is a delicate, complicated balance that we have to keep," Khalilzad said. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado recently introduced legislation that would nearly double the number of visas available this year, to 8,000, and ease eligibility requirements. But he said congressional action will not be quick enough or sufficient. Even if the legislation passed immediately, the number of visas would fall far short of the estimated 18,000 Afghans waiting to be processed. That figure does not include their spouses and children, who would bring the total to about 70,000 people. And the average wait is more than three years. The process has been also hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, which led the US embassy in Afghanistan to suspend visa interviews. Crow, a former Army ranger who served in Afghanistan, said he prefers the government "evacuate our Afghan partners to a temporary evacuation site where we can safely conduct robust visa processing without threat to applicants' safety by the Taliban." In a statement this month, the Taliban vowed not to attack those who worked for Western interests, urging Afghans to remain at home and warning their ranks against revenge killings. Still, many Afghans are desperate for a visa, fearing violence not only from the Taliban but heavily armed warlords allied with the US and seeing now as their last chance to leave Afghanistan. The American withdrawal began May 1, when the number of US troops was between 2,500 and 3,500, and could be completed by July 4. Some 7,000 NATO forces are set to leave by Sept. 11. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said the government needs to find a "creative" approach to helping Afghans who worked with the US military. That could include sending more people from the State Department or the military to process visas in Afghanistan or evacuating people to a safe place to be vetted. "It's not only a moral issue, it's a national security issue," said King, who sits on both the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, adding that "we also have a practical responsibility, in terms of do we want people to help us in the future?" More than 300 interpreters have been killed in Afghanistan since 2016, according to No One Left Behind, an organization that advocates on their behalf. Former Army Maj. Matt Zeller said a military evacuation is the only viable option for thousands of Afghans facing threats who have been protected by the presence of US troops. "I'm only alive because my Afghan, Muslim translator saved my life by killing two Taliban fighters who were about to kill me in a battle," said Zeller, whose interpreter waited three years for a visa. The US government should have learned from what happened in Vietnam, said Jim Jones, a Vietnam veteran and former Idaho Supreme Court chief justice. Initially fearing a mass evacuation would undermine the South Vietnamese military, the US watched for weeks as the North Vietnamese Army overtook South Vietnam before starting to fly out Americans and allies. The effort ended with the largest helicopter evacuation in history in the final hours of the war. In less than 24 hours, Marine helicopters airlifted about 7,000 US military personnel, South Vietnamese who supported the American mission and their dependents. Many South Vietnamese soldiers and government officials left behind were killed or held in "reeducation" camps. They included troops who had helped Jones stay alive as an Army artillery officer. "We had a moral obligation to extract as many as possible but, instead, we abandoned them to a horrific fate," Jones wrote in the Military Times. "We simply cannot allow that kind of tragedy to happen again with the Afghans. I pray that this great nation does not again turn its back on beleaguered people who placed their trust in us." Pentagon leaders say they are ready to help in any way they can and downplayed concerns that history will repeat itself. "I don't see Saigon 1975 in Afghanistan," Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently told lawmakers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/calls-grow-to-evacuate-afghans-to-guam-as-us-troops-leave/articleshow/83793351.cms||---
---||World||Germany in rainbow colours as Hungary LGBTQ row heats up||MUNICH: Germany put on a show of colour on Wednesday in defiance of UEFA's refusal to light Munich's Euro 2020 stadium in rainbow hues, as a political row over Hungary's anti-LGBTQ law escalated. As tensions soared on and off the pitch, EU leaders and Hungary traded barbs over the new law banning LGBTQ educational content for children, with EU chief slamming it as a disgrace. Munich city authorities had planned to light the Allianz stadium up in rainbow colours during Germany's match against Hungary to "send a visible sign of solidarity" with Hungary's LGBTQ community. But UEFA refused the request and on Wednesday again doubled down on its stance. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said his organisation could not give in to "populist" demands from politicians but Germany said the football body sent the "wrong message". EU chief Ursula von der Leyen slammed as a disgrace the law passed by Viktor Orban's government banning the "promotion" of homosexuality to minors, prompting an immediate slap down from Budapest against her comments as "a shame". Just minutes before kick-off at Munich's Allianz Arena, a fan wearing a Germany shirt and waving a large rainbow flag evaded security to invade the pitch, running in front of the lined-up teams before being tackled by stewards and led away. When the doors opened earlier to the stadium, German activists wearing vests emblazoned with the logo "rainbow to go" were handing out rainbow flags to fans. German fan Michael, 51, told AFP he would have liked to see the stadium lit up. "I don't see it as political and I think that would have been a great signal," he said. But Hungary fan Csongor, 39, said the rainbow had "nothing to do with football ... We feel that this is a campaign against Hungary, against the Hungarian national team, against the Hungarian government." Orban has been at loggerheads with many Western EU nations over his stance on issues from immigration to press freedom. Hungary has also recently refused to sign up to joint EU foreign policy statements on Israel and Hong Kong, sparking frustration within the bloc. Fifteen of the EU's member states have signed up to voice their "grave concern" at the LGBTQ law that Budapest argues will protect children. At government question time in parliament, chancellor Angela Merkel added to critical voices including from France, saying she considered the law to be "wrong and incompatible with my understanding of politics". But UEFA argued that taking those views to the pitch by allowing the stadium display would be a mistake because it was "political". It added a rainbow to its logo and in a statement said it was "proud to wear the colours of the rainbow" but underlined its refusal of Munich's request. "UEFA cannot be used as a tool by politicians," UEFA's Ceferin told Germany's Die Welt newspaper. "We don't want to be used in populist actions." Budapest praised UEFA for taking a stance against "provocation", with stadia across Hungary preparing to light up in national colours in a tit-for-tat display during the Euro 2020 match. In a show of defiance, Munich put up six huge rainbow-coloured flags at its town hall and illuminated a huge wind turbine close to the stadium, as well as the city's 291-metre (955-foot) Olympic Tower. Other arenas across Germany also put on rainbow light displays, including Berlin's iconic Olympic Stadium, as well as Bundesliga venues in Cologne, Frankfurt and Wolfsburg. German newspapers, such as the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, displayed rainbows on their front pages, while Bavarian industrial giants such as Siemens and BMW also decked themselves in rainbow colours on Twitter. At the stadium, German fan Madeleine, 26, said she had replaced one of the flags on her headband with a rainbow-coloured one. "Germany must send a message - this is the best chance to do so," she told AFP. "They may not be able to light the arena but the fans are lighting up in its place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/germany-in-rainbow-colours-as-hungary-lgbtq-row-heats-up/articleshow/83793954.cms||---
---||World||Scientist Finds Early Virus Sequences That Had Been Mysteriously Deleted||About a year ago, genetic sequences from more than 200 virus samples from early cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China, disappeared from an online scientific database. Now, by rooting through files stored on Google Cloud, a researcher in Seattle reports that he has recovered 13 of those original sequences — intriguing new information for discerning when and how the virus may have spilled over from a bat or another animal into humans. The new analysis, released Tuesday, bolsters earlier suggestions that a variety of coronaviruses may have been circulating in Wuhan before the initial outbreaks linked to animal and seafood markets in December 2019. As the Biden administration investigates the contested origins of the virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, the study neither strengthens nor discounts the hypothesis that the pathogen leaked out of a famous Wuhan lab. But it does raise questions about why original sequences were deleted and suggest that there may be more revelations to recover from the far corners of the internet. “This is a great piece of sleuth work for sure, and it significantly advances efforts to understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who was not involved in the study. Jesse Bloom, a virus expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who wrote the new report, called the deletion of these sequences suspicious. It “seems likely that the sequences were deleted to obscure their existence,” he wrote in the paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal. Bloom and Worobey belong to an outspoken group of scientists who have called for more research into how the pandemic began. In a letter published in May, they complained that there was not enough information to determine whether it was more likely that a lab leak spread the coronavirus, or that it leaped to humans from contact with an infected animal outside of a lab. The genetic sequences of viral samples hold crucial clues about how SARS-CoV-2 shifted to our species from another animal, most likely a bat. Most precious of all are sequences from early in the pandemic because they take scientists closer to the original spillover event. As Bloom was reviewing what genetic data had been published by various research groups, he came across a March 2020 study with a spreadsheet that included information on 241 genetic sequences collected by scientists at Wuhan University. The spreadsheet indicated that the scientists had uploaded the sequences to an online database called the Sequence Read Archive, managed by the US government’s National Library of Medicine. But when Bloom looked for the Wuhan sequences in the database earlier this month, his only result was “no item found.” Puzzled, he went back to the spreadsheet for any further clues. It indicated that the 241 sequences had been collected by a scientist named Aisi Fu at Renmin Hospital in Wuhan. Searching medical literature, Bloom eventually found another study posted online in March 2020 by Fu and colleagues, describing a new experimental test for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese scientists published it in a scientific journal three months later. In that study, the scientists wrote that they had looked at 45 samples from nasal swabs taken “from outpatients with suspected Covid-19 early in the epidemic.” They then searched for a portion of SARS-CoV-2’s genetic material in the swabs. The researchers did not publish the actual sequences of the genes they fished out of the samples. Instead, they only published some mutations in the viruses. But a number of clues indicated to Bloom that the samples were the source of the 241 missing sequences. The papers included no explanation as to why the sequences had been uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive, only to disappear later. Perusing the archive, Bloom figured out that many of the sequences were stored as files on Google Cloud. Each sequence was contained in a file in the cloud, and the names of the files all shared the same basic format, he reported. Bloom swapped in the code for a missing sequence from Wuhan. Suddenly, he had the sequence. All told, he managed to recover 13 sequences from the cloud this way. With this new data, Bloom looked back once more at the early stages of the pandemic. He combined the 13 sequences with other published sequences of early coronaviruses, hoping to make progress on building the family tree of SARS-CoV-2. Working out all the steps by which SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a bat virus has been a challenge because scientists still have a limited number of samples to study. Some of the earliest samples come from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, where an outbreak occurred in December 2019. But those market viruses actually have three extra mutations that are missing from SARS-CoV-2 samples collected weeks later. In other words, those later viruses look more like coronaviruses found in bats, supporting the idea that there was some early lineage of the virus that did not pass through the seafood market. Bloom found that the deleted sequences he recovered from the cloud also lack those extra mutations. “They’re three steps more similar to the bat coronaviruses than the viruses from the Huanan fish market,” Bloom said. This suggests, he said, that by the time SARS-CoV-2 reached the market, it had been circulating for a while in Wuhan or beyond. The market viruses, he argued, aren’t representative of the full diversity of coronaviruses already loose in late 2019. “Maybe our picture of what was present early in Wuhan from what has been sequenced might be somewhat biased,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/scientist-finds-early-virus-sequences-that-had-been-mysteriously-deleted/articleshow/83794589.cms||---
---||World||McAfee antivirus software creator dead in Spanish prison||MADRID: John McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus software, has been found dead in his cell in a jail near Barcelona, a government official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  Hours earlier, a Spanish court issued a preliminary ruling in favor of the 75-year-old tycoon's extradition to the United States to face tax-related criminal charges.  Security personnel at the Brians 2 penitentiary near the northeastern Spanish city tried to revive him, but the jail's medical team finally certified his death, a statement from the regional Catalan government said.  The statement didn't identify McAfee by name, but said he was a 75-year-old U.S. citizen awaiting extradition to his country. A Catalan government source familiar with the event who was not authorized to be named in media reports confirmed to the AP that the dead man was McAfee. Spain's National Court on Monday ruled in favor of extraditing McAfee, who had argued in a hearing earlier this month that the charges against him were politically motivated and that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he was returned to the U.S.  The court's ruling was made public on Wednesday and could be appealed. Any final extradition order would also need to get approval from the Spanish Cabinet.  Tennessee prosecutors charged McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary. The criminal charges carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years.  The entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona's international airport. A judge ordered at that time that McAfee should be held in jail while awaiting the outcome of a hearing on extradition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mcafee-antivirus-software-creator-dead-in-spanish-prison/articleshow/83794724.cms||---

The incident occurred at a meeting in Athens of senior bishops. The 37-year-old priest, who was facing the hearing for alleged drug-related offenses, was arrested unharmed and detained for questioning. A police officer who helped restrain the suspect was also injured, as were a lawyer and a presiding clergyman. They were transferred to state hospitals, for treatment, and two clergymen were described as being in more serious condition. Police said it was not immediately clear what liquid was used, but added that the victims were being treated for burns. "I express my abhorrence at this unprecedented event," Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou wrote in a tweet after contacting Archbishop Ieronymos, the leader of the Greek church. Most of the victims hold the senior rank of metropolitan bishop. Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias visit an Athens hospital where the bishops were initially treated, joined by Archbishop Ieronymos. Ieronymos told reporters he was ``deeply saddened'' by the attack but relieved that none of the injuries were considered by doctors to be life-threatening. Health minister Kikilias said four of the bishops were more lightly injured and were receiving first aid, while one was transferred to the plastic surgery unit of another hospital and the other two might also be transferred to other hospitals with specialized units, including one with a specialist eye clinic. He said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis had asked for constant updates on the case. The motives for the attack were not immediately clear. State-run ERT television reported that the hearing was held as an appeal to depose the priest from the clergy. Police identified the victims as the metropolitan bishops Antonios of Glyfada, Kyrillos of Kifissia, Kallinikos of Arta, Nikodimos of Kassandra, Dionysios IV of Zakynthos, Dimitrios of Goumenissis, and Andreas of Dryinoupolis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/bishops-attacked-with-caustic-liquid-10-hurt/articleshow/83794687.cms||---

Two injured survivors of the attack in the small town of Togoga detailed the incident to CNN after they were brought to a hospital in Tigray's capital Mekelle by Red Cross ambulances. The bomb struck a market on the 33rd 'martyrs day' in Tigray - a date marking the Hawzen Massacre that killed more than 1,000 Tigrayan people at a market in Hawzen towards the end of the Ethiopian Civil War. Moreover, around ten ambulances were later blocked from leaving to assist the injured as they reached the outskirts of Mekelle, with the military accusing them of going to help the Tigray Defense Forces, according to medical sources. A team of doctors that tried to reach the scene in the evening were shot at by the military, eyewitnesses additionally informed. "Wounded civilians from the Togoga Massacre, who could have been saved easily in a hospital, have died overnight, as the invaders refused to allow ambulances to travel to the area. Their level of cruelty, their determination to see Tigrayans falling like leaves is unparalleled," tweeted Hailu Kebede, foreign affairs head of the Salsay Woyane Tigray opposition party on Wednesday. The disastrous seven-month-old civil war in the northern region of Tigray, where a powerful regional political party is waging a guerilla-style conflict against Ethiopia's military. The Ethiopian military has aligned with forces from neighboring Eritrea and Ethiopia's Amhara region. All sides have been accused of war crimes, and humanitarian groups say hundreds of thousands in Tigray are experiencing famine conditions. Ethiopia's government has steadfastly asserted that all blame for the fighting and ensuing suffering of people in Tigray lays at the feet of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which the government accuses of attacking a military command post in 2020 Meanwhile, Ethiopian voters on Monday went to polls on Monday in a national election that has been held as a long-awaited emergence into a multi-party democracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/30-killed-after-airstrike-hits-market-in-ethiopias-conflict-torn-tigray/articleshow/83794923.cms||---

Judge blasts Republicans for downplaying attack on US Capitol||A US federal judge on Wednesday harshly criticized Republican lawmakers for downplaying the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the US Capitol, questioning "what planet" they are living on. Hundreds of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol that day in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Biden's presidential election victory. The violence left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer, and more than 480 people have been arrested on charges linked to the attack. "I'm especially troubled by the accounts of some members of Congress that Jan. 6 was just a day of tourists walking through the Capitol," US District Judge Royce Lamberth said during a court hearing in Washington. "I don't know what planet these people are on." Lamberth, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan - one of the heroes of the Republican Party - said millions of people saw what he called a "disgrace" to the country. "The attempt by some congressmen to rewrite history and say this was all just tourists walking through the Capitol is just utter nonsense," Lamberth said. "It was not an accident that it turned violent," he said of the Capitol attack. "It was intended to draw to a halt the very functioning of our government." Lamberth did not name any particular legislator during his remarks, but Republican Representative Andrew Clyde last month likened the attack to a "normal tourist visit" during a congressional hearing. "Watching the TV footage of those who entered the Capitol and walked through Statuary Hall showed people in an orderly fashion staying between the stanchions and ropes, taking videos and pictures," Clyde said. "If you didn’t know the TV footage was a video from January the 6th, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit." Clyde did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Other Republican lawmakers have also downplayed the violence. Photos from Jan. 6 showed Clyde rushing toward the door of the House of Representatives while guards with guns drawn held off rioters trying to break into the chamber. Lamberth made his remarks during a sentencing hearing for Anna Morgan-Lloyd, 49, who was the first of about 500 people charged for participating in the Capitol siege to receive punishment. Morgan-Lloyd, of Bloomfield, Indiana, agreed to plead guilty to a single charge of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Lamberth sentenced her to three years of probation. "I went there to support and show support for President Trump, and I’m ashamed that it became a savage display of violence that day," Morgan-Lloyd said during the court hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/what-planet-are-they-on-judge-blasts-republicans-for-downplaying-attack-on-us-capitol/articleshow/83795272.cms||---
---||World||House panel pushes legislation targeting Big Tech's power||WASHINGTON: A House panel pushed ahead Wednesday with ambitious legislation that could curb the market power of tech giants Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple and force them to sever their dominant platforms from their other lines of business.  Conservative Republican lawmakers haggled over legislative language and pushed concerns of perceived anti-conservative bias in online platforms but couldn't halt the bipartisan momentum behind the package.  The drafting session and votes by the House Judiciary Committee are initial steps in what promises to be a strenuous slog through Congress. Many Republican lawmakers denounce the market dominance of Big Tech but don't support a wholesale revamp of the antitrust laws.  The Democratic-majority committee made quick work of arguably the least controversial bills in the package, which were approved over Republican objections. A measure that would increase the budget of the Federal Trade Commission drew Republican conservatives' ire as an avenue toward amplified power for the agency. The legislation, passed 29-12 and sent to the full U.S. House, would increase filing fees for proposed tech mergers worth more than $500 million and cut the fees for those under that level.  A second bill would give states greater powers over companies in determining the courts in which to prosecute tech antitrust cases. Many state attorneys general have pursued antitrust cases against big tech companies, and many states joined with the U.S. Justice Department and the FTC in their antitrust lawsuits against Google and Facebook, respectively, last year. The measure drew many Republican votes and was approved 34-7.  The panel then dug into a complex measure that would require online platforms to allow users to communicate directly with users on rival services. Proponents said it also would give consumers more power to determine how and with whom their data is shared.  The advance of the massive, bipartisan legislation comes as the tech giants already are smarting under federal investigations, epic antitrust lawsuits, near-constant condemnation from politicians of both parties, and a newly installed head of the powerful FTC who is a fierce critic of the industry.  The legislative package, led by industry critic Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., targets the companies' structure and could point toward breaking them up, a dramatic step for Congress to take against a powerful industry whose products are woven into everyday life. If such steps were mandated, they could bring the biggest changes to the industry since the federal government's landmark case against Microsoft some 20 years ago.  The Democratic lawmakers championing the proposals reaffirmed the case for curbing Big Tech as the committee began digging into the legislation.  It "will pave the way for a stronger economy and a stronger democracy for the American people by reining in anti-competitive abuses of the most dominant firms online," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the Judiciary Committee chair. "Each bill is an essential part of a bipartisan plan to level the playing field for innovators, entrepreneurs and startup - and to bring the benefits of increased innovation and choice to American consumers."  Conservative Republicans laid down their markers. They insisted that the proposed legislation doesn't truly attack anti-competitive abuses by the tech industry because it fails to address anti-conservative bias on its social media platforms.  And they previewed a fight over legislative definitions. The legislation as drafted would apply to online platforms with 50 million or more monthly active users, annual sales or market value of over $600 billion, and a role as "a critical trading partner."  The new proposals "make it worse," insisted Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the panel's senior Republican. "They don't break up Big Tech. They don't stop censorship."  The legislation's definition of which online platforms would fall under stricter antitrust standards could mean that companies such as Microsoft, Walmart and Visa would soon be included, Jordan suggested. "Who knows where it will end?" he said.  President Joe Biden's surprise move last week elevating antitrust legal scholar Lina Khan to head the FTC was a clear signal of a tough stance toward the tech giants. It was top of mind for the conservative Republicans objecting to the new legislation. Khan played a key role in the Judiciary Committee's 2019-20 sweeping investigation of the tech giants' market power.  The four companies deny abusing their dominant market position and assert that improper intervention in the market through legislation would hurt small businesses and consumers.  In a letter to committee leaders Tuesday, a top Apple executive said the proposed legislation "would undermine consumers' ability to choose products that offer state-of-the-art privacy and security" and would hamper innovation and weaken competition.  Lauded as engines of innovation, the Silicon Valley giants for decades enjoyed minimal regulation and star status in Washington, with a notable coziness during the Obama administration, when Biden was vice president. The industry's fortunes abruptly reversed about two years ago, when the companies came under intense federal scrutiny, a searing congressional investigation, and growing public criticism over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech.  Biden said as a presidential candidate that dismantling the big tech companies should be considered. He also has said he wants to see changes to the social media companies' long-held legal protections for speech on their platforms.  The legislative proposals also would prohibit the tech giants from favoring their own products and services over competitors on their platforms. The legislation was informed by the 15-month Judiciary antitrust investigation, led by Cicilline, that concluded the four tech giants have abused their market power by charging excessive fees, imposing tough contract terms and extracting valuable data from individuals and businesses that rely on them.  The legislation also would make it tougher for the giant tech companies to snap up competitors in mergers, which they have completed by scores in recent years.  Democrats control the House, but they would need to garner significant Republican support in the Senate for legislation to pass. The chamber is split 50-50 with the Democrats' one-vote margin depending on Vice President Kamala Harris being the tiebreaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/house-panel-pushes-legislation-targeting-big-techs-power/articleshow/83795443.cms||---

Of the more than 59,000 vaccination sessions organised on Wednesday, over 96% were in public health facilities. Besides, 60.8 lakh new registrations were recorded on the day. A day after MP recorded a low number, officials said the figure came down as vaccines are not administered on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sunday. Overall, more than 30 crore doses of vaccines have been administered since the rollout of the drive on January 16. While nearly 25 crore people have received at least one dose, over 5 crore people have been vaccinated with two doses. In the new phase of vaccination from June 21, the Centre has been buying 75% of locally produced vaccines and giving it free to everyone above 18 through government centres. The remaining 25% vaccine production has been earmarked for private hospitals, where people will have to pay for jabs. The idea is to speed up vaccination coverage to be able to reduce hospitalisation and avoid deaths from the disease. The government aims to cover the entire adult population by December. While India achieved over 88 lakh inoculation on the first day of implementation of the new policy on June 21, the government aims to administer one crore doses a day soon. Officials have indicated that with adequate vaccine supplies and available capacity, the coverage can be improved from the current level. So far, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, MP, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Odisha, UP and West Bengal have covered over 10 lakh people in the 18-44 age group for the first dose of vaccine.

Under the proposal by King County Councilman Reagan Dunn, King County would acquire the park from the city of Seattle and request that Executive Dow Constantine relocate the park's dozens of residents to transitional or permanent housing, provide additional security, and fix damage to the park, The Seattle Times reports.  The proposal came after the fatal stabbing on June 17 of a 31-year-old man in the park. Seattle police Sgt. Randy Huserik, a spokesperson for the department, said police responded to 100 calls of service at City Hall Park between April 13 and June 20 - including assaults, robberies, warrant arrests and public disturbances.  "The city of Seattle has no one to blame except for themselves for failing to abate the nuisance and keep that area safe," Dunn said. "People have the right to a safe county courthouse and we shouldn't have to fight this hard for it."  The adjacent King County Courthouse belongs to the county and taking over City Hall Park would allow it to be policed by the King County Sheriff's Office instead of the Seattle Police Department, he said.  The little-used state law would require the county to pay the city fair value for the property, Dunn said. He needs five votes, including his own, to move the legislation forward.  "It's going to be a spirited debate," he said.  King County Superior Court Presiding Judge Jim Rogers said the park next to the courthouse "is pretty full of tents and people and (park residents) are increasingly hostile to anyone walking through the park."  This week, three prospective jurors notified court staff that they were refusing to serve, specifically citing the dangers of City Hall Park as the reason, Rogers said.  Anthony Derrick, a spokesperson for Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, said the city has worked closely for several years with the county on improving safety in the park, adding lighting, trimming trees and stepping up police emphasis patrols.  On Monday, the Seattle City Council committed $7.5 million to address homelessness in City Hall Park and Pioneer Square over the next year, matching the $7.5 million the county has dedicated to a homelessness outreach program, Derrick said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/push-to-condemn-seattle-park-with-large-homeless-population/articleshow/83795807.cms||---
---||India||Social media companies to shut fake a/cs within 24 hours of complaint||NEW DELHI: In a major decision that is likely to end the menace of impersonation on social media in India, the government has mandated that top companies such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube have to remove accounts with fake profile pictures of known personalities and businesses, and even the general subscriber, within 24 hours of being notified of the same by the user or someone on his/her behalf. The government has said this mandate comes in as part of the new IT rules and thus social media giants will need to act immediately after receiving a complaint to this effect. "For example, if a known film actor, or a cricketer, or a politician, or any other user, objects to another person using his or her image/picture to gain followers or to make their messaging more visible, or to carry out any illegal act, then they are within their right to ask the companies to take down the account. Provisions to this effect have been included in the new IT Rules for social media companies, and they have to take remedial action within a day after being notified by a user," official sources told TOI. Impersonators are a major sore point for popular personalities, influencers, activists and even corporates/businesses as they mimic a legitimate account for various reasons. These may range from pure-play parody accounts, to those created for doing mischief or a crime, or to carry out a financial fraud. Some such accounts are also created by fans of popular personalities, and some are also run through bots. Apart from using an image of a popular personality as their profile picture, some fake account holders may also add their own image to a celebrity/politician’s picture by morphing the original content in order to claim proximity, and get favours. All such accounts, while being fake, use a real picture or morphed images, and even carry content that is generally similar to the personality that they are targeting, a source said. The IT ministry’s diktat comes under the grievance redressal mechanism that has been prescribed for social media platforms, and makes it contingent on the firms to remove any content around nudity, obscenity, and sexual act or conduct within 24 hours after receiving a complaint. The issue of fake accounts is a menace the world over and is believed to have caused losses to the tune of billions of dollars over the years, apart from leading to crimes of various types. While it is a messy affair for personalities who often find themselves targeted through fake news, it is an even bigger nuisance for corporates and businesses who become a victim of impersonation. Often such fake accounts of corporates are used for phishing attacks, selling counterfeit products, and even scams. While many platforms like Twitter, Instagram and YouTube verify accounts of known personalities, the fakes are also present in abundance, behaving almost as close to the real accounts as possible for most of the time. And with the wide footprint of social media companies across the length and breadth of the country, there are numerous instances where people fall prey to the fake accounts, primarily believing the pictures used on profile. The knowledge around a verified account is also limited, and many users are not aware that a blue tick, like on Twitter, signifies a confirmed account. The new IT rules make a mention of giving users option to verify their accounts, but this been kept as a voluntary exercise. This mandate is for platforms which are seen as “significant social media intermediaries”, or those with over 50 lakh user.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/social-media-companies-to-shut-fake-a/cs-within-24-hours-of-complaint/articleshow/83795819.cms||Pankaj Doval

---||India||Less than 1 in 5 fatalities in India certified for cause of death in 2019||Less than one in five deaths in India in 2019 was certified for cause of death. In Bihar, it is less than one in forty, in Jharkhand and Nagaland about one in thirty and in UP, one in every 25, an analysis of two recent report from the Census office revealed. The 2019 annual report of the Civil Registration System estimates that there were just over 83 lakh deaths in India that year. Of these, a little over 76.4 lakh were registered. A report on medical certification of cause of death released on Wednesday shows that less than 1.6 lakh deaths were certified for cause. That's just 18.9% of the total. The data is particularly significant at a time when there is a raging debate on whether India's official count of Covid deaths represents the true picture. In no large state were even half of all deaths certified for cause. Among the larger states, TN and Maharashtra were the best with about 44% and 38% of all deaths being certified. It is also worrying because it shows that the level of medical certification has gone down not up, though only slightly, over the last three years. It has fallen from 22% of all registered deaths in 2017 to 21.1% in 2018 and further to 20.7% in 2019. Thankfully, the level of registration has risen over the same period quite sharply from 78.3% in 2017 to 92% in 2019. As a result, the proportion of estimated deaths that are medically certified has risen, not dropped. The worst off states in terms of the proportion of estimated deaths being medically certified are those that have both low levels of registration as well as low levels of certification of those that are registered. Take Bihar, for instance. The state had nearly 7 lakh estimated deaths in 2019. Of these, only 3.6 lakh or a little over half were registered. And of those only 18,233 or 5% were certified for cause. The double whammy of low registration and low certification of registered deaths meant that a mere 2.6% of all deaths were actually certified for cause. Jharkhand, Nagaland and UP all had a similar pattern (see graphic), with low registration levels and low certification levels combining to mean the cause is medically certified for only a tiny fraction of the estimated deaths in the state. There are also states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, which had 100% registration, but low levels of certification of cause. The top of the charts is occupied by smaller states or UTs like Goa and Delhi, most of which have 100% registration and high levels of certification too. Goa was the lone state with 100% registration and certification of deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/less-than-1-in-5-fatalities-in-india-certified-for-cause-of-death-in-2019/articleshow/83796052.cms||---
---||India||TOI is India’s most trusted news brand: Reuters survey||The Times of India, isn't just the world's largest English language newspaper across all formats, it is also the most trusted among major news media brands in India, according to a 46-country survey conducted by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ). The survey, released as part of Digital News Report, an annual publication by the institute, found that had a trust score of 74. While there are no cross-country comparisons, the most trusted brand in the UK, BBC News, had a trust score of 62 and the most trusted paper in that country, Financial Times, scored 56. Similarly, in the US, CBS had the highest trust score of 48 while the Wall Street Journal (46), CNN (45), New York Times (44) and Washington Post (43) scored lower. In general, in India print brands were more prominent at the top of the trust scores chart than other media, with the exception of government media and BBC News. In the West, as evident from the US and UK examples, the pattern was the reverse with television brands dominating. TOI was followed by DD News, All India Radio and BBC News in that order. The lower half of the top 10 was almost entirely made up of newspapers - Indian Express, The Economic Times, Hindustan Times, The Hindu and Business Standard - with CNN being the only non-print brand among them. (NDTV, India Today and 'regional/local newspaper' came lower down). The report showed that trust in news has grown across the world, with 44% of the total sample for all media markets saying they trust most news most of the time. At the same time, the gap between trust in traditional news sources and news from social media or searches has widened, an indication of the growing need for credibility in a world with an information overload. The report showed that in India, those who use social media to access news pay most attention to internet celebrities followed by mainstream news outlets. Smaller or alternative new outlets and politicians are paid relatively less attention. This was true across social media platforms, whether Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/toi-is-indias-most-trusted-news-brand-reuters-survey/articleshow/83796119.cms||---

The blast, which was heard miles away, resulted in visible damage to parked vehicles and nearby houses. Windows and walls of the residence of the LeT founder and banned JuD chief were also badly damaged, local residents said. The injured included cops guarding Saeed's residence, Pakistan Punjab's police chief, Inam Ghani, said, adding but for the police picket, "the car could have gone anywhere". The blast sparked rumours that Saeed, designated a terrorist by the US justice department with a $10 million bounty on his head, was inside his residence at the time, news agencies reported. Soon, authorities restricted access to the building, citing security reasons. Calling it a "targeted bombing", Ghani said the counter-terrorism department had taken over the investigation and would ascertain whether it was a suicide bombing or an IED was detonated. "The majority of terrorist attacks in Pakistan are the work of outside forces, hostile intelligence agencies," Ghani claimed. Last year, Pakistan had sentenced Saeed to 15 years in jail in a terror-financing case, but he was never charged in connection with the Mumbai attacks. Pakistani officials had reportedly told a Pakistani Anti-Terrorism Court in 2012 that the terrorists who attacked and killed over 166 innocent people in Mumbai on November 26, 2008 belonged to the Saeed-led LeT and that they had been trained at various cities in Pakistan. The key planner of the Mumbai carnage, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, was an undertrial at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi but was released due to "lack of evidence" on April 9, 2015 on the orders of the Lahore high court. Meanwhile, all the victims of Wednesday's bombing were shifted to Lahore's Jinnah Hospital, where the management urged people to come forward and donate blood for the wounded. The injured, according to the police, included a few women and children. Hospital officials said several of the injured had been severely burnt and were in critical condition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/blast-outside-hafiz-saeeds-lahore-residence-kills-three/articleshow/83796150.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

A bench of Justices Anup Jairam Bhambhani and Jasmeet Singh noted that a similar application for a stay on the investigation had been heard earlier, following which a notice was issued to the director general of the competition commission. No interim relief was given by the division bench on May 6. The petition is listed for hearing again next month "We also find that there is substantial overlap, in fact near identity, as between the prayers made in... (earlier application) and those made in the present application. For the foregoing reason, we do not consider it appropriate to stay the operation of impugned notice dated June 4, at this stage," the bench said. It pointed out that there was no doubt the notice issued to the companies by the DG was a step towards taking the probe ahead. In their fresh plea, Facebook and WhatsApp had sought a stay on the CCI's notices, asking them to furnish certain information for the inquiry conducted by it. The notices were issued to WhatsApp and Facebook on June 4 and June 8 respectively. Appeals challenging the notice were dismissed by a single judge who refused to stop the investigation ordered by CCI into the instant messaging app's new privacy policy. HC noted that CCI has submitted that though the notice to the digital platforms was issued as per procedure, it would take substantial time to prepare a report after the receipt of the information called-for. "Taking note of statement as above, we would only urge the DG to bear in mind that investigation against the appellant (Facebook and WhatsApp) is under judicial consideration before a division bench of this court; and we direct that the matter be listed before the roster division bench on July 9, the date already fixed," the vacation bench said and issued notice on the fresh applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-hc-refuses-to-stay-cci-notice-to-fb-whatsapp/articleshow/83796188.cms||---

Presiding over the 20th court meeting of the university, Chaudhary pointed out that AKU was set up by chief minister Nitish Kumar in the name of the great mathematician and astronomer, Aryabhatta, with a view to creating an atmosphere of research in Bihar. “AKU is not like other degree awarding universities, but it stands for enhancing the scientific knowledge and technological skill of its scholars,” he said. The minister called upon the faculty members and the students of the university to help in the all-round progress of the state by making innovations and carrying out meaningful research “Bihar was known in the field of education all over the world during the ancient days. Therefore, the present day scholars should work hard to bring back the state’s old glory by attaining excellence in the field of higher education and research,” he claimed. At the outset, AKU registrar P K Verma presented the annual report and gave details of various academic and infrastructural developments made during the period. Established in 2010 and built across an area of 7.6 acres, AKU has nearly 190 affiliated medical, engineering, pharmacy, nursing, education, paramedical and other professional institutions of the state under its jurisdiction. It has 35,000 students on its roll.

According to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), household savings fell to 8.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the quarter ended December 2020, down from 10.4% in the preceding quarter. Savings-to-GDP ratio had spiked to a high of 21% in the first quarter of FY21 as Indians held back from spending during the lockdown. According to the RBI, the trend in deposits exhibits a sequential moderation for the second consecutive quarter driven by weaker flows into household financial assets, which more than offset the moderation in the flow of household financial liabilities. Financial assets as a share of GDP have fallen to 12.7% in the third quarter from 15.8% in the second quarter. The drop was seen across financial instruments. The pandemic has hurt households hard as they struggle to deal with the impact of the pandemic on jobs, income and spending. The ratio of household (bank) deposits to GDP declined to 3% in Q3FY21 from 7.7%. Savings in life insurance and provident & pension funds as a share of GDP fell to 2.9% and 2.2% respectively in the third quarter from 3% and 2.6% in the preceding quarter. Households moved their money from banks and held it in cash, resulting in household currency holdings as a percentage of GDP rising to 1.7% in the third quarter from 0.4% in the second quarter. Also, falling interest rates and the surge in stock valuations resulted in household investment in mutual funds rising from 0.3% of GDP at the end of September 2020 to 1.2% at the end of December. SBI Group’s chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in a note on Tuesday that there was scope for an increase in household investments in equity from present levels. “Increasing retail participation, if it becomes the norm, could also enable a larger resource pool for financing India’s infrastructural requirements. For example, the share of savings in stocks and debentures to total household financial savings at 3.4% in FY20 is likely to increase in FY21 to 4.8-5%,” he said. This is still much lower than 36.5% in the US. At the same time, liabilities of households from commercial banks rose to 27% of GDP, up from 26.3%. Despite higher borrowings from banks and housing finance companies, the flow in household financial liabilities was marginally lower in Q3FY21 following a marked decline in borrowings from non-banking financial companies. The household debt-to-GDP ratio, which is based on select financial instruments, has been increasing steadily since end-March 2019. It rose sharply to 37.9% at the end-December 2020 from 37.1% at end-September 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/household-savings-fell-debt-rose-as-1st-wave-ebbed-in-q3/articleshow/83793229.cms||---

The resolution to pay out around Rs 1,800 crore more to small investors and funds representing them was taken up to comply with the order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The tribunal, while approving the resolution plan submitted by Piramal, was sympathetic to the claims of small investors but could not do much under the law. In terms of the bankruptcy law, those who vote against a resolution proposal are entitled only to the liquidation value. According to legal experts, more than the payout, lenders are worried about opening the doors for other categories of claimants as many other institutional investors are ultimately representing small investors. Fresh litigation could then derail the resolution process, which is already subject to several pending litigations. The resolution, on which the lenders voted this week, would have them pay the Army Insurance Group Fund, Air Force Group Insurance Society and The Navy Children’s School in full as suggested by the NCLT. This will result in an additional Rs 86-crore outgo for the lenders. It also proposes that all fixed deposit (FD) holders get 40% of their admitted claims, which is in line with the recovery for secured creditors, resulting in an additional payout of Rs 965 crore. In terms of the approved resolution plan, FD holders would have got a pittance as they are dissenting creditors and entitled to only their share of liquidation value. In the case of non-convertible debentures (NCDs), lenders have proposed creating four categories based on the size of the investment. The resolution proposes investors of up to Rs 10 lakh as well as retirement funds be paid 40% of their admitted claims even if they do not qualify for it. The additional payout to NCD holders works out to Rs 891 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dhfl-lenders-vote-against-more-small-investor-payout/articleshow/83793086.cms||---

According to locals, several local hoodlums from a particular community have been harassing the people, especially women and girls. They resort to stalking, scaring the women and girls and making it impossible for them to step out of their homes alone. Commissioner of police Asim Kumar Arun has asked DCP (East) Anup Kumar to investigate the matter and submit a report to him after the issue was brought to his notice on Wednesday. The incident came to light after locals in the past few days came across some messages written by the victims on the walls of their house saying that they are migrating from the area and want to sell their home. The victims claimed while talking to reporters that they are selling their homes and migrating out of fear. “Our women and girls are harassed by members of the other community and we are often attacked for resisting it,” they alleged. The CP said that the matter pertained to an eve-teasing incident reported from the area on Saturday in which four persons have been arrested for harassing a woman and sent to jail. “Problems faced by the residents of the locality will be resolved soon. Those found scaring and harassing their neighbours will be booked under the gangster and NSA and sent to jail. We have assured the people of prompt action with regard to their complaint,” he said. and added, “police have been deployed in the area to deal with law and order issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/harassment-of-families-incolonelganj-to-be-probed/articleshow/83789309.cms||---

Most farming activities like ploughing, watering the fields, separating grains and harvesting are done through tractors, water pumps, thresher and harvest machines that operate on diesel. But since the fuel prices have gone up, the cost of farming activities has increased manifold. Diesel prices in Bihar have reached around Rs 96 per litre from Rs 75 per litre during the same period last year. In the last 20 days, diesel prices have increased by over Rs 2.46 per litre. According to farmers and agriculture experts, fuel prices play a vital role in determining the input cost of crops. Dr Abdus Sattar, an agro meteorologist at Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, said during the puddling (process of destruction of soil structure by submerging it under water) operation, tractors are needed to prepare the field for rice cultivation. “Generally, 2 to 3cm standing water is required. Many farmers use tractors for which diesel is required, while few still use traditional bullock ploughs,” he said.  He added, “Once the transplantation of seedling is done, the land needs 30 to 35mm rain per week for good yield. But transplantation should be done by mid-July.” Mahabir Ojha (69), native of Chotka Singhanpura in Buxar said diesel price determines the cost of input by 10-15%. “To plough the agriculture land, we hire tractor by paying Rs 150 per hour, however, last year, it was around Rs 70-80 per hours. We need tractor from July to August and even in June, before sowing. I have 35 acres of land and every year, we produce up to 45-50 quintals of rice. But it is difficult for me to find a buyer for the rice produce,” said Ojha. Ram Briksh Mahto, another farmer from Madhubani, was also worried about the rise in fuel prices. “Cost of production has already increased due to upward trend in fuel prices and it is bound to increase more if fuel prices rise further. The ploughing rates of tractors have increased by 40% from Rs 1,800-1,900 per acre last year to Rs 2,700 per acre this year, due to rise in fuel prices. For cost-cutting, many farmers in the districts did not hire tractors for sowing of seed. They just spread the seeds,” he said. “From increasing fuel prices to labour cost, everything was just adding up in the input cost of the crop,” said Hari Prakash Choudhary, a farmer who hails from Patyeli in Samstipur. “The total cost for cultivation of paddy crop has gone up to Rs 13,000 including use of machineries, fertilisers, seed, and cost of labour. When it comes to selling the crops, we never get the right price. I still have enough stock of wheat as I could not find a buyer. The government has set the MSP of Rs 1,850 per quintal, however, I sold it at Rs 1,200 per quintal. We are only facing loss,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rising-fuel-prices-worry-farmers/articleshow/83789214.cms||Faryal Rumi

Vadodara-based Nisarg Wellness Private Ltd (NWPL) has sued Vision Medical Services LLP (VMS) from Ahmedabad for using a trademark registered by them.  The complainant has also sought Rs 50 lakh towards damages from VMS for using its trademark for over last one year and asked the latter to stop using it in the case filed at a commercial court in Vadodara.  “NWPL was formed in 2016 and has been offering health-care and allied services since its inception. They coined the trade name ‘Dr@Door Step’ and got it registered in the trademark registry in 2017. Since then, NWPL has used this trademark with the logo extensively in all its services,” said Shrikrishna Acharya, advocate for NWPL.  NWPL offers healthcare services in allopathy, dentistry, homeopathy, ayurveda, physiotherapy, dietician and nursing at the patients’ home apart from collecting samples and lab testing too. “The model of offering medical services at doorstep became very popular after the first wave of Covid. In October 2020, NWPL learnt that an Ahmedabad-based firm too is offering the same services under almost the name similar to NWPL’s trademark. VMS blindly copied the business method of NWPL,” Acharya said.  NWPL has also contended that VMS has launched a website www.doctorsatdoorstep.com that is very similar to the its own url ‘www.dratdoorstep.com’. “NWPL had served a legal notice to VMS in November 2020 asking them to cease infringement of trademark but the latter didn’t comply. Using a similar name and business model to offer the services that were very much in demand during the pandemic has affected NWPL’s business,” Acharya said. Advocate Jaydeep Verma, representing VMS, said, “My client, who launched the service in early months of 2020, is clear that such trademark registration cannot be granted to anyone. There cannot be any proprietary over the word ‘doctor’ or any other medical sign including stethoscope or red cross. Doctors and doorstep are generic and descriptive words and are being used by many other proprietors across the country.”  “We have contended that NWPL offers its services in Vadodara while VMS has its base in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. In no way, does my client’s business interfere in the plaintiff’s territory. So, there is no possibility of confusion or deception among people,” Verma added. “Also, the plaintiff’s trademark has a red cross. India is a signatory to the Geneva Convention that protects the red cross emblem from commercial use through section 12 of the Geneva Conventions Act, 1960. The registration of NWPL’s trademark should, therefore, be cancelled,” Verma said. The next hearing date for the case on July 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/firms-offering-home-covid-healing-battle-for-trademark/articleshow/83787065.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Caddies jabbed & courses reopened, golfers flock back to club greens||KOLKATA: Restrictions eased, golfers are teeing off with confidence as most city clubs have vaccinated caddies and support staff. However, club managements have made it clear that only inoculated members can hit the fairways. The city’s courses have reopened since June 16, as the state began relaxing measures. Golf is now among the outdoor activities that can take place, along with football, cricket, tennis and basketball. Last June, golfers had swung back into action after the lockdown was lifted, but they had to carry their own golf bags or pull their own trolleys as no cart or caddy was allowed. “When golf was allowed to resume, we jumped at the chance,” said Samaresh Das, a seasoned player at Ecopark Golf Arena (EPGA). Neel Law, managing partner, EPGA, said, “We are open from 9am to 6pm. The greens are full of happy golfers enjoying the sport they love. Everyone is respecting Covid norms like before.” Some notable changes in the rules for the past year include players staying at least three metres apart when hitting the ball and not removing the flag from the hole. “Thank god that most of us are vaccinated this time. We conducted two inoculation drives in the last two months, covering 650-odd people, including our 147 caddies. Members cannot enter unless they have received at least one dose. We are not having guests over at the moment,” said Anil Mukherji, CEO, Tolly Club. Royal Calcutta Golf Club, the oldest golf club outside the British Isles, too, has vaccinated 90% of its 300-plus caddies and 95% of its support staff and those from outsourced agencies. Col Devrishi Singhal, CEO, RCGC, said, “Most of our 2,500 members got vaccinated on their own. Though it’s not in our circular, but everyone understands that only vaccinated persons are allowed to use the premises.” The club, in a drive on June 6, inoculated 513 people and is planning follow-up camps. “The vaccines and the social distancing norms are encouraging more golfers to return to the putting greens. Last Sunday, 200 of them were here,” RCGC Captain Rohan Ghosh said. But tee-off times are still staggered and clubhouses and shops remain closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/caddies-jabbed-courses-reopened-golfers-flock-back-to-club-greens/articleshow/83790833.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

There is none yet and in the wake of heavy rains we are not ruling it out either. However, you are intelligent enough to distinguish between waterlogging and floods. Kindly refrain from confusing the two (sic),” Jha tweeted in reply to an earlier tweet of Gandhi about the “floods” in Bihar.

There is none yet and in wake… https://t.co/1tM99FVAyy— Sanjay Kumar Jha (@SanjayJhaBihar) 1624446685000Earlier in the day, Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet in Hindi, wrote, “My sympathy with the flood-hit families of Bihar. This disaster is a big tragedy in the time of Covid-19 epidemic. I appeal to the colleagues in the Congress to join relief works. Steps should be taken to provide assistance to public. This is the real ideology of Congress.” Jha also attached a broad-sheet with his tweet, giving detailed information about the flow of waters in different rivers of the state. राहुल जी,आपदा की घड़ी में बिहार सरकार अपने नागरिकों की सुरक्षा और राहत पहुंचाने के लिए हमेशा जमीन पर मुस्तैदी के… https://t.co/GT5yuLDBbm— Sanjay Kumar Jha (@SanjayJhaBihar) 1624438422000In another tweet, the Bihar minister, while tagging Rahul Gandhi, wrote, “The teams of water resources department are monitoring the water level and embankments of different rivers 24x7 to protect people in case of floods.

Performances of the schools in the public examination and the infrastructure facilities seem to be the criteria for choosing the schools. Large queues were seen outside the EVR Nagammaiar Corporation Girls Higher Secondary School from early on Wednesday. “My daughter is entering the Class IX. I am finding it difficult to pay the fee that the private schools are demanding. I think she can do equally well in the corporation school,” said T Thiagarajan, a parent. The headmistress of the school, R Krishnakumari, said that they received many applications and they are ready to admit them if the students came with transfer certificates from private institutions. As many as 545 students have passed out from Class XII in the school this year. They are ready to admit an equal number of students to the new classes, she said. The Elango Corporation Boy’s Higher Secondary School also witnessed a good crowd. The other corporation schools are also seeing a steady flow of students. Madurai Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said that enrollment for Class XI till date is 1,915. Admissions are on for other classes also, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-students-may-switch-to-corpn-schools-this-year/articleshow/83792689.cms||---
---||Business||Cash for green card: More funds not needed, for now||MUMBAI: Behring Regional Center, one of the many regional centres that pool funds from EB-5 investors and sponsor business entities, has successfully challenged the modernisation rule which had significantly increased the required investment limits. However, the impact of this court order could be short term and may not benefit many. With effect from November 21, 2019, the investment requirements under the EB-5 programme (commonly known as ‘cash-for-green card’) were hiked to $1.8 million (as opposed to $1 million earlier). For Targeted Employment Area (TEA) investments in rural areas or areas of high unemployment, the investment required was raised to $900,000 (as opposed to $500,000 earlier). In short, the fallout of the US district court’s decision is that the investment limits revert to the earlier ones. So, a TEA investment would require $500,000 (or about Rs 3.7 crore) and not $900,000 (or around Rs 6.7 crore). In recent years, the EB-5 programme has gained popularity among rich Indians, including H-1B workers who are in decade-long queues for a green card. Under it, if the necessary investments are made and at least 10 permanent local jobs are created, it offers a comparatively quicker path to permanent residence. Via this route, for Indians it takes between seven and 10 years to get an unconditional green card. In the context of the court order, several immigration experts warn that the outcome is likely to be short-lived. As reported by TOI earlier, unless the US government issues a short-term temporary extension of the regional centre programme which expires June end, while it considers a new reauthorisation legislation, new investments via the regional centre route will not be possible. It should be noted that the EB-5 programme offers two routes of investments. One is the direct or standalone route, where the investor sets up his own business. The other is investments via regional centres — the latter programme has a sunset clause of June 30. (Read also: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cash-for-green-card-will-the-popular-eb-5-regional-center-programme-survive/articleshow/80910984.cms) Mitch Wexler, partner at global law firm Fragomen, points out that the judge kept the injunction door open and “we need to see how it plays out”. According to several immigration experts, all eyes are now glued on the steps that the Biden administration will take. “That said, there could be a limited open window, enabling investors to benefit from the ruling,” adds Wexler. However, he cautions that this is possible only if investors have all their documentation ready and actually fund before any development happens. The crux of the challenge in this lawsuit was that the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it introduced this rule, hiking the investment limits. A former ‘acting’ official was not properly serving in his position when he promulgated the final rule in July 2019. Interestingly, following the court hearing, the current DHS secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ratified the final rule. However, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley held this would have no bearing and declared the final rule to be void.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cash-for-green-card-more-funds-not-needed-for-now/articleshow/83793265.cms||Lubna Kably

Gaya special public prosecutor (POCSO Act) Syed Qaiser Sharfuddin on Wednesday said Tanuja’s statement was recorded before the court of judicial magistrate Swati Singh. “She reiterated her allegation that the girl, who was minor at the time of incident, was raped by her husband in his official quarter in Gaya during Dussehra in 2017,” he said, adding the woman has also deposed that she possesses a recording in which the girl could be heard narrating her ordeals. The special PP said Tanuja’s statement under Section 164 CrPC was recorded on directions of the special court (POCSO Act) of ADJ-VII Neeraj Kumar. “The woman will have to produce the recording before the special POSCO court on July 5 when the anticipatory bail petition of the accused DSP will be taken up for hearing again,” he said. Sharfuddin said that on Monday, the court had granted relief to the DSP by ordering no-coercive action against him. He said that besides the recording, the police would also have to present the case diary before the court on July 5. On June 14, CID (weaker section) ADG Anil Kishore Yadav had asked Patna and Gaya SSP to arrest the DSP. However, he could not be arrested. An FIR was lodged against Prasad with Women’s police station in Gaya on CID’s direction on May 27.

Cybercafes, which were much in demand among foreign tourists and pilgrims, suffered major setback. In fact, 23 out of 24 cybercafes operational in the city till March 2020 have been forced to shut down during the pandemic. Gaurav Kumar, who owns the only cybercafe near Gandhi Chowk, said: “It was a good business as the foreign tourists, who visit the heritage city in large numbers, used to visit the cafe for internet facility. But all the international flights have been suspended since March last year. Domestic tourists are also not visiting Bodh Gaya as the Mahabodhi Mahavihara is closed for public due to the pandemic. This has spoiled the cybercafe business,” he said. “While other 23 cafes have been shut down, I am still opening the shop in anticipation for the situation to improve. I am spending Rs8,000 every month on this business, which includes Rs700 for internet connection, Rs6,000 as rent and Rs1200 as electricity bill. But the income is almost nil. Only a few students visit the cafe for filling online applications for admission in any course or for job,” he added. Rajiv Ranjan, a travel and tour operator, said he shut his cafe in 2016 and started tour and travel business because of better prospects. “In my knowledge, several cybercafes have been closed during the pandemic due to sharp decline in tourist footfall,” he said. The October to March period is considered the tourist season in Bodh Gaya, while the period from April to September is lean season. Mahabodhi Mahavihara is the main attraction for the tourists. But due to the lockdown, the Mahavihara was first closed from March 22 to June 9 and then again from July 16 to September 20. The temple opened for public from December 21 to the first week of April this year, but was again closed adhering to the fresh state government’s order after the second wave of the pandemic hit the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cybercafe-business-suffers-major-setback/articleshow/83788272.cms||---

---||Business||SBI to raise Rs 14,000cr by issuing AT-1 bonds||Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) has approved a fundraise of Rs 14,000 crore through the issue of additional tier-1 (AT-1) bonds. The board of the bank on Monday approved a proposal to raise these bonds through instruments denominated in dollars or rupees during the current financial year. According to SBI officials, the bank has decided to hit the market to replenish the capital outflow following the maturity of bonds worth Rs 9,000 crore during the current financial year. AT-1 bonds are debt instruments but are treated as tier-1 equity as they have the capacity to absorb losses of the bank. Although the bank is adequately capitalised with a capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of over 13%, it wants to have a buffer over what is stipulated. Earlier, SBI had forecast a growth rate of 10% for FY22. However, following the second wave, the growth targets have been reset for the first quarter and the bank is now looking at 9%. In addition to raising capital from the market, SBI expects to raise funds through the sale of bad loans worth Rs 20,000 crore to the National Asset Reconstruction Company. The bank also expects to raise a substantial amount through the recovery of bad loans from accounts such as Kingfisher Airlines and DHFL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-to-raise-rs-14000cr-by-issuing-at-1-bonds/articleshow/83793196.cms||---

In his first communication to shareholders, he also promised action to ensure that the bank keeps culture, conscience and customers at the forefront in light of regulatory action on misselling. “We are certainly sorry for what has happened. And have taken this as an opportunity to improve and redouble our efforts to fix this problem for good,” Jagdishan said. He said that the RBI had ordered a third-party audit of the bank’s IT systems. “This audit is now over and the report has been submitted to the regulator. We now await the decision from the RBI,” he said in his letter addressed to shareholders in the bank’s annual report. Jagdishan also acknowledged that the bank had been penalised for the arrangement that it had with a vendor for distributing GPS devices with auto loans. “Subsequently, we have been asked to pay a penalty of Rs 10 crore and have also been instructed to repay the commission that we earned from this process back to customers. We accept this verdict and will comply with the directives,” he said. “In November 2019, a whistleblower alleged that the vendor was incentivising some of the employees in the auto loan team to bundle these products (GPS) with our car loans. We immediately conducted an enquiry and basis the findings have taken necessary actions against the involved employees including termination of their services and also terminated the arrangement with the vendor,” said Jagdishan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-bank-ceo-says-sorry-for-tech-glitches/articleshow/83793140.cms||---

Deb said he had spent hours trying to remove vaccine hesitancy, a claim that was corroborated by some of those who received the jabs—whether it was an actual vaccine or not is yet to be proved—at the Kasba centre on Tuesday. “My sister-in-law had Covid barely a month ago and we had reservations about her getting vaccinated. But Deb spent over two hours, trying to convince her to get vaccinated,” said Mitali Mondal, who received a shot at the camp organised by Deb. Investigators claimed the NGO was a facade Deb was hiding behind after he realized his cheat might be exposed. He reportedly did not even attempt to get the NGO registered. “A fortnight ago, his photograph was sent to the municipal commissioner to check if he really was the joint commissioner in the civic body, as he claimed to be. The commissioner lodged a complaint against him at the New Market police station,” said an officer. Police are probing why he was collecting signed photocopies of Aadhaar cards from vaccine recipients. Deb was a resident of Madurdaha off E M Bypass and his family claimed he was an MSc in genetics. Police said his father had retired as a senior excise officer nine years ago and that Deb wanted to follow in his footsteps. But he had failed to crack the civil services exam. His father claimed he was unaware of his son posing as an IAS officer. “We thought he was still pursuing higher studies,” he said. Neighbours of the Deb family, however, said he had been claiming himself to be an IAS officer since 2017. Over time, he began using a blue beacon on his car and a security guard was always with him, they pointed out. Some said he had a steady stream of visitors at his home, while others said Deb claimed to travel widely. Deb had also told some neighbours that he had received an offer to act in a film in Bangladesh and that his film for children had been accepted at the Cannes film festival. A few months ago, Deb had even alleged that his contacts in the state government would ensure a club in his area received a Rs 2 lakh grant. But when the promised amount was not paid, neighbours started doubting him. The police pointed out that Deb might not have been acting solely on his own. Besides the fake ID cards, cops have recovered some requisition slips that they claimed was sent to Swasthya Bhawan. Cops also seized vials and some packets with a Bagri Market address. “At any given point of time, we noticed six to eight men and women at the fake KMC office located on the second floor of a bank building. We have seen a bus load of people coming there and getting vaccinated,” said Kaushik Saha, another vaccine recipient. Police said the details of the accused were being analyzed, along with his financial transactions. “He must have survived cheating even earlier. We are trying to find out how he received help from other quarters,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-trying-to-unmask-the-man-behind-many-vaccination-camps-in-city-suburbs/articleshow/83790911.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation nod must for off-site units now||KOLKATA: Taking a lesson from the fake vaccination camp fiasco, KMC on Wednesday decided to make it mandatory for organizers of off-site camps to seek prior approval from the civic health department. Vaccinations at such camps are usually held in partnership with a private hospital that supplies and administers the doses. Senior member in the KMC Board of Administrators (BoA) Atin Ghosh said it was unfortunate that the civic body was being kept in the dark about camps being held by clubs, social organizations or private organizations. “It is a matter of regret that so many camps are being held across the city and we know nothing about them. Whatever happened in Kasba is a matter of concern and we don’t know what will happen to the recipients The source of the fake vaccine is still unknown,” Ghosh said. According to an official, the civic body recently stopped supply of vaccines to a section of social welfare organizations which were sourcing the doses from KMC and selling them at a premium to a section of private healthcare groups. Ghosh expressed concern for Jadavpur MP Mimi Chakraborty, who is a family friend. “The camp at Kasba has taught us a lesson. Henceforth, we will ask all our borough health officials to keep tabs on vaccination camps conducted by private organizations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-nod-must-for-off-site-units-now/articleshow/83790683.cms||Saikat Ray

The protesters alleged they were left out of the merit list despite having qualified the test, while the ones who had not qualified the test have made it to the list. Deepankar Gaurav, who was leading the protest, said he had qualified in mathematics, the result of which was announced in March this year, but excluded from the final merit list. “While releasing the results, the education minister had said all the qualified candidates would get job as the number of qualified candidates was less than the required posts of teachers in government schools. Yet, we have been left out of the merit list,” he asked. The STET 2019 was conducted for 15 subjects by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). The results of 12 subjects were declared in March and three more subjects on June 21. As per the BSEB, 24,599 candidates have qualified in 12 subjects, including Paper 1 (classes IX and X) and Paper 2 (classes XI and XII), while 24,598 are on the merit list. Altogether 30,675 are on the merit list in all 15 subjects against 37,447 vacancies. Gaurav said, “As per the BSEB’s claim, just one qualified candidate has not found place on the merit list. The fact, however, is that hundreds of candidates have been left out. We have conducted a small survey of 350 STET-qualified candidates. Of them, 40% are out of the list. We will move Patna high court against the BSEB. Besides, the lifetime validity of STET was also scrapped for 2019 candidates.” Another STET-qualified candidate, Bijendra Kumar, said he had scored 91 out of 150 marks in social science, but was excluded from the merit list while another aspirant, Shrawan Kumar Suman, was on the list despite scoring just 68 marks. “It is nothing but injustice. The BSEB should make cut-off list public,” he added. Similar was the case with Anish Kumar, who had been left out of merit list despite scoring 82 in mathematics. Education department’s additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said the department has drawn the attention of the BSEB chairman regarding the grievances of the candidates. “There are confusions. The matter will be sorted out in two days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/left-out-of-merit-list-hundreds-of-teacher-aspirants-hit-roads-in-patna/articleshow/83787366.cms||Faryal Rumi

Even the supposed KMC office where the drive was held was fake. “I am at a loss for words and am worried about myself as well as all the others, who had taken the so-called vaccine from the Kasba camp on Tuesday. I had a talk with Atin da (Atin Ghosh). He said it would take at least three weeks to know the composition of the liquid administered. I guess we will have to spend sleepless nights till then,” said Chakraborty. The MP said she received an invitation to the vaccination drive for people with disabilities and the economically deprived section, allegedly being held by KMC. She even decided to take the “vaccine” herself. “I guess the fraudsters didn’t think I would also take the vaccine. When I didn’t get the vaccination certificate even after four hours of the jab, I started having doubts and sent my staff to the centre. They found out none of the recipients had been registered. I immediately stopped the drive, lodged a police complaint, shut the place down and got the man arrested. But by then, 150 people had been given the shot,” said Chakraborty, adding she found out the man had held a similar drive in Sonarpur, where local leaders and senior police officers also got their “vaccines”. “I am glad I could flag off the issue. But I am worried about my health as well as that of the others. My doctors has asked me to avoid any medication and wait for the test results to come. While the mild fever seems to be a common after-effect of Covishield but I don’t know if the fever is due to the vaccine or from stress,” sighed Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/will-have-sleepless-nights-till-report-comes-mimi/articleshow/83790938.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The stray pig had fallen into the 30-foot-deep well. The three, who did not own the pig, went into the well one by one, but could not come out as they got trapped in the swamp. The victims were identified as Virendra Manjhi (30), Jitendra Manjhi (22) and Ravindra Manjhi (18). The trio died due to suffocation. Bodh Gaya circle officer Kamal Nayan Kashyap visited the village and took stock of the situation.

Consequently, the hospital has come up with a systematic plan to provide better treatment to them. The medical superintendent of the MCS, Dr L B Singh, told this reporter on Wednesday that on average, 1,000 cancer patients were visiting the hospital every day. “The departments of radiology, chemotherapy and surgery are functioning round the clock to treat patients on time,” Singh said, adding that nearly 300 patients were undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatment at the hospital daily. In view of the serious nature of cancer, the MCS, which has 110 doctors and 600 paramedical staff, is also carrying out 11 surgeries every day amid the pandemic. “Many of our doctors and staff had tested positive for Covid during the second wave. After recovery, they are taking all precautionary measures while treating the patients,” the medical superintendent said. The MCS has also vaccinated a large number of people. Altogether 3,529 beneficiaries have been inoculated at the hospital so far. Of these, 2,489 got their first dose and 1,040 the second dose. Dr Singh said, “If we get a nod from the health department, we will begin vaccinating people in the 18-44 age group soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cancer-hospital-witnesses-sudden-rush-of-patients/articleshow/83788322.cms||Kumod Verma

Patna divisional forest officer (DFO) Ruchi Singh on Wednesday said they need to interrogate the four to know from whom they had managed to smuggle the ivory. A team led by the DFO arrested Dr Jyoti Kumar, his driver Guddu Rai and two mediators – Ravi Ranjan and Bunti Patel – from the premises of a private hospital near Zero Mile in the state capital on Monday. The doctor, who used to work at the private hospital, is also in-charge district president of the BJP in Vaishali. The forest officials also recovered 35kg of elephant ivory kept inside a private ward of the hospital on Jyoti’s confession. Sources said elephant ivory price ranges from 90USD to 600USD per kilogram or even more in the international market. The ivory was brought to Patna from Hajipur by the doctor in his car. All the four were forwarded to judicial custody on Tuesday and the doctor’s car was also seized. It was on the basis of an intelligence input provided by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau that the forest officials laid a trap and arrested the four with ivory. The DFO said a preliminary offence report, which is similar to an FIR, had been filed at the Patna east range office of the forest department in connection with the recovery. “Once the range office submits its detailed report in the case, we will move court seeking the remand of the four for interrogation. We have also seized two cellphones from the possession of the arrested persons,” she said. The DFO added the ivory would be sent to Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for forensic investigation. “The doctor claimed that the ivory was of the elephant owned by him which had died four years back. However, he failed to produce government-issued licence for owning elephants or a postmortem report. Even if he had an elephant, the tusks were required to be submitted to the government as per Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972,” the DFO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/illegal-ivory-trade-bjp-neta-among-4-arrested/articleshow/83787839.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||Bengal: Tollywood film shootings resume, but restrictions stretch schedules||KOLKATA: Wednesday marked the return of shooting in Tollywood according to the state’s notification of allowing not more than 50 people per unit at a time. While Arindam Sil began shooting ‘Mahananda’ in a house on Harish Mukherjee Road, Anshuman Pratyush started filming ‘Nirbhaya’ at Bharat Laxmi studio. Shooting of serials had begun earlier. Sil returned to the floor more than three months after he began shooting for ‘Mahananda’ on March 12. Shooting of this film, inspired by the life and works of author Mahasweta Devi, had continued for three days in a house on Nayan Chand Dutta Street and at Bharat Laxmi studio with Gargee Roychowdhury and Debshankar Haldar. “People are following all health protocols and maintaining social distance,” the director said. What helped was the fact that Sil chose to film a separation sequence. So, intimacy was ruled out and the scene demanded actors to maintain social distancing. Pratyush had shot for only three days in April. A courtroom drama, ‘Nirbhaya’ is intended to start a dialogue on the need to take another look at the laws required to support rape survivors who are minors. “After doing commercial films, this is my foray into realistic cinema where I am following in the footsteps of my uncle — director Anubhav Sinha. We started on April 23 and shot in a village for two days. Then we went to shoot in Rishra for a day before having to stop when Gaurav Chakrabarty’s mother-in-law succumbed to Covid and his father-in-law tested positive. Subsequently, Gaurav, too, tested positive. We couldn’t resume shooting after he recovered because work was stalled then,” he said. Arindam Sil shoots with Debshankar Halder and Gargee Roychowdhury for 'Mahananda' on WednesdayArindam Sil shoots with Debshankar Halder and Gargee Roychowdhury for 'Mahananda' on WednesdayOn Wednesday, Sil could shoot only for five hours since his unit members need to reach home by 9pm. Once edited, this will give only two minutes’ worth of footage. “Due to the restrictions, the amount of work I usually do in a day will take two days. Producers are cooperating with us in this matter,” Sil said. Pratyush gave a call time of 7am and shot for 13 hours with his entire unit comprising Priyanka Sarkar, Gaurav Chakrabarty, Sabyasachi Chakrabarty, Sreelekha Mitra, Shantilal Mukherjee and Hiya Dey on Wednesday. “This will be worth five minutes’ of footage in my film,” the director said. Sil’s unit will shoot in the city bylanes on Thursday before shifting to Bharat Laxmi studio on Friday. After that, the unit will shift to Rampurhat. “Some locations in Bengal were only available from July. So we will return to shoot at the Burdwan Rajbari and the Nonapukur tram depot. Once that is done, we will go to Jhansi,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tolly-film-shootings-resume-but-restrictions-stretch-schedules/articleshow/83790766.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Recovered Covid-19 patients now plagued by pancreatitis||AHMEDABAD: For Gopi Darji (33), recovery from Covid-19 was uneventful. She was home quarantined for 14 days and took basic medicines under guidance of an MD doctor. What happened 15 days later knocked her out-- she developed severe stomach pain that refused to subside. Her general physician suspected gastritis and prescribed basic medicines to lower acidity and gas. Two days later when her condition deteriorated further, sonography was ordered but it failed to reveal the source of Gopi's suffering. Finally, a CT scan showed massive inflammation on the pancreas. In fact, so acute was the attack that 25% of her pancreas tissue had died and got infected. “By the time the patient came to us, she was critically ill. She was put on `nil by mouth' nutrition, an antibiotic regimen and insulin for sugar control. She has recovered well,” says gastroenterologist Dr Manish Bhatnagar. He says he has treated 40-odd cases of pancreatitis in Covid and Covid-19 recovered patients in the past few months. Experts say nearly 30% Covid patients report altered blood sugar levels, which may be indicative of impact on pancreas which house the insulin producing beta-cells. Of these, 30% cases would report pancreatitis which can be mild or acute. “The hallmark symptom of pancreatitis is severe pain in the upper quadrant of the stomach which lasts for more than two days. It cannot and should not be missed. Nearly 90% of pancreatitis in Covid patients are mild but 10% would have acute illness which needs to be addressed urgently,” said gastroenterologist Dr Nilay Mehta. Dr Mehta said that if pancreas tissue gets necrosed, the dead tissue can get infected triggering complications. "In a young woman patient, we recently had endoscopically puncture the stomach to go into the abdomen area and clean it of the dead tissue and fluid. Meanwhile, a month after her discharge, Gopi still has to take oral medicines for her sugar control. “Due to pancreatitis, her blood sugar levels went haywire. Earlier, she was put on insulin but is now settled on pills,” said her husband Hemal Darji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/recovered-covid-19-patients-now-plagued-by-pancreatitis/articleshow/83792013.cms||Radha Sharma
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Call to add seats in colleges due to expected surge in demand||MADURAI: Anticipating a surge in admissions to colleges after Class XII students were given ‘All Pass’ due to the Covid-19 pandemic, activists have urged the state government to be prepared to meet the demand for higher education opportunities. The number of students passing out of Class XII this year is expected to be around 10% more compared to previous years. Considering the increase in the number of students expected to apply for various courses, especially in arts and science college, the government should make all arrangements to provide seats in the courses of their choice. Shifts can be introduced in colleges, where it is not available yet to accommodate more students, an activist said. R Ramamoorthi, an activist from Dindigul district said that the government should consider increasing the seats in both government and aided colleges by 30%. In some courses, the number of seats need to be increased by up to 40% as students are more likely to choose arts and science streams over engineering courses, which are losing sheen over the last few years. There will also be a demand for polytechnic and ITI courses. Government should provide suitable guidelines to colleges and universities to handle the increase in number of applications. Ensuring adequate number of faculties and required infrastructure facilities are crucial, said Ramamoorthi, who provides free coaching to government aspirants. Activists say that courses like computer science, English and B Com have been in high demand for the past few years. There is also a growing demand for science courses and Tamil literature. R Murali, state coordinator of Save Higher Education Movement - Tamil Nadu, said the state government should monitor the fee collected by private colleges for both self-financing and aided courses. “They are already collecting a few times higher than what is fixed by the government. There should be a committee to monitor fee discrepancies and redress the complaints raised by the students and parents,” he said. Similarly, private colleges should also be monitored for the quality of education and required infrastructure as they might increase seats without the required facilities in place, Murali said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/call-to-add-seats-in-colleges-due-to-expected-surge-in-demand/articleshow/83792668.cms||V Devanathan
---||Kolkata||Fake vaccination camp in Kolkata: Medical experts, vaccine recipients wonder what went into their bodies||KOLKATA: The ‘vaccines’ administered at the camp in Kasba on Tuesday could just be saline water since it has not led to any immediate adverse reaction among recipients, doctors said. Had the injected liquid contained any unsterilized substance, it would have triggered an infection leading to fever, puss formation at the injected area or an allergic reaction, they said. However, some said impurities in the injection could have a long-term impact. “It seems that those who conducted the camp did some homework. It’s likely they have used saline water or some innocuous substance. It’s difficult for recipients to know since a genuine vaccine may or may not trigger immediate reactions. But it will be self-limiting, mild and not fatal,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences interventionist Souren Panja. Others, like internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas, warned that impurities in the fake vaccines could have a long-term neurological impact. “It is possible for the recipients to develop pain and swelling in the injected area, cough and fever. These symptoms match the immediate reactions of a real vaccine, so it is confusing and dangerous,” said Biswas. IMA president Shantanu Sen said recipients will be kept under observation. Meanwhile, medicine wholesalers at Bagri Market have denied sale of vaccine from the market after the accused said he procured it from there. They said there has never been any allegation of wholesalers here selling fake or spurious drugs. Some recipients from the Kasba camp told TOI they have not had any adverse reaction so far, but were scared. Sandhya Das (55), a vegetable seller at Kasba Market, took the shot since she was told the camp was vaccinating those without an Aadhaar card. But she said there has been no adverse reaction yet. Grocery shop owner Dibakar Mandal said he has had no reaction so far. Bagri Market and Mehta Building are wholesale hubs of medicines. Both get special exemption during restrictions so that medicine supply to stores is not disrupted. “Even the government and private hospitals are facing difficulty in procuring the vaccines. How can it be available in Bagri Market? No wholesaler in Bagri is selling the vaccine. We don’t know how the market’s name got involved in this,” said Asutosh Singh, president of the shop owners’ association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/medical-experts-vaccine-recipients-wonder-what-went-into-their-bodies/articleshow/83790712.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Patna||‘Get both doses of vaccines before 3rd wave hits Bihar’||PATNA: The severity of the third wave of Covid-19, which is expected to hit the state sooner or later, will depend on the rate of the ongoing vaccination drive. The sooner the people are inoculated with both the dosages, the less severe the impact of the third wave will be, say experts. The ex-president of the state unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr Bimal Kumar Karak, believes that the third wave is likely to hit the state in September or even before that and will be as severe as the second one. “Vaccination can be of some help in reducing the impact only when 70% of the state’s population gets vaccinated within the next couple of months, which seems almost impossible,” Karak said, adding that so far, only a small percentage of people in the state have been vaccinated with both the doses. Joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), Dr A K Ashu, observes that the severity of the third wave will depend on the behaviour of the Delta+ strain of the virus, which has been changed by the government of India from ‘variant of interest’ to ‘variant of concern’. “This variant of the virus is relatively resistant even to the vaccines which are being used for inoculating the people of the country,” Ashu said. He further stated that the pace of ongoing vaccination drive is quite slow as it is difficult to get such a huge population with diverse cultural backgrounds and mindsets inoculated. “Moreover, inoculation of people below 18 years of age is yet to begin,” he added. Paediatrician Dr Arun Shah claims that the vaccines available in the country are still effective against Delta variants though on a lesser scale. He hopes that at the present moment close to 25% of the population shall have the second dose of the vaccine before the onset of the next wave. “A big chunk of the population in our state has already got infected with the virus, ranging from asymptomatic to severe and critical cases. Those who have survived are likely to retain adaptive immunity to counter the infection during the third wave,” he says. Dr Shah asserts that the third wave will not be as deadly as the second wave unless the mutant virus with more transmissibility and virulence escapes the immunity induced by vaccination and natural infection which is least likely to happen. “However, there is an urgent need of active surveillance to determine genome sequencing of at least 3% of positive samples to know about any mutant variant and ensure effective intervention,” he said. Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s health and medicine faculty dean and former superintendent of PMCH Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, the third wave is unlikely to be more severe as expected. He also ridiculed the idea that it would affect mostly children. “Despite the lack of vaccination in children, their seropositivity has been found to be comparable to that of adults. Moreover, children are supposed to be relatively resistant to severe infections due to paucity of ACE 2 receptors and robust innate immunity and their better ability to regenerate alveolar endothelium,” Dr Prasad said. Nalanda Medical College Hospital’s medicine department head Dr Satish Kumar also feels that if the people are not inoculated with both the doses of vaccines and if they do not strictly adhere to Covid protocols, the third wave would certainly affect them severely. “People have become careless and violate the norms after the lockdown is lifted. Frontline workers are always vulnerable if they are not inoculated with both the doses,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/get-both-doses-of-vaccines-before-3rd-wave-hits-bihar/articleshow/83788226.cms||B K Mishra

Nearly 700 people visited the zoo and 4,000 went to city parks from 6am to 12pm. All the visitors underwent thermal screening and used hand-free sanitising machines before entering the zoo and parks. The food courts, restaurants and canteens, however, remained closed. Zoo director, Satyajeet Kumar, told this newspaper that the zoological area was still closed for the visitors. “We are apprehensive about the safety of the inmates after the death of a lion at the Chennai zoo due to Covid-19. Animals were also infected with the virus at the Ranchi and Hyderabad zoos,” he added. Although visitors were allowed only in the botanical areas of the zoo, they were delighted to be back. An elderly couple, Rajesh Singh and Punam Devi, claimed, “We live in a flat that does not have a lot of space. Walking here feels lovely.” Jayant Kumar, a visitor at the Eco Park, said, “Although I have been inoculated, I follow all the Covid safety protocols while stepping out of my house. I carry my own sanitizer and water bottle. I am happy I can walk again in a park.” All the 72 parks in the city, including Eco Park, Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park, Shivaji Park, Shaheed Kishore Kunal Park, Navin Sinha Memorial Park, Punaichak Park and S K Puri Park, were open on Wednesday.

---||Business||Let HFCs rejig terms without recast label, says Parekh||Mumbai: HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh has called for a dispensation that will allow housing finance companies (HFCs) to convert loans to existing borrowers by offering them better terms without the loan being classified as ‘restructured’. Parekh, the pioneer of housing finance in India, also called for reckoning financing for mortgage insurance as part of the home loan and make insurance more accessible. In his letter to shareholders in the company’s annual report, Parekh said that direct selling agents aid the churn in home loans as they get a commission twice for the same borrower’s loans. Parekh said that while this is par for the course in a competitive market, “an endeavour to retain a performing customer, which could entail a change in the rate of interest, is not akin to a loan being restructured”. “It would be of great comfort for all HFCs to have this issue put to rest,” he said. Regulators and investors tend to view restructured loans with caution as they believe this is one of the indications of financial stress. On allowing insurance as an integral part of the home loan, Parekh said that the cover protects both the borrower and the HFC. On the new norms which require HFCs to maintain 50% of assets in housing loans, Parekh said that a minor tweak to exclude surplus liquid balances from total assets to arrive at prescribed limits would go a long way in helping HFCs. In its current form, the norms discourage HFCs from having large liquid balances. Parekh said that in FY21, despite the economy contracting 7.3%, the demand for home loans surpassed expectations. “Going forward, the risks of recurring waves of infections may result in temporary setbacks, but the inherent demand for home loans remains stronger than ever,” said Parekh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/let-hfcs-rejig-terms-without-recast-label-says-parekh/articleshow/83793039.cms||---

He, however, will continue as a consultant to the company till March 31 next year, the flagship of the Tata Group said in a stock exchange filing on Wednesday. Tata Motors did not name a new CEO and said that the leadership team will work closely with chairman N Chandrasekaran to take the company ahead, indicating that the Tata Group flagship will be without a chieftain again. This would be the fourth time that Tata Motors will be without a CEO in the past 27 years and Chandrasekaran, like his predecessors Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata, will have to devote more time to oversee its operations. Simultaneously, Tata Motors has promoted president (commercial vehicles) Girish Wagh, 51, to the executive director position. The proposal of his appointment, to be effective from July 1, will be placed for approval before Tata Motors shareholders at its annual general meeting on July 30, the company said. Butschek’s original five-year tenure with Tata Motors had ended in February this year and his contract was renewed till June 30. In February, he had informed the company of his desire to relocate to Germany at the end of the tenure for personal reasons. But Tata Motors had said at the time that Butschek had accepted the board’s request to continue as the CEO till June 30. “Leading Tata Motors over the last five years was an exciting experience. The business fundamentals are stronger, and we are well positioned to leverage the opportunities in both commercial and passenger vehicles. I look forward to my continued association with the company as a consultant in the coming months,” Butschek said in a statement. It added that the leadership team that has been scripting the turnaround of the company will continue to work closely with Chandrasekaran. Apart from Wagh, the leadership team includes Shailesh Chandra, who heads vehicle passenger (India) and Thierry Bollore, CEO of Jaguar Land Rover. “I would like to continue to focus on the business and take it further as the markets reopen after the lockdowns,” said Chandrasekaran in an internal note to Tata Motors employees, while announcing the board changes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tamo-ceo-butschek-to-step-down-on-june-30/articleshow/83793003.cms||Reeba Zachariah

We need to make the cancer unit functional for people of Pune under the BJMC-Sassoon hospital soon,” Lahane said.Sassoon General Hospital’s (SGH) administrative controller, S Chockalingam, spoke about scaling up the facilities and services a notch higher. “A Rs700-crore master plan has been submitted to the state government for approval. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar has given in-principal approval for construction of resident doctors' hostel and nursing hostel, each needing Rs50crore,” he said.On the immediate challenges, Chockalingam spoke about further enhancing patient care services. “We have to be prepared for the third wave in terms of the manpower needed and readiness of the infrastructure,” he said“We should have at least another 100 beds for paediatric patients, with 20 reserved for ICU. The vacancies of the medical staff are again a big issue that needs to be addressed. In view of the prevailing condition, the vacant positions need to be filled in,” he said. The administrative controller of the medical college said that for the accommodation of patients’ relatives, construction of a new building, on the existing Dharamshala, was on the cards. From plague to Covid-19, the medical college and hospital has stood the test of time. In the old Sassoon dagadi (stone) building, embedded on a wall is its history: “Built in 1867 with a generous donation of over Rs2lakh that Jewish philanthropist David Sassoon made for the poor of Poona.”While the hospital was founded in 1867, the Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Medical School was founded in 1871. After completion of 75 years, the school was expanded to B J Medical College (BJMC) in 1946. It has consistently ranked among the top medical colleges in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjmc-unveils-plans-for-ramping-up-services-on-75th-foundation-day/articleshow/83790442.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A decision to this effect was taken at the meeting convened here on Wednesday in which mayors and deputy mayors of all 12 municipal corporations of the state were present. The gazette notification on curtailing the rights of municipal bodies on recruitment of third and fourth grade employees, which was passed on March 31, was declared a black ordinance by the members of the council. Patna mayor Sita Sahu said under the 74th Amendment of the Constitution, local bodies were to be given complete independence. “However, the state government has been taking all the powers and making changes in several provisions of the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007. Introduction of Bihar Municipal (Amendment) Act, 2021 was a step in this direction,” she said. “The power of recruitment and reinstatement of third and fourth grade employees has been taken away from the municipal corporations. Along with this, the right of disciplinary action on the officials and employees appointed at the level of the municipal corporation has also been taken away as the state government has struck off the Section 36(2) and 37(7) in the Bihar Municipal Act,” said Ashish Kumar Sinha, an empowered committee member of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC). Sinha was among the one who had filed the PIL against the state government at Patna high court on June 21. He said the urban development and housing department would constitute a cadre – ‘Directorate of Municipal Administration’ – of third and fourth grade employees. “The state had earlier taken away the right of appointment of group A and B employees from the civic bodies. If we are not even able to recruit the employees as per our requirement, what’s the use of municipal bodies?” Sinha asked. Sinha added, “Patna mayor and others will also file a criminal writ against those officials of UDHD who had misguided the state government by preparing such a proposal which is against the Constitution.” Mayors and deputy mayors of Muzaffarpur, Begusarai and Gaya municipal bodies were also present at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mayors-cry-foul-as-govt-curtails-their-key-powers/articleshow/83787946.cms||Faryal Rumi

Tejashwi’s statement came a day after Chirag’s concern over BJP’s silence over the high-voltage drama in LJP. Chirag had said on Tuesday that he was expecting BJP’s intervention in ending the crisis in the LJP. He had also reminded BJP of the days when he and his late father Ram Vilas Paswan stood firmly with it after the JD(U) left the NDA. Meanwhile, Tejashwi also accused CM Nitish Kumar of engineering split in the LJP. “Nitish is the mastermind of the split in LJP. He had tried to break the party in 2005 and 2010 as well. In 2010, when LJP neither had any MP or an MLA, my father Lalu Prasad made Ram Vilas Paswanji a Rajya Sabha member on RJD’s quota,” Tejashwi said. Tejashwi also lashed out at Nitish over various issues like inflation, price rise, flood and Covid-19. Asked about the questions being raised by the ruling party leaders about his long absence from Bihar, he said, “I am also a son and everyone is aware that my father is not keeping well.” Tejashwi said the RJD supremo would come to Patna in a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-indirectly-suggests-chirag-to-join-rjd-led-alliance/articleshow/83788178.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Mumbai||Kandivli jabs ‘meant for use in Gujarat’; cops book complainants||MUMBAI: The vaccines administered at a fraudulent camp at Kandivali's Hiranandani Heritage society were meant for use at centres in Gujarat, Daman and Diu. BMC officials said the men arrested for a string of such bogus camps could have diverted the vials to Mumbai. A 23-year-old woman employed on contract at the BMC's Nesco Covid Centre was arrested on Tuesday by the Kandivali police, taking the total number of arrests to six. Meanwhile, in a first, an FIR was registered against office bearers of an institution where a fraudulent camp was conducted-- Borivali's Aditya College-- besides the gang that set up the camp. The BMC had written to the Serum Institute of India (SII) last week, sending batch numbers of vaccines that were administered at the bogus camp. “We have learnt from SII that the vaccines were allotted to centers in Gujarat, Daman and Diu. Transporting vaccines from other states is not allowed," an official said. But Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said they were yet to receive any official response from SII. “We are reaching out to the top SII management to get official information on the source of the vaccines and are expecting details by Thursday," he said. On June 3, a fraudulent camp was conducted at Borivali's Aditya College where 213 people comprising college staff and their families were given shots. On Wednesday, the BMC pressed charges on a senior executive of Aditya College besides the administrator of the trust that runs the college. Also among those booked are three staffers of Shivam Hospital who reportedly gave the shots and three individuals booked for the other bogus camps in Mumbai. "We have named the Aditya College management in the FIR as they did not inform the civic body about the doorstep vaccination camp which is mandatory," said an official. Police said a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which has to be signed with a Private Covid Vaccination Centre (PCVC) that conducts the camp was absent. "As mediators between the service provider and the vaccine beneficiaries, the college management should have given us a copy of the MOU. This is a violation of civic guidelines and a serious lacunae,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, R/Central Ward. Police added that no record was maintained as to which doctors had attended the camp. "All data of beneficiaries was entered only on an Excel sheet. None of the beneficiaries received vaccine certificates nor did anyone report side effects of the jabs," a police official said. The beneficiaries were charged Rs 1260 each when guidelines do not permit private hospitals to charge more than Rs 780 for a Covishield shot. Shivam Hospital denied they had any involvement in the bogus drive. "We are officially a Covid hospital and our staff does not go out for private vaccination drives," said Dr Neeta Pataria of Shivam Hospital. In a press statement released last week, the Aditya College management said they had placed their faith in Rajesh Pandey, then an employee of Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, who had given an assurance that the camp would be conducted under supervision of the hospital and an event management firm would procure all the necessary permissions and complete legal formalities. While Pandey is on the run, the Kandivali police on Tuesday arrested Gudiya Yadav, a contractual employee of Nesco Covid centre for misusing the centre's login and password. Police said Yadav, 23, the first woman to be held in the case, keyed in incorrect details of nine vaccine beneficiaries and thus aided in the generation of fake vaccine certificates. "She was paid Rs 2500 for her role," an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kandivli-jabs-meant-for-use-in-guj-cops-book-complainants/articleshow/83793099.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

All the flats will be in one building so that other residents don’t have any issues. Just like the earlier decision to allow 100 flats in the two buildings at Kalachowki, this decision has also been taken with the consent of the CM,” Awhad said. “The new allotment will be done immediately. We have given alternative flats to Tata Memorial Hospital in less than 24 hours. We will hand over the keys to them immediately. The previously allocated 100 flats will be back in the Mhada pool and will be kept aside for residents of BDD chawls that are undergoing redevelopment,” Awhad said. The keys for the 100 flats were handed over to Tata Memorial Hospital authorities in May by NCP chief Sharad Pawar. The CM stayed the decision following a letter by Shiv Sena MLA Ajay Chaudhary, requesting the decision be stayed since other residents living in the two buildings feared for their health if patients and their relatives moved into the buildings, especially during the pandemic. Chaudhary stated there were 750 families living in the Sukhakarta and Vighnaharta housing societies where the flats were to be handed over. He said instead of allotting flats in buildings where other families were residing, patients and their relatives must be given all the 100 flats in an entire Mhada building in Bhoiwada near the Tata Memorial Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-100-flats-allotted-to-tata-cancer-hosp-in-dadar-building/articleshow/83795971.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

However, 75% of the people have received their second instalment of Rs 2,000 dole. The dole and grocery kits’ distribution started on June 15, and each PDS shop was entrusted with the task of distributing the relief materials for 100 cards per day. The consumers were also issued tokens. However, the relief was stopped from June 19, due to short supply of the grocery items. As people continued to queue up in the shops on their designated date, many of them were turned away saying that they would get relief when the stocks arrive. Only the Rs 2,000 was given to those who came and they were asked to come on another date to receive the free groceries. Civil supplies sources said that the district had a total of 8,97,844 cardholders, of which 6,73,841 had received the Rs 2,000 second instalment as on June 22, but only 5,95,433 (66.3%) had received the grocery kits. Eight of the things for the kits have been received by the civil supplies department, while there is a shortfall in the remaining six products, so the kits would be given whenever the supplies are received, they said. Meanwhile, some women who had checked their grocery kits on Monday, complained about the absence of some items like chilli powder and they were assured that it would be given to her when stocks arrive. Some of the customers are even getting the shopkeepers to give it in writing that they would get the missing items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shortage-hits-free-grocery-kit-distribution/articleshow/83792717.cms||---

Last week, the agri marketing department vaccinated traders at the farmers markets. The traders there had been demanding that they be allowed into the market complex as they were finding it difficult to sell their produce on the roadside. The agriculture department told them that they would have to get vaccinated first. Deputy director of agriculture marketing P Vijayalakshmi said that as many as 654 traders and their helpers in the markets had been vaccinated so far. Traders say they were reluctant at first, but now have a feeling of being safe after taking the jab. Hence, the farmers markets which see a lesser crowd than the fish markets are slowly coming back to normal. ``But then they are also not wearing the masks properly,’’ said Kathiravan of Anna Nagar. With the lifting of fishing ban from June 15, the fish markets including shops outside Karimedu are seeing a surge in crowds, with customers and traders throwing caution to the winds. Almost all traders in the market were seen wearing masks below their nose, while some were without them. V P Manikandan, a social activist, says both corporation and the district administration should continue to monitor fish and meat markets. ``We do not even know if the second wave has ended and delta variants have been identified in Tamil Nadu, hence markets need to be kept under vigil for Covid norms,’’ he said. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan said they planned to vaccinate all priority groups in a phase manner as soon as they received vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/monitor-markets-continuously-while-easing-lockdown-experts/articleshow/83792714.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Two food delivery boys, aide held for snatching chains||PUNE: A bag with the name of a food delivery company printed on it and CCTV cameras’ footage helped the Hadapsar police arrest three persons — two delivery boys and their accomplice — on the charge of robbing two gold chains in Kalepadal and Chandannagar on June 16 and 19. “The delivery boys — Akash Jadhav (23) and Vijay Posa (22) — and their friend Sahil Gaikwad (22), all from Solapur, were arrested on June 21 after footage of around 500 CCTV cameras established their involvement in the two cases,” said deputy commissioner of police (Zone V) Namrata Patil on Wednesday. The trio had snatched a gold chain of a 60-year-old woman in a housing society in Kalepadal on June 16. After three days, a 55-year-old woman in Chandannagar was their target. Patil said, “The footage revealed that the three men had followed the 60-year-old woman from her residence to her daughter’s home, in Kalepadal, but a security guard in the housing society stopped them. Only Jadhav, riding a bike, was allowed to enter for delivering the parcel. While returning, he snatched the chain of the woman, holding a baby with a bag in her hands.” The DCP said, “After the first case was reported with the Hadapsar police, a CCTV camera captured the image of the bag of food a delivery company kept on a bike. We analysed its footage and a police team led by assistant inspector Hanumant Gaikwad identified the route Jadhav and his accomplices took up to Kharadi and Chandannagar. The team worked on certain clues and took Jadhav, Posa and Gaikwad into custody.” She said, “The trio’s questioning revealed that Sahil Gaikwad was the main suspect in the cases. In need of money, he had instigated Jadhav and Posa to snatch chains of women. The suspects, first-time offenders, admitted to snatching another gold chain of a woman in Chandannagar. We have recovered two gold chains and a bike, collectively valued at Rs1.97 lakh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-food-delivery-boys-aide-held-for-snatching-chains/articleshow/83790476.cms||Asseem Shaikh

As the second wave subsided, people have begun stepping out and heading to vaccination centres to get on-spot vaccination at the earliest. Chirag Goud, a 35-year-old business associate from a public-sector bank, said, “I went for my second dose of Covishield vaccine. I contracted Covid-19 in November last year and I do realize the importance of vaccination. I guess I will feel more safer to go to work being fully vaccinated.” Similarly, Radhinkumar Shah, 56, a military contractor said, “I have taken one dose and I have come with my mother for vaccination today. If my family and I take the vaccine, chances of getting Covid-19 again are low. Even if we contract the virus somehow, it won’t be as severe. With the third wave looming, it is best to get vaccinated.” Shah had to stay separate from his family for two weeks due to the infection. After witnessing the effects first-hand, he doesn’t want to endanger his family and thus, brought his mother along for vaccination. A lot of people who suffered from Covid-19 during the second wave were keen on getting vaccinated. Moreover, with no requirement to book slots beforehand, there were really no excuses left. Mansi Rathaur, a 20-year-old college student said, “Everyone in my family got infected in April. I was determined to get vaccinated at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/walk-ins-increase-vaccine-uptake-in-city/articleshow/83790524.cms||---

The collector explained to them that mortgaging ration cards or receiving supplies meant for someone else is an offence. He asked the people to reach out to him for any basic requirements. The tribal people requested the collector to build houses for those who have no houses in the colony. They also urged him to provide them with jobs and agricultural land to eke out a living. Paliyars, who used to stay in forest, depend on forest produce for their livelihood. Now, they are working as security guards at farms in Madurai and Theni districts. The district authorities administered 1st dose of Covid-19 vaccine to the tribal people on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, a team led by civil supplies superintendent of police M Baskaran visited the village and conducted an inquiry into the alleged mortgaging of ration cards. Sources from the civil supplies CID said that the officials asked the people to come out and raise complaints if someone else is holding their ration cards, but no one came forward.

---||Pune||Lab-made cornea restores woman’s damaged vision||PUNE: An infection robbed 66-year-old Anupama (name changed on request) of her vision in her left eye 15 years ago and in 2017, she underwent surgery to remove a mature cataract in her right eye. But she developed severe eye swelling or inflammation post-surgery due to poorly functional eye cells (corneal endothelium) that take care of the eye's hydration and nutritional needs. Besides, the delay in seeking medical attention in time because of the pandemic-induced lockdown rendered her condition hopeless.  Anupama began losing her vision in the right eye which repeated attempts to restore with a human corneal transplant failed. Hope came in the form of the lab-made cornea. In April 2021, eye surgeons at the Pune-based National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO) performed an artificial corneal transplant called keratoprosthesis, a rare and complex operation. Post-surgery, Anupama can see enough to carry on with her life on her own. Artificial corneal transplant is used for patients who have had unsuccessful human corneal transplants or in whom such transplants are doomed to fail. The operation is rare and requires expertise. The first artificial corneal transplant in India was in 2011, and Pune-based NIO has carried out 11 such transplants in 15 years. “Graft (human cornea transplant) rejection decreases the chance of success for repeated surgery. The only alternative for patients is a procedure in which the damaged cornea is replaced with an artificial cornea, known also as a keratoprosthesis,” eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar said. He is the medical director of NIO, a dedicated tertiary care eye hospital. The hospital’s corneal transplant specialist Yogesh Chougule performed Anupama’s surgery on April 16. Functional recovery after keratoprosthesis is gradual. Over the last eight months, the near-blind woman, who only had light perception, now has a 20/80 vision as against the normal 20/20 vision. It means she can see up to six metres comfortably. It is a remarkable improvement,”Chougule said. Continued advances in the India-made design (keratoprosthesis) and superior postoperative care have resulted in improved outcomes, he added. Anupama's is grateful to the doctors. “Prior to this surgery, I led a dependent life for a few months. I could start seeing immediately from the next day after the surgery. Now, I have started my daily work,” she said.  The medical experts said the costs are not prohibitive. An Indian lab-made cornea costs about Rs 15,000 while the US-made one would cost Rs 45,000.The surgery for the transplant would take Rs 25,000, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lab-made-cornea-restores-womans-damaged-vision/articleshow/83790523.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Shaikh has to spend Rs 10,000 for repairs on a customer’s bike he was riding. He and his friend plunged into the crater which suddenly opened up beneath them on Tuesday. “At about 4pm that day, I needed to get two-wheeler parts for a customer,” Shaikh said. “Since no other vehicle was available, I took the customer’s bike. Near the bridge, my friend Tausif Panarwala and I fell into a hole after the road caved in.” Shaikh said he then sent an SOS to his friend, Yash Goplani, an auto parts trader in the area. “Meanwhile, people gathered and made efforts to pull us out of the cave-in,” Shaikh said. “One Good Samaritan who tried to rescue us fell down into the pit too.” Shaikh said people tried using a rope, but that did not work. “So my friend and I lifted the person who had fallen in while trying to pull us out,” Shaikh said. “After he was safe, we were extricated.” Shaikh said the road is patchy and continues to be a great hazard for commuters. He said he was lucky to escape with minor injuries while his friend has wounds on his leg. “I am really worried about the bike of the customer as it is badly damaged,” Shaikh said. “I am not sure if the customer will be satisfied even after the repairs.” Shaikh’s other friend, Goplani, who reached the spot called the fire department. “I rushed to the accident site only to find the two in the pit,” Goplani said. “Shaikh was coming to my shop.

On January 20 last year, Sonia Gandhi constituted manifesto implementation committees for five Congress-ruled states. The five-member committee for Punjab was chaired by Congress leader P Chidambram. Other members of included CM Capt Amatrinder Singh, Haryana Congress chief Selja, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and then Punjab affairs in-charge Asha Kumari. On January 21, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) and the party’s district congress committees were dissolved by Sonia Gandhi, though Punjab Congress president was retained. Then an 11-member PPCC coordination committee was formed with Asha Kumari at the helm. Others in this committee included Amarinder, Jakhar, AICC general secretary Ambika Soni, four Punjab ministers S S Sarkaria, Sunder Sham Arora, Vijay Inder Singla and Charanjit Singh Channi, MLAs Kuljit Singh Nagra and Gurkirat Kotli, and PPCC general secretary Capt Sandeep Sandhu. The coordination committee was supposed to look after the affairs of Punjab Congress and to ensure better coordination between party cadres, MLAs and state government. Sources said being AICC state party affairs in-charge, Asha Kumari was responsible to convene both the committees. After she was replaced, this task was responsibility of new in-charge Harish Rawat. These committees were formed as discontentment brewing at the ground level come out in the open in December 2019, when Jakhar started the exercise of getting feedback from ground-level workers. The common refrain at the first meeting held in Jalandhar was: “Our government is failing on every front and can face the same ignominy which Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) faced.” Jakhar stopped the exercise, Sources in the Congress said had these two committees worked, both implementation of manifesto and coordination in state Congress and state government would have been better and all, including MLAs, could have got their issues addressed on internal party forums. Contacted, Jakhar admitted to no meeting of either committee being held. He said AICC in-charge of Punjab party affairs was supposed to convene meetings of both committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/congs-punjab-coordination-and-manifesto-panels-have-never-met/articleshow/83794837.cms||IP Singh

S Balamurugan, a resident, said that many petitions and demonstrations regarding this problem have never been addressed. “As this ward comes under the earlier 72 wards of the corporation, water is supplied through pipelines once in two days in this area. But, as much as we look forward to the potable water, we now fear the overflowing sewage,” he said. The reason behind the problem has been identified as a leakage in drinking water pipeline in some places. The water spills into the underground drainage (UGD) system, which then overflows onto the road. The sewage and drinking water are mixing in some place, residents said. “When we complain, the corporation tankers come and clean up the UGD manholes. But, the it overflows the very next day,” said Rani, a resident. Shanmugavalli and Panchavarnam, residents in the ward, said that they had got used to it, but now they are scared that it might spread diseases. “We are scared that the children may fall sick due to this dirty water,” they said. Corporation officials said that they have identified 15 manholes along the line up to the Sivaganga road, which had not been opened for over 10 years, and they were choked with sand. The work has to be done in the night and it will be done in the next two weeks, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/in-this-madurai-street-sewage-water-always-overflows/articleshow/83792747.cms||---

Since the OGH main building was in a dilapidated condition and the wards had to be shifted to the Quli Qutub Shah building, the number of operational beds at the hospital dropped to 500 from its full capacity of 2,000 beds. As a result, Telangana had less facilities during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic when even government hospitals were running to full capacity and were turning away patients. “Had the new building been constructed and the OGH had 2,000 operational beds, a lot of distress for patients would have been cut down. The government should expedite the construction of the new building at the earliest,” read an official statement from the IMA. If there is provision to retain the central heritage part, it may be converted into a public health museum, read the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ima-expedite-new-building-at-osmania/articleshow/83792752.cms||---

These will be in addition to the two already adopted villages by the open university. UPRTOU Vice-Chancellor, Prof Seema Singh said, “The university had earlier adopted Chak Kriparam village in Chaka development block in trans-Yamuna area, and Bari village in Soraon development block in trans-Ganga area of the district. The university has been carrying out different educational and developmental initiatives in these two villages from time to time.” “Now, we have decided to adopt five more villages including Matadeen Ka Purva in Phaphamau, Gohri, Lehra and Jaitvardeeh villages in Soraon development block, and Chandi village in Naini,” added the VC. A team lead by Prof Ruchi Bajpai had visited Jaitvardeeh village on Wednesday and interacted with the village folks. The coordinators of the Women Study Centre of the university and Prof Bajpai met the village’s head ASHA worker and informed about the mandate of the study centre, and how it would help the female populace in the fields education, health and employment. Meanwhile, the VC said that the university has also asked all its 11 regional centres located in Gorakhpur, Bareilly, Lucknow, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Agra, Jhansi, Kanpur, Azamgarh and Agra to also adopt two villages each which are located near them. “The UPRTOU team will work for providing better health facilities, sanitation services and education to the residents of these villages, and also strive to increase the green cover with local support. Our team will also motivate all the villagers aged above 18 years to take the Covid vaccine shots on priority. Women and child health will also be a key focus area for us as part of this initiative,” said Prof Singh. The teams would work for the empowerment of the rural women, sensitise them about women rights, and also help them fight social evils like dowry system and sexual harassment, she said. “We will also undertake a massive year-long plantation drive of Peepal saplings in these two villages, with the help of locals who will be involved in nurturing these plants,” she shared. The Uttar Pradesh government plans to plant 30 crore saplings during the Van Mahotsav (afforestation festival) beginning in the first week of July this year. For this, it has sought support from all, including the universities of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/uprtou-to-adopt-two-more-villages-in-state/articleshow/83789642.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Testing strategy helps Telangana bring down Covid-19 positivity rate by 1%||HYDERABAD: Telangana has the third highest number of people, 47,743, per lakh population to have undergone a Covid-19 test. Ahead of Telangana, only southern states Kerala and Karnataka have logged more people (over 50,000) to have undergone Covid-19 tests per lakh population. However, experts like AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria have been calling for continuous focus on testing even after a significant dip in cases in the second wave. Interestingly, nearly half the population (in each lakh) in the state is yet to undergo a Covid-19 test. After repeatedly changing testing strategies, health department has been conducting, on an average, over one lakh tests per day for the past one month. Director of health Dr Srinivasa Rao said that the state has been conducting an average of 1.17 lakh Covid-19 tests a day. “The positivity rate has come down by one per cent,” he added. Experts say since the state has stopped conducting Covid-19 household surveillance, it was all the more important to continue testing to arrest any unexpected local outbreaks. Telangana Medical Council (TMC) chairman E Ravindra Reddy said increased vigilance was required, looking at the susceptible population for infection. “Mostly, those not vaccinated and those who have no antibodies due to earlier infection should be careful and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Dip in the number of cases does not mean that we ignore symptoms, there should be focus on testing too,” he said. “This way we can prevent any possible next wave,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/testing-strategy-helps-state-bring-down-covid-19-positivity-rate-by-1/articleshow/83792781.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad has already seen 20 cave-ins against annual average of 80||AHMEDABAD: The city has received just 258.6mm of rain this year, after Cyclonic Tauktae hit in mid-May, but the city has already reported no less than 20 complaints of road settlement and cave-ins. According to the AMC monsoon control room, there have been six complaints of road cave-ins and another 14 complaints of road settlement this year. Officials said that on average, there are 80 such complaints every year and some sites have reported repeated cave-ins. The BRTS track near the Blind People’s Association has repeatedly seen major cave-ins and one wason Tuesday, the same area reported the cave-in. “This reflects poor work done by AMC officials on cave-ins,” said a senior AMC office-bearer. The cave-in reported recently near the Jivraj Mehta Bridge was at the same site where a cave-in was reported in 2020. The AMC office-bearer said the work done by contractors has not been not satisfactory. He said that according to the guidelines, all work must come to a halt by June 15 but contractors begin laying pipelines in April or May and do not refill the trenches properly. According to the contract terms, they have to water the area and settle the mud properly. But often contractors leave loosely filled trenches for the monsoon to settle, resulting in vehicles getting stuck. Senior AMC officials said that according to an estimate, 42km of pipelines have been identified as being 40 years old and need to be replaced. He also said that the AMC has decided to install a new sewage line with HDPE (high-density polyethylene) coating to control damage due to corrosive gases and chemicals. A ruling party office-bearer said leaks in old pipelines cause cave-ins. Officials do not have any answer to why cave-in occur frequently at certain places only. The line near BPA on the BRTS track is not 50 years old but reports cave-ins every year. This was because of the faulty works by the AMC. The office-bearer said cave-in are reported near new lines as well and officials have no explanation for these. We have decided to raise the issue in the standing committee soon,” said the office-bearer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-has-already-seen-20-cave-ins-against-annual-average-of-80/articleshow/83790651.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

---||Ahmedabad||Gujaratis paid Rs 247 crore for mask rule breach||AHMEDABAD: Defying law is proving costly to Gujaratis who have already paid Rs 247 crore for not wearing masks during the Covid-19 pandemic and also coughed up Rs 101 crore in fines for venturing out during curfew hours between June 2020 and June 22, 2021. Ultimately, the law offenders paid around Rs 348 crore which means, on an average Covid protocol violators paid nearly Rs 1 crore every day. A senior police officer told TOI, “We have fined 36.8 lakh people for not wearing masks in a year. They paid Rs 247 crore in fines. This means, we have fined around 8,000 to 9,000 people every day.” Besides the mask cases, around 6.8 lakh people were fined for violating curfew norms by venturing out with their vehicles and were cumulatively fined Rs 101 crore under Section 207 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, said the officer. Under this section, a cop can fine a person if he or she cannot produce a pass or permit for roaming during curfew. “On an average, Rs 95 lakh in fines, which is nearly a crore, were collected every day over the year taking both the offences together. This huge fine collection was received even after cops were bit lenient during festival and election season,” said a police officer. Another police officer said that people did not cultivate the habit of wearing masks even after they witnessed two killer waves of the Covid-19 infections. “Like helmets, people usually wear masks when they see cops and remove it or pull it under their chins. They should understand that if they wear a mask, then only they can be saved from the Covid infection,” said a police officer. The officer said that apart from the monetary fines, state police registered 5.13 lakh cases under IPC sections 188 (for defying notification duly promulgated by government officer) and Section 269 (negligent act which may spread infection). These cases under IPC sections 188 and 269 were registered mainly during weddings along with other religious and social gatherings held without obtaining police permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujaratis-paid-rs-247cr-for-mask-rule-breach/articleshow/83790633.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Covaxin trial on children of 2 to 18 years old is under process at seven locations across the country, including AIIMS Delhi, AIIMS Patna and a private hospital in Kanpur. The process has been expedited considering threat of third Covid wave striking early. Kanpur is the only centre in the state where Covaxin trial on children is being done. Last year, before the launch of the vaccination drive, the trials of Covaxin on adults were also done in the Industrial city along with other centres. “Three boys and two girls, of 2 to 6 years age group were administered Covaxin today. We have already done trial of the vaccine on 20 children each in the age category of 6 to 12 and 12 to 18. Now, trials of Covaxin are being done on the third age category of children. So far, Covaxin has been administered to 45 children of the three age categories.

---||Mumbai||Arnab Goswami, BARC ex-CEO caused Rs 431 crore loss to Times Now: Police||MUMBAI: Republic TV's Arnab Goswami, in connivance with Partho Dasgupta, former CEO of Broadcast Audience Research Council, had manipulated television rating points (TRPs) of Times Now channel between June 2017 and March 2018 causing a loss of Rs 431 crore to the organisation, according to the supplementary chargesheet filed by Mumbai Police on Tuesday. The crime branch had registered a case on October 6, 2020 after the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) lodged a complaint that certain television channels were rigging TRPs through illegal means. The BARC had installed 2,000 barometers in households in Mumbai to monitor TRPs in a confidential manner. However, money was paid to households to keep TV sets tuned to certain channels and shows to rig ratings, for which funds were provided by Goswami, the chargesheet said. Earlier, police had said that Times Now was the leading channel in TRP rankings, but within a week after Republic TV was launched in 2017, BARC officials had connived and brought down Times Now to the number 2 position and CNN-18 from number two to third rank. The chargesheet also said that Arnab paid Dasgupta huge sums and the latter bought expensive items including gold and silver jewellery from the funds he received for his involvement in the manipulation, the chargesheet states. The chargesheet said Arnab was a member of various WhatsApp groups used for the company’s work and the chats on some of them reveal discussions on TRP manipulation. The chargesheet also states that Goswami during questioning accepted the nature of the content of the Whatsapp chats with Dasgupta. Police conducted a panchnama of the conversations. “In these chats (between December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2020) Dasgupta shared confidential information of his company (BARC) with Goswami that benefited his company”, the chargesheet states. The Mumbai crime branch named Republic TV's Arnab Goswami, four employees of the channel and two others in the supplementary chargesheet submitted in the 37th Metropolitan Magistrate court on Tuesday. Police have also named COO of ARG Outlier (that runs Republic TV), Priya Mukherjee, chief financial officer Shiva Sundaram, other officials Shivendra Mundherkar and Ranjit Walter and two directors of Maha Movies Amit Dave and Sanjay Verma in the chargesheet. The chargesheet also states that the accused used Dual LCN—getting one channel placed on two frequencies by multi system operators (MSOs) and cable operators—and manipulating channel viewership data received at BARC. Due to this, Republic’s TRP had risen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/arnab-barc-ex-ceo-caused-rs-431cr-loss-to-times-now-in-mumbai-police/articleshow/83795987.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Hyderabad||Redistribution of Krishna water: Centre mulls legal opinion on Telangana plea||HYDERABAD: Even as the Telangana government insisted on reallocation of Krishna water at the earliest and withdrew the case in Supreme Court, the Centre appears to be in no hurry. The Union ministry of jal shakti has reportedly decided to seek legal opinion on Telangana’s plea to refer the issue of redistribution of Krishna water between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh either by constituting a new tribunal or referring to Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II with new terms of reference, before taking a final decision.  Which means the fight between both the states over water and new projects is likely to continue for some more time. For the total 811 tmcft of Krishna water, temporary allocations were made, in which Telangana was allotted 299 tmcft and AP 512 tmcft. The Telangana government says it should get at least 565 tmcft, with the balance going to AP. Both the states have been fighting over their share of Krishna water for the past few years, and complaining over new projects on the river. Presently, a tussle is on over the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme (RLIS). There has been a war of words between the leaders of both states. Sources in jal shakti department told TOI that they had received Telangana’s letter over withdrawal of the case in Supreme Court only on Saturday. “The issue involves multiple problems, as there are four states on Krishna river basin, Telangana, AP, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Telangana wants reallocation between only AP and Telangana. Secondly, Telangana is also opposing water issue to be settled under Section 89 of the AP Reorganization Act as it can only make project-wise allocation and cannot redistribute between the two states,” an official with the jal shakti said. Apart from this, the Centre wants to know through legal advice whether a new tribunal is required or the matter should be referred to the present Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-II under Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act of 1956 with new terms of reference, sources said. Sources confirmed that during the apex council meeting held in October 2020, Union minister of jal shakti Gajendra Singh Shekawat said the Centre would seek a legal opinion on the issue, but had not given any assurance either on a new tribunal or referring the issue to KWDT-II. With both Telangana and AP at loggerheads, and dashing off letters to Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) over the new projects on the river, the department has decided to appoint a permanent chairman for KRMB in a week or 10 days. As of now, the KRMB has in-charge chairman Chandrasekhar Iyer, who is chairman of Godavari River Management Board.  In the absence of the full time chairman, it has not been able to focus on issues like sending a fact finding committee to RLIS on directions of NGT and holding a meeting for allocation of waters for this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/krishna-centre-mulls-legal-opinion-on-t-plea/articleshow/83792862.cms||Koride Mahesh

SP Ghazipur OP Singh said, “After it came to light that land of individuals, government and gram sabha was grabbed by a company owned by Afsha Ansari and her brothers, cases were lodged against them. Apart from booking them under Gangster Act, their illegal possession from those plots had been removed.” “On an order issued by district magistrate Ghazipur under Gangster Act, a team of Ghazipur police reached one of the houses of Mukhtar’s family in Ghazipur city with drums. After announcing confiscation of the car of the trio, the process of seizure of the Audi car of Rs 31 lakhs was completed,” he added. Mukhtar, his family and gang members are on the radar of police especially since May 2020 as action initiated by police and local administration in Mau, Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Varanasi and other districts against them has resulted in losses of above Rs 286 crores so far. “Mukhtar’s economic empire including movable and immovable properties have been confiscated since then while cost of buildings demolished and illegally captured land from which their possessions were removed has gone above Rs 140.55 crores,” said police. Most of the immovable properties garnered by Mukhtar gang by grabbing government land was owned by a company Vikas Construction led by Mukhtar’s wife Afsha Ansari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/audi-car-of-mukhtars-wife-in-laws-seized-in-ghazipur/articleshow/83789516.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: IAF corporal saved from losing job over jab jitters||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has restrained the Indian Air Force (IAF) from taking any action against a corporal posted in Jamnagar after he showed reluctance to get Covid vaccine, saying that he preferred ayurvedic treatment instead. Corporal Yogendra Kumar (28), who is working in Pechora Missile System as group-124 crewman, moved the HC after his department issued a show-cause notice for his termination for putting air warriors at health risk for his refusal to take the Covid-19 jab. Kumar maintained that he had a right to choose the type of medication and the government could not sack him for refusing to vaccinate. While issuing notice to IAF on Kumar’s petition, the bench of Justice A J Desai and Justice A P Thaker sought reply from the IAF and ordered that he should not be forced to vaccinate at least till further hearing, which is scheduled on July 1. In his petition filed through advocate Shree Kotwal, Kumar submitted that in February he showed unwillingness to vaccinate. He was issued a show-cause notice on April 24 by the air commanding officer on why action according to the rules of the Air Force Act should not be taken for his reluctance. In response, Kumar said that the Covid-19 vaccine was not safe and had been given only Emergency Use Authorization. This invited another show-cause notice on May 10, seeking an explanation on why he should not be dismissed from the service for his unwillingness to get vaccinated. The notice accused him of disobeying orders, “Your defiance verges on gross indiscipline and your continuation in the service is likely to adversely impact the health of other air warriors and Air Force civilians…Your continuation in the disciplined force like Indian Air Force is undesirable and you need to be separated from the service…” Seeking quashing of the notice, protection of his job and protection from forced vaccination, Kumar submitted before the HC that he uses ayurvedic medicines or products to increase his immunity against coronavirus, and this has been successful till now. “I am in practice to cure my body with ayurvedic medicines or methods for other diseases also. I adopt allopathy medicines only in emergency or if the solution is not possible in ayurveda,” he submitted and claimed that this method is prescribed by the Ayush ministry. The petitioner submitted that he has hesitations and his inner consciousness does not allow him to get vaccinated instead of using ayurvedic methods. He has contended that the Centre says that taking the vaccine is voluntary and cited the Supreme Court judgment that says a person has a right to choose medication of his choice and vaccination cannot be forced upon him. For not taking Covid vaccine, the corporal said that he fears that vaccine might cause his death and cited the Tamil Nadu Medical Practioners’ Association to point out the adverse effects following immunization.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/iaf-corporal-saved-from-losing-job-over-jab-jitters/articleshow/83790733.cms||---

---||Allahabad||ABAP to take measures to check religious conversions||Prayagraj: After raising the pitch for introduction of a two-child norm in the country, Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) — the apex body of the 13 akharas (religious orders) — has summoned an urgent meeting of all the 13 akharas to decide on the steps to be taken to check religious conversions. The development comes close on the heels of the arrest of two persons on charges of converting over 1,000 persons. ABAP president Narendra Giri said, “Not only external factors, there are fault-lines within us also. We have to find a solution and provide an equal opportunity to all so that such incidents could be stopped.” “Experiences have shown us that those who have been neglected in the mainstream or those who have been treated as outcasts, tend to take refuge in other religions. We will request the Hindus to rise above the considerations of caste and treat everyone with dignity, share mutual respect and avoid circumstances wherein someone changes his or her religion,” Narendra Giri told TOI on Wednesday. He added, “Soon, a meeting of the representatives of all the13 akharas would be held and the only agenda would be to ask out disciples and common Hindus to rise above the caste system and mull over steps for bringing back to the fold those who have changed their religion.” Agreeing to Narendra Giri, chief patron of Juna Akhara — the largest of 13 akharas in terms of membership — Hari Giri said, “We have always advocated welcoming back those who have switched over to other religions. Seers and disciples would be given the task to make the people aware of rising above the narrow considerations of caste system as Juna Akhara and for that matter even ABAP does not believe in it. An example of this belief is that even dalits have been coronated as mahamandaleshwars.” The decision of the ABAP comes close on the heels of its earlier stand advocating introduction of a legal draft for population control. Narendra Giri, in a press statement had said that the seers have always demanded that the ever-increasing population in the country should be controlled. He had said that under the Population Control Act, it should be ensured that couples, irrespective of their religion, should have only two children. He said that if the population growth in the country is not stopped by bringing a law, then there may be a big population explosion in the coming days. Giri has appealed to all that keeping faith and loyalty in the country, every family should have only two children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/abap-to-take-measures-to-check-religious-conversions/articleshow/83789561.cms||---

The Sangam city witnessed the peak of the second Covid wave between April 7-25 and the district recorded the highest number of macro and micro-containment zones, 294 and 9,527 respectively, on May 7. Once, there was a decline in the caseload since May first week, the number of containment zone – macro and micro – also started to decline. Currently, the caseload of Sangam city was below 20 (per day) in the past one week and as a result, the constant decline in the Covid-19 cases has brought a massive decline in the number of micro-containment zones. Data revealed by range police on Wednesday claimed that the number of macro-containment zones in Prayagraj district came down from 294 to 148 between May 19 and 23, and by June 5, the district did not have even a single macro-containment zone. Similarly, the number of micro-containment zones in the Sangam city was on May 23 recorded as 1,891 and is reduced to 314 on June 10. However, it declined from 215 on June 15 to 118 on June 23. Not only in Prayagraj, the graph of micro-containment zone in neighbouring districts like Kaushambi, Pratapgarh and Fatehpur has also declined. As of now, there are only six macro-containment zones in Pratapgarh while three other districts of the Prayagraj range — Prayagraj, Kaushambi and Fatehpur — have no macro-containment zone. Statistics also revealed that only the Pratapgarh district has six active macro-containment zones in the range. Besides, the number of micro-containment zone in Kaushambi (1), Fatehpur ( 17) and Pratapgarh (55) has also seen a fall. Data also revealed that there are as many as 191 micro-containment zones in the Prayagraj range — Prayagraj (118), Kaushambi (1), Fatehpur (17) and Pratapgarh (55). The number of micro-containment zones in the range on June 10 was 450, including 314 in Prayagraj, 20 in Kaushambi, 25 in Fatehpur and 91 in Pratapgarh. Inspector-General of police, Prayagraj range, K P Singh, told TOI that despite the constant decline in the caseload in all four districts of the range, cops have been constantly cautioning citizens to adhere to the Covid protocol strictly to check the spread of the disease. He, however, said that police teams are constantly taking up violators to task, particularly those spotted without masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/191-active-micro-containment-zones-in-prayagraj-range/articleshow/83789607.cms||---

Talking to TOI SP Chandauli Amit Kumar said, As the liquor smugglers use to change their style to dodge police for taking the liquor consignments to Bihar by crossing Naubatpur border of the district, the cops had increased vigil on doubtful vehicles. During the exercise, they caught two SUVs with such stickers on Tuesday and again on Wednesday and recovered huge quantity of liquor, although the smugglers could not be caught in both cases. According to him, Saiyyedraja cops on Wednesday succeeded in nabbing an SUV, on which ‘Uttar Pradesh Sarkar’ (UP government) was depicted in red letters below the number plate. However, before the cops could reach close to this vehicle, its driver managed to escape, leaving the vehicle abandoned. When inspector Saiyyedraja Laxman Parvat checked the SUV 449.28 litre of country liquor packed in 2496 bottles was recovered. Cost of recovered liquor was estimated at Rs 3.75 lakhs. Earlier, on Tuesday night, Alinagar police had caught a vehicle near Singhitali area after its driver and one more person fled the scene after jumping out of vehicle on noticing men in khaki heading towards them. When police checked the SUV containing stickers of government of India and emergency railway services, 1680 bottles of country liquor packed in 35 boxes were recovered. Following seizure of liquor consignments and these vehicles, the cops of Saiyyedraja and Alinagar police station are trying to identify the owners and drivers of both the vehicles. The vehicle caught in Saiyyedraja belonged to Prayagraj district, said police. The menace of liquor smuggling in Chandauli and other bordering districts of Bihar as a blanket ban was imposed on liquor by the Bihar government. In past five years, the gangs involved in pumping liquor in Bihar had kept changing their style of operation. As sending big consignments in trucks was causing them huge loss, the smugglers started using small cars, pick-up vans and SUVs to send small consignments. Police said due to same reasons, extra vigil was being kept even on those small vehicles, which are heading to Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/liquour-smugglers-strategy-to-evade-cops-exposed/articleshow/83789457.cms||---

Top sources in the state police department said that the home department is likely to give a nod to an event where only few registered persons will pull the chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balbhadra and their sister Subhadra as part of their annual excursion in the city, said a senior police officer. “The government cannot allow a full-fledged rath yatra in order to prevent adverse impact on the Covid-19 situation which has just come under control after a severe second wave. After marathon rounds of discussion with the Jagannath temple trust and other stakeholders, deliberations centre on holding a truncated procession this time,” said a senior police officer. The official said that after discussions with the temple trust and home department officials, select few people will be given permission to take part in the rath yatra. “We will ensure social distancing is followed,” said an officer. “We have been thinking of imposing curfew on the 23-km long route, for an hour before and after the yatra,” said the police officer. The state government is inclined to announce holding of rath yatra only when Covid cases dip to single digits. The temple authorities’ decision to organize jal yatra is indicative of holding the rath yatra. The event, which is otherwise attended by hundreds of people, is likely to see low participation this year due to Covid-19. “The jal yatra will be held with the participation of around 50 persons including temple priest Mahant Dilipdas Maharaj,” confirmed Mahendra Jha, one of the trustees of Jagannathji Mandir Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rath-yatra-likely-to-roll-in-curtailed-form/articleshow/83790692.cms||---

He added, “In view of this, a proposal for procurement of 31 DFMDs, 19 female frisking booths, 47 HHMDs and 11 X-ray baggage scanners worth Rs 5.43 crore has been forwarded to the state government last week.” “Advanced DFMDs and female frisking booths will be placed at all the entry points of the KV Dham, while X-ray baggage scanners will be placed at the entry points of the pilgrim facility centres on its campus,” said the commissioner adding that the proposal was forwarded to the government after seeking details from the security department on June 12. “All the procurements will be done through government e-Marketplace,” he added. With the beginning of Ayodhya temple movement in ’90s, the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi complex was declared a highly sensitive site and a standing committee on its security came into existence after 1992. After the city witnessed terror attacks between 2005 and 2010, the sensitivity of this complex increased and security plans were revised to meet the challenges in case of a terror attack. The government is spending crores of rupees annually to pay the salary of the security forces deployed at this site apart from spending millions to arrange technical resources. Three-layered security is in place at this site under the supervision of an additional SP rank officer. The temple and mosque are guarded by the Central paramilitary forces in the red zone (inner cordon) while the civil police have the role of frisking and crowd regulation. “The highly sensitive site already has a huge network of CCTVs, security gadgets, power sliding gates, dedicated units of bomb disposal squad, fire brigade along with a control room inside the complex. sAll the existing equipment of the site will also be utilised along with new gadgets on the expanded campus,” said Agrawal. The KV Dham project commenced with the formation of Yogi Adityanath government. Later, a long-pending demand of a standing committee for demolition of several old and dilapidated buildings obstructing security arrangements as well as posing threat for the security personnel was addressed. Around 396 buildings were purchased and removed to implement the over Rs 700 crore KV Dham project, which is expected to be completed by November end. Regarding advancement of facilities, including security arrangements, police commissioner A Satish Ganesh said, “The current security plan is being maintained as per the guidelines of the standing committee. Any change like assessing requirement of manpower will be taken only after the structures proposed in KV Dham area are completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kv-dham-security-upgrade-with-new-hi-tech-apparatus-in-pipeline/articleshow/83789426.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Later, they submitted a memorandum addressed to the chief minister to district magistrate Jhansi Andra Vamsi. The protestors have announced to host cultural activities like plays, concerts and nukkad nataks in the museum campus on a daily basis as a mark of protest. Talking to TOI, former Union minister Pradeep Jain Aditya said, “ Tourists evaluate the history of a country or city from the articles displayed in its museums. Jhansi has always been on the international tourist map because of the valour of Rani Laxmibai. People come here with a lot of hope to see the things associated with her. Just imagine what they will feel when they find the museum closed”. Terming the government’s decision as a step towards subduing the Bundeli culture, Jain said that he and his team members were even ready to shelve out money from their pockets to pay the salaries of the staff provided the district administration should open the museum. Almost the entire staff of the museum has retired and its deputy director Asha Pandy will also retire by June end, he said. The museum, situated near the historic Jhansi Fort, started on February 29, 1996 when it was inaugurated by then UP Governor Motilal Vohra. Its foundation stone was laid by former Prime Minister late Indira Gandhi on October 16, 1982. “The museum has been fighting for its existence due to shortage of staff as most of its employees have retired with no new recruitments being made. Of the sixteen galleries, ten have been closed while the remaining six were looked after by the lone staffer who has also now retired”, Jain Aditya said. The DM Jhansi told TOI that he was trying his best to get the museum opened at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/delegations-of-artistes-writers-sit-on-dharna-to-protest-closure-of-jhansi-museum/articleshow/83789402.cms||---

The shares, which represent a 15% stake in Kingfisher Beer-maker UB, were bought by existing shareholder Heineken which now has control. For banks, the recovery covers up their principal claims and a substantial part of the total claims of Rs 9,900 crore from Mallya. As the loans to Kingfisher were completely written off, the recovery could boost their profits in the first quarter. The recovery was made possible because the Enforcement Directorate (ED), in a money laundering case, confiscated the shares which were assets of Mallya. These shares were owned through seven companies, some of which were 'paper companies' controlled by the liquor baron, according to enforcement authorities. Banks had earlier recovered Rs 1,357 crore, with assistance from the DRT by selling Mallya's shares in UB and United Spirits Ltd (USL). They are now in the process of selling Rs 800 crore worth shares in United Spirits and aim to conclude the sale before June 25. The block deal was executed through a special arrangement between ED, the SBI-led consortium of 17 banks and Heineken, current owner of UB. The block deal was executed before the opening of the stock exchange to prevent an impact on the share price. Post-confiscation, the ED was recorded as the owner of these shares by the stock exchanges. Recently, with court permission, the ED transferred ownership of these shares to SBI after ensuring that Heineken, in principle, agreed to purchase these shares. In all, the ED has transferred attached assets worth Rs 8,442 crore to public sector banks in investigations pertaining to the triumvirate of fugitive economic offenders-Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The trio had caused a collective loss of Rs 22,586 crore to banks. Using the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ED had attached assets worth a total of Rs 18,170 crore linked to the trio in India and abroad, which is around 80% of the total loss caused to the banks. Mallya, a fugitive economic offender, is in the UK and the government of India is trying to extradite him in the case. He has been denied permission to appeal against the extradition by the UK Supreme Court. Under the law, once the court declares an accused fugitive economic offender, the government agency can confiscate all his properties-even those not associated with the crime-and after court confirmation, it becomes government property that can be auctioned to recover the loss. Mallya took bank loans on his personal guarantee, a corporate guarantee of UB Holdings and an inflated brand guarantee of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. The loan was taken for operating expenses of Kingfisher Airlines but was used for other purposes, including procuring a luxury aircraft for Mallya's personal use and properties. Following defaults in loan repayments, the loan to Kingfisher Airlines was classified as a non-performing asset almost a decade ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lenders-get-back-rs-5824-50cr-from-mallyas-ub-share-sale/articleshow/83796203.cms||---

Mahendra Gandhi, a resident of Jain Society, filed his complaint with the cybercrime police on Tuesday. Among other businesses, he has showrooms for readymade garments. Gandhi said that he had received a WhatsApp message on June 3 from someone who self-identified as Elina from Singapore. As they began chatting, the woman told Gandhi that she was a wine analyst. She said she could help him make whopping profits if he invested in the wine business. Gandhi agreed to her proposal and she sent him a link, telling him to fill up basic details such as bank account and cellphone numbers. Gandhi said in his FIR that his staffer filled up the details on June 7 and after a while the woman told him to invest the money. Gandhi first gave her Rs 1 lakh and she told him that he would get Rs 74,000 as profit. Gandhi ended up depositing Rs 34 lakh in five online transactions. In the end, he got no returns. Later, the woman went incommunicado and Gandhi realized he was duped. Police have registered a complaint of cheating, breach of trust, and criminal conspiracy.

---||Ahmedabad||‘Travel business revenues to reach 40% of pre-pandemic levels’||AHMEDABAD: The tours and travel industry, which was beginning to recover before the second wave of Covid-19 infections began, will now see revenue this fiscal reaching only 35-40% of the pre-pandemic levels, states a report by Crisil Ratings. According to the rating agency, the industry was brought to a standstill in the first quarter of last fiscal – the peak travel season because of summer holidays – which eroded revenue by 95% on year-on-year basis. However, fortunes started to mend gradually thereafter, with improving air traffic and demand for short domestic holidays lifting revenue to 55% of the pre-pandemic level by the fourth quarter. Then the second wave set in. Under its impact, the first quarter of this fiscal is expected to be almost a washout once again, this time due to state-level lockdowns. “With states beginning to ease restrictions and vaccination rates expected to improve, we see domestic travel picking up slowly from the second quarter. However, segments such as international holidays and inbound travel may see recovery only in the second half, and that too only if travel restrictions are eased in foreign countries,” said Manish Gupta, senior director, Crisil Ratings. Stating that the corporate travel is expected to remain under pressure with meetings and events shifting to the online mode, he added, “Therefore, overall revenues this fiscal may reach only a little over a third of the pre-pandemic level.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/travel-biz-revenues-to-reach-40-of-pre-pandemic-levels/articleshow/83790735.cms||---

He added that while he is not sure about MLA Rakesh Pandey, Fateh Jung won’t take up the offer. The Punjab MLA’s son was recently given a job of an inspector in a cabinet meeting. Sources said Fateh Jung had sent a letter to Rawat, saying he does not require a government job for his son Arjun. The move to give the two jobs on ‘compassionate grounds’ had led to a political storm with not just the opposition parties but even a section of Congress leaders, including PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar, questioning the move. The cabinet gave approval to appoint Arjun Pratap Singh Bajwa as inspector (Group B) in Punjab Police and Bhisham Pandey as naib tehsildar (Group-B) in revenue department. Bhisham is son of Rakesh Pandey. Amid the internal turmoil in Punjab Congress over the decision to give jobs to sons of two-party MLAs on ‘compassionate grounds’, Congress Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa has appealed to both the MLAs to give up the offer.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s CET cell opens up registration for MBA, MMS||MUMBAI: The state’s CET cell launched the registration process for the entrance test for MBA/MMS courses on Tuesday evening. The application process for courses such as law, B.Ed and others is likely to follow. Dates are yet to be announced for any of the exams, including MHT-CET, as at least 10 districts in the state are still under level 3 of lockdown-like restrictions. The delay in entrance exams in the state as well as national entrance exams—NEET and JEE —has made students anxious. The National Testing Agency (NTA) is yet to start the registration process for NEET. The registration process for MBA/MMS CET will go on till July 17. The process for MHT-CET, which saw over five lakh registrations last year, is on till mid-July with late fee. A CET cell official said they will be ready with all the pre-test processes and can schedule the exams whenever the Covid situation improves in the state. “Finalising the dates at this point will be challenging as at least 10 districts are yet to fully recover from the second wave. JEE (Main) and NEET dates are yet to be announced and we will have to consider those dates to avoid clashes,” he said. MHT-CET is also taken by students from other states and the situation in those states will also have to be taken into account, he added. A principal of a management college said the test could have been conducted in March itself like every year, while professor Rajesh Srivastava from Sydenham Institute of Management said it is good the admission process is set in motion, but the notification could have come a bit earlier. With the NTA yet to invite applications from students for NEET, Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative said the agency should get the application forms filled so they can conduct the exam without any delay when the situation improves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-states-cet-cell-opens-up-registration-for-mba-mms/articleshow/83793128.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana Maoist leader Haribushan dies of Covid-induced heart attack||HYDERABAD: With reports emerging that CPI (Maoist) Telangana state secretary Yapa Narayana alias Haribushan succumbed to Covid-19 in the last couple of days, Bhadradri-Kothagudem police on Wednesday confirmed his death in an official statement. However, the Maoists did not confirm the development. Bhadradri-Kothagudem superintendent of police Sunil Dutta said Haribushan died of heart attack on Monday. He had Covid-19, the SP added. However, police did not disclose the location of his death. “In the past, police have declared that several key Maoists and many of their cadre were hit by coronavirus. But Maoist central committee general secretary Nambala Kesava Rao, in a statement, denied the police claim. With the latest death, that of Haribushan, following other CPI Maoist party cadre’s deaths, in the recent past, it is now clear that our information was correct,” Sunil said. According to the police, Maoists Kukati Venkanna, Sarada, Sonu, Vinod, Nandu, Iduma, Devay, Mulla Devender Reddy, Damodar and Badrudu were afflicted with Covid-19. The SP said the CPI Maoist leadership should take responsibility for the death of Haribushan and others, who died of Covid-19, since they were allegedly denied treatment and not allowed to move out of forest for a long time. In the past, Haribushan had given a slip to Telangana police on several occasions. He had been one of the most wanted Maoist leaders and was reportedly making attempts to revive the Maoist influence in Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-maoist-top-gun-haribushan-dead/articleshow/83792954.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Permission to drink liquor at home in Gujarat: HC reserves order on pleas||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday reserved its order on the maintainability of petitions challenging certain sections of the state’s prohibition legislation, mainly on the grounds of the right to privacy, and whether it can be interpreted as permission to drink liquor in private places. This came after the state government objected to the challenge to various provisions of the Gujarat Prohibition Act, and asserted that the pleas are not maintainable before the high court because the Supreme Court had in 1951 upheld the validity of the entire act. The advocate general submitted that the HC has no jurisdiction to hear the issue. The government counsel argued that if one wants to improve the law in light of the right to privacy, the right conferred by the apex court in 2017, one has to approach the SC. He submitted that the law cannot be defined and re-interpreted by citing the right to privacy, because its application to other laws is like ‘a bull in a china shop’. For a women’s rights group, AWAG, senior advocate Prakash Jani supported the prohibition policy and claimed that only those who work for the downtrodden can appreciate it. He claimed that Gujarat ranks at the top in per capita income in the country due to the existence of the prohibition policy. On the other hand, the petitioners’ advocates reiterated that the ground of the right to privacy is available to them now, and did not exist in 1951 when the apex court decided on the validity of the law. Hence the government’s argument does not stand that the validity of the law cannot be re-evaluated on this ground.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pleas-opposing-dry-laws-order-on-maintainability-reserved/articleshow/83790783.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||CBI suppressing key evidence related to investments: Jagathi Publications||HYDERABAD: Jagathi Publications, founded by AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, on Wednesday charged the CBI with deliberately suppressing key evidence in respect of investments made in Jagathi. Principal special judge of CBI courts BR Madhusudhan Rai took up the discharge plea filed by Jagathi seeking freedom from the quid pro quo case on the ground that it was not at fault in this case. In its Ramky Pharma chargesheet in the quid pro quo case, the CBI made allegations on the investments made by two infra companies — ERES Projects and TWC Infrastructure — in Jagathi and described them as part of a quid pro quo arrangement between these firms and Jagan. Jagathi was made an accused entity in this chargesheet.  According to the CBI, Ramky got undue benefits from the YSR government in 2008 and it paid bribes which are shown as investments in Jagathi. Appearing for Jagathi, Supreme Court senior counsel Siddharth Agarwal said the CBI was contending that the two infra firms had made Rs 10 crore as an investment in lieu of the benefits Ramky got in Pharma City. “These two firms made the investment at the behest of Ramky was the CBI version,” he said. But when it came across evidence to the contrary, the CBI did not pursue the matter further, the senior counsel alleged. He said that two directors of these infra companies deposed before the CBI that Mangalagiri YSRCP MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy had asked them to invest in Jagathi. “This MLA is the brother of Ramky Pharma promoter and YSRCP MP Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy. Ramakrishna Reddy did this to secure an MLA ticket from YSRCP,” the senior counsel said, citing the depositions of the infra directors. He said had the CBI examined the MLA, true facts about the investments would have come out. But the Ramky chargesheet or its list of witnesses did not reveal any deposition from the MLA, the counsel said.  “We do not know whether CBI has examined him or not, but there is no such material on record,” he said. The case will be heard on Thursday also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-suppressing-key-evidence-related-to-investments-jagathi/articleshow/83793002.cms||---

Unable to identify a consultant to auction the land repossessed from promoters of the SEZ, the Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) had decided to try and auction at least 5 lakh sq m of the industrial land through the e-auction route. In its proposal to the state government, it submitted that the plan could be executed through the e-auction platforms of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) or a public sector bank. The GIDC is paying a steep monthly instalment of close to Rs 4 crore to repay the Rs 200 crore short-term loan taken from the Oriental Bank of Commerce. It took the loan in May 2019 to pay back the SEZ promoters and reacquire 38.4 lakh sq m of land as part of an out-of-court settlement. Last November, GIDC had floated a tender to select a property consultant that could help auction land re-possessed from the SEZ promoters. However, not a single consultancy firm bid for the contract, prompting the corporation to abandon the process. The industries department had asked the GIDC to auction the SEZ land in December 2019, but bureaucratic delays and the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panel-to-monitor-e-auction-of-sez-land-at-verna/articleshow/83793000.cms||---

---||Mumbai||‘CBI needed Maharashtra govt's nod before filing FIR against Anil Deshmukh’||MUMBAI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has gone beyond the April 5 order of the Bombay high court in not seeking the consent of Maharashtra government before registering its first information report (FIR) against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh for alleged offences of corruption, said his counsel on Wednesday. Senior counsel Amit Desai was arguing a quashing petition filed by Deshmukh against the FIR registered by the CBI on April 21, accusing him and unknown others of offence of “illegal gratification” by a public servant under the Prevention of Corruption Act and criminal conspiracy. Desai claimed that it was all about “enmity, hostility, politics and the perception”. He said that sweeping statement was made as how Deshmukh has “undue influence over transfer and postings” when it is yet to be determined. A bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar was hearing Deshmukh’s petition after concluding the hearing in a petition by the state for partly quashing the same FIR. Desai stressed that the HC bench of Chief Justice and Justice Girish Kulkarni, in its April 5 direction to CBI to conduct a preliminary enquiry (PE) into a complaint based on former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s March 20 letter to the CM of Deshmukh’s alleged “corrupt malpractices”, had been careful in directing that the enquiry and any steps that follow be “in accordance with law”. After concluding the PE, the law requires the CBI to first seek state’s consent under section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act under the present federal structure that is followed in India. Desai argued that the HC would have to “be cautious of implication of breach of federal structure”. He referred to various past judgments and stressed on the fact that while the CBI was “duty bound” to follow HC mandate, it could not claim a right to go beyond the same and investigate. He said that Deshmukh believes in his “honesty and has nothing to hide” and had issued a “press note” for his readiness to participate in any inquiry. But once the PE is over, his rights to challenge the FIR, the process of its registration and investigation are intact and are being agitated for the “first time”. The hearing will continue on July 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaicbi-needed-state-nod-before-filing-fir-against-deshmukh/articleshow/83795002.cms||---

Now, a case will be filed against the employer in the court,” said labour secretary Neeraj K Pawan.Moolchand, who was terminated from his job last year, had also written to secretary of Jaigarh Public Charitable Trust Diya Kumari (Rajsamand MP) requesting her to withdraw his termination order. “But, no action was taken in this regard,” he said.“I was the president of Jaigarh employees’ association. They (the management) levelled false charges against me that I used to smoke cigarettes and bidis within the fort premises and sacked me. On May 19, 2020, I was terminated from work. They sacked me for demanding my salary for the month of March. They sacked me despite Centre’s and state government’s order not to terminate anyone during the lockdown.

---||Goa||Lobo rubbishes rumours of floating new political party||Panaji: Reacting to social media rumours that he is likely to float a new political party called Goa First, science and technology minister Michael Lobo said on Wednesday said that he is not part of any such “Goa First or Goa Second” party, but he is with BJP, and that he will make the right move at the right time. Asked if he will contest the next assembly election on a BJP ticket, Lobo said, “Ask me this question in November or December.” He added that in December, he will also predict who will win how many seats. Lobo said that he has been a member of BJP for the past 15 years. He said that when he makes statements against the government, people think he will leave BJP, but stressed that he would continue to “make statements” for the people. “We will work for the people of Goa,” he said. Lobo said that during Covid times, the state government has not been able to perform, but otherwise, it has done “better work”. He also said that “if we do a good job, people will stand with BJP”. Speaking to reporters, Lobo dismissed his so-called new party as rumours. Lobo said that it so happens that he does “development” in other constituencies, some people think he (Lobo) will field his candidates there, but said that’s not the case. “We are elected as members of the Goa legislative assembly, and we have to see that development takes place in other villages,” hthe minister said. He added that he is a minister and thus, he should take up development in other constituencies too, and that there is nothing wrong in that. “Anyone is free to come to my constituency and do good work. Even MLAs can come to my constituency to work,” the Calangute MLA said. The Calangute MLA said that as minister, he has to travel across the state, and over the past couple of months, he has been to Canacona, Bicholim and other constituencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lobo-rubbishes-rumours-of-floating-new-political-party/articleshow/83793037.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mhada to get 4 lakh sq ft built-up area in Goregaon chawl deal||MUMBAI: The state cabinet decided on Wednesday that the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (Mhada) will now be the developer of Siddharth Nagar (Patra Chawl) at Goregaon West, where work has been stuck for close to a decade. The state cabinet also decided, as a one-time special case, that it will allow Mhada to sell the flats at market rates. This is to enable Mhada to recover the cost it will incur in carrying out the redevelopment for the existing tenants. Mhada will have to raise the funds for the redevelopment by making provision for it in its budget. Times ViewDecent, affordable housing continues to be Mumbai’s most pressing problem. Mhada has scarcely been effective. It has taken a long time for the state government to take a decision on the Patra Chawl issue, and residents will have to wait another two years for their homes in the redeveloped buildings — an entire generation spent waiting. The state government and Mhada need to push for redevelopment, especially cluster redevelopment, as soon as possible as Mumbai has little vacant land left for new construction.“The Mhada layout is spread over 47 acres and only a few acres have been used to construct three buildings for the Ekta Housing Society residents and the Mhada lottery winners. The original contractor Guruashish had fraudulently sold pieces of land to other developers. Some of these have been developed. We shall ensure these residents too get their flats, but we shall ensure none of the builders to whom the original builder sold the land gets any benefits,” said housing minister Jitendra Awhad. It is estimated that Mhada will now get around 4 lakh sq feet of built-up area to construct and would be one of the authority’s most profitable ventures. “We shall develop the remaining land as a cluster development,” said Awhad. Shiv Sena MLA Ravindra Waikar, who had filed a complaint demanding an enquiry into the scam, said that the developers and Mhada officials who have been responsible for the scam must be punished and the losses suffered by Mhada should be recovered from them. The approval comes following a report submitted by a committee headed by former chief secretary Johny Joseph recommending that Mhada itself carry out the redevelopment. It has also directed that all the 672 tenants be rehabilitated and also pay rent to them. The 306 lottery winners will also be allotted their homes after completion of the building work. “The tenants will be paid rent for the years that they have not been paid. Around 60% of the building work is to be completed. The flats will be made available to the tenants in the next two years,” said Awhad. As per the committee’s recommendations, Mhada will need to appoint a committee comprising three of its representatives and two experts. This committee will enumerate how much FSI has been utilised by the nine developers, dues owed to Mhada, its construction cost, revenue from the project and ensure that while recovering the dues from the developers, no loss is caused to the housing authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mhada-to-get-4l-sq-ft-built-up-area-in-goregaon-chawl-deal/articleshow/83796022.cms||Clara Lewis

Considering the dynamic clinical nature of the SARS-COV2 virus, vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour consisting of wearing the mask properly, frequent hand washing and maintaining six-feet distance remain the most important interventions to contain the pandemic, he added.“Media has always been a valuable partner in fighting the pandemic.

---||Bhopal||This Friday, learn the art of accepting own mistakes and forgiving those of others||BHOPAL: If you want to learn about the need to apologize or to have a heart to forgive people, wait for Friday evening. Madhya Pradesh happiness department — first such department in the country, started online classes in which teenagers will be taught on the subjects that deal with inner happiness of a person. The online classes are free for all and anyone can join it through the department’s youtube channel or its live facebook page.

Our target audience is students between 12 years and 18 years of age”, said director of Rajya Anand Sansthan, Praveen Gangrade.

The happiness department known as the Rajya Anand Sansthan has a team of master trainers who brief participants on ways to be happy. Officials said it is important that people do not get demoralized in the pandemic. Having a positive state of mind is the first thing required to deal with any crisis. To help people, the department started the yoga and mental health sessions in May. A need to interact with students and young population was felt since the young ones tend to lose patience and confidence soon in the time of uncertainty due to corona. Though the sessions are mainly for teenagers, anyone can attend it through the youtube channel or its live facebook page, officials added. In March the Happiness Department sensitized educational institutes and its faculties on happiness. The department conducted online happiness introductory sessions wherein its experts were briefed on the concept of happiness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/this-friday-learn-the-art-of-accepting-own-mistakes-and-forgiving-those-of-others/articleshow/83790940.cms||---

Based on a report prepared by the district task force committee led by Dr Prashant Nikhade, the collector had submitted before the court on June 15 that two private medical colleges were allegedly not complying with infection control norms. As per the ‘key findings’ of the survey by the committee, surveillance was done at GMCH, IGGMCH and AIIMS Nagpur, but allegedly not at Lata Mangeshkar Hospital and Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre, both in Hingna. Among the 119 hospitals surveyed under Nagpur Municipal Corporation jurisdiction, surveillance norms were followed in 88, the survey had revealed. On June 2, the high court had ordered the task force to expand the scope of all fungal infections and assess the situation in hospitals and submit a report within two weeks. The HC intervention had come after cases of black fungus or mucormycosis began to spiral. Many Covid-recovered patients had lost their eyes or debridement in facial bones because of post-Covid complication. Black fungus is considered hospital-acquired infection, especially where standard operating procedures are not followed. The task force had also recommended 12-point SOPs to meet the infection control norms. As per the fresh affidavit, the district task force had on June 22 submitted the addendum. While Dr Nikhade refused to comment, dean of Datta Meghe Medical College and Shalinitai Meghe Hospital, Dr Dilip Gode, said, “We are aware that fungal infections are dangerous. We had been taking swabs from bedsheets, floor etc and testing them. The hospital has monthly infection control committee and its minutes are also maintained. It was shocking to see name of Shalinitai Hospital among those not following the norms. We approached the collector with facts and the task force admitted to its mistake.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/collector-u-turn-in-hc-after-objection-by-pvt-med-college/articleshow/83790959.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Jaipur||Private sector developing 73 oxygen plants in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Corporates in Rajasthan have committed to set up 73 oxygen plants at government hospitals through donations and CSR funds out of which four have become operational by the end of May. While 27 of them are under various stages of development by the donated funds, the rest are getting implemented under the companies’ CSR activities. During peak of the second wave, local industries had supplied more than 3,000 cylinders of oxygen on daily basis. “During the peak Covid period, we wrote to the CSR wings of corporates for providing support as per CSR guidelines. The local teams were also in touch with industrial associations. We got an over whelming response from the industries as well as social organisations,” said Archana Singh, Commissioner Industries. Transportation of the medical oxygen had emerged as a major challenge following sudden increase in demand. The industries department under the Oxygen Management Group traced and acquired nearly 26,000 industrial oxygen cylinders. Oxygen from local industries helped in reducing the logistics challenges and transportation delays. While Alwar-based Synergy Steel provided 850 to 950 cylinders of oxygen to the hospitals in about seven districts, Hindustan Zinc from its Dariba complex supplied 600 cylinders free of cost. Similarly, Shree Cement from its Pali unit supplied 250 filled oxygen cylinders. SRK Oxygen plant in Chittorgarh was revived for generation 700 cylinders a day. Salasar Gases in Kishangarh, an old and closed LMO plant, was made functional for producing 600 cylinders a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pvt-sector-developing-73-oxygen-plants-in-state/articleshow/83793062.cms||---

Additional superintendent of police (CBI) C B Ramadevan said that they had received information from reliable sources that Lodwal had amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, both movable and immovable, in his name and in the name of his family members. CBI said that considering Lodwal’s income of Rs 96.8 lakh and expenditure of Rs 62 lakh during the check period, he should have had a likely saving of Rs 34 lakh only. However, it was found that Lodwal had amassed assets worth Rs 69.1 lakh in his name and that of members of his family. “Thereby, Lodwal is in possession of disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs 34 lakh which is 36% of his total income and 102% of his likely savings, which he cannot satisfactorily account for.

The 'India international university of legal education and research' may also establish centres in other parts of India, and abroad. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that 20% of the seats would be reserved for Goans, and the university would be run entirely by the BCI. While the expenditure to set up the university will be borne by the BCI, the state government will provide the land free of cost, but that is yet to be finalised, Sawant said. At present, there are two law colleges in Goa, both affiliated to Goa university. The state, so far, has no law university or National Law School (NLS). The government will likely promulgate an ordinance regarding the new university, and later introduce a bill in the assembly. A cabinet note said that the chief justice of India (CJI) or any of his nominees, a sitting SC judge, would be a “visitor” of the university. Sawant also told reporters that an international arbitration centre would be established in the state. He said this would be the second such centre in Asia, the first being in Singapore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabinet-nod-for-setting-up-law-varsity-in-state/articleshow/83793066.cms||---

Its leaders said seats given to BSP to contest were approved by party supremo Mayawati. Talking to TOI on Wednesday, BSP state general secretary Sawinder Singh Chajjalwandi said, “Assembly seats in Punjab were decided by BSP national president Mayawati and we have no objection over contesting on these seats.” He said those talking about supposed discontentment could have their own agenda. “No party leader has objected to the seats which came in share of BSP after the alliance with SAD,” Chajjalwandi said. A party leader and BSP’s probable candidate from Amritsar North assembly constituency, Engineer Gurbax Singh Shergill, said in the 2017 assembly elections in Punjab, the party was in second or third place in eight out of twenty seats which they would be contesting in the 2022 assembly elections. Shergill said in the 2022 battle for ballot, their vote share would improve much better as compared to the 2017 assembly elections. “The vote share will divide among five to six candidates in each constituency and we will emerge much stronger in coalition with Akalis,” he said, adding that their voters who had voted for AAP and other parties in 2017 assembly elections would be voting for BSP-SAD combine, which would automatically improve their performance. Amritsar district president of BSP, Tarsem Singh Bhola, informed that the party would be ready with its booth-level structure by October 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-differences-with-sad-bsp-functionary/articleshow/83795010.cms||Yudhvir Rana

The yellow slip would also serve as a “notice” to the station house officer concerned — under whose jurisdiction a complaint was registered — for speedy disposal (within a week) of the complaint or else he would be summoned with an explanation, said police sources. The receipt — bearing the name and address of the complainant and the accused, phone numbers of the SHO and the circle officer — is given to the complainant and a copy of it is kept at the SSP office for future monitoring and record. “The idea behind introducing the yellow slip is to make police stations redress complaints lodged to them and take appropriate action in a time-bound manner. If no action is taken within a week, the officer concerned will be summoned,” said senior superintendent of police Prabhakar Chaudhary. Scores of complainants — such as shoddy probes, irregularities, corruptions and complainants turned away by local police stations — land at the SSP office every day. “We will soon be introducing the same provision at all police stations as well so that we can cross-check when a complainant claims that no action was taken by the station house officer concerned on his complaint,” added the SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/new-meerut-ssp-introduces-yellow-slip-to-monitor-grievances-redressed-by-station-houses/articleshow/83786180.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nurses go on 2-day strike, services crippled in Nagpur||Nagpur: Demanding filling up of all vacant posts of nurses in government hospitals on regular employment basis, caregivers in all government hospitals under the banner of Maharashtra State Nurses Association have gone on a two-day strike from Thursday. Other demands of the striking nurses include equal work, equal wages, risk and nursing allowances, promotion and leave etc. “If our demands are not fulfilled even after the two-day strike, nurses will go on an indefinite strike from Friday,” the association warned. Yashesvi Bodile, vice-president of Maharashtra State Nurses Association, who has been working with Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) for the last eight years said several posts of nurses are lying vacant and we have been demanding recruitment for the last one year. Even after facing Covid situation, the authorities have not initiated any steps to fill those posts. During the peak of Covid waves, every nurse was burdened with more than 50 patients to look after, said Bodile. “State government nurses should get risk and nursing allowances as is given to central government staff,” she said. Sarita Naik, member of MSNA, said when everyone is talking about the third wave of Covid, the government should seriously consider our demands and immediately recruit nurses on permanent basis and not depend on engaging contractual staff through private agencies.

The actor filed an application to restrain critic, K R Khan and nine others from making defamatory posts or publications, including about his film ‘Radhe’. His counsel Pradeep Gandhy submitted that there's no restriction on commenting on a film or cast's performance, but “personal allegations against Salman Khan are baseless”. The defendant’s counsel Manoj Gadkari “vehemently” argued that Salman Khan should as a public figure be open to criticism and that the critic “had merely expressed his opinion about ‘Radhe movie’…’’ tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-restrains-film-critic-from-defaming-actor/articleshow/83795124.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi's ration scheme rejected, AAP govt scoffs at reasons||NEW DELHI: The row over the Delhi government’s plan for doorstep delivery of ration escalated on Wednesday with the Aam Aadmi Party government saying the Centre has rejected Delhi’s ambitious scheme by posing senseless questions like how the ration will be delivered to beneficiaries living in multi-storey buildings in narrow bylanes. Delhi received a letter from the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution on June 22 stating that the ration scheme can’t be approved because it does not meet the statutory and functional requirements of National Food Security Act. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal called the Centre’s letter painful, asserting that the scheme was in national interest. Targeting the central government on Twitter without naming it, Kejriwal said: “Fighting everyone all the time is not good — Twitter, Mamata Banerjee, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Delhi government, farmers, traders and even the West Bengal chief secretary.” Kejriwal asked how the country will progress amid so much fight and asked the Centre not to fight over Delhi’s ration scheme. TimesViewAt a time when appropriate Covid-19 behaviour is of paramount importance, doorstep delivery seems to be a timely idea to avoid crowding at ration shops. The Centre can well suggest ways to improve the scheme. But a prolonged tussle on a scheme like this certainly doesn't help Delhi's citizenry.Addressing a digital press conference, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia slammed the Centre over the objections raised by it. He said it had earlier suggested dropping the term, ‘Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’, from the scheme which the Delhi government had accepted, but now it has rejected the scheme entirely. “The central government has cited reasons like pricing, verification of addresses, mobility, narrow lanes, multi-storey buildings where the poor live and accommodating change of addresses in the rejection letter,” said Sisodia. Read AlsoDoorstep delivery of ration in Delhi: Food ministry cites operational difficulties, transparency issuesThe food ministry has turned down the Delhi government’s proposal for doorstep delivery of ration allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) flagging shortcomings and concerns over likely operational difficulties, transparency and ensuring uninterrupted supply to poor who either shift“One of the issues raised in the letter is how will delivery of ration be ensured if the vehicle carrying the ration breaks down or gets stuck in traffic. These kinds of excuses are very unbecoming of a Prime Minister in the 21st century. If pizza, clothes and food can be delivered all around, why not ration for the poor?” Sisodia asked, directly questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Taking a swipe at the Centre over the objection that free movement of ration delivery may not be successful in multi-storey buildings, Kejriwal indirectly hit out at Modi. “21st century India has reached the moon and you are stuck on the third floor,” said the CM in a tweet. Conceived in early 2018, the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, a brainchild of Kejriwal, has got stuck because of a prolonged Centre-AAP government tussle on the issue. Recently, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had raised objections. He had observed that the scheme required the Centre’s approval, pointed out that a writ petition on the issue has been filed in the high court and returned the file to the state government for reconsideration. The LG’s observations put the scheme, ready for an immediate rollout, on hold. It triggered another major confrontation between the Centre and the AAP government. In a recent note, the CM rejected the observations of the LG, asserting that the scheme has already attained finality. It will, however, not be rolled out by the food department without the Centre’s nod. “The PM has left aside all his work and resorted to just fighting with the state governments and obstructing their work. Why has PM Modi adopted such a quarrelsome stance? In 75 years, it is perhaps the first time that we have a PM who fights all the time. It seems like the PM wakes up every morning and makes a list of individuals to fight with,” Sisodia stated, urging the PM to open his heart and let the Delhi government deliver ration at the doorstep of consumers. The ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution has raised multiple objections, pointing out that the proposed scheme involves distribution of packed food commodities instead of wheat and rice which are distributed under the NSF Act. It has also underlined that the scheme does not have clarity on how Delhi government will maintain/update the addresses of beneficiaries to ensure uninterrupted home delivery every month even in case of change of address because most poor beneficiaries keep on changing their accommodations. The ministry’s letter also said it was not clear how the Delhi government will ensure coordination with beneficiaries for timely delivery at a fixed date/time because that may get hampered due to traffic congestion and breakdown of delivery vehicles. It added that there was no clarity on whether there will be one or multiple contractors. Observing that there were concerns regarding implementation of the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ plan (ONORC) for food security of migrant beneficiaries, the ministry has also asked how Delhi plans to integrate the home delivery scheme with ONORC to provide ration card portability to the beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ration-blocked-aap-govt-scoffs-at-reasons/articleshow/83790980.cms||AlokKNMishra

The full budget would be passed in this session. The session is likely to be stormy because of various burning issues, as well as because it’s the last full-fledged session ahead of the assembly polls early next year. The opposition is likely to work out all strategies including floor management to corner the state government on issues like law and order, Covid management, resumption of mining activities, the three linear projects at Mollem, double tracking, and coal handling, among others. In May, governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had prorogued the 14th budget session from May 12. In March, the state legislative assembly session was cut short by over two weeks and adjourned till July 19 after the state election commission declared the schedule for the second phase of the municipal elections, bringing into force the model code of conduct. All pending business of the house which was listed for the coming days, including the discussion on the budgetary demands and private members’ bills submitted by the opposition, were earlier decided to be taken up for discussion and consideration in July, after the session resumes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monsoon-session-from-jul-28-grounds-set-for-political-storm/articleshow/83793096.cms||---

Sources said that AICC will discuss the party’s state leadership conundrum in the coming days with Rao, with the high command thinking of a change in the local leadership soon. “The discussion with AICC is an ongoing process. I will be coming to Goa in about a week,” said Rao when asked if a report about Goa’s organisational rejig has been given to the AICC. Rao also said that South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha’s visit to Delhi had no link with the ongoing organisational reshuffle. Sardinha said that he flew to Delhi to attend a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science & Technology, Environment & Forest, of which he is a member. “No meeting with AICC has been scheduled. I had already told the high command what I had to say,” said Sardinha. Rao, who was in Goa for a four-day visit, left the state on Sunday after deliberting with local leaders on how to resolve the vexatious issue of the party leadership. The post of the party president has remained under a cloud ever since Girish Chodankar resigned, for the second time, in December after the BJP thrashed the Congress in the zilla panchayat elections. Rao has held extensive discussions with local leaders, including with former chief minister Luizinho Faleiro, leader of opposition Digambar Kamat, Sardinha and other senior Congressmen aspiring to head the state unit.  Chodankar returned from his visit to Delhi, but remained mum on what transpired in the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rao-to-soon-brief-aicc-about-congs-leadership-issue/articleshow/83793134.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The announcement is significant amid speculations that free distribution of ration among non-PDS beneficiaries is going to be stopped.“Delhi government is firmly committed to provide free ration to both National Food Security beneficiaries and non-PDS needy people, as long as the situation warrants,” food minister Imran Hussain stated.“Delhi government believes that free ration in Covid pandemic is not a privilege but a basic obligation of the government towards its people. We are providing free ration to people of Delhi and will continue to do so. In these testing times of the pandemic, we will make all the efforts so that no one sleeps hungry in Delhi,” said Hussain.Earlier on Wednesday, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of doing politics in the name of ration, claiming that “Delhi government was going to stop free distribution of ration among poor from July 1”.NE Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari and the leader of Opposition in the assembly, Ramvir Bidhuri, asked Kejriwal why his government hadn’t yet implemented the one nation, one ration card scheme that was designed to ensure food security for migrant beneficiaries. In Delhi, 60 lakh people have applied but haven’t got the ration card, alleged Tiwari.Under the free scheme, non-PDS beneficiaries get foodgrain kit made of 4 kg wheat and 1 kg rice per beneficiary free of cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-rejects-speculation-free-ration-to-be-stopped/articleshow/83791025.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Schools in Bhopal suffer 60% fee loss, many on verge of permanent shutdown||BHOPAL: After facing back-toback lockdowns and unending closure of campuses, private schools are in a bad shape. Having lost around 60% fees in the last one year, many schools are on the verge of permanent shutdown. Vice-president of un-aided private schools association, Vinny Raj Modi said, situation has become critical now. “Last year, schools charged only 60% of the fee in the form of tuition fee and out of that 25% was never paid, leading loss of 60% to 65%. How can schools managed to survive,” said Modi. He added, “Some of the major issues concerning us were never raised. We understand that the situation was bad for parents to pay during Covid-induced financial crisis. Due to this, schools also did not insist beyond tuition fee. However, in such a situation, 25% fee went unpaid. Who will have to bear this cost? Obviously, schools have to bear it,” Modi said. He claimed, there was no relief given to them by government either. “We are not given any relaxation in taxes or bills. I know several school owners who are on the verge of closing their institutions. How would they maintain huge number of buses that they have? They are not able to run the campus,” said Modi. School managements have demanded that campuses must be opened at the earliest. “Schools at their individual level are making their campuses 100% safe by vaccinating teaching faculty and other staff. We are ready to support the government in all situations; we will make it mandatory for parents to carry vaccination certificates at the time of admission. Schools did a remarkable job after restarting the classes last year. We will do it this time too,” Modi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/schools-suffer-60-fee-loss-many-on-verge-of-permanent-shutdown/articleshow/83791030.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||JRP leader drags RSS into Janu bribery row||Kozhikode/Thrissur: Amid the ongoing crime branch investigation into the bribery charges against BJP state president K Surendran and Janadhipathya Rashtriya Party (JRP) leader C K Janu, yet another audio tape of a purported conversation between Surendran and JRP leader Praseeda Azhikode emerged in which he is heard telling that BJP state organizational general secretary M Ganeshan was in the know of the alleged money dealing. The new revelations drag RSS into the controversy as Ganeshan was a senior pracharak and the crucial link between RSS and BJP in his role as the general secretary. Surendran is heard saying that he had told Ganeshan to provide the cash (mentioned in the audio clip as 25 allegedly referring to Rs 25 lakh) to meet the needs of the party (JRP). Surendran is heard telling Praseeda that he had made arrangements for handing over the money and Ganeshan would have called in that regard. He also asked Praseeda why Janu did not return Ganeshan’s call to which she replied that Janu would have been busy with the election campaign. During the conversation, Surendran asked if they knew Ganeshan and is heard saying that he is the party’s state organizing secretary. Surendran tells her that being the candidate he was away and couldn’t handle such things. He is heard telling her to ask Janu to return the call. Surendran is heard telling that the money was for JRP and other things will be taken care of by the local party mandalam committee. Praseeda told the media in Kannur that the day after this call, Prashanth Malavayal – a district general secretary of BJP in Wayanad – came to Manimala homestay in Sultan Bathery where Janu and she were staying on March 26 and handed over the money. Praseeda alleged that Prashanth came with a cloth bag which had bananas on top and gave it to Janu. When asked why he had come in the morning with bananas, he reportedly said that it was puja offerings made on behalf of the candidate and later the bag was given to Janu. Praseeda alleged that she came to know about the money in the bag later when local BJP activists told her that the fund was given. Praseeda had earlier levelled an allegation that Surendran had paid Rs 10 lakh to Janu in Thiruvananthapuram on March 7 for her re-entry into NDA. She had released three audio clips of the telephone conversations with Surendran to substantiate the charge. Wayanad district crime branch had taken over the investigation of the case registered against Surendran and Janu under Sections 171 E (punishment for bribery) and 171 F (punishment for undue influence or personation in elections) over the allegation. The probe team has already recorded the statements of Praseeda and she is learnt to have handed over the evidence, including audio clips of the telephone conversation. Meanwhile, Surendran refuted the allegations and alleged a false campaign was underway to silence BJP by foisting multiple cases. Surendran is facing a bribery case for allegedly bribing K Sundara, a namesake candidate from Manjeswaram to withdraw his candidature. Pleas deferred in Kodakara heist case Acting judicial first class magistrate of Irinjalakuda N M Raghunath on Wednesday adjourned the petitions of the complainants in the highway heist case at Kodakara, claiming the money and car seized by the probe team, to June 30. While the petitions filed by Dharmarajan and Sunil Naik claimed they must be given the money seized by the police, Shamjeer is demanding that the car seized by the police should be returned to him. Dharmarajan claimed that he had sent the money in the car, Naik said that he had given Rs 25 lakh to Dharmarajan. Hearing on the petitions were to begin on Wednesday, but Dharmarajan sought more time to submit his responses to the objections of the probe team. Police objected to the petitioners’ demands as probe is in progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/jrp-leader-drags-rss-into-janu-bribery-row/articleshow/83791059.cms||---
---||Delhi||Doorstep delivery of ration in Delhi: Food ministry cites operational difficulties, transparency issues||NEW DELHI: The food ministry has turned down the Delhi government’s proposal for doorstep delivery of ration allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) flagging shortcomings and concerns over likely operational difficulties, transparency and ensuring uninterrupted supply to poor who either shift their residence frequently or don’t have permanent addresses. Responding to a letter from the Delhi government dated June 15, the Union ministry on Tuesday said the “proposal doesn’t meet the statutory and functional requirement of the NFSA and so the proposal cannot be accepted.” The Delhi government has proposed the scheme on “Door-step Delivery of Ration (wheat, flour, rice and sugar) under TPDS” whereas under the NFSA wheat, rice and coarse grain are distributed to the identified beneficiaries. The ministry has pointed out that the proposal doesn’t indicate the issue price of flour and packaged rice, and whether there will be any additional charge on beneficiaries. It said since making flour involves milling, processing, packing and additional transportation there will be additional financial implications for the poor. Though under NFSA flour at higher price can be distributed, but that has to be notified and consent of beneficiaries is mandatory. The ministry said it’s not clear whether the government has taken consent from beneficiaries. It has also flagged how under the proposed scheme, at the beginning of the financial year, the beneficiaries will need to give the option for door step delivery or to get ration from ration shops. The ministry said it’s not clear whether they will be allowed to opt out in between. It has also claimed that there is no mechanism for maintaining or updating the address of the beneficiaries considering that the poor and tenants often keep shifting their addresses. The ministry has said unrestricted reach of foodgrain vehicles and delivery to beneficiaries living in multi-storey buildings is another concern. Moreover, coordination with daily wagers and labourers for timely delivery is another area of concern. The Union ministry has flagged how there is no information on how leakages, diversions and availability of the right quantity and quality of foodgrains will be ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/food-ministry-cites-operational-difficulties-transparency-issues/articleshow/83790999.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Goa||Goa: NGT orders formation of 10-member panel for Western bypass stretch||MARGAO/COLVA: In a setback to the state government, National Green Tribunal in New Delhi, has directed the constitution of a ten-member committee to study the objections raised in regard to construction of western bypass on the Benaulim-Seraulim stretch. Villagers have been demanding that the 2.75kms stretch in these two villages be built on stilts to avoid flooding, inundating houses and stagnation of water. The committee would consist of members from Goa State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), Goa State Biodiversity Board, Goa State Wetland Authority, Goa PWD, Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), district magistrate, South Goa, Water Resources Department, Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB), a nominee of National Wetland Authority and a nominee of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF), Goa. GSPCB and SEIAA, Goa will be the nodal agency for coordination and compliance, the order states. NGT has further directed that a meeting of the committee be held within two weeks and after taking stock of the situation, plan of action may be prepared and executed. NGT’s principal bench, New Delhi, consisting of chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, judicial members - Justice Sudhir Agarwal, justice M Sathyanarayanan, Justice Brijesh Sethi and expert member Dr Nagin Nanda observed, “There can be no doubt that water bodies, wetlands, mangroves and other natural resources need to be protected. While construction of a road may be a necessity, such construction should not result in destruction of bio-diversity and other environmental resources, including water bodies and wetlands. Flood plains of river Sal also need to be protected.” Applicant Royla Fernandes, former sarpanch of Benaulim, had moved the NGT pointing out that the construction of the Western Bypass on earthen embankments through the villages Seraulim to Benaulim would lead to water stagnation resulting in flooding and inundation of houses located in the vicinity She had said that the project is fully on earthen embankments with one railway overbridge and 3 underpasses and 9 box culverts, passing through khazan lands, paddy fields, water bodies, through villages of Verna, Nuvem, Seraulim, Benaulim, Navelim and Telaulim, besides a very small portion in Margao municipal area by illegally filling the said agricultural lands and water bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ngt-orders-formation-of-10-member-panel-for-western-bypass-stretch/articleshow/83793153.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Ernakulam medical college to resume non-Covid treatment tomorrow||KOCHI: Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Ernakulam, will open for non-Covid treatment from Friday. In the initial phase, out-patient department (OPD) and emergency services will start. However, specialized Covid treatment will also continue in the MCH. As Covid cases surged in the state in May, the hospital was completely converted into a Covid hospital and all non-Covid treatment was stopped. Now with a dip in critical Covid patients in the district, the medical college authorities have decided to focus also on non-Covid treatment. Confirming this, MCH medical superintendent Dr Geetha Nair said, “We plan to open in a phased manner and revert to a fully functional medical college and hospital like in the past with OPD, surgery and in-patient services. Initially, the patients to be admitted to the hospital will be those in need of emergency care”. In the absence of adequate facilities for Covid treatment in government hospitals in the district, the MCH was converted fully into a Covid hospital during the first Covid wave. As cases began to dip in January 2021, there was a demand to admit non-Covid patients to ensure that the medical students’ classes were not affected. With instructions from the Kerala University of Health Sciences and Directorate of Medical Education, most government medical colleges ensured that at least 50% patients treated in the institutes are non-Covid patients as students need to be trained in handling non-Covid patients post reopening of the college. However, it was not until March that the college became fully functional as a tertiary care learning institute. Within two month it was converted into a full-fledged Covid hospital again. “Covid and non-Covid patients will be segregated as Covid ICU and wards will continue to function in the MCH,” Dr Nair added. In the college council meeting held recently, it was decided to keep aside two wards in the medicine department for Covid patients. Also for pregnant Covid patients and children who have Covid, another ward has been set aside. Around 15 to 20 ICU beds have been kept aside for Covid patients. Meanwhile, the decision to start regular classes for all batches will only be taken after Friday. “We have been demanding that offline classes for all batches should start again. However, college authorities have said that they will discuss the issue after Friday,” said Medical College UG Student’s Union chairperson Lakshmi Raghavan. On Tuesday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that classes for medical students will start from July 1 as all of them were already vaccinated. With Covid cases under control and amid lockdown relaxations, Kerala University of Health Sciences is now conducting exams for final year and PG students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekm-medical-college-to-resume-non-covid-treatment-tomorrow/articleshow/83791056.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Mumbai||Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Iqbal Kaskar held in Kashmir drug case||MUMBAI: The Narcotics Control Bureau on Wednesday moved the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance (NDPS) court and got permission to take the custody of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar as part of a probe into drug trafficking that had its origin in Kashmir. NCB is also examining if the trafficking is part of terror funding. Kaskar has been lodged in Thane Central jail since 2017 in connection with an extortion racket. Iqbal Kaskar who was deported from UAE in 2003 is the only sibling of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim living in Mumbai. Sources said that NCB team on Thursday will take his custody from Thane jail and will produce him before Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) Court and seek permission to take his custody. Officials said that once the MCOCA court grants them permission, they will produce Iqbal before the 8th Metropolitan Magistrate court and seek his custody. In September 2017, the Thane Police had arrested Kaskar on the charges of extortion. He was booked under MCOCA following a complaint by a builder for allegedly extorting money from him since 2013. Iqbal’s name cropped up during the investigation of two cases of drug trafficking in which 27 kgs hashish worth Rs 20 crore was seized. NCB claims the quality of hashish seized by them indicates it is from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK). The NCB last week carried out a search of a boarding facility in Dadar and arrested Rajvinder Singh and Gurmit Singh from whom they seized 2 hashish. Duo had travelled from Kashmir via Punjab to Mumbai on a bike carrying the drugs. Simultaneously the NCB arrested five more persons and their interrogations led to the seizure of a motorcycle on Tuesday from which they recovered another 9 kgs of hashish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dawoods-brother-iqbal-kaskar-held-in-kashmir-drug-case/articleshow/83793251.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Nagpur||Lot of factual blunders in Sherni, says ex-PCCF AK Misra||NAGPUR: Even as Hindi movie Sherni, released last week is a fiction based on the killing of Pandharkawda tigress T1 aka Avni, two senior forest officials who had led the operation, want all to know the real story. On June 20, KM Abharna, the then Pandharkawda deputy conservator (DyCF), had made it clear that several facts have been fictionalized in the film. Currently, she is the director of Bamboo Research & Training Centre (BRTC), Chandrapur. On Wednesday, both ex-PCCF (wildlife) AK Misra, who issued orders to capture/shoot T1 and headed the entire operation, and then APCCF (wildlife-east) Sunil Limaye, who is now APCCF (wildlife-west), said they find the entire discussion on ‘Sherni’ amusing. Both had camped in Pandharkawda during the operation. The problem tigress was eliminated on November 2, 2018. The movie clearly says that it is a work of fiction. Even if it did not say so, it is a Bollywood movie and not a documentary. In addition, it is a film that may be of interest to the common man. “There are lots of factual blunders in the film. This is a typical film that cashes in on depicting government authorities in a bad taste,” says Misra. According to Misra, the central character Vidya Vincent (based on DyCF Abharna) did excellent work during that period. “All other characters have been shown in a negative light. Everyone wanted to save the tigress and there was no villain,” he said. “The operation prolonged over a year because all the efforts were taken to capture T1 alive. Had the authorities been keen to shoot the tigress, it would have been done over several months ago when six humans were killed,” said Misra. The story indicates that some criminal act was committed to shoot T1, said Mishra. “In fact, it was done under the orders of statutory authority only after recommendations from the field and supervisory officers down the line, including the DyCF. Courts too had upheld these orders,” he said. Limaye feels senior forest officers have been portrayed in a bad taste — drinking and merry-making. “The fact is non-veg food and liquor is prohibited in Maharashtra forest rest houses for the last two decades. In fact, all the staff members and officers had worked hard in the last several months of the operation,” he said. “Many times they were even gheraoed by angry mobs, risking their safety and lives. But no such gate crashing in the forest office happened as shown in the film. ‘Sherni’ misleads by showing that mining was responsible for declaring the tigress a man-eater. The nearest existing mine is 60-70 km from the site of operation,” said Misra. The film shows dense forest “but the area of T1 is a fragmented forest with a mosaic of dominantly agriculture fields and over 40 villages interspersed”. The films shows that the private shooter cannot differentiate between tiger, leopard and sloth bear signs and marks. “It is just laughable,” said Misra. The film shows that the inquiry was deliberately avoided but two very high-level panels submitted their reports to the state. Besides, ballistic and narcotropic drugs forensic investigation was also done. “The storyline was new and could have made an impact, but the opportunity has been badly squandered by director Amit Masurkar.

The proposal was placed before the government after Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) suggested that the CM should be nominated chairperson of the board. “It was felt that it would be practical to have a chief minister at the helm, to ensure faster approval of projects that would need clearance from departments other than tourism,” the officer said. The tourism policy that was approved in October last year has a provision to constitute a 16-member tourism board, with the tourism minister as its chairman. The proposal was sent for clearance earlier this week, and approval is awaited. TTAG president Nilesh Shah confirmed to TOI that they have asked the government that the chief minister be made chairperson of the tourism board. A TTAG member said they have also suggested a few changes in the composition of the board, such as that the trade body should be given the freedom to select experts who will be appointed on the board rather than government imposing its will. The official said the suggestion by TTAG is valid considering the trend seen while appointing the board of directors of any corporation. Apart from officials nominated by a virtue of their position in the corporation or the linked department, he said, other members appointed are choice of the chairperson, who is an MLA. If the industry not given the choice to appoint their members, he said, the proposed board will be like any other corporation. A member of the trade said, if they are not given the choice to appoint at least some members of the board, then they don’t expect tourism master plan to be executed in a letter and spirit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-should-head-tourism-board-govt-urged/articleshow/83793209.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Fuel on fire: After petrol, diesel prices set to breach `100 mark||Bhopal: Common man is reeling under the impact of steep and steady surge in fuel prices. The way things stand, after petrol now diesel prices may touch Rs 100 per litre mark by this month-end. Petrol prices have already created history by crossing Rs 100 per litre mark in May when lockdown was in force in MP. On Wednesday, petrol was selling for Rs 105.78 per litre and diesel for Rs 96.98 per litre. " Every time I come to the petrol pump, I check whether I have Rs 1,000 in my pocket or not. Refuelling your vehicle is quite different from buying fruits or vegetables. If apples are selling for Rs 250 per kilo, you may decide not to buy it oy buy just half-a-Kg. But, you can't do it with petrol or diesel. When petrol and diesel were comparatively cheaper, we used to ensure there was at least Rs 500 when we went to a petrol pump, now it's Rs 1000 because Rs 500 petrol pump fetches just over 4 litre of petrol and you have to come back in a day or two, to buy fuel", said Rahul Jain, who was getting his car refuelled at a petrol pump in Bittan Market. At the time when petrol was about to touch Rs 100 per litre mark, petrol pump owners and even oil companies' executives believed that either central or the state government or both would intervene and reduce the hefty taxes levied on petrol and diesel to give some relief to the consumers. But, it did not happen; petrol prices have crossed Rs 100 per litre mark and still continue to rise and now that last hope has also faded. "Yes, we thought the state and central government both would both cut taxes- Rs 2 or Rs 3- thereby bringing the prices of petrol and diesel prices down by Rs 5 per litre and won't allow the petrol price to go up to Rs 100 per litre mark but it didn't happen", said president of M P Petrol Pump Owners' Association, Ajay Singh. Singh said, crude prices in the international market are on a rise but it doesn't mean that petrol and diesel prices in India or any other country will rise every day or every alternate day. It's not the bullion market or satta bazar that rates will change everyday. It's an essential commodity and dynamic pricing policy doesn't mean that oil companies should raise the prices every day corresponding to rise in crude prices in International market. "Oil companies buy petrol and diesel for at least three months at a time and if the prices are down, they buy more. So, at least for three months, prices of petrol and diesel can remain stable", Singh added. Traders are also blaming consistent rise in fuel prices for the rising prices of essential commodities including edible oil and pulses. "If mustard oil is selling for Rs 200 a Kg and tuar for Rs 120 per Kg, consistent rise in prices of diesel is one major factor. Transportation charges have increased by 30 % in the last couple of months alone,” said Anupam Agrawal, a wholesale grocery trader. gfx June Surge Saga: (When petrol/diesel prices rose in Rs/ per litre) Date Petrol Diesel 1-06-21 102.67 93.95 4-06-21 102.95 94.25 7-06-21 103.52 94.84 10-06-21 103.77 95.11 11-06-21 104.07 95.66 14-06-21 104.65 95.66 16-06-21 104.91 96.10 20-06-21 105.49 96.71 22-06-21 105.78 96.98||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fuel-on-fire-after-petrol-diesel-prices-set-to-breach-100-mark/articleshow/83791047.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Jatinder Nagpal, 40, a resident of Basant Avenue, said in his police complaint, “Like every day, I reached my shop around 10am to open it. I was carrying a bag that contained about Rs 2 lakh. I kept the bag down to unlock the shop. At that time, two men on a motorcycle stopped near me. They asked me if a man named Billa worked there. When I told the duo I did not know him, one of them threw chilli powder into my eyes and escaped with the cash bag.” Jatinder somehow opened his shop, washed his face and called up the police control room. Assistant commissioner of police, Industrial Area-B, Randhir Singh said a case has been registered under Section 379-B (snatching) of the IPC. The cops scanned footage of CCTVs installed near the spot that had captured the accused. They are checking more CCTVs to trace the miscreants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/2-throw-chilli-powder-in-scrap-dealers-eyes-flee-with-rs-2l/articleshow/83788600.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Soon, get registration certificate of your new car at dealership itself||NEW DELHI: Delhiites will soon be able to get the registration certificate (RC) for a new vehicle at the vehicle dealership itself. A beginning towards the new, hassle-free system has already been made in the shape of temporary RC for vehicles that have been purchased in Delhi but will be permanently registered in another state. Delhi government’s transport department has recently appointed ‘self registration’ dealers as special registering authority under the Delhi Motor Vehicle Rules, 1993 to issue temporary registration of new non-transport (personal) vehicles sold from their outlets. “Under CM @ArvindKejriwal ji's guidance we always strive to simplify delivery of services. Self registration dealers in Delhi can now issue temporary Registration certificate for new vehicles sold from their outlet, along with unique registration mark listed under Rule 34 of DMVR,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot tweeted on Tuesday. Officials said that till now, vehicles purchased from Delhi by residents of other, usually neighbouring states, were issued temporary registration certificates by the motor licensing officer (MLO) of the regional transport office (RTO). Now, vehicle dealers will be able to issue these temporary certificates, which will be valid till the vehicle is permanently registered where the owner resides. “This is a step towards empowering the vehicle dealers to eventually issue actual RCs. We have already done pilot tests and authorising them for issuing the temporary certificate is a building block for empowering them,” an official said. “We have piloted the system in three zones and have firmed up the modalities of doing it,” he stated. Delhi is the nation’s car capital and before its battle with the Covid-19 outbreak began, the transport department had issued 6,45,359 new registration certificates in 2019. The official said that when someone buys a vehicle and doesn’t go to the RTO to get the RC, the details are punched in the ‘system’ by the dealer and the file goes to the MLO’s office, where it takes some time to be printed and the RC is then sent to the dealer, who then hands it over to the owner. “Even if one is not chasing RC, the procedure of getting it takes time. The new model will allow the dealer to issue the RC,” the official said. “Dealers will be given cards for printing but they will have to arrange printers and other necessary equipment. Self registration of a large number of dealers has already been done and they are on board. We have also held consultation meetings with dealers’ associations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/soon-get-rc-of-your-new-car-at-dealership-itself/articleshow/83791060.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Target 2022: DMRC’s knowledge centre likely to come up near Vishwavidyalaya station in north Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is planning to establish the National Metro Rail Knowledge Centre (NMRKC) to showcase the growth and development of Metro railways in India and to act as a hub of knowledge about state-of-the-art urban train technology. The two-storey centre will come up near the Vishwavidyalaya Metro station in north Delhi. “The objective of this knowledge centre is to showcase the evolution of the Metro rail in India as part of the celebrations for the 75th year of independence in 2022. This work is planned to be executed in public-private partnership mode,” a DMRC official said on Wednesday. The likely cost of around Rs 46.4 crore to be incurred on civil, electrical, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, including finishing and architectural works, will be borne by a concessionaire, the official said. “In addition, around Rs 15 crore will be incurred for developing exhibits, display, etc., which shall be borne by DMRC,” he added. The official said the concessionaire would develop a total of 5,800 square metres and the work is expected to be completed in fifteen months. DMRC had earlier published an expression of interest to solicit and examine the response of the private parties, corporate houses, NGOs, PSUs, trusts, among others, to associate with the train company in the establishment of the knowledge centre. The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, resulted in some setbacks for the project. DMRC believes that such a centre will not only help in communicating to the public the immense challenges involved in constructing and operating a Metro rail system, but also help in archiving materials about Metro construction in India. The centre will have provisions for audio visual screening of films and documentaries and research work with the help of books and archival publications. The NMRKC building will come up on a plot near the Vishwavidyalaya Metro station and will have six levels, including two basements and two terraces, with one of the latter housing a restaurant. The construction will be undertaken by the concessionaire under DMRC’s specifications. Apart from the 5,800 sq m for the knowledge centre, there will be additional space adding up to 7,680 sq m for commercial use. The concessionaire will construct the NMRKC building and hand over its operation to DMRC. The total parking space spread across two basements and the ground level will approximately be 6,160 sq m. A resource centre with a library containing research work and archival publications related to the Metro system will be opened for visitors, along with facilities like a reading room and a conference room. Apart from a hub of knowledge, the centre also promises to become a tourist attraction in its own right. The centre will have a museum spread across two floors, which, among other exhibits like different train models and other displays, will also feature an actual Metro train coach on display. The centre will also feature a Metro simulator, a selfie zone and souvenir shops. The entry to the museum will require e-tickets but there will be a public plaza that would be open to all. Apart from the terrace restaurant, there will be another café in the centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/such-a-long-journey-get-to-know-how-metro-overcame-challenges-in-its-way/articleshow/83791054.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Forest staff let transporting trucks pass in Wayanad||KOZHIKODE: It has emerged that forest department checkpost at Lakkidi in Wayanad failed to take note of the illegal transport of the rosewood trees, which were felled from assigned land at Muttil in Wayanad, to the timber depot in Ernakulam. RTI documents of the list of timber vehicles that passed through the checkpost from Feb 2-6 did not have the number of the lorry (KL-19-2765) in which the logs were transported on Feb 3. As per the information provided by the department to the RTI query, 44 timber lorries passed through the checkpost from Feb 2 to 6, but the lorry used by timber mafia was missing in the list. The incident points to possible collusion between the checkpost staff and those involved in the illegal timber transport. According to department sources, disciplinary action will be taken against the officers at the checkpost who are responsible for this lapse. The rosewood logs were seized by Meppadi forest range officer MK Sameer from a timber depot at Perumbavoor on Feb 8 and the lorry used to transport the timber was seized from Koduvally on Jun 9. Forest department has registered 43 cases in connection with the felling of 101 rosewood trees and 202 cu m of timber have been seized. The forest vigilance probe had found that 161 trees, including 101 rosewood trees and 60 teak trees, were felled from assigned land in Wayanad by misusing a revenue department order. Meanwhile, forest department also slapped the Bio Diversity Act in the tree felling cases while the multi-agency special investigation team (SIT) is also probing the illegal tree felling by charging cases under various sections including theft, cheating, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, Kerala Land Conservancy Act etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/forest-staff-let-transporting-trucks-pass/articleshow/83791070.cms||---

Hence, we have withdrawn the facilities like power, water coolers, pandal, sheets etc that were installed to operate the coaches,” said Jay Singh, additional divisional railway manager (ADRM). “We will reinstall these facilities as and when needed by NMC. The 11 coaches have been stationed at the same spot at the erstwhile Inland Container Depot at Narendra Nagar,” the ADRM added. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “As the facility was started on May 3, a fall in cases had already started and there was not much response. Yet, as part of our preparedness, we had jointly launched the facility. If needed, we will demand to restart it. It was a nice learning experience.” Official sources said in one month, only 24 Covid positive patients availed the benefit of the facility. Putting it for more period would have added to recurring expenses. These coaches have the capacity to treat 176 patients. Sources said another reason to close the facility was that the contract for various facilities provided in the coaches was till June 10. If the facility had stayed, the Central Railway contract will have to be extended putting a financial burden. Secondly, the coaches have been put on a siding which is still in use for transporting goods like foodgrains, tractors, sand etc. Though there is no immediate commercial impact, in the long-term it will hit railway revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cases-down-rlys-covid-coaches-put-on-hold/articleshow/83791065.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Patna||Govt pays Rs 10L relief to father of Munger police firing victim||PATNA: The state government on Wednesday paid a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to Amarnath Poddar whose 18-year-old son, Anurag Poddar, had died in alleged police firing during immersion of Durga idol in Munger on October 26 last year. Munger DM Navin Kumar said Amarnath had come to his office on Wednesday along with two of his relatives and the compensation amount was transferred to his bank account. “We offered him help in getting loan on priority basis for expanding his hardware shop business. However, Amarnath told us that he doesn’t need loan,” the DM said. On April 7, the Patna high court had asked the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh to Amarnath within a month. The state government, however, moved the Supreme Court challenging the high court order on the ground that the investigation was still in progress in the case. However, the apex court refused to interfere with the high court’s order and dismissed the state government’s SLP on June 6, leaving no option for it but to compensate the victim’s father. Supreme court lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava, who is representing Amarnath pro bono in the high court, told TOI that the matter would come up for hearing again on Friday. “The CID is expected to reply if the then Munger SP, Lipi Singh, has been quizzed and sub-inspector Brajesh Singh nabbed. It’s also expected to file a report on further progress made in the investigation,” he said, adding the last hearing in the case took place on May 19. Srivastava said HC was completely dissatisfied with the investigation carried out by CID during the last hearing. Amarnath had moved high court seeking a CBI investigation into the case under high court’s monitoring and payment of Rs 5 crore as compensation for his son’s “murder”. On October 29, violence had erupted in Munger following Anurag’s death. The Kotwali and Mufassil police stations as well as Vasudevpur and Purabsarai police outposts were burned by angry mobs. Within hours, the then SP and DM Rajesh Meena were removed on orders of the Election Commission of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-pays-rs-10l-relief-to-father-of-munger-police-firing-victim/articleshow/83788410.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Police have registered a case of murder against the man, Harish Kumar, who is in hospital and critical. Police called the murder brutal and said the woman had been stabbed multiple times in a way that even her intestine got exposed. Vijay Kumar, the accused’s brother, informed the Hari Nagar police station that Harish had called him in the morning and told him that he had killed his wife following an argument. Vijay also told the cops that Harish had locked himself in the same house in Tihar village. After reaching the spot, a police team found the main door locked and broke it open. “On entering the house, they found Harish lying on the bed with cut injuries on his hands. Next to him was the blood-drenched body of his wife Pinky, who had multiple cuts and stab wounds,” said an officer. Police found Harish alive and took him to a hospital. His wife was declared dead on arrival and her body was sent for a postmortem. Harish, police said, is an alcoholic and unemployed and the couple used to often fight over these. “During one such argument, Harish lost his temper and attacked Pinky with the knife. Police have found two knives and two blades that were used by Harish,” the officer said. Police are also questioning the other family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-arrested-for-stabbing-wife-to-death-injuring-self-in-west-delhi/articleshow/83791066.cms||---
---||Kochi||Medicos rue gap in practical knowledge||Kochi: The students of Ernakulam medical college have lost a major part of the last academic year, unable to see non-Covid patients, as the college was converted into a Covid hospital. Students fear that if this continues, they will have doctors from the college who have not seen non-Covid patients and have no practical knowledge in dealing with diseases and patients. “Unlike other government medical colleges that became Covid hospitals only during the peak of Covid infection, our college was a Covid hospital for most of the academic year. Due to this, students have been deprived of the practical training which is absolutely essential for medical education,” said Lakshmi Raghavan, chairperson, UG Student's Union, Kalammassery Medical College. The college has 32 PG students, 520 UG students and 70 plus house surgeons. Due to inordinate delay in starting OP and IP services and authorities inability to impart practical education, the medical students in January had gone on strike. Before the college was converted to a Covid treatment centre, they received nearly 3,000 OP patients per day and had 700 inpatient capacity. Now there is no OP and inpatient is less than 10 % — emergency care patients. In pre-Covid times, the PG doctors used to get to see a minimum of 20 to 30 patients per day, but since the college became a Covid hospital, the number has reduced to one or two. In April 2020, the Association of Indian Health Science Universities raised the issue of disrupting medical education in India due to the pandemic and how to minimize it. After discussions, a decision was taken to restart medical education. On July 1, 2020, Kerala University of Health Sciences communicated to all medical colleges principals to take the necessary steps for starting the final year MBBS classes on the campus. However, Ernakulam Medical College did not immediately restart classes, and Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association, Ernakulam Medical College Unit, came out the students' support. They demanded to ensure normal functioning of college both for education and treatment of non-Covid patients and thereby limit the Covid patients' treatment to Category C alone. "There are no clinical postings and we are only seeing Covid patients. With a reduction in clinical experience, the most affected are the final year students who will be passing out this year. You will have doctors who have read about a disease but never seen a patient in the hospital," said Dr Rayees Mohammed, president, PG student association, Ernakulam Medical College. "After several protests and requests, now the college will reopen to non-Covid treatment. Authorities have already initiated steps to restart classes. We are hopeful that students in each department will get to see patients and learn about the diseases that they have read in the books henceforth," said Dr Siby Manual Jose, former president, House Surgeons Association 2020-21, Ernakulam medical college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/medicos-rue-gap-in-practical-knowledge/articleshow/83791064.cms||Preetu Nair
---||Bhopal||CM slams Diggy over ‘meet with Taliban’||Bhopal: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Wednesday slammed Congress leader Digvijaya Singh for quoting a media reportregarding a ‘meeting between Indian officials and Taliban leaders’. "Digvijaya's mentality is Talibani," said Chouhan when asked about Congress leader's recent tweet on meet with Taliban leaders. The Congress leader had earlier shared a media report which claimed that Indian officials had quietly met Taliban representatives in Doha. "The Government of India should make an immediate statement on this subject. Will the BJP IT cell take cognizance of this in the sedition category?" tweeted the former chief minister sharing the report of a news website.  Chouhan attacked Digvijaya at the BJP state head office to plant saplings on the martyr's day of party ideologue Dr Shayama Prasad Mukherjee. He said that Congress had misled the public during the vaccination drive, but it turned out to be a historical event. On June 12, Chouhan had attacked Digvijaya over an audio chat that said Congress would have to relook decision to revoke Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. "He is speaking the language of Pakistan?" Chouhan had said. Meanwhile, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayavargiya said that Digvijaya's contacts are being investigated. "With whom Digvijaya is in contact, it is still being investigated," disclosed Vijayavargiya at the state party office on Wednesday. However, when asked which agency is investigating, he did not reply.  The Congress has termed Chouhan's remarks on Digvijaya as objectionable. "Digvijaya Singh has referred to a news report about the alleged Taliban meeting. The BJP and the government should come clear on this report. Blaming Digvijaya Singh and calling himnames is objectionable," said Congress state spokesperson Narendra Saluja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cm-slams-diggy-over-meet-with-taliban/articleshow/83791071.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Kerala: Surge in domestic violence cases a cause for concern||KOCHI: Domestic violence cases recorded in the various police stations in the district tell a story of the gruesomeness of different levels coming to the domestic abuse women face in households. A sample of some of the FIRs reflects the state of affairs. My husband and in-laws used to indulge in body-shaming. They used to shame me, saying that I had an ugly body and was not fit to be seen around. (The woman was caught between an alcoholic father and abusive in-laws. After filing an FIR, she returned to her home). For both couples, it was a second marriage. In-laws did not like her. They didn't want her parents to come inside. Put a camera to watch her. Husband leaves for the Gulf without telling her. They throw her and the children out of the house. When she files a complaint, the court allows her to stay at his house. With no support, her father was giving food in a basket every day from the neighbouring house. Dowry and poor family status was the cause. Husband and in-laws ill-treat her. She and the children are not allowed to sit in the dining room and have food. He has posted pics with another woman on social media. One day, she wrote on a chit of paper ‘save me’ and threw it into the next house. A neighbour informed her parents and they, along with the panchayat ward, rescued her. In many cases, the suffering is long before they are even known to parents and neighbours, say legal experts. The family court has several cases pending and even more in the last couple of years, said N Leelamani, former judge of family court and state president of the national forum for people’s rights. She says that there is a steep increase in domestic violence cases coming out in the district. “Apart from hearing while in the family court, I have heard a lot of cases while serving as chairperson of the Supreme court-appointed family welfare committee to look into whether IPC Sec 498 is being misused when complaints of dowry and domestic violence are being reported.” The committee’s mandate was to receive the complaint directly from the complainant even before the FIR is filed. “Domestic violence cases should be heard fast because it is the trauma of not just one woman. So many lives are entangled in this,” she said. RTI activist and a paralegal member of the family welfare committee TN Prathapan said that more than 100 FIRs are filed after they have investigated complaints. “I have even faced opposition from the police when we went to inquire into some of these cases. There were many cases involving people in very high levels of society and holding very top positions and indulging in such severe domestic abuse of their daughters-in-law."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/surge-in-domestic-violence-cases-a-cause-for-concern/articleshow/83791084.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

He said that the mega drive was organized with the sole purpose of creating a record. “A day after June 21, only about 5,000 persons were vaccinated,” he said. Kamal Nath said, “We know that vaccination is the only effective way to control corona spread, yet according to available statistics, Madhya Pradesh is still behind, despite the vaccination maha abhiyan.” He said that on June 21, about 16.95 lakh persons were vaccinated. “Congress party had urged people to come forward and get vaccinated. But statistics reveal that seven days before June 21, vaccination had decreased. Similarly, a day after the maha abhiyan, only 5,000 people were vaccinated,” state Kamal Nath said. He said that on June 21, there were 8,000 vaccination centres and the next day it shrunk to 300. “This itself raises a question on the government’s vaccination campaign. In the rural areas, more people have been vaccinated than the population at those places. This too raises doubt on the figures,” he said. The former Union minister said that if Madhya Pradesh has to stop the third wave, vaccination abhiyaan is needed everyday. “But the government ran the vaccination drive for a day, and misled the people”. Kamal Nath said that the state government should inform people how many persons were vaccinated for seven days before the June 21 vaccination campaign. And how many vaccines are available after the vaccination drive. “How many vaccination centres were working before the maha abhiyan day and how many centres are open now? How many persons have been vaccinated after June 21?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mega-vac-drive-just-to-create-record-nath/articleshow/83791083.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lady Shri Ram College students dish up new venture for ‘LSR aunty’||NEW DELHI: If Veni Das is synonymous with anything, it is the home-cooked south Indian food that she served students eating at the Lady Shri Ram College canteen. Then came the Covid-19 lockdown and the closing of educational institutes and Veni Aunty, as she is fondly called, was not only no longer able to cook at the canteen, but didn’t have any other sources of income. To her gratitude, the army of students she fed weren’t willing to see her suffer. LSR students, current and past, have created an Instagram page for Veni Aunty home-delivery service. Das moved to Delhi from Mumbai many years ago and settled in south Delhi’s East of Kailash with her son. “I started my life in the capital by stitching clothes at a small factory. But I got tired of it, so much so that I just didn’t want to continue with that job,” said the woman. “I then began working as a masseuse, which was when I met Meenakshi Gopinath, who was then the principal of LSR. We bonded well because we were both south Indians in a north Indian city.” It was during one of her meetings with Gopinath that Das was sounded out about starting a small south Indian food section in the college canteen. “I was very happy with the idea,” smiled the affable woman. “I prepared a menu, and the college administration tasted my menu and visited my home to see whether I cooked in hygienic conditions. I was able to win their approval and have been serving idli sambhar, vada sambhar and lemon and tomato rice to the students.” But the lockdown took a cruel toll on her finances. “After so many years of regular income, I was suddenly left without a paisa in earnings. While in college, the LSR girls were always in touch with me and many would ask me if I needed help, assuring me that I needn’t worry about anything,” she said. “But when the college closed down due to the lockdown, I didn’t know who to contact for help.” Recently a few students approached Das for an interview for their project. While talking to them, the topic of her lockdown problems cropped up. “I told them about how I hadn’t been able to earn anything and was relying on my son for money,” said Das. “You see, I’ve always wanted to avoid asking my son for financial help. That is when the LSR girls suggested that I should start a food delivery service.” The good-hearted girls helped her open an Instagram account under the tag of Veni Aunty. The account has her phone number and a small menu. It has been four days since she went online. “Many students have been ordering food from me,” beamed Das. “Also, past students called me and said they wanted my food because they missed it from their time in college.” One of the students assisting Das said when they learnt of her predicament, they decided to start a crowdfunding relief campaign for her. But others thought something that got her a regular income would be better than temporary monetary assistance. Thus began the food delivery venture — and a new lease of life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-dish-up-new-venture-for-lsr-aunty/articleshow/83791079.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor asked the government to file a detailed affidavit on the tendering process for procurement of the new machine. “It should also contain a time frame within which the tender process will be over and the machine would be delivered. It should also have the contents of audit report, which pointed out absence of adequate fire safety measures and time limit within which the compliance would be ensured by the authorities.” TOI had on January 26 highlighted the absence of an MRI machine at GMCH due to which its administration was diverting patients to Indira Gandhi GMCH. The HC’s directives came while hearing a petition filed by CH Sharma and others, where amicus curiae Anup Gilda pointed out the lack of efforts on the government’s part in procuring MRI machine and taking adequate fire safety measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-flays-govt-for-lack-of-mri-machine-fire-measures-in-gmch/articleshow/83791072.cms||---
---||Kochi||Gang hired to provide ‘protection’ to gold: Cops||Kozhikode: Custom department’s headquarters preventive unit (HPU) on Wednesday took over the investigation into the gold smuggling bid at Kozhikode airport from the local unit. It is suspected that the seizure of 2.33kg gold worth around 1.11 crore on Monday is linked with the road accident that killed five men at Ramanattukara the same day. Hours after the accident, police had booked eight persons who reportedly followed the car. The gold was seized from Muhammad Shafeeque (23), a Malappuram native, who arrived from Dubai at 2.30am, hours before the accident at Ramanattukara. Customs officers on Wednesday conducted evidence collection at Kannur after the investigation team found that Shafeeque was in touch with Arjun, a Kannur native. “The probe would now be handled by the HPU which will directly report to commissioner Sumit Kumar. We believe that three gangs were involved in the incident,” said an officer with customs preventive. Meanwhile, police investigating the case of intended robbery against the gang that followed the car involved in the road accident are learnt to have traced its remaining two members. Police are also learnt to have zeroed in on the third car involved in the incident. “Right now, it seems like a gang from Cheruplasssery was hired by a Koduvally-based group to provide ‘protection’ for the gold. The passenger who came with the gold seems to have been in touch with a Kannur-based team as well,” said an officer with the probe team. He added that the police are looking into the possibilities of the involvement of other gangs in the incident as well as whether another consignment of gold was successfully smuggled out. The other day police had found evidence, including voice clips from the mobile phones of the accused that allegedly revealed their involvement in a plan to get away with the smuggled gold. The eight accused who were arrested under IPC section 399 (making preparation to commit dacoity) were remanded in custody on Tuesday by a Nilambur court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gang-hired-to-provide-protection-to-gold-cops/articleshow/83791142.cms||---

Mumbai, too, vaccinated over 1 lakh people for the third day in a row. The state has so far administered 2.9 crore doses—2.4 crore have got one dose and 56.8 lakh both. According to state data, over 45% of the 45-plus population has been covered with at least one dose. Mumbai sees more free jabs than paid second day in rowHoping to keep the vaccination momentum alive, Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, said the state expected more doses to arrive from the Centre in the next two days. After Mumbai that administered 1,11,110 lakh doses on Wednesday, Pune also inched closer to the 1 lakh mark by administering 91,368 doses. State officials said they have already started to plan how to speed up the drive further. “We can achieve up to 10 lakh vaccinations a day. As we get more vaccines, we still speed up more,” said N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission. According to state data, at least seven districts, including Hingoli, Nanded, Palghar, Aurangabad, Solapur, Jalgaon and Parbhani, have covered less than 30% of the population above 45 years, considered more at risk of hospitalisation and death. Ramaswami said districts that are lagging behind in terms of coverage are being allocated more doses so that they can catch up with the rest. Kolhapur and Sindhudurg continue to top the chart having covered nearly 70% with at least a single dose. In Mumbai, civic officials are hopeful of keeping the momentum alive, although they were uncertain of receiving vaccine doses on Thursday. The city on Wednesday administered 1.1 lakh doses, of which 75,347 were in the public centres and 35,763 at the private centres; for the second day, more free vaccines were administered than paid ones. Overall, 38.7 lakh people have taken the first dose and 9.3 lakh the second in Mumbai. Dr Sheela Jagtap, head of immunisation for BMC, said they had 1.15 lakh doses of Covishield and 33,000 doses of Covaxin at the beginning of the drive on Wednesday. “If we don’t get the doses, we may slow down a bit. But, overall, the rush is back since people above 18 years have been allowed at the public centres,” she said. While the younger population is mainly queuing up at the vaccination centres now, there is a worry that a chunky proportion of people above 45 years and senior citizens may not have taken the vaccine at all. Civic officials said they plan to start an awareness campaign once the supply of doses is more streamlined. The head of a private hospital said most people who were willing to take the vaccine have taken it. “Now the majority who are left are either from the non-affluent class who are not so aware or the ones who are hesitant. It is time to start an awareness campaign,” he said. Private hospitals, meanwhile, awaited clarity on procuring vaccines. A civic official said while bigger chains had earlier managed to get doses, standalone ones were without vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-sees-new-high-of-6-1l-doses-over-1-lakh-in-city-third-day-in-row/articleshow/83803457.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The police said Sakhina Motarwala alias Saniya (32), who ran Universal Group near Saki Naka Metro station, lured job-seekers by posting online fake recruitment advertisements featuring photographs of 11 chefs from TAJSATS. She charged Rs 400 as registration fee and Rs 1,600 for training that would be provided on the 1,000 sq ft office space that comprised eight rooms, including one designed like the interior of an aircraft. The police suspect the scam was in operation for two years and the fraud could run into crores. “At least 100 victims have approached us. Motorwala had promised them jobs paying Rs 26,000 a month,” said senior inspector Dinkar Shilvate. The matter came to light on June 19 when TAJSATS Air Catering Ltd manager Tinu Sule came across the fake recruitment ads on Facebook and WhatsApp. He informed the HR head, Dinsha Ankaleshwariya (37). “Ankaleshwarya verified the fraud by sending a staffer, Sandesh Chalke, to the Universal Group office where he paid Rs 2,000 and applied for a job at TAJSATS. She then filed a police complaint on Tuesday,” said an officer. DCP (zone VIII) Manjunath Singe’s team—Shilvate, sub-inspectors Sandeep Yesane, Sanjay Kalhatkar, Anand Nagral, Nagesh Misal and detection staff—raided the office, arrested the accused and seized over 22 hard discs and documents. A local court remanded Motorwala and 11 of her staffers in police custody till June 30. The office boy was handed over to his parents. In court, lawyers Rakesh Singh, Prabhakar Tripathi and Arun Gupta, appearing for the accused, argued that the firm provided training to candidates to clear job interviews and charged Rs 2,000 for the same, so there is no cheating. They claimed that the police arrested them without giving notice under Section 41(a) of CrPC. “Some employees who had joined two-three days ago were also arrested,” said Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-13-arrested-as-police-bust-multi-crore-air-catering-job-racket/articleshow/83793302.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Power tariff set to be hiked second time in six months, says former minister minister Jitu Patwari||BHOPAL: Former minister and state Congress media cell chairman Jitu Patwari on Wednesday claimed that soon the Narendra Modi government is going to bring a Bill to end administered tariff rates for electricity. This means that if the Union government brings such a Bill, then like petrol, power tariff will be freely decided by private companies selling electricity. “Next session in Parliament, a new Bill will be presented to free electricity from the system of administered tariff rates. After this, government will not have any control over electricity tariff rates,” Patwari said. He claimed, this Bill will profit private power companies. Launching an attack on state minister for energy Pradyumn Singh Tomar who climbed a high tension pole to clean it on Saturday, Patwari said, “The energy minister leaves his work and starts to climb high tension poles, which is crime punishable with three years’ imprisonment. But the power minister has no concern for the deteriorating electricity scenario in the state. This will be the first time in the state when power tariff will be increased twice within a span of six months.” Patwari said that government is trying to mislead people on rising tariff rates. He alleged that 60% of power generating plants in the state are shut down incurring a huge loss for the exchequer. This includes to state-of-the-art, ultra-modern Singhaji Thermal Power Plant. “In 17 years, the BJP government set-up only one power generating plant and that too has been shut down for the past ten months, incurring a loss of Rs 1,500 crore for the state,” he said. The Congress MLA from Rau seat Patwari alleged that state run power plants are closed to earn profits for private power companies, the financial burden of which is being borne by honest consumers. He appealed to the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government not to increase tariff in the interest of the consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/power-tariff-set-to-be-hiked-2nd-time-in-six-months-jitu-patwari/articleshow/83791094.cms||---

Mohit Kumar, who allegedly attempted snatching, was under treatment at PGIMER, where he breathed his last on Tuesday night. After adding murder section to the FIR, Focal Point police on Wednesday arrested three accused: Gopal, Hajari and Ganpat. The fourth accused, Raj Kumar, is at large. All are residents of slums at Chandigarh Road. They had assaulted Mohit with sticks after tying him up with a rope in the slums on June 16. Police said Mohit, along with his friend Guddu, was passing through the slums on a bike when they tried to snatch a cellphone from Raj Kumar that day. Raj Kumar resisted and fought back. Meanwhile, Mohit attacked Raj Kumar with a brick. On hearing his cries, his father Gopal and neighbours Hajari and Ganpat rushed there. “Guddu managed to escape on his bike, but the accused nabbed Mohit. They tied him up with a rope and brutally thrashed him. On receiving the information, police reached there, rescued Mohit and took him to ESIC Hospital. He was referred to PGIMER due to his critical condition,” said inspector Davinder Kumar, SHO of Focal Point police station. A murder bid case was lodged against the accused, to which police have now added murder section too. “We are trying to trace Guddu, too, as a case would be lodged against him and Mohit for attempting to snatch a cellphone from Raj Kumar and thrashing him. We urge people to call police when they nab an accused rather than beating him up,” the SHO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/week-after-snatching-bid-thrashed-man-dies-3-held/articleshow/83788629.cms||---
---||Business||Government frees BPOs as global rivals rise||NEW DELHI: Amid growing competition from countries such as the Philippines, Mexico, Malaysia and Canada, the government has decided to unshackle the multi-billion-dollar Indian BPO industry, removing the need for a plethora of regulatory approvals and compliances. The move will also simplify the process of infrastructure and work sharing between different entities to build scale and speed. The move, which primarily impacts voice-based BPOs, allows companies providing outsourcing services of various hues to share work between each other, take domestic and international assignments on the same infrastructure, apart from providing ease of work for the employees who may have relocated to remote areas after the pandemic. The revised guidelines for the 'other service providers' (OSPs) mark a series of initiatives that the government has undertaken to liberalise the working of the Indian IT sector and allow them the option of remote working, or the 'work-from-anywhere' phenomenon. New norms may boost $39bn sectorThe IT-BPM (business process management) industry in India is estimated to have generated revenues to the tune of $38.5 billion in FY21, and the government expects the liberalised norms will give a further impetus to the industry while being more agile to competition. Read AlsoIT companies set to slash 3 million jobs by 2022 due to automation, to save $100 billion in cost: ReportWith automation taking place at a much faster pace across industries especially in the tech space, domestic software firms that employee over 16 million are set to slash headcounts by a massive 3 million by 2022, which will help them save a whopping $100 billion mostly in salaries annually, says a“In order to encourage our BPO industry, OSP guidelines that were liberalised in November 2020 have been simplified even further, offering greater ease of business and regulatory clarity. This will further reduce compliance burden and help our tech industry,” PM Narendra Modi said in a tweet. OSPs are entities providing application services, IT-enabled services, call centre services or any kind of outsourcing services using telecom resources. The liberalised norms take away the restrictions on data interconnectivity between BPO centres, opening up prospects of easily building scale. The norms have also been substantially eased for remote call centre agents who can work from any location to connect with customers using any technology, including broadband over wirelines, or wireless.

Senior officials of all line departments will visit industrial hubs and resolve pending issues of industries at their doorstep, instead of industrialists having to visit Gandhinagar to resolve their issues. Additional chief secretary (industries & mines) Rajiv Gupta, who recently held a series of meetings with over 20 major industrial associations to understand the issues faced by various industrial hubs, said the CM has directed the ‘open house’ approach to proactively resolve issues of all industries, especially MSMEs. “Necessary instructions have been given to all the line authorities which deal with industries especially industries commissioners, MSME (Micro, small & mediumenterprise) commissioner, commissioner geology & mines, as well as officials of Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation, Gujarat Pollution Control Board, and all other line departments and local district officials will remain present in the open house,” Gupta said. He added, “Any association member or any individual industrialist can visit the open house and raise their issues. Concerned authorities will have to ensure that maximum issues get resolved on the same day and if the issues are of policy nature, they will have to compile issues and brief the government to address the policy issues.’’ The official added that such open houses will be organised regularly at all major industrial hubs involving all local associations. “We have directed to use the open house forum for information dissemination and promotion of various pro-industries policies and schemes, so that maximum number of industries can benefit from state government’s policies and schemes. Open house is expected to further help us in improving our ease of doing business (EoDB) rankings.” Gupta stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/troubleshooting-at-industrial-hubs/articleshow/83791193.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Delhi||Delhi yet to meet its 2022 solar power target, 7% achieved so far||NEW DELHI: Delhi is well behind its 2022 solar power target of 2,762MW of installed solar panels, having met an abysmal 7% of the target so far. The analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment as part of its State of India’s Environment 2021 report says this is also significantly behind the national average of 39%. While a number of societies in Dwarka in south Delhi have seen large-scale installation of solar rooftops panels, other parties of the city are yet to accept the trend despite the incentives offered under the capital’s solar policy. Experts attribute the low expansion to limitations in actual rooftop space and add that lack of awareness is not a major problem in Delhi. As one of them said, “The Delhi power distribution companies have several programmes and channels where consumers can connect with them and learn more about the benefits of generating solar power. The only drawback is that the geographical area is limited and so is the space for putting up solar panels on roofs.” Saying that Delhi has fared well in comparison with other cities, the expert added, “Delhi’s regulations and policies are pro-solar energy. In fact, Delhi’s rate for adjustment of surplus solar output at the end of the financial year was around Rs 5 per unit when in most other states, it around Rs 2 per unit.” The discoms pointed out that solar rooftops have been successfully installed in many places, including Saket, Vasant Kunj, Dwarka, Chhatarpur, Sainik Farms, Karkardooma, Mayur Vihar, Patparganj and Rohini. A BSES official said both BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) have been aggressively promoting roof-top solar generation in south, west, east and central Delhi. “We have energised a record 3,200-plus roof-top solar installations with a connected solar load of over 110MW. In the current financial year, we aim to energise over 1,000 roof-top solar connections,” said the BSES official, adding that the response to rooftop solar net metering had been encouraging. Data shared by the discom showed over 1,800 connections had been installed in residential areas, over 600 in educational institutions, 578 were commercial connections and 35 industrial connections. The official added, “Consumers across categories, including residential, educational (and schools) and commercial establishments have warmed up to the roof-top solar net metering in a big way.” According to the Union ministry of new and renewable energy, Delhi had installed solar roof-top capacity of a mere184.1MW until February 28. This deficit in meeting the planned solar generation target, however, is even more significant because Delhi has no wind power projects, hydro projects or biomass projects to generate power from other renewable energy sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-yet-to-warm-up-to-solar-energy/articleshow/83791161.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

So, we had to even pay Rs 6,000 per acre for the paddy transplantation. This year, there is surplus labour and so the rate has come down to Rs 3,500 per acre. Last year, many farmers had sent vehicles to get labourers from outside, but this time around farm labourers came on their own,” said Kuldeep Singh, a farmer of Jatiwal village who has around 20 acres of land. “Our village sends a batch of villagers to Morcha on Delhi borders regularly to the protests. But despite that, we are not facing issues in paddy transplantation, as there are more than sufficient farm workers available now,” said Maggar Singh, a large-holding farmer from Turmuri village in Khanna area. He added that they have got 40 farm workers from Bihar. In some areas, the rate for paddy transplantation has fallen even more than Rs 3,500 per acre. “In our village, it is around Rs 3,000 per acre,” said Sukhjit Singh of Diwala village on Khanna Samrala road. Meanwhile, Sardara Singh Johal, an agricultural economist and chancellor of Central University in Bathinda, insisted the direct sowing of rice, which requires less labour, is yet to have an impact of the farm labourers. Johal indicated that the area under traditional paddy growing methods is in billion of acres, while DSR has only reached thousands of acres. According to him, this year simply more people have come from their respective states to earn some money, resulting in over supply. Sukhjit Singh, a farmer from Diwala, who uses DSR technique to sow rice, said while in Bathinda the area under DSR has increased significantly, because of brackish ground water, in Ludhiana district, it has decreased compared with previous years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/paddy-farm-labourers-in-surplus-rates-go-down/articleshow/83788673.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat govt invites bids for port at Nargol||GANDHINAGAR: After years of delay, the Gujarat government has finally invited bids for development of a greenfield port at Nargol in South Gujarat in the BOOT (Build, Own, Operate, Transfer) mode. Manoj Das, additional chief secretary (ACS) in the chief minister’s office (CMO) and in-charge ACS, ports and transport, said, “The CM has has approved development of a greenfield port at Nargol in South Gujarat in public-private partnership (PPP) mode with an extended BOOT period of 50 years. In deference to the fact that port projects have huge gestation lags, the government is setting a precedent by keeping the BOOT period for Nargol port development at 50 years, rather than the 30 years usually offered for greenfield port development in Gujarat. This presents the potential port developer with the assurance of greater return on investment.” “The proposal also offers interested developers the flexibility to quote discounted waterfront royalty rates in addition to the prevailing system of quoting premiums on base rates. The Nargol port developer will be selected through a global bidding process,” the official said. He added that the major port of JNPT in Mumbai is expected to exhaust its present container handling capacity of 10 million by 2025. “This presents Gujarat with an opportunity to have a greenfield port in South Gujarat to cater to the EXIM and coastal trade requirements of the sound industrial base in the hinterland comprising of the entire area of South Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh,” Das said. He added, “Considering the strategic location of Nargol and its proximity to the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), the port will handle sizable traffic of containers, dry bulk and liquid bulk cargo.” Located approximately 140km north of Mumbai and120km south of Surat, Nargol is envisaged to be a multi-functional port capable of managing solid, liquid, and container cargo with an estimated investment of Rs 3,800 crore in the first phase and additional investment in other facilities also. The first phase will witness capacity addition of close to 40 million tonnes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-years-of-delay-govt-invites-bids-for-greenfield-port-at-nargol/articleshow/83791134.cms||---

Police are yet to ascertain the identities of the deceased. Yaseen, a passenger who was injured in the accident, said, “I had boarded the bus from Sitamarhi to Ludhiana and paid Rs 1,600. The bus was overloaded till Delhi and some passengers were standing in the vehicle. When we reached near Khanna around 3am, we heard a loud bang and fell down. I tried standing up, but couldn’t. A few more passengers were injured.” Police said when the bus was passing through the flyover, the truck loaded with iron rods was parked there. “The bus driver didn’t see the truck. And by the time he noticed it, he lost control of the vehicle and ran into it. The iron rods broke into the bus windscreen and pierced the body of the driver, killing him on the spot. It seems the truck driver was sleeping under his vehicle. And as the bus dragged the truck, the latter’s tyres killed him,” said a cop. Sources said the injured were Vishwanath and Kalawati of Bagga Khurd. They were referred to Ludhiana civil hospital from a Khanna hospital. “Police later recovered two bodies from the spot. The bodies have been kept at a government hospital in Khanna for identification,” they added. Khanna DSP Rajan Parminder Singh said, “Two persons, including the bus driver and another who might be the truck driver, have died in the accident. A case will be registered against the truck driver for causing accident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/2-die-as-many-hurt-as-bus-runs-into-truck/articleshow/83788685.cms||---

In 2021, the Petit family, which controls the trust that runs the Bai Avabai Petit Girls’ School, plans to exploit a prime 2.2-acre vacant plot behind the school near Bandra’s Carter Road, for a residential project. TOI has learnt the trust has entered into an agreement with a builder, KBK Realtors (Kotharis), to develop the land. According to property market sources, the plot has development potential worth a couple of thousand crores given its location. A south Mumbai-based chartered accountant with expertise in selling Parsi trust properties is believed to have initiated the deal. The state government too has lent a helping hand to the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Trust by deleting all the public amenity reservations on it. Under the city’s development plan, the plot was reserved for 1) municipal market with old age home and students’ hostel, 2) playground, 3) park/garden and 4) school. However, on March 12, 2021, the state urban development department issued a notification removing these reservations, thereby allowing the trust to develop the plot. While the reservation for the municipal market/old age home/students’ hostel has been entirely deleted, the reservation for playground, park and school has been relocated on another open ground nearby, which also belongs to the Avabai Petit school. “With the reservations for public amenities gone, this plot has suddenly become a gold mine because of its prime location,” said a property market source. Property market sources expressed surprise that reservations for a playground and school have been relocated on a plot located inside the existing school campus which is already used as a playground. One of the school trustees, who spoke to this newspaper on the condition that he is not named, confirmed the trust wants to monetise the land. “We plan to upgrade the existing school infrastructure; perhaps build a college too,” he said. Asked if the trust had taken the mandatory permission from the charity commissioner’s office, the trustee said, “It will be done in due course of time.” “We have not sold the land to the builder. The developer is only advising us on how to exploit the plot and procure permissions. The trust will be selling the flats,” he said. Developer Rajendra Kothari of KBK Realtors said his firm is providing consultation to the trust and helping it procure the permissions. He denied there was a formal agreement with the trust to develop the property. Property experts said it is mandatory for a trust to issue a public notice, inviting bids from potential developers if it wants to develop or sell its property. However, the trustee told TOI this will be done after the charity commissioner’s sanction is taken. ``Everything is at a preliminary stage now,” he added. However, documents made available to this newspaper show that the trust has already received Rs 1 crore from KBK Realtors. The Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls’ High School was established in Bandra in 1913 as an orphanage for Parsi girls, but turned into a cosmopolitan school for girls in 1963.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-prime-bandra-plot-de-reserved-petit-trust-strikes-deal-for-housing-project/articleshow/83795215.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

The illegal mining issue was raised by senior Congress leader and Sangod MLA Bharat Singh, MLA Ramanarayan Meena, party officer-bearers Naimuddin and Pankaj Mehta, and wildlife activists during their meeting with the minister at the circuit house. They also submitted a written complaint to the minister alleging his son and nephew’s involvement, along with another Congress minister Pramod Jain Bhaya for the illegal mining in Dabi forest block. According to sources, heated arguments took place between the minister and his party workers. “There were heated arguments when the minster met party workers,” said Bharat Singh.Speaking to media on the illegal mining issue, Bishnoi said, “The department is taking action and 29 cases of illegal mining have been registered in the Dabi area in recent past. We have also imposed penalties and taken continuous action against illegal mining.” In the June 6 report, 'Illegal mining at proposed tiger reserve site', TOI had highlighted the criminal activity going on in the forest land inside Bundi's Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary, a newly declared tiger reserve. The minister was also met by contractors who alleged that their payments were not being cleared by officials who were demanding money from them. When the minister inquired about the issue, officials claimed that the payment was stopped due to the poor quality of work. The minister assured them of a probe in this regard by the PWD department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-forest-ministers-son-nephew-accused-by-cong-workers-of-illegal-mining/articleshow/83793336.cms||---

A meeting in this regard was held last week. The officials held a presentation to introduce the new councillors and members of the town planning committee to various components of the master plan. The department had forwarded the draft of the master plan to state mission management unit in March. It was later submitted to the Centre. The key step of getting the new plan approved by the council with changes and recommendations has kicked off. The councillors have been given a pro forma to fill in their inputs which shall form a part of discussion when the draft master plan comes up for council discussion. Lack of clarity in provisions regarding modifications of interim development order has made it imperative for the corporation to finalize a uniform master plan for the city. The constructions in wards outside the purview of sanctioned master plan 1971 are being done using interim development order (IDO). The public had raised concerns regarding certain provisions in IDO especially with regard to constructions in green zones. During the tenure of the previous council, the town planning standing committee presented a set of modifications in IDO to ease the processing of building permits. The modifications could not be passed in the council. After the new council came to power, the town and country planning had pitched the need to get the modifications passed. However, the Kerala Town and Country Planning Ordinance, 2021 was notified in February 2021 and this did not contain any clause to modify the IDO. This led to a question whether IDO can be modified or not. The officials with regional town planning had sent a letter to the chief town planner (planning) seeking clarity on the matter, but a reply is yet to be received. As per the changes proposed in IDO, private properties mistakenly included in areas for public and semi-public use or as paddy land can be verified using revenue records and conversion is possible with the concurrence of town planner.The dimension of commercial constructions in residential zones was proposed to be revised depending up access of road. For road width of 8m, area of commercial constructions was proposed to be increased from 200 to 500 sqm. The allowable area was proposed to be increased from 500 to 750 sqm for commercial constructions if road width is 12m. The provision of having 50% coverage for residential buildings up to 300 sqm in dry agricultural zones was taken away in the modification and in green to planned coverage zones, the coverage limit fixed at 33.3% was proposed to be done away with. The building rules will determine coverage in these areas, the modification note said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/citys-draft-master-plan-2040-to-head-to-council-for-discussion/articleshow/83791215.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Rajkot||Rajkot: HR manager, supervisor held for sexual harassment||RAJKOT: Two employees of a private firm contracted by the Jamnagar’s state-run GG Hospital were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly sexually harassing female medical attendants over the past six months. Police arrested Lomesh Chandegara alias LB Prajapati (27), a resident of Lalvadi and Akbar Ali Nayak (26), a resident of Navagam Ghed area of Jamnagar. Prajapati, who was the human resource (HR) manager, was assigned powers like deciding the duty hours of the attendants, recording their attendance, deciding their leave and others. He used to take a round to see if the attendants were carrying out the work assigned properly. He had powers to report about anybody’s mistakes, said police. Nayak was working as a supervisor with Prajapati.  The duo has been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 354 (use of criminal force to outrage a woman's modesty, 354-A (demanding sexual favours), 354-B (use of criminal force to disrobe a woman) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), the official said. Police said more arrests are likely in the coming days after the investigation. The FIR lodged by a woman victim alleged that they used to touch the women inappropriately and resort to physical and unwelcome gestures that included disrobing, passing sexually coloured comments, obscene gestures etc. Police is expected to produce the accused in the court on Thursday and request for remand to find out who supported them in misusing their administrative power. According to sources, some of the nursing staff also had knowledge of their immoral activities but no action like withdrawal of powers was taken on time. GG Hospital which created the biggest capacity in Saurashtra to treat 2,000 Covid-19 patients had hired nearly 550 medical attendants over the last 18 months through several agencies. According to hospital sources, despite several advertisements in the local paper, they did not get sufficient staff, so they decided to hire attendants through outsourcing. These attendants were assigned the duty to take care of the patient’s needs in the absence of the patients’ relatives because they were not allowed inside the hospital. Last week, one of the attendees while raising the issue of non-payment of salary also flagged allegations of sexual harassment of women attendants. Chief minister Vijay Rupani had ordered an inquiry by three-member committee to probe the allegations of sexual harassment. The committee has submitted its report to the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hr-manager-supervisor-held-for-sexual-harassment/articleshow/83788766.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Hardik Patel can move out of Gujarat: Court||AHMEDABAD: In a relief for the Congress working president, Hardik Patel, a city sessions court granted him permission to move out of Gujarat without prior permission from the court for one year. The restrictions on Patel’s movement were imposed in January 2020 by the court, which hears the 2015 sedition case against the former convenor of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), while granting him bail. He was then arrested for skipping court hearings on multiple occasions. Patel’s advocate Rafik Lokhandwala filed an application in the court and sought permanent deletion of the bail condition or a relaxation for two years so that Patel does not have to seek court’s permission every time he needs to leave Gujarat. It was contended that Patel is a social activist and political leader and has to go outside Gujarat frequently for social activities. It was also submitted that Patel is acting president of Gujarat Congress and he is under obligation to visit various places in India to attend social and political functions. Patel’s request was vehemently opposed by the cyber cell of the city crime branch and it was argued that if allowed to move outside Gujarat, Patel may not be available during court hearings. After hearing the case, additional sessions judge B J Ganatra suspended the restrictions on movement for one year but made it clear that Patel would not seek any adjournment on account of his absence. He would also not raise any objection or dispute about identification of witnesses, if the trial goes ahead in his absence during the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hardik-patel-can-move-outside-gujarat-without-court-permission-for-a-year/articleshow/83791211.cms||---
---||Jaipur||RBSE to consider marks of previous years for Class 10 & 12 evaluation||JAIPUR: The final formula for evaluating RBSE students for Class 10 and 12 board exams was released on Wednesday following a report submitted by the committee constituted by the education department. Similar to CBSE's assessment scheme, RBSE will consider marks of previous years to evaluate students. For Class 10 board evaluation, students will be given a mark weightage of 45% for Class 8 exam, 25% for Class 9, 10% for Class 10 exam. For Class XII final evaluation, 40% weightage will be given for Class 10 exam, 20% for Class 11 and 20% for Class 12 exam. The school subject committee will decide on how to give mark weightage for classes 10, 11 and 12. This committee will include the school principal, class teacher and subject teacher. They will determine the marks based on observations made throughout the year keeping in view the continuous participation and performance of students in various digital sessions such as Smile-1, Smile-2, 'Aao Ghar Mein Seekhein' and classroom teaching. The remaining 20% marks for both board exams will be based on internal assessment as done every year. School education minister Govind Singh Dotasra announced the formula on his social media platform. Regarding practical examinations for Class 12 students, the committee has said that most schools have already conducted them and around 40% have completed giving marks to students. The remaining schools will conduct the practical examination online or offline and, if necessary, take permission from the home and medical department to hold the same. RBSE has also given the option of giving physical examination to students who are not satisfied with the marks based on the formula announced. For this, they will have to register online and only marks of that optional examination will be considered for the final result. Students taking exams privately or those who have applied for category improvement will be given the opportunity to give physical exams whenever the examination is conducted by the board. Students who have to take supplementary exams will have to appear for the same when they are held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rbse-to-consider-marksof-previous-years-forclass-10-12-evaluation/articleshow/83793398.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Rs 630cr fake billing network busted, Ludhiana businessman arrested||LUDHIANA: Zonal unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) has unearthed a bogus billing network involving circular trading of Rs 630 crore being run in the city. In the operation that had been going on for two days, the DGGI on Wednesday arrested a timber and plywood businessman of the city for his alleged involvement in the nexus being run by using 15 firms, 12 of which have been found to be non-existent. The accused has been sent to judicial remand till July 7. A highly-placed source in the department said, “Based upon intelligence gathered, simultaneous searches on 16 premises were conducted by different teams of 35 DGGI officials. During the investigation, it was found that 15 firms were involved in circular trading and supply, which started from three firms and returned to them after routing through 12 dummy or non-existent firms. These 12 firms were shown to be operating from different non-existent addresses with dummy proprietors, who were either current or ex-employees of the three firms owned by Barinder Singh and his family. The entire operation and bank accounts were being managed by him.” The source said, “As being partner and operator of three firms, Singh was the key person responsible for collecting and using the documents of other persons for floating fictitious firms and was involved in bogus outward supplies of Rs 600 crore approximately, involving input tax credit (ITC) of Rs 94 crore and fake inward supplies of Rs 630 crore, with ITC of Rs 98 crore. He was found to be operating and managing 12 fictitious firms for issuing fake invoices for availing and passing inadmissible ITC without supply of goods by undertaking circular trading. Three trading firms of timber and plywood were found to be engaged in making outward supplies to six firms and thereafter these firms were repeating the process with other six firms, which finally returned the goods to the three firms.” Source said recovery of incriminating evidence, including electronic and IT devices, from the residential and business premise of Singh during the search revealed his involvement in creating and managing these dummy firms. Various suppliers and buyers of these firms are under the radar of the department. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/rs-630cr-fake-billing-network-busted-city-bizman-arrested/articleshow/83788741.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee revamp to focus on smaller panels||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC political affairs committee has decided to discard jumbo committees, which more often than not, represented group politics rather than Congress politics in the KPCC. The new KPCC will have only 51 members, including office bearers. The lower-levels committees would also be constituted in a similar fashion, KPCC president K Sudhakaran said on Wednesday. The political affairs committee took the decision to downsize the committees following consultations with senior leaders. Sudhakaran said Congress will introduce 10% reservation in party posts for women and SC/ST candidates. The primary agenda of the party, he said, was to invigorate the party machinery. “Micro-level committees, covering 30-50 houses will be introduced for the first time. Such committees are being set up to improve the party’s grassroots presence. The attempt is to develop the party into a semi-cadre one,” Sudhakaran told reporters. The organisational revamp will be over in two three months, he said. The political affairs committee meeting has also decided to constitute five zonal committees to probe the reasons for the party’s dismal show in the assembly elections. Sudhakaran said the party would start a “political school” to impart political education to party workers. The new KPCC president candidates will be selected to party forums based only on merit and warned strict action against those engaging in anti-party activities. The party, he said, will soon set up a disciplinary committee to identify and act against misuse of freedom in the party. Sudhakaran said all office bearers of KPCC, DCC and other committees in the lower rungs will be be full time workers and KPCC will reserve the right to strip anyone of the party position, if he or she is found to be a failure in discharging the duties assigned to them. Sudhakaran denied rumours that K Muraleedharan MP has skipped the political affairs committee meeting as he was not among the senior leaders whom Sudhakaran had consulted prior to the political affairs committee meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kpcc-revamp-to-focus-on-smaller-panels/articleshow/83791218.cms||---

The alleged incident took place in Begum Bridge area of Meerut where two groups of drug addicts clashed forcing the local police to intervene. Later their families too got involved in the clash, leading to chaos on a busy intersection. More force was called to the spot and the situation was brought under control. But, while removing the families from the road, a policeman lifted an infant with its hand. Someone captured the moment on camera and put it on social media platforms. It was met with shock and disbelief. @atlastofhumans wrote, “What kind of monster handles babies like that?” @garima5555 wrote, “Omg how can they hold a baby like this? Strict action should be taken.” @shivangidinesh wrote, “Basically this is UP police so plz don’t expect humanity from them. One of the High Court judge right said about them, a few years back. Their only job is to collect money from poor people.” Though a probe has been ordered in the incident, SP Vineet Bhatnagar said, “It was the family that had not taken care of the child at that moment when a few drunkards created ruckus and clashed with each other.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Teen alleges moral policing in Salt Lake||KOLKATA: A 19-year-old student from a top English-medium school in Kolkata had claimed he was subjected to moral policing and assaulted by a group of men outside a park at BA Block in Salt Lake for sitting on a bench with a girl last Monday. The local residents’ association has lodged a complaint at Bidhannagar North police station on Wednesday against the youth citing “unethical activities” by “outsiders”. The youth, who has narrated his plight on social media, has told TOI he was just chatting with his friend after a round of cycling at 5.15am, when the caretaker of BA block community centre asked them to leave the spot and claimed their behaviour was indecent. “When I protested, a local resident joined the caretaker, saying we were doing dirty things. I protested again as others gathered around us. One of them flung my bicycle in a drain while others began hitting me. In self-defence, I pushed them away, as more people joined to abuse and beat me up. Two men even appeared with an iron rod,” said the youth, a resident of Phoolbagan. The girl had initially left but had come back after the youth called her for help. However, the men were abusive towards her as well, he said. “I had never felt more powerless before. The rod hit me again, near my eye. I grabbed it and snatched it away. People pounced on me again and I stopped everyone saying I don’t want to hurt anyone, so please stop. Thankfully by then, the police came and the hitting stopped as well,” the youth wrote on a social media page. Residents of BA Block claimed the youth was sitting indecorously outside the park that led them to protest but refuted allegations of beating him up. “He was sitting in such a manner with the girl that elderly residents in the area couldn’t bear to stand the sight. We had just asked him to sit at a distance maintaining Covid protocol and he began abusing us. The youth was extremely aggressive and had even pushed a senior citizen. But we never beat him up,” said Subhendu Kundu, the secretary of BA Block residents’ association. The youth added that someone had even called the local councillor Rajesh Chirimar but he allegedly asked the locals to continue the beating. However, Chirimar denied the allegation. “I told the men to call the cops or talk to the boy and ask him to leave. If he had been assaulted, it is wrong. But then he should have complained to police if indeed something like this happened. I am ready to help the young man if required,” Chirimar said. Officers from Bidhannagar North police station rescued the youth and later handed him over to his parents. “The youth hasn’t lodged a complaint yet,” said a senior officer. The officer added that local residents, however, lodged a complaint about unrestricted entry of outsiders in the area who engage in unethical activities. Sociologists have described the incident as an example of moral policing borne out of generation gap, antipathy towards different sections of society and a sense of deep-rooted envy. “Most elderly residents had never got the opportunity to hang out ad mix with the opposite gender in their puberty, the way today’s teenagers do. They had always lived in a state of denial. These instances of moral policing often get exposed when this sense of generation gap coupled with an underlying element of envy towards the liberty enjoyed by today’s teenagers may have prompted the attack as well. The fact that the youth was not a Bengali could have flared the sentiments further,” said sociologist Prasanta Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teen-alleges-moral-policing-in-salt-lake/articleshow/83791223.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai Univ mgmt council wants to pay HRA to V-C, 2 others living in varsity homes||MUMBAI: The Mumbai University’s management council has proposed to pay house rent allowance to three senior-most officers of the university – vice-chancellor, pro vice-chancellor and registrar – who incidentally are living in rent-free furnished accommodation provided by the university. At the management council meeting of May 29, this item was not originally a part of the agenda distributed among members. But as the online meeting was about to end, a member, Pradeep Sawant, raised the issue and stated that the HRA matter ought to be looked into. In the minutes of the council meeting distributed among members on Wednesday evening, for Thursday’s new management council meeting, the decision has been printed as: “According to everyone, a decision has been taken to pay the HRA retrospectively for the date of appointment to the VC, pro VC and the registrar.” In response to this, university officials said: “The minutes have not been confirmed yet. Only when they are confirmed in the management council meeting that will be held on Thursday, will this become a resolution.” HRA payout is 40% of basic salary, and if paid retrospectively, could amount to several lakhs for the V-C. “But this point is not about the sum. The decision is fundamentally faulty as it contravenes the accounting code,” said a former V-C. Said another ex-VC, “Living in a government provided bungalow and then asking for HRA is not acceptable. No faculty who lives on campus claims HRA.” No other V-C/registrar or pro-VC who lived on campus residences claimed HRA, officials said. The “controversial” matter could blow out of proportion, said a former university head, as the HRA rule was applicable to everyone living on campus, including faculty and university officers and staffers. While the V-C Suhas Pednekar lives in the V-C’s bungalow on Kalina campus, Ravindra Kulkarni, the pro-VC, lives in the lodge provided by the university at Marine Lines. Registrar Baliram Gaikwad is also provided residential accommodation on the Kalina campus. A member said, “It is ridiculous that officers who chair the management council get such decisions passed in their favour.” A former senior finance officer said, “When I lived in the officers’ accommodation in Haji Ali, neither did I claim HRA, nor did we pay it to anyone who lived in government accommodation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-univ-mgmt-council-wants-to-pay-hra-to-v-c-2-others-living-in-varsity-homes/articleshow/83795307.cms||Hemali Chhapia

The core areas of the tiger reserves are usually open between November and June while outer zones, like Dhela, Jhirna and Garzia in Corbett, allow passage to a certain extent for most of the year because they lie in the buffer zone. But since May 1, the outer ranges, too, had been shut. Rajaji doesn’t have any buffer zones. So, all its five tourist zones remain out of bounds outside the open season. “We will be opening the reserves but entry to all areas will be permitted only if access is easy and doesn’t threaten wildlife,” chief wildlife warden of the forest department, JS Suhag, said. Head of forest force Rajiv Bhartari said this is being done to “provide more livelihood options” and open “tourism zones for adventure and wildlife lovers”. Directors of both reserves are yet to receive official communication about the plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/corbett-rajaji-to-be-open-round-the-year/articleshow/83788814.cms||Shivani Azad

The rape survivor and the accused belong to the same village in Uttar Pradesh. Santosh is on the run. The minor was rescued last week after the Pradhymannagar police was tipped off about her by a Mumbai-based NGO. Police had stumbled upon a prostitution racket that was flourishing in the hotel for several months and found a woman from Maharashtra too who was brought her for flesh trade. After the girl was rescued, she had first refused to lodge any complaint against Santosh and she was sent to a protection home for girls where she was counselled. She later agreed to lodge a complaint and her 56-year-old mother filed a complaint against Santosh who was booked under relevant sections fo of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act. The girl and her mother, who are natives of Aligarh in UP had come to Rajkot to stay with her son in the city. The girl’s brother could not accommodate them in his room. Santosh, who runs a factory in Aji Dam area, gave them a room near his unit.  "Santosh allegedly raped her in the room where she was staying and later eloped with her. Two months ago, he returned and started living in Hotel Park Inn and she was found,'' police said. Separately, police have booked the hotel’s owner Himanshu Mehta for allowing the immoral activity that was carried out by Prabhudas Kakad and Jayshree Chavda. Hotel’s manager Mehul Chotalia too was arrested on the basis of the Maharashtra woman’s statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/up-man-booked-for-raping-16-year-old-girl/articleshow/83788922.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Electric 2-wheelers may cost Rs 30,000 less’||AHMEDABAD: The incentives rolled out by the state government’s new electric vehicle (EV) policy coupled with enhanced subsidy under the Centre’s FAME-II Scheme may soon make electric two-wheelers cheaper by Rs 30,000. That reduction has been estimated in a report released by the ratings agency ICRA. Gujarat State EV Policy 2021 will be effective for four years from July 1, 2021. The state government is also offering incentives on electric four-wheelers at Rs 10,000 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). So the ratings agency said there is a possibility of a price reduction of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh for electric cars in Gujarat. According to ICRA, the policy is positive for two-wheeler and three-wheeler segments and the good part is that passenger vehicles for personal usage is covered under the state policy, which is currently excluded from FAME-II. Under the policy, a demand incentive of Rs 10,000 per kWh is being provided by the state government for electric two-wheelers, electric three-wheelers and electric four wheelers, over and above any subsidies from the central government. Ashish Modani, ICRA vice-president and sector head (corporate ratings), said: “The department of heavy industries’ amendment and the Gujarat government’s incentive could result in a price reduction of about Rs 30,000 on an e2W.” It is substantial and will help in achieving price parity with conventional two-wheelers, he said. “If successfully implemented, the Gujarat EV policy could result in at least 25% EV penetration in the 3W segment,” Modani said. “Its target of 1.10 lakh electric two-wheeler units over a four-year period remains modest compared to over 10.6 lakh two-wheelers sold in 2019-20.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/electric-2-wheelers-may-cost-rs-30k-less/articleshow/83791230.cms||---

The corporation will be keen on giving a new impetus to the projects that have missed the timelines owing to different reasons. Smart City Thiruvananthapuram Ltd (SCTL), which had planned to launch the work on the Smart Road project in the city, had been forced earlier to put off the work owing to a directive from the District Collector banning any kind of road cutting till May 2 in the wake of Assembly elections. The Smart Roads project had to go through a series of hurdles, starting with a delay in clearance from the public works department and then tender excess issue with participating firms quoting exorbitant rates for the work. The plan was to start the work at least by March when the directive from the District Collector came forcing a change of plan. However, since then, the onset of the second Covid-19 wave further impeded the progress of the work. Presently, the Smart Roads project is being implemented only in three corporation roads around the East Fort region. The choice of one of the roads for Smart Roads recently led to protests. When the project team arrived at the site in February, residents protested. Ward councillor Rajendran Nair also brought up the matter in the council recently. The project encompasses features like pedestrian footpath/safe pathways, junction improvements, stormwater drains, utility conduits and underground ducts for electrical, KWA and communication lines. Besides landscaping, streetscaping, provision of smart street furniture, creating and developing basic conveniences along the roads, are also included under the scope of work. Regarding the work on the construction of the Integrated Command and Control Centre under the Smart City Project, SCTL had sought the intervention of the chief minister’s office. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the project that is being touted as one of the prestigious schemes under the Smart City Project. Although the letter of award was issued to the contractor in August 2020, the site could not be handed over owing to strong objection from leftist unions. The matter came up in the board meeting and SCTL stressed the need to start the work and sought the attention of Mayor Arya Rajendran. The delay in handing over the site to the contractor could adversely affect the prospects of Thiruvananthapuram when it comes to achieving milestones and timelines in the completion of projects. The mayor plans to address all these concerns in the review meeting scheduled on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/smart-city-mayor-to-hold-review-meet-today/articleshow/83791236.cms||---

No post-mortem was done on the bodies as the parents did not want it, said police. The incident took place in Landhaura near Roorkee on Tuesday noon. Suhail, 11, and his uncle Sarfaraz, 13, saw some children play in a pool of water and wanted to join them. It was a pit dug up to store raw material for a nearby brick kiln. Heavy rains had filled it with water. “The kids were all splashing around in the pool when around 12:30 pm, Suhail and Sarfaraz accidentally ended up in the deep end and drowned. When the other children noticed the two boys were missing, they raised an alarm. Fire tenders and a State Disaster Rescue Force (SDRF) team reached the spot as soon as information reached us but by then, the kids’ family members had fished out the bodies,” in-charge of Landhaura police checkpost Nitesh Sharma told TOI. “We did not notice any foul play, so we respected the family’s wish to go about the last rites without conducting a post-mortem on the bodies. We let them take the bodies after they submitted a written request,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-boys-11-and-13-drown-while-playing-in-a-water-filled-pit/articleshow/83788886.cms||Tapan Susheel

The police have identified the accused as Sahad (29) of Mannaniya Laksham Veedu Colony. The police had earlier arrested four others in connection with the case. The alleged attack took place a day after liquor shops were opened in Kerala after the state government eased lockdown restrictions. All the accused had gathered in a public place near the colony and were consuming alcohol. Junior health inspector Aneesh, who was on a field visit, saw them while passing by. He questioned their actions and told them that it would not help the ongoing fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. But, the accused, who were in an inebriated state, got infuriated at being questioned and attacked the JHI. When municipality staff Arun, accompanying the JHI, tried to intervene, they also assaulted him. The accused also vandalized their car, owned by the Varkala municipality. Sahad, like the other accused in the case, went into hiding after committing the crime. He was arrested by a team of police led by Varkala station house officer Inspector Dwijesh. He was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody shortly after the arrest was recorded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/one-more-held-in-covid-duty-staff-assault-case/articleshow/83791242.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai sees more free jabs than paid second day in row||Mumbai: Hoping to keep the vaccination momentum alive, Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, said the state expected more doses to arrive from the Centre in the next two days. After Mumbai that administered 1,11,110 lakh doses on Wednesday, Pune also inched closer to the 1 lakh mark by administering 91,368 doses.State officials said they have already started to plan how to speed up the drive further. “We can achieve up to 10 lakh vaccinations a day. As we get more vaccines, we still speed up more,” said N Ramaswami, commissioner, National Health Mission.According to state data, at least seven districts, including Hingoli, Nanded, Palghar, Aurangabad, Solapur, Jalgaon and Parbhani, have covered less than 30% of the population above 45 years, considered more at risk of hospitalisation and death. Ramaswami said districts that are lagging behind in terms of coverage are being allocated more doses so that they can catch up with the rest. Kolhapur and Sindhudurg continue to top the chart having covered nearly 70% with at least a single dose.In Mumbai, civic officials are hopeful of keeping the momentum alive, although they were uncertain of receiving vaccine doses on Thursday. The city on Wednesday administered 1.1 lakh doses, of which 75,347 were in the public centres and 35,763 at the private centres; for the second day, more free vaccines were administered than paid ones. Overall, 38.7 lakh people have taken the first dose and 9.3 lakh the second in Mumbai. Dr Sheela Jagtap, head of immunisation for BMC, said they had 1.15 lakh doses of Covishield and 33,000 doses of Covaxin at the beginning of the drive on Wednesday. “If we don’t get the doses, we may slow down a bit. But, overall, the rush is back since people above 18 years have been allowed at the public centres,” she said.While the younger population is mainly queuing up at the vaccination centres now, there is a worry that a chunky proportion of people above 45 years and senior citizens may not have taken the vaccine at all. Civic officials said they plan to start an awareness campaign once the supply of doses is more streamlined. The head of a private hospital said most people who were willing to take the vaccine have taken it. “Now the majority who are left are either from the non-affluent class who are not so aware or the ones who are hesitant. It is time to start an awareness campaign,” he said. Private hospitals, meanwhile, awaited clarity on procuring vaccines. A civic official said while bigger chains had earlier managed to get doses, standalone ones were without vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sees-more-free-jabs-than-paid-second-day-in-row/articleshow/83793533.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Cabinet rejig is Ashok Gehlot’s call, no one can dictate terms, say Independent MLAs||JAIPUR: With infighting in Congress deepening in Rajasthan, Independent legislators in the state publicly reiterated their faith in the leadership of chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday. The legislators convened a meeting here as Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot’s supporters have been sparring since the past fortnight over long pending cabinet expansion and political appointments in the state. Of the 13 Independent legislators, 12 attended the meeting, as MLA Baljeet Yadav could not reach. The Independents said “all attempts to destabilise the state government would be given a befitting reply as was done after Pilot’s revolt last July.” “It is the prerogative of the chief minister to decide when to expand his cabinet and who should be included. It is not in the interest of the people of Rajasthan to dictate terms to him and make a practise of exerting pressure. This meeting leaves it to the CM to take a call on every issue,” Sanyam Lodha, Independent MLA from Sirohi, said at a press conference after the meeting at the Circuit House. “Sachin has been fortunate to be born in the family of a leader like Rajesh Pilot. He got everything at a young age,” said Lodha. “He never tasted defeat in life. It (defeat) happened with him for the first time on the issue of being the CM and then for the second time (during the rebellion). He will take time to learn,” said Lodha. Replying to the charge that he was getting restless to be a minister, Lodha said, “We are people who swept floors for Congress and pasted posters for NSUI. If Sonia Gandhiji tells us to work as legislators, none of us will demand anything. We are ready to make all kinds of sacrifices.” Of the 13 Independents, 12 are Congress rebels. In response to Pilot camp’s charge that Congress did not seek Independents’ support as they were party rebels, Lodha said “Soon after the state election, the AICC and the state leadership contacted us. We were made associate members of Congress in the presence of Rahul Gandhi during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Rajasthan government got into a crisis after that. They (Pilot supporters) are no one to question us.” The meeting was earlier tipped to include six BSP-turned-Congress legislators too, but they were later dropped as it would have depicted these MLAs as separate from the Congress. Still, Rajendra Gudha, one of the six MLAs, reached the meeting’s original venue, Hotel Jaipur Ashoka, a RTDC property. Gudha’s presence was objected to by a couple of independent MLAs and the meeting venue was hurriedly shifted to the Circuit House. Lodha said the meeting was convened to ask for improving governance in the state, filling posts of patwaris and gram-sevaks immediately and initiating a process to regularise contractual employees. “We urge all non-BJP parties to unite and launch an agitation against the Centre to protest rising prices of cooking gas, diesel and petrol. We demand PM Narendra Modi to fill 15 lakh posts in the government of India. Congratulating CM Gehlot for best covid management in Rajasthan, we express full faith in his leadership,” the MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cabinet-rejig-is-gehlotscall-no-one-can-dictateterms-independent-mlas/articleshow/83793503.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

On Tuesday morning, a landslide near Uma Maheshwar Ashram at Karnaprayag had blocked the highway, leaving almost 200 vehicles stranded. Nand Kishore Joshi, disaster management officer of Chamoli district, told TOI, “The highway was opened on Wednesday morning for traffic movement after debris were cleared in a night-long operation.” Earlier, the Rishikesh-Badrinath highway was also blocked near Hanuman Chatti, near Badrinath, after a landslide triggered by heavy rainfall on June 19.  Meanwhile, several interior roads continue to remain blocked. In Chamoli district, as many as 51 village link roads are still blocked and power supply in 42 villages is yet to be restored. Nearly 38 link roads are still out of bounds in Pauri district, 15 village roads are obstructed in Rudraprayag district, 15 link roads are blocked in Champawat district and six border roads and 16 village roads are blocked in Pithoragarh district, according to the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC). In Almora, the rain subsided after three days. Most of the roads that were blocked by debris have been opened for traffic movements. However, four internal roads and the Almora-Haldwani road continue to remain shut for commuters as heavy boulders continue to fall on the stretch at several places. Rakesh Joshi, the district disaster management officer, told TOI, “We are trying to restore the four internal roads — Hanuman Mandir road, Mornaula Jainti road, Chakar village road and Ghughuti road — at the earliest possible.” In Bageshwar, efforts are underway to restore the three roads that are still blocked.

---||Goa||Now, to enter Goa, even pets must have vaccine certificates||PANAJI: With Goa having acquired the status of being a rabies-controlled state, the directorate of animal husbandry and veterinary services (AHVS) has decided to ensure that the virus doesn’t enter the state through its borders. People, especially tourists, travelling to Goa along with their pets will now have to inform the AHVS department about bringing the animals along and get them vaccinated. “As soon as they enter Goa, they must call the hotline and share their pet’s information and vaccination details. If their pets are not vaccinated, we will arrange for the vaccination free of cost,” AHVS deputy director Dr Marvin Lopes said. However, livestock is exempted from this. Only dogs and cats must be vaccinated against rabies while entering Goa. In Goa, every pet owner is required to get the animal vaccinated, and they can be questioned by any veterinarian on why they’ve failed to do so. If locals have even the slightest doubt that a dog is showing rabies symptoms, they must inform on the hotline, the department has mandated. The rabies virus had resulted in the death of 17 people in 2014, besides several dogs. The cases have declined after Mission Rabies started vaccinating and sterilising dogs across Goa. TOI had reported on June 23 that Goa has been declared as a rabies-controlled state on account of zero deaths in humans due to the rabies virus in the past three years. “It is a long neglected disease that was often unreported and in some cases, the rabies deaths used to go unrecorded. After Goa came forward to address the issue, the data was recorded by Mission Rabies and monitored by district-level monitoring committees,” Mission Rabies education director Dr Murugan Appupillai said. To maintain the status of Goa being a rabies-controlled state, he said that the people must cooperate by reporting any potential rabies cases and be educated about avoidance and management of dog bites. The department has set up monitoring committees in panchayats to encourage tie-ups with animal welfare organizations to sterilise stray dogs within their jurisdiction. Lopes said that roughly about 20 panchayats have signed the MoU to execute this task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-to-enter-goa-even-pets-must-have-vaccine-certificates/articleshow/83793519.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Man found buried in house day after murder of wife, 81||LUDHIANA: A day after an elderly woman was found murdered at her house in Lakha village, the body of her husband was found buried there on Wednesday. The woman has been identified as Shanti Devi, 81, and her husband as Hari Chand, 85. Their son Pawan Kumar, 59, of Preet Nagar in Moga, said in his police complaint, “Of my three siblings, my younger brother Kuldeep Kumar lives in Finland. My sister Parveen Rani started living with our parents 17 years ago following issues with her in-laws. My second sister Anita Sharma is married to my namesake Pawan Kumar and resides in Moga.” On Monday, Parveen had gone to Anita’s place to get vaccinated against Covid. “On Tuesday at 5.30pm when Parveen and Anita, along with her husband, reached home in Lakha, they found our mother dead and father missing. Killers had hit our mother in the face with rods. We looked for our father everywhere, but to no avail,” he added. Hathur police took Shanti Devi’s body to a government hospital for the post-mortem and booked unidentified accused. During investigation, police found the body of Hari Chand buried at the rear of his house. The decomposed body was exhumed in the presence of a sub-divisional magistrate. Raikot DSP Sukhnaz Singh said, “We are probing the case from various angles. No CCTV cameras are installed at the house. We are scanning the footage of CCTVs of the nearby areas.” Ruling out the dacoity angle, police said no costly belongings were missing. “Parveen has two sons, one lives with his maternal uncle in Finland and the other works abroad,” said a cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/man-found-buried-in-house-day-after-murder-of-wife-81/articleshow/83788971.cms||---

Vincent of Kochu Kinattinmoodu House, Mampally, is the deceased. Anchuthengu coastal police have registered a case in connection with his death. According to the Anchuthengu coastal police, the mishap occurred around 5.45am on Wednesday. Vincent was part of a five-member group that set off for fishing in the boat, Paraloka Matha, owned by one Poulose. The other members of the group were Alphonse, Franklin, Theranyas and Dasan. All of them were residents of Mampally. Shortly after launching the boat from Mampally beach, they were hit by a giant wave. In the impact, the boat capsized and all the men were thrown into the turbulent water. While the other four men managed to swim to safety, Vincent, apparently suffering from exhaustion, was left behind. However, he was pulled out of the water by fishermen on other boats nearby. He was still alive when brought to the shore. But, he died shortly after reaching Chirayinkeezh Government District Hospital. This is the third mishap reported in the Anchuthengu region in the past 10 days. The first death was of five-year-old Mohammed Shahabas, who was swept away by waves while standing close to the sea on June 15. His body washed ashore two days later. On June 18, a 19-year-old youth went missing after his boat capsized near Muthalappozhi breakwater, where Kadhinamkulam lake joined the Arabian sea. His body is yet to be found. Incidentally, all three mishaps have occurred while the District Collector has repeatedly been issuing warnings as the sea remains rough. The collector's warnings are based on the prediction by scientists of the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) that the state's coastline would experience waves of height ranging from 2 to 2.5 meters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fisherman-dies-as-boat-capsizes/articleshow/83791271.cms||---
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Passengers attacked in fight between rival bus operators||BIJNOR: A private bus carrying nearly 40 passengers was attacked by a group of men on a busy highway in UP’s Amroha district on Tuesday night following a bitter dispute between two rival travel agencies. A few passengers sustained mild injuries and three of them were taken to the nearest primary health centre for first-aid treatment. The bus was carrying passengers from Delhi’s Anand Vihar to Hardoi (UP) when men armed with sticks and stones got down from another bus near Gajraula in Amroha district and forcibly stopped the first vehicle. “A group of men who had boarded the bus in Meerut posing as passengers also joined the attackers and started beating up our driver. Others tried to damage the vehicle and some passengers were injured in the process,” said passenger Mohd Shehzad. According to another passenger, Ram Vilas, “I had boarded the bus at Anand Vihar. Everything seemed normal until we reached Gajraula when suddenly we heard commotion and saw the bus being attacked. Some passengers got down and ran for cover. After a few minutes, the attackers boarded their own bus and again hit our vehicle in reverse gear. By then, police had reached the spot.” According to police, 11 people were arrested and booked for attempt to murder, rioting and voluntarily causing hurt. The passengers were provided another bus to carry on their journey. Amroha superintendent of police Poonam (who only uses her first name) said, “The attack was a result of dispute between two travel agencies — one based in Delhi and another in UP — over who would ply on the route. We have arrested 11 people and sent them to jail,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/passengers-attacked-in-fight-between-rival-bus-operators/articleshow/83786749.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra may ask colleges to reduce fees, not charge for unused infra||MUMBAI: In good news for students, colleges across Maharashtra are likely to be asked to reduce fees and stop charging for unutilised infrastructure like libraries and gymnasium. Several such costs were factored in when the fees were decided for the batch currently in college and for the next one too. More importantly, also under review is the plan to merely set fees for the current year, which would be reviewed at the end of the current academic session depending on the severity of the pandemic. Higher education minister Uday Samant, who met the newly appointed fee regulating authority (FRA) on Wednesday, asked the members to consider ways to reduce fees and ensure that “student-friendly” measures are adopted. The members are likely to meet again soon to discuss the way forward. The FRA is likely to release a circular asking colleges to re-work their accounts and merely charge the costs they are incurring from students and subtract expenses like development charges and computer lab fees. When a college submits its accounts to FRA, which approves the fees chargeable to students, there are a total of 153 heads under which the entire student-related expenditure is claimed. That apart, there is a residuary head titled ‘any other expenses’. “We want to find a balance between what can and should be charged by colleges. While we will have a no-compromise attitude, we will also make sure that neither students nor colleges suffer,” said advocate Dharam Mishra. “Keeping the four corners of the law as our boundary, we will try to solve the fee issue; we will not permit colleges to profiteer,” said Manoj Chandak, another FRA member. However, there is an issue that poses a legal challenge: The fee once decided by the FRA cannot be revised by the same body. The FRA Act, 2015, does not have a provision to allow revision of fee—a hike or reduction. “However, several students have submitted letters regarding the fact that the current fee is not justified for online education. We have to work towards solving these issues,” said a member. “Also, the fees are decided on the audited balance sheet of the previous year and the projected expenses of the next year. Hence, we will have to look at how we can alter the fees for the 2019 and 2020 batches in a way that the decis-ion can stand on legal groun-ds too,” said another member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-may-ask-colleges-to-reduce-fees-not-charge-for-unused-infra/articleshow/83795420.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Delhi||Covid the party pooper brings Delhi's Hauz Khas Village to its knees||NEW DELHI: The lockdowns and restrictions forced by Covid-19 since March last year have proved a party pooper for tony Hauz Khas Village, the popular carousing hotspot. The lanes lined with boutique shops are deserted and many of the quirkily named eateries and stores now have ‘To Let’ signs in the windows. The energy that made the place so youthful and lively has given way to a burdened air of hopelessness. The local market association claimed most store owners aren’t able to pay rents and staff salaries, repay loans or meet other expenses. Satinder S Sarna, president, Hauz Khas Village Traders’ Association, and a restaurateur, pointed out that the situation was so dire that only six of the 40 major eateries and restaurants there have attempted to resume business. “While there is no official support for the hospitality industry, there is hardly any footfall to talk of,” said Sarna. “Our customers too have obviously faced financial setbacks, with a large percentage of the middle class now finding excursions to places like Hauz Khas Village unaffordable.” TimesViewThe sad state of the once-bustling area underlines the damaging effect of long lockdowns on business. The only long-term solution to this problem is to accelerate the pace of vaccination. Only a fully vaccinated country can control Covid-19 and resume normal business in the medium term.The colourful art shops, designer apparel outlets, bric-a-brac sellers and small hangout places now stand empty with boards announcing that these properties are available for rent. Subhash Chand, who runs an antique and collectibles shop, said one shop after another is being vacated. “Most owners have not reopened their shops while others have given up altogether,” he said. “The entire market runs on rented premises. How can people keep paying rent and electricity bills and also meet other expenses when there is no income?” Chand’s shop was open, a rarity on the lane, but customers weren’t around. At the other end of the lane, Dinesh Yadav tried in vain to convince a passer-by to take a break at his eatery. The restaurant worker said, “It has never been this bad in the decade that I have worked here. Most restaurants are unwilling to take the risk of resuming operations. We had a miserly footfall last weekend.” Raja Kushwaha, another restaurant worker, added that only a few young couples arrived now, not families or big groups. “In such circumstances, it is difficult even to recover the day’s operation costs,” he pointed out. Kanchan Prajapati, who has a tobacco business, felt it could take another full year to see the village regain its spirit. Sarna remarked that the businesses at Hauz Khas Village are aware of the situation the city is in and the need to prevent crowds to stop Covid from spreading but, he said, a helping hand had to be extended to the restaurant industry. “We need financial oxygen to even breathe,” Sarna said. “Perhaps the collection of licence fees and other charges can be delayed for some time or charged in instalments.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-the-party-pooper-brings-hauz-khas-village-to-its-knees/articleshow/83793526.cms||Paras Singh
---||Goa||All physical exams by GU called off: CM||Panaji: Following demands from different students’ bodies, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday said that the government has decided to call off all exams under the purview of Goa University which are scheduled to be conducted in the physical mode. He said the decision has been taken to ensure the safety of students due to the Covid pandemic. “In view of the request received from various student organisations and considering the pandemic situation in the state, I discussed the matter regarding the examination with all the concerned officials and Goa University,” Sawant said in a tweet. “It has been decided that no examinations under the purview of Goa University shall be held in physical mode in order to ensure the safety of the students,” he said. While Goa University had said that exams for final year students of graduate programmes would be held online from July 9, the final year exams for postgraduate students were to be conducted in the physical mode from July 1. “The CM has taken the decision based on the pandemic situation and this will be implemented,” said Goa University registrar Radhika Nayak. After the state government cancelled the SSC and HSSC public exams, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) as well as the Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad had demanded that Goa University also follow suit and evaluate students of the final year based on their performance at the previous semesters and on internal marks. Conducting in-person examinations during the ongoing pandemic will put the safety of students at risk, the students’ body had said, also writing to the Goa governor and GU. Goa University had decided to conduct offline examinations, as following consultations it was felt that physical examination is required to ensure quality of the degree granted, which would also help students in their future studies and employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-physical-exams-by-gu-called-off-cm/articleshow/83793557.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Stay-at-home rules less strict in micro containment zones this time||KOLKATA: Some localities that were declared containment zones during the first wave have again been cordoned off as “micro containment zones” during the second wave. However, the nature of containment has changed with new restrictions and relaxations. During a press briefing on Wednesday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that in these micro containment zones, as many people will be inoculated as possible. Rabindrapally at KestopurThree neighbourhoods in Kestopur, Lake Town and Dum Dum have been barricaded following a spurt in Covid cases. But residents are no longer holed up in their homes. They can head to workplaces, markets or other places if none in the family is infected. On the edge of the city, micro containment zones have come up at Kestopur Rabindra Pally near Pragati Sangha club, Radhakrishna Mandir Lane on Bangur Avenue B Block in Lake Town, Bhatenda in Rajarhat-New Town and Shyamnagar Road near Dum Dum Park Bazar. Thirteen other places in North 24 Parganas and 18 places in Howrah have also been included in the list. Containment zones now include only a few houses, less strictures on the entry and exit of people and stress on inoculating non-vaccinated people inside the zones. While there are still police guardrails and cops demarcating the containment zones, gone are the constant police questioning and everyday calls to enquire if family members had stepped out. Cops are instead asking about how many have got themselves tested and the persons who are yet to be vaccinated. “We have tied up with the municipal corporation and have been taking the non-vaccinated residents to the inoculation centres to get them jabbed,” said an officer of Lake Town police station, under which a containment zone has come up around 30-odd houses and standalone buildings at Bangur AvenuContae. Shyamnagar Road resident, Subho Das, who works at a private firm and has been heading to work since it reopened last week, said that unlike last year, the containment norms are much more lenient this time. “Residents inside containment zones are allowed to go to work and even move outside the containment zone to fetch essentials and necessary items,” he added. Debopriya Chakraborty, a resident of a high-rise at Rabindra Pally in Kestopur, where a containment zone has been set up barricading a cluster of around 10 houses, said, “A school teacher in our building died of Covid-19 shortly after returning from poll duty. A week later his wife died. Over the next few days, the entire family was affected and so were many people in our building and neighbourhood. We are still safe but since my husband has to head out to work, we are spending tense hours every day.” A few rules, though, have remained the same. Shops inside the enclosed area have been asked to stay closed while outsiders may still have to face a few questions with a warning to take protection and step out as soon as work is over. In the city, KMC has hinted several areas in south are under the scanner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/stay-at-home-rules-less-strict-in-micro-c-zones-this-time/articleshow/83791352.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

On Wednesday, RPF stated they have arrested eight persons including four booking clerks so far. RPF learnt about the Tatkal booking scam in April this year. It found out that small railway stations like Talala, Sasan-Gir, Visavadar and Damnagar were making a daily income of Rs 1 lakh amid the pandemic which was at its peak in April. Tickets were being issued to passengers from Ahmedabad and Surat. Railway police discovered two Tatkal tickets — one for Ahmedabad-Lucknow and another for Surat-Muzaffarpur — were issued from Talala station booking office. “We sent our team and asked the two passengers how they got the tickets. They revealed the names of their agents who we arrested and managed to unravel the entire scam,” Uday Bhan Singh, police sub inspector, RPF, told media persons in Veraval on Wednesday. RPF have arrested four booking clerks including Sandeep Agrawat of Sasan-Gir station, Manish Shrivastav of Talala station, Nitin Damania of Visavadar station and Shivkrupal Paswan of Damnagar station. “Three clerks had opened bank accounts in their wives’ names and the amount they received from black marketing of tickets were deposited in these bank accounts. Manish Srivastav had opened a bank account in the name of Sanjay Hariyani but gave his own mobile number and was operating the account himself,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/eight-arrested-for-railway-ticket-scam/articleshow/83789094.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ICMR studying vaccine efficacy against fresh Delta-plus variant||PUNE/MUMBAI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is currently examining the efficacy of the current vaccines on the emerging Delta-plus variant of Covid-19. The union health ministry classified it as a variant of concern on Tuesday.  ICMR scientist Dr Samiran Panda said they are closely monitoring the neutralization capability of the serum of Covid vaccine recipients against Delta-plus variants which have been obtained from different sites. He said the results should be out in a few weeks. “We are examining samples obtained from different places to assess if they get neutralized by serum of the Covid-19 vaccine recipients. Let’s hope that the vaccine effectiveness for this variant will continue,” he told TOI.  He further added that states should observe strict containment around clusters identified with the Delta-plus variant, ensure treatment of those infected, quarantine for the contacts and engage communities to address vaccine hesitancy. As part of surveillance, the state has created ten sentinel sites, including five laboratories and tertiary care hospitals, from where samples are being randomly sent for analysis. JJ Hospital been selected as the nodal centre from Mumbai. In the coming few weeks, over 100 samples will be sent from districts to CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) laboratory in New Delhi. Virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI that so far, all variants of concern are neutralized by antibodies induced by infection by the “founder variant” that caused the first wave. “Therefore, Delta-plus can be predicted to be protected by immunity induced by all vaccines,” he said. “Delta Plus should remain on the radar -- to avoid the blunder we made with Delta, detected in December 2020 which was not followed up for a while and came as the second wave.” He said there was no need for anxiety. “After all, we are calling all of these as variants and not as ‘strains’.” The Centre on Tuesday directed Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala to focus on containment measures and increase contact tracing in the affected districts. Maharashtra, which already has 21 cases, has issued guidelines for the affected districts, said state director of health services Dr Archana Patil.  Maharashtra COVID-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi on Wednesday said there is need for better genomic surveillance on vaccine breakthrough infections. and that is being carried out currently.

The petition said that secretary education, R Meenakshi Sundaram.Sundaram overruled education minister, Arvind Pandey, state technical committee and even Centre’s guidelines to favour a Chennai- based private company named M/S I Cube Group which provided “obsolete technology” to over 700 schools of Uttarakhand where over two lakh students study. The PIL filed by activist and AAP leader Ravindra Jugran has demanded that the state should be directed to cancel the smart class model and an inquiry should be conducted against the senior officials of the education department as well as the private company. The petition alleged that under the Information Communication Technology Scheme, the Centre provides 90% of the funds to replace smart classrooms with virtual classrooms – a more technologically advanced way of learning. It alleged that in December 2019, Sundaram approved the work of setting up smart classes by Central Electronics Limited (CEL) “without prior vetting and approval from the state expenditure-finance committee as provided under Uttarakhand procurement rules 2017”. A month later, the Information Technology Development Agency (ITDA), the IT department of state government, rejected the proposal and directed that the project of setting up ‘smart classes’ be replaced with ‘virtual classes’ keeping in mind the latest technology and students/teachers’ interest. A few days later, Sundaram wrote to the ITDA requesting it to reconsider its decision, citing a letter from CM that emphasised integration of smart and virtual classes. Pandey also wrote to Nishank yet again and the Centre finally came up with a corrigendum, especially for Uttarakhand, approving the conversion of smart classes to virtual class.

Most of the residents of the township, while speaking to TOI, said that the issue of tenants coming up to stay in the housing complexes is one of the most important aspects which need to be thoroughly dealt with. “There should be a continuous surveillance system in place. A committee may be formed comprising of around seven RWAs from each Action Areas which would also include officials from the local police, Hidco and NKDA. There should be a meeting at least once in every two months to review the law and order situation and all unusual things happening in any block, housing and gated communities should be brought to the notice of committee members for redressal,” said Alakai block cultural and welfare association (consisting of New Town AL, AK and AI blocks) general secretary Anjan Sarkar. “Tenants come to stay in the housing complexes either directly or through brokers. There must be proper verification by the police as to who are coming to stay as tenants,” said Alaktika housing complex president Swapan Biswas. “During agreement between a housing society and a tenant, the local broker who is introducing the tenant should also be tagged in the agreement for police verification. All housing societies should install CCTVs in their complexes,” said Sunrise Point housing complex secretary Gobinda Biswas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-residents-want-cop-verification-of-tenants/articleshow/83791384.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Persons who test positive on the rapid antigen test will be isolated at the border itself. Sawant said that so far, 26 cases of the Delta variant have been confirmed in the state, but no cases of the Delta+ variant. He said that of the samples sent for genome sequencing, 78% were of the Delta variant. The state has intensified screening at the borders since the Delta+ variant has been found in Sindhudurg, the Maharashtra district bordering North Goa. Additionally, Sawant said that the government has granted permission to a private lab to set up at the border. “We have approached three laboratories, and soon, it will be set up,” he said. “If we get suspected cases, we will keep them in isolation and do testing.” Speaking to reporters, Sawant said that the state surveillance unit under the integrated disease surveillance programme has identified four “sensational sites”, and will coordinate with regional genome sequencing labs. The four include Goa Medical College, North Goa district hospital, Victor hospital, and South Goa district hospital. Sawant said that the state government collects samples from these four hospitals for a period of 15 days, and sends them to Pune for testing for the Delta or Delta+ variant. TOI reported on Wednesday that even as the Delta+ variant has been detected in neighboring Maharashtra, Goa continues to be in the dark about whether it has entered the state. Results of 89 samples sent for genome sequencing to a laboratory in Pune are still awaited. The proposed independent virology laboratory at GMC will take another month to become functional, a health official said. In April, health minister Vishwajit Rane had announced that since the NIV did not return sample results in time, the state would have its own facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-asks-pvt-labs-to-start-testing-at-borders/articleshow/83793596.cms||---

The incident happened at an ATM at Jagtap Chowk on Shivarkar Road in Wanowrie on June 7. The accused allegedly stole the PIN, replaced the complainant’s debit card with an inoperative one and used the card to purchase a gold ring worth Rs 50,000 and to withdraw Rs 80,000 from different ATMs. Assistant inspector Jaywant Jadhav from Wanowrie police station said, “The retired policemen Madhav Dhaigude from Handewadi Road and his son had visited the ATM at Jagtap Chowk but the fraudster told them the machine was not functioning and advised them to visit another kiosk to withdraw cash.” Jadhav said, “The father and son visited a nearby ATM and withdrew cash worth Rs 10,000. The suspect was standing behind them and stole the PIN. The fraudster diverted Dhaigude’s attention after he received a telephone call from his wife and replaced his debit card with an inoperative one and fled the scene.” “Dhaigude realised that he was cheated after his wife received text messages about the transactions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudster-replaces-retd-srpf-cops-debit-card/articleshow/83791470.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||‘Sour tryst with BSP & Cong, will bond with small parties’||Lucknow: Attacking the ruling BJP over what he described as ‘ghar mein ladai’ (infighting) Samajwadi party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said BJP will defeat BJP in the high stake assembly elections to be held in Uttar Pradesh early next year. On the issue of the impact of Modi factor in UP elections, Akhilesh said ‘Dilli wale log’ (BJP leaders in Delhi) are no longer being acknowledged in UP. On the issue of any possible alliance with the Congress or the BSP, Akhilesh said he has had some ‘unpleasant’ experiences after he entered into an alliance with the two parties in the past, hence he has decided to side with smaller parties only. Describing the infighting within the BJP as a result of a similar ‘ladai’ (fight) that the party had orchestrated earlier in another family, Akhilesh, in an interview to NDTV, said now the same thing is happening with the BJP. Asked to comment on the impact of Modi factor in the UP elections, the former UP CM said: “Dilli se ek bahut hi anubhavi adhikari bheje gaye the …. woh shayad UP ko vikas ke raste par laate … Dilli wale log usko mantri nahi banwa paye …. unke kehne se vote kaun dega (Leaders in Delhi had sent an experienced retired bureaucrat … he could have put UP on road to development … but the leaders in Delhi were unable to get him a ministerial berth … how will they influence the voters),” Akhilesh said. About claims of the government that everything was on track in UP and the government handled the second wave of Coronavirus effectively, Akhilesh said in the past one month there has been only infighting within the BJP. “Main ye janana chahta hoon ki pichle ek mahine mein inke ghar pe kitna jhagra ho raha hai … aur is liye ghar mein jhagra ho raha hai … kahbi inhon ne doosron ke ghar mein jhagra karwaya tha … ye doosron ke ghar mein jhagra karane wale ke apne ghar mein jhagra ho gaya (I want to know why is there so much infighting within the party since last one month? It is because they have also orchestrated a similar crisis in another party),” Akhilesh said in an apparent reference to the rift within the Yadav Pariwar in the run-up to the 2017 assembly elections which eventually ended up in a split with Akhilesh taking over the control of the party and uncle Shivpal floating a separate political outfit. Akhilesh went on to add that in Uttar Pradesh elections the BJP will defeat the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sour-tryst-with-bsp-cong-will-bond-with-small-parties/articleshow/83793651.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Twice sold minor finally breaks free||PALANPUR: Minor girl who was sold off twice — once at 13 years and then at 14 — by her father and maternal uncle in the garb of marriage could finally break free from the vicious cycle of agony that she had landed in. It could happen because the 17-year-old girl could call up Abhayam helpline in Palanpur last week. Abhayam finally rescued the minor around four to five days back and took her paternal uncle’s house at Dantiwada, some 15km from Palanpur. “The girl was brought from Dantiwada on Wednesday to Palanpur and is being given shelter in the Nari Sanrakshan Kendra,” Aniket Thakar, CWC chairman told TOI. In her statement recorded with the CWC, the girl said that her mother had deserted when she was a child. Her father along with maternal uncle kept selling her on the pretext of marriage. She was first sold for Rs 60,000 by her father to a man who raped her repeatedly. She was later retrieved by her maternal uncle and a year later he too sold her off once again for a similar amount to another 35-year-old man. Here, she stayed for nearly three years but the torture was unending as she was subjected to repeated sexual assaults. “I have written a letter to the police as well as other agencies to look into the matter. This is a crime not just against the girl but humanity at large. Both the uncle and her father, besides all those connected with the trafficking should be given a deserving punishment,” Thakar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/twice-sold-minor-finally-breaks-free/articleshow/83789196.cms||---
---||Goa||‘Faith, science go together’: Priests queue up for the jab in Goa||PANAJI: Catholic priests in Goa, whether diocesan or religious, are leading by example and getting vaccinated, paving the way for the faithful to follow. “I took the vaccine the moment the announcement was made that it was available for the under-60 age group,” said Fr Eugene D’Silva, rector of the seminary of the Redemptorist fathers in Varca. “One of our members, an 81-year-old with heart ailment who underwent bypass surgery in the past also took it. We have encouraged all our students too, now that it's available for everyone above 18.” The Catholic church hasn’t put any blocks to taking the vaccine, with Pope Francis and Oswald Cardinal Gracias also having received the jab. “The Church is not against the vaccine. Faith and science always go together,” said D’Silva. “The Church and faith need science, and we cannot rely on miracles alone. The Church believes that science is ultimately God’s work, and God has given wisdom to people to make the earth a better place. Science and the Church have to work together for the betterment of humanity.” He said that it’s important to appreciate the work of scientists, and that “we have a responsibility to protect not only ourselves but others too”, adding, “a person does a disservice to humanity by refusing to take the vaccine”. In Mapusa, principal of St Britto’s high school, Fr Simon D’Mello, has also taken his first jab and is awaiting the second. “We believe that God himself has given us the vaccine for protection, and he has to do this through humans,” he says, specifically addressing Catholics who are reluctant to get vaccinated. “He has given people the intelligence and wisdom to take care of their own lives. We believe that vaccines that have come out within such a short period of time are a miracle. If people are waiting for God, He is already telling them that the vaccine is here, and to protect yourselves.” During the second wave, government statistics revealed that a majority of mortalities were among those who weren’t vaccinated despite many falling in the eligible category. Although people cannot be forced to get vaccinated, the superior at Carmelite Monastery, Margao, Fr Sylvestre D’Souza, said that God has given people the responsibility to look after themselves. “We believe everything, even medicine, is a gift from God,” he told TOI. “We must do whatever is possible and God-given to protect ourselves, and leave the rest to God. The scriptures too praise medicine as a gift from God. We must be thankful to God for all these means, and use them to the best of our ability.” In Assolna, parish priest Fr Sertorio Rodrigues, who is diabetic, has gone a step further to tackle vaccine hesitancy, working together with parish council members, volunteers and the panchayat to get as many persons vaccinated and protected as possible. “God has given us the means of this vaccine so that the pandemic can be wiped off,” he said. “It’s better to stay safe. We must put our trust in God, but at the same time, we cannot be jumping into the river saying God will protect us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/faith-science-go-together-priests-queue-up-for-the-jab/articleshow/83793630.cms||Lisa Monteiro

According to the police, the boy developed a fancy for the two-wheelers after he joined junior college. He belongs to a middle-class family and his father works with a private company. The police said that he would use a key to open the handle locks of the two-wheelers then add or delete a number on the two-wheeler before riding it on city roads. The boy would leave the two-wheelers by the roadside when the vehicle would run out of fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teen-detained-over-theft-of-two-wheelers-for-joy-ride/articleshow/83791526.cms||---

With 3,35,544 doses administered during the day till last reports came in, this was also the highest number of doses administered in a day in June. Health officials said that with the supply of vaccine having slightly escalated the state is in a position to scale up operations to a certain extent. “We have achieved another milestone of two crore doses. Wednesday was also the third consecutive day when we achieved the target of 3 lakh doses daily,” said the director of health services, Ajay Chakraborty, The inoculation drive began at a slow pace on January 16 due to vaccine hesitancy among people, even healthcare workers and the Co-Win technical glitches. The scene changed in a couple of weeks with eminent and senior doctors taking the jab. “It took 120 days for us to achieve the first one crore jab mark. But the second one crore happened in 39 days,” said state family welfare officer, Ashim Das Malakar. The state government is expecting to get an additional 10 lakh doses by June end and target 3 lakh doses daily.

---||Mumbai||‘Mindless’ notice to Parel society over parking, BMC gets HC rap||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has slammed the BMC for issuing a demolition notice over parking issues at a Parel highrise, asking if it intends to raze the parking podium and make the building collapse. “If the parking podium is to be demolished, the building will come down,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni on Tuesday. It was hearing a petition by Kinjal Villa Co-operative Housing Society comprising stilt plus 1-4 floors of parking and 5-18 floors of 47 flats. After the building was issued the occupation certificate (OC) in 2013, flat-purchasers moved in and formed the housing society. In 2018, BMC’s executive engineer (of the F-south ward) issued a notice under section 53 of the Maharashtra Regional & Town Planning Act, for removal of unauthorised development and listed unauthorised parking on the ground floor, two-wheeler parking in the car park on the podium, no visitors parking and no rainwater harvesting as per OC conditions. “The petitioner is a cooperative housing society and the issue of parking of vehicles is an internal matter of the society,” its petition said, adding that it cannot be held liable for alleged non-compliances of the developer. The society took remedial measures, asking residents not to park two-wheelers at the ground and podium levels, providing visitor parking and installed a rainwater harvesting system. Without verifying these compliances, a final order was issued on February 18, 2021 “to remove/ demolish/ restore the notice work” within seven days, failing which the BMC said that it would demolish it. The society’s advocate, Sharmila Deshmukh, argued that section 53 is invoked for unauthorised development or change of use of land and none of the works listed in the notice come under it. Also, a stereotype order has been passed without verifying if any unauthorised development has taken place. The judges said that the civic body’s action appears to be vindictive. “Will you [BMC] take action against the officer or we’ll take action...?” said justice Kulkarni. The BMC’s advocate sought time to take instructions and undertook that no demolition would be done till the next hearing. “Prima facie, the impugned order suffers from non-application of mind”, the judges said in the order. On Thursday the judges will consider granting interim relief to the cooperative housing society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mindless-notice-to-parel-soc-over-parking-bmc-gets-hc-rap/articleshow/83795488.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Dust from Rajasthan ends clean-air spell||New Delhi: After enjoying a clean spell of air, Delhi’s air quality slipped into the “poor” category on Wednesday with the overall air quality index (AQI) touching 218. Transportation of dust from Rajasthan to Delhi and slow wind speed led to the deterioration. Experts say PM10 is the predominant pollutant due to dust-raising winds sweeping from the arid region to the city. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at India Meteorological Department and head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “The dust-raising winds from the Rajasthan side have led to an increase in dust particles in the air. The wind direction has changed to northwesterly. Besides, the low wind speed has affected dispersion of pollutants.” Delhi’s AQI was “satisfactory” at 84 on Monday but deteriorated to “moderate” on Tuesday with a reading of 127. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting body, “Although ventilation is favourable for dispersion, an increase in long-range transport of dust is likely for the next three days.” SAFAR has predicted that AQI may stay “moderate” with PM10 as the lead pollutant during this period. AQI may even turn “poor” for a brief period. Meanwhile, the city recorded another hot and humid day as the maximum temperature increased to 40.5 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, on Wednesday at the Safdarjung observatory, city’s base station. Pitampura remained the hottest station at 42 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was 28 degrees Celsius. The relative humidity oscillated between 77% and 31%. A Met official said the maximum temperature might hover around 40-41 degrees Celsius on Thursday but was likely to drop slightly on Friday. There is a possibility of very light rain or thundershowers on Friday and Saturday. Gusty winds at the speed of 30-40 kmph may sweep the city on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dust-from-rajasthan-ends-clean-air-spell/articleshow/83793692.cms||---

Residents of the building, who live here on rent, had been demanding that the Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), which owns the residential colony, should ensure its maintenance. Soon after the collapse, the news spread that several persons had been buried under the debris. Cabinet minister Brijesh Pathak, district magistrate Abhishek Prakash and municipal commissioner AK Dwivedi reached the spot. A police team, along with SDRF personnel, started rescue operations. The deceased, Gaurav Dwivedi of Rae Bareli, was living with his uncle, Gyani Trivedi, to pursue his studies from Shri Jai Narain (KKC) College. He was also working with a private telecom company. The building, known as Gomti Sadan built in 1952, houses 25 other families. Other apartments are also in a bad shape. As LMC was not carrying out repair and maintenance work, Gyani Trivedi had demanded that LMC should allow residents to ensure the upkeep on their own and had also staged a dharna in this connection. However, his pleas fell on deaf ears. Executive engineer, Lucknow Municipal Corporation, AP Tiwari said, “Top two floors of the building were vacant. Rainwater had accumulated there in the last few weeks which had weakened the top floors of the building resulting in the collapse.” A communique, issued by the municipal commissioner’s office, said the civic body would conduct a quality check of other buildings in River Bank Colony and demolish the dilapidated ones. ACP (Chowk) IP Singh, who was the first to reach the spot with with SDRF inspector Chandrashekar, told TOI: “Gyani and Gaurav were sleeping in the flat when the roof caved in and they were buried under the debris. We got information at 6.56am about the incident and a team comprising 26 personnel and a dog squad reached the spot for rescue and rehabilitation. The operation lasted 86 minutes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1-killed-as-dilapidated-building-collapses-in-river-bank-colony/articleshow/83793688.cms||---

Police have also been asked to alert the agencies to keep watch on any wire sticking out. In recent years, multiple deaths have been reported in the city owing to electrocution. This year, too, there have been three deaths, two of them in areas serviced by CESC and one by WBSEDCL. According to KMC, borough level electrical engineers have been assigned the task of checking out lamp-posts and kiosks that supply power to streetlights in localities that get inundated during monsoon. These include Cossipore, Belgachia, Amherst Street, Thanthania, CR Avenue, Burrabazar, BBD Bag, Bhowanipore, Alipore, areas off EM Bypass, Jadavpur, Behala, Garden Reach and Kidderpore. There are around 2.5 lakh lamp posts in the city of which around 2 lakh are maintained by KMC and the rest by PWD and KMDA. CESC officials said it was checking all distribution boxes on pavements to see if the height needed to be raised or if they need to be repaired or replaced. In peripheral areas where the distribution line is overhead, CESC engineers are checking if there are any tree branches that pose a threat to the network and safety. “We are also conducting public miking and sending SMS to consumers on the issue,” said CESC vice-president (distribution) Avijit Ghosh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-cesc-start-audits-on-electrical-installations/articleshow/83791540.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Jaishankar emphasised the importance of open supply chains, specially in the middle of the pandemic. He said to scale up vaccine production to meet the challenge of inoculating the world, Europe needed to keep open supply chains as well as consider a waiver of patents as proposed by India and South Africa at the WTO. Without "dramatically" scaling up production, the world would not be able to deal with the challenges of today, he said. This has been a recurring message India has put out in the world. On Tuesday, addressing an economic forum in Qatar, Jaishankar said about components for vaccines: "A lot of it comes from Europe as well. So, ...the US and Europe need to step forward if India has to ramp up its production... Patents are one part of it, but production is the other part..."

Madan said all the poll staffers involved in the by-election process have to take at lease one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Polling would be conducted for 70 seats in five the Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur zilla parishads and 130 seats in the 33 panchayat samitis in the districts. The bypolls were necessitated by the March 4 order of the Supreme Court quashing the Other Backward Class (OBC) reservation in the local bodies. The state election commissioner said a close watch would be kept on case positivity rate in the districts. “We have not announced the by-polls in Palghar due to rise in cases. If there is any rise in cases in the districts where the by-elections are scheduled, we will intervene,” Madan said. “Besides the other Covid protocols that have to be followed during elections, this additional clause (cap on 50 people) has been put to avoid any unnecessary gathering. We will also closely monitor that each staff selected for the by-poll duty gets at least one dose of the vaccine,” he said. During the assembly by-polls in April, reports related to violations of Covid protocols were galore. The state election commissioner said they wanted to take utmost care during the coming by-polls. “The five-level unlock measures are in place the state has issued guidelines. These guidelines to have to be strictly followed and additional caution is a must during the poll process,” Madan said, Experts have said elections should not be conducted, especially amid the threat of a third wave of the pandemic. “The districts where the by-polls are being held may be in ‘level one’ now. But one cannot rule out the possibility of these districts will be affected by gatherings,” an expert said on the condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sec-to-allow-only-50-people-for-july-by-poll-campaign-meetings/articleshow/83791576.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Mumbai||Of 49 lakh doses given in Mumbai, 66 lead to adverse events||MUMBAI: Of 49lakh Covid-19 vaccinations in the city, there have been 66 severe and serious adverse events following immunization (AEFI) since the drive started. Of these cases, 24 have led to fatalities (a probability of 0.0000048%) though none have been directly linked with vaccination. Most of the deaths were found to be coincidental and in people above 50 years with underlying health problems. AEFIs are classified as minor, severe and serious medical events that occur within 28 days of immunization. According to BMC data, 993 adverse events have been reported in the past five months, of which 927 were minor and 31 severe which required hospitalisation for a brief period. There are 35 serious adverse events also listed which include 24 deaths and nine cases of paralysis, weakness or prolonged hospitalisation. It shows less than five deaths per million vaccinations in Mumbai, said an official, adding that it should put all fears about vaccine safety to rest. Of the 24 deaths, one was of a 33-year-old. Rest were people above 50 years of which a significant number was over 60 years. Four of the deceased were women and 20 were men, though gender disparity could be explained by the fact that 4.5lakh more men have taken the vaccine compared to women in Mumbai. Two deaths were of Covaxin recipients and 22 of those who took Covishield, a disparity in keeping with the fact that of 49 lakh doses, over 44.5lakh administered were of Covishield. “It is reassuring that there is not a single death because of vaccination per se. Deaths occurred in people who had underlying health conditions, comorbidities, and vaccination was largely coincidental,” said Dr Mukesh Agarwal, who heads BMC’s AEFI committee. Hypertension, diabetes, obesity were some common comorbidities seen. Four of the deceased had tested positive within 3-4 days of vaccination and the deaths could have been due to complications of Covid, another doctor said. Mumbai’s AEFI audit panel found that 14 of 24 deaths were co-incidental, meaning a clear cause for death other than vaccination was found. Two were attributed to ‘indeterminate reactions’ while postmortem results for 8 are yet to arrive. Indeterminate reaction means the deaths occurred soon after immunization but there was no definitive evidence to link it to vaccines. A doctor said no cases of thromboembolic event linked to the vaccine have been found. After incidents of stroke post vaccination with Covishield were reported, the national AEFI panel recently revealed there was a miniscule but definitive risk of thromboembolic events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-of-49l-doses-given-in-city-66-lead-to-adverse-events/articleshow/83793764.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: CBSE evaluation formula unfair to meritorious students, academicians||LUCKNOW: Many academicians have expressed dissatisfaction over the evaluation formula finalized by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for the assessment of Class 12 students and said the decision to cancel the examination should be reconsidered. Many experts termed the formula as “cumbersome and unfair to meritorious students”, while others supported it saying it is accurate, scientific and best decision that the Board could have taken at the time of Covid-19 pandemic. According to CBSE’s ‘30:30:40 formula’ — weightage of 30% will be given to Class 10 board marks, 30% to performance in Class 11 examination, and 40% to Class 12 assessment for tabulation of Class 12 results. Founder manager of Lucknow Public School and Colleges, SP Singh, said: “I am not satisfied with the suggested formula. Its biggest drawback is that it will demotivate students as possibilities of scoring perfect 100% or 99% will be less as all students – be it very hardworking, good or average – will score average marks.” He said the formula would also increase the chances of corruption in awarding marks. Coordinator of CBSE, Lucknow, Jawaid Alam Khan said, “The formula suggested by CBSE is complex and requires intensive work to compile marks since students change boards after Class 10 and marksheets of all the boards do not show practical and theory marks separately. It’s very difficult to compile results and students indeed could have performed better had they taken the examination.” He said the only ray of hope was the option given to students to appear in physical examination if not satisfied with marks. President of the Unaided Private School Association Anil Agarwal said, “It’s unfair to award 60% of the marks on the basis of Class 10 and 11 and just 40% on Class 12 performance. A student who scores even 99% marks in Class 10 is not able to score even 90% in Class 12 Pre-Board or internal assessment as strict marking is done so that students work harder and perform better in boards.” “If CBSE is giving the option to students to appear for the physical Board examination later if not satisfied with the marks, then why not conduct exams beforehand. If not all, one examination of core paper and one of the languages can be conducted,” he added. However, director of SKD Academy, Manish Singh, welcomed the formula. “It is scientific and accurate and has been formulated in the interest of students.” “The evaluation policy appears fair and balanced. This is the best the board could have done,” said chairman of GD Goenka Public School, Sarvesh Goel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cbse-evaluation-formula-unfair-to-meritorious-students-academicians/articleshow/83793732.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Rajkot: Protests over arrest for lynching of woman beater||RAJKOT: Eight people were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly lynching a man from Navi Dharampur village in Morbi district. However, soon after the arrest of the eight men, women from the village held protest outside the police station demanding their release. The women claimed that the deceased Bharat Parmar (31) and his aide Jagdish Thakor, who was also beaten up by the accused, used to harass them often.Those arrested include Jadav Vadecha (55), Bechar Bharvad (33), Shailesh Bharvad (29), Mahipat Upsariya (36), Sanjay Upsariya (30), Baldev Upsariya (30), Shiva Koli (65), and Ramesh Koli (30). On Tuesday, a heavily drunk Parmar, who chased a woman shopkeeper and thrashed her with a stick, died allegedly after being beaten up by a group of villagers on Monday. Parmar and Thakor, both autorickshaw drivers in Navi Dharampur village, had gone to the provision store of Chandrika Goswami, in an extremely inebriated condition and started forcing her to close the shop. When Goswami asked them to leave, the duo started hurling abuses at her. Bharat picked up a stick and chased her as she tried to save herself from the assault. The video of Parmar and Thakor chasing Goswami went viral on social media. In the video, Parmar is seen thrashing Goswami with a stick even as other villagers tried to stop him. After the video started circulating in the village, some locals went to the houses of the duo and beat them up with iron pipes and other blunt weapons. Both were taken to the Morbi Civil Hospital where Parmar again created some ruckus. He was taken to the police station but as his condition worsened, he was taken back to the hospital where he succumbed. Thakor, who suffered five fractures, is under treatment at Rajkot Civil Hospital and is said to be out of danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/protests-over-arrest-for-lynching-of-woman-beater/articleshow/83789266.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Presidency University UG entrance test dates remain unchanged||KOLKATA: Admission tests to undergraduate courses at Presidency University would be held on August 7 and 8, as scheduled, chairman of West Bengal Joint Entrance Examinations Board (WBJEEB) confirmed on Wednesday. WBJEEB conducts the Presidency entrance tests. After St Xavier’s University, Presidency will be the second university in Bengal to announce that admissions will be conducted through entrance tests after the board exams were cancelled due to the pandemic. Calcutta University and Jadavpur University are yet to announce the methods they will follow for admissions. At Presidency, after the UG admission tests on August 7 and 8, the entrance exams for post-graduate courses will be conducted on August 14. The results are expected to be announced by the end of August. “The entrance examination for UG and PG courses at Presidency University will be held as scheduled. There will be no change,” chairman of the board Malayendu Saha told reporters. A total of 20,000 students have applied for UG and PG courses. Ever since the boards and councils—state and all-India—called off their respective Class XII exams to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, vice-chancellors and principals have been apprehensive about the method to be followed for UG admissions. Many principals even questioned the formulae that the boards have framed to evaluate Class XII candidates as they felt the marks might not reflect the students’ aptitude for subjects they would apply for even though they might have the cut-off scores. “It was important to conduct the UG admission tests this time to understand the students’ aptitude for the subjects they are applying for. Class XII results form a strong basis for admission but this time, the marks may not reflect the actual merit,” said a Presidency official. Admissions last year spelled a lot of confusion owing to the calculations for cancelled papers and the absence of admission tests. The process had dragged on till January this year as many students, after scoring high, had secured seats in various subjects but ultimately did not take admission there. “We want to avoid a repetition of last year’s situation. Admission tests will help us identify the meritorious and interested candidates,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/presi-ug-entrance-test-dates-remain-unchanged/articleshow/83791541.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Increase 18+ vax quota or stock more doses at civic centres, says Corporators||MUMBAI: As the BMC opened up vaccination against Covid-19 for those aged above 18 years on Wednesday, corporators pointed to the need to increase doses reserved for the category. Goregaon corporator Sandeep Patel said in his ward, the centre at Motilal Nagar saw many aged above 18 from the unorganised sector turn up for shots. “There is an urgent need to increase the vaccine quota for local centres. Currently, we have been getting around 200 doses daily. Not everyone can afford a shot at a private centre and hence it is important that they are able to get it from civic centres,” said Patel. Several ward level centres, on an average, have been receiving 200-300 doses daily, out of which 50% is kept reserved for those in the 18-plus category and the rest for those above 45 years. Corporators said it is important to reserve a larger number for those in the 18-plus category or increase the number of doses which ward level centres are being given daily. South Mumbai BJP corporator Atul Shah said, “The response was overwhelming on Wednesday. Hence, for the 18-plus category, for the initial days at least, the BMC should allow vaccination only through online registration. Most youngsters are tech savvy and would be able to book a slot. However later, once the rush settles offline, walk-in can be allowed. At the same time, it also important that the number of doses be increased to ease the crowds which have started building up again,” said Shah. Corporators said they are finding that many above 45 years have already taken their first shot and are not due for the second dose yet and hence there is a need to now focus on ensuring more doses are made available for the 18-plus bracket. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda, though, said they cannot afford to reduce the number of doses for those in the 45-plus category as many may be due for their second shot. “Therefore, it would be better to increase the overall number of doses.” Some corporators said many a times people who book online do not turn up and yet the BMC does not allow these doses to be administered for walk-ins. “So neither the dose is used for whom it was reserved nor for a person available at the site. The BMC should look at these issues and allow it to be diverted,” said Nehal Shah, Matunga corporator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-increase-18-vax-quota-or-stock-more-doses-at-civic-centres-says-corporators/articleshow/83788026.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Despite lockdown in Delhi, PM2.5 as high as two years ago||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s pollution levels between March and May this year were almost the same as the pollution levels during the same period in 2019, despite the city being in full lockdown for over a month in 2021, data analysed by a climate communications initiative, Climate Trends, reveals. Track the pollution level in your cityWhile the levels were much lower in 2020, when there was also a full lockdown, the average PM2.5 levels this year were 95 micrograms per cubic metre — almost the same as 95.7ug/m3 recorded in 2019. The analysis also shows despite lockdowns, the pollution levels in both Delhi and Lucknow were above permissible limits, highlighting high background emissions. The other cities analysed included Mumbai where the average PM2.5 concentration has only increased year on year during March, April and May from 2019 to 2021. Kolkata was the only city to show improvement in the air quality during this period. Researchers compared Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s air quality data for Delhi, Lucknow, Mumbai and Kolkata over March, April and May in 2019 when there was no lockdown, and 2020 and 2021, when there was complete lockdown. Mumbai’s average concentration of PM2.5 between March and May in 2019 was 21.6ug/m3 that increased to 31.3 in 2020 and then to 40.3 in 2021. The safe limit for PM2.5 as prescribed by CPCB is 60ug/m3. “Mumbai being a coastal city has a mixed effect of local meteorology and prevalent conditions of large-scale motions, including that of cyclones. While cyclones such as Tauktae act as a washout/cleaning effect on the atmosphere, slow wind conditions, favourable conditions of long transport of particulate matters from neighbouring states act as accumulation, suggesting marginal increase of pollutants,” said professor S K Dhaka of Rajdhani College at Delhi University. Delhi’s average PM2.5 concentration for the three months dipped from 95.6ug/m3 in 2019 to 69 in 2020, but was back to 95ug/m3 in 2021. Kolkata’s PM2.5 concentration swayed from 41.8ug/m3 in 2019 to 27.9 in 2020 and 37.3 in 2021. While there was a complete lockdown in 2020, the 2021 lockdown saw high movement of people due to the assembly elections. G C Kisku, chief scientist of environmental toxicology at CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, said, “The partial/complete lockdowns lowered vehicular movement and subsequently led to reduced consumption of fossil fuels. Closure of industrial establishments during lockdown periods also added to it. But the levels are still relatively higher this year.” The good thing is, he added, there has been a decreasing trend in PM10 levels from 2017, though the observed levels of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 at all locations this year were relatively higher compared to the previous year. CSIR also recently released a report on the assessment of ambient air quality of Lucknow that showed that the mean levels of PM10 (127.1g/m3) and PM2.5 (64.5g/m3) at all monitoring locations in residential, commercial and industrial areas from April-May 2021 were higher than permissible limits. Any relief from lockdown-resultant pollution levels cannot be rejoiced, feel experts. “Lockdown-related reduction in air pollution is neither consistent nor uniform. The contribution of anthropogenic activities do not totally explain the high pollution level. Thus, we should stay alert about the continuing health hazards of high pollutant levels, especially in metropolitan cities,” said Arun Sharma, president of Society for Indoor Environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/despite-lockdown-pm2-5-as-high-as-two-years-ago/articleshow/83793790.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The study was published in the medical journal ‘ecancer’ on June 17. TMC director Dr RA Badwe said, “According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, with approximately 70% cases being reported in low and middle income countries (LMIC). India’s cancer scenario is burdened with oral cavity cancer being the most common among men. In fact, India accounted for almost a third of the global incidence in 2020.” “As per the GLOBOCAN statistics, the rate of new cases being diagnosed has increased by a staggering 68% in the past two decades alone, making it a real public health crisis. To add to this, accessibility to health services is low, which coupled with poor health literacy results in a majority of cases presenting with advanced stage disease that is often difficult to treat,” said Dr Badwe adding that approximately 10% of the patients have progressive disease that makes them untreatable and can only be offered supportive care for their symptoms. Most of those who receive some forms of treatment are left unemployed and become an economic burden on their family and friends. Even patients with health insurance and government aid, typically seen as immune to the cost of healthcare, face serious challenges as most of the schemes do not provide the actual amount needed for the treatment. This eventually increases their out-of-pocket expenses, pushing a significant proportion of the patients themselves and their families into a never-ending cycle of debt. To tackle these issues, the officer-in-charge of MPMMCC and HBCH Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi and his team at Tata Memorial Centre set out to conduct a cost of illness analysis that would provide invaluable information for policy makers that make appropriate allocation of resources towards cancer. Dr Chaturvedi claimed that this is the first such study in India and among a handful globally, whose estimates were calculated utilizing a bottom-up approach where data was collected prospectively for each service as it was used. “This ginormous data collection has resulted in determining the direct healthcare costs of treating oral cancer, i.e., the per patient cost borne by a healthcare provider that are directly attributable to treating oral cancer.” Research fellow at Tata Memorial Hospital and the lead author of the study, Dr Arjun Singh, said that the unit cost of treating advanced stages (Rs. 2,02,892) was found to be 42% greater than early stages (Rs. 1,17,135). “At the same time, there was an average reduction of 11% in the unit costs as socio-economic status increased. Medical equipment accounted for 97.8% of capital costs, with the highest contributor being the radiology services that included CT, MRI and PET scan. Variable costs that included consumables for surgery in advanced stages were 1.4 times higher than early stages. With the addition of additional chemo and radiotherapy to surgery, the average cost of treatment increased by 44.6%,” he added. According to the study, about 60-80% of the cases of oral cancer visit their specialist oncologists at advanced stages. Multiplying the cost per unit of early and advanced cancer as per the study’s results, India spent approximately Rs 2,386 crores in 2020 on oral cancer treatment, paid for by insurance schemes, government and private sector spending, out of pocket payments and charitable donations or a combination of these. This is a significant portion of the healthcare budget allocation the government made in 2019-20, towards a single disease. Without any inflation in costs, this will result in an economic burden on the country of Rs 23,724 crore over the next 10 years. This straining economic impact of treating oral cancer treatment, strongly suggests that prevention must be one of the key mitigation strategies for addressing affordability. Almost all oral cancers are caused by some form of tobacco and areca nut use, either direct or as a secondhand intake. It is very important for our country to take adequate measures to curb this menace and mitigate the economic burden caused by just one of the hundreds of diseases caused by tobacco consumption. Dr Chaturvedi said that early detection strategies leading to just 20% reduction in advanced stage disease could save almost 250 crores annually. Physicians, dentists and all healthcare workers are the first line of detection where opportunistic screening of high-risk individuals such as tobacco and areca nut users can be performed. Institutions also play a key role by following up screened patients, actioning tobacco de-addiction strategies and providing timely care and support. He said that Tata Memorial Centre’s efforts can now provide in-depth information on the costs of treating oral cancer that can assist policy makers in planning treatment disbursements more effectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cost-of-oral-cancer-treatment-is-rising-steadily-warns-tata-memorial-centres-study/articleshow/83750160.cms||Binay Singh

The two church heads in the city have got all priests and church workers vaccinated and said that they have kept the churches ready for a possible reopening on July 1. They seek further clarity in the orders that might be issued by the state when present restrictions end on June 30. The Archdiocese of Kolkata — which has 65 Roman Catholic churches under its umbrella — and the Diocese of Kolkata of the Church of North India (CNI) — under which there are 35 churches —will remain shut till June 30, said the two church heads, archbishop Thomas D Souza and bishop Paritosh Canning. They said that the state government orders have not mentioned anything about, “religious congregations” unlike what they did earlier. That is why, they have decided to keep the churches closed till further orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/churches-to-stay-shut-till-month-end/articleshow/83791613.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man falls off train chasing cellphone thief, badly injured||MUMBAI: In yet another instance of a mobile phone robbery on the railways with serious consequences, a 48-year-old commuter landed on the tracks with grievous injuries while chasing a robber on Tuesday. The robbery has occurred at a time when railway travel is permitted only for essential workers. Co-passengers and patrolling policemen managed to nab the accused. In Tuesday’s incident, Devendra Parekh, who is employed with a garments company in south Mumbai and lives in Virar, was travelling in an up slow Churchgate local between 11.30am and 11.45am. Just as the train started to move from Prabhadevi station, a man entered the second-class compartment. “Parekh was seated near the passage. The man grabbed his handset. Parekh fought back but the robber pushed him away and jumped off the moving local,” said senior inspector Mehboob Inamdar, Mumbai Central railway police. Parekh jumped off the train, though it had gathered speed. He could not maintain his balance though and landed on the tracks. Co-passengers saw him fall and alerted two policemen patrolling the platform. The cops chased the accused and nabbed him. He was identified as Gauravkumar Singh (24). Parekh’s phone was recovered from him.  Parekh was taken to Nair Hospital where he underwent treatment for hours for injuries to his knees, shoulder, forehead and lips. He was conscious and recorded his statement with railway police. Police informed his family. “We checked if Singh was booked in the past but found no record. He lives in a chawl at Antop Hill,” said Inamdar. He has been booked under Section 392 of IPC for robbery, other than provisions of the Indian Railways Act that attract life imprisonment. Last month, a Dombivali mother of three, Vidya Patil, back to work after a maternity break, was crushed to death under a local at Kalwa while chasing a phone robber.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-falls-off-train-chasing-cellphone-thief-badly-injured/articleshow/83788106.cms||Nitasha Natu

Police said that the 17-year-old boy called the 21-year-old girl on June 21 night asking her to meet him near her house as her boyfriend wanted to meet her. He told her that her boyfriend had sent him to pick her up. To ensure that the boy was not lying, she asked him to make her talk to her boyfriend, but the boy said that he had already left and her boyfriend’s bike’s tyre had got punctured. The girl believed the accused and left with the minor boy on the bike. On reaching the outskirts of the village, when the boy stopped the bike, she inquired about her boyfriend. The boy told her that he had lied to her and forced himself upon her. Police said that the girl was initially shocked but later she resisted and shouted for help. As she did not succumb, the boy hit her head against a tree nearby and fled leaving her profusely bleeding. The girl somehow managed to reach a house nearby and asked the occupants to call her parents. She was rushed to a government hospital in Dharampur in Valsad and later registered a complaint of abduction, molestation, criminal intimidation and causing grievous hurt at Khergam police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/minor-abducts-molests-friends-gf-detained/articleshow/83788677.cms||---

The terminal station of the city’s Line 2 or the East-West Metro will now be called “Bandhan Bank Salt Lake Sector V Metro Station”. Last October, East-West Metro’s Salt Lake Stadium station was prefixed with Indian Football Association (IFA) and a one year’s renewal agreement was signed between Metro Railway and IFA. Again, on Nov 24, Metro Railway tied up with Bandhan Bank to rev up its non-fare earnings with an endorsement on its smart cards. And now, another station branding has been established, at Salt Lake Sector V Metro station. Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, MD and CEO, Bandhan Bank, said, “We are privileged to partner Metro Railway, Kolkata. This association is another way for us to show our gratitude to the citizens of Kolkata and the commuters of Sector V.” Manoj Joshi, GM, Metro Railway, said, “We are glad to join hands with a home-grown organization for the first of its kind initiative for Indian Railways.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bank-gets-branding-rights-for-metro-stn/articleshow/83791583.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Not first, but second doses fuelling inoculation numbers||VADODARA: While the daily Covid-19 vaccination numbers in the city may seem encouraging since the last couple of days, the fine print reveals that the progress remains sluggish. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is now reaching out to leaders and opinion makers in various parts of the society to ensure the it gains momentum. Data furnished by VMC health officials clearly reveals that the numbers this week have been fuelled largely by people taking the second shot. It was particularly the population in the 18 to 44 age group that was taking the second Covaxin shot that fuelled the numbers. The number of persons taking the first dose has in fact shown a receding trend barring Monday when a major drive was organised. This has been the case despite walk in vaccinations being announced formally and organisations being given the permission to hold vaccination camps. Despite the sluggish vaccination off late, the city has otherwise performed well. Against an adult population of around 15 lakh, the city has already vaccinated 9,13,900 persons with at least one dose of the vaccine. Mayor Keyur Rokadiya who held a meeting with representatives of various traders, business and industry groups said that many of those who remained were reluctant to take the vaccine. “We will be approaching them through various organisations working with them. Right from the association of street vendors to those of industries and those working for different communities like the Baroda Muslim Doctors Association, we are approaching all,” Rokadiya said. He said that vaccine hesitancy did prevail in some classes of the society. “But things have started changing off late. Many who were reluctant are now coming forward. A reason for vaccination slowing down is also that we have already a very healthy vaccination rate and a lesser proportion of the eligible population remains,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/not-first-but-second-doses-fuelling-inoculation-numbers/articleshow/83787109.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Kolkata||West Bengal JEE to be held on July 17, 1st exam in 2nd wave||KOLKATA: The West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board (WBJEEB) has decided to hold the engineering entrance test on July 17, the first public exam after the second Covid wave struck. The WBJEE results are scheduled to be published by August 14 and the three rounds of counselling by September 15. The exam was supposed to be held on July 11 but was postponed owing to Covid case spike. The decision to hold the joint entrance exam comes days after the state cancelled both the Class X (Madhyamik) and Class XII (Higher Secondary) board exams. The national boards, CBSE and CISCE, have also called off their exams to check the spread of the novel coronavirus. But now that Covid cases have started declining, WBJEEB will hold the exams with Covid-safety measures, like limiting the maximum number of candidates in a room to 25. “In view of the Covid second wave and the restrictions, the date for WBJEE-2021 has been rescheduled... The exams will be held on July 17, Saturday. All and other aspects of the exams remain unchanged,” said WBJEE Board chairman Malayendu Saha. This year, 92,695 candidates have applied for the exam, 60% of whom are domicile of the state. In 2020, 88,800 candidates registered, while 73,200 appeared for the test; rank cards were handed to 72,298 students. The number of exam centres has been increased to 274 this time. “We have ensured the students do not have to travel long distances for the exams. Instead, we have increased the zones and candidates can choose centres of their preference,” said a WBJEEB official. Last year, the board modified the counselling process to engineering, architecture and pharmacy seats. Only online counselling was held and students had to register for every round. Also, candidates had to lock their choices after every round. Last year, 99% of the candidates got the rank cards, which allowed students to take part in counselling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jee-to-be-held-on-july-17-1st-exam-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83803349.cms||Somdatta Basu

Speaking to media persons here after visiting Vismaya’s house said the investigation led by rural SP and DSP would consider all types of evidence. “Considering the gravity of the case I am confident that the accused will get a strong conviction. There is strong evidence against the accused. We will take all steps to ensure that all evidence, including medical and electronic, are gathered,” she said. About Kirankumar assaulting Vismaya’s brother Vijith and Vismaya at her house at Nilamel last January and the Chadayamangalam Police’s role in not pursuing the case, she said, “As she was married for hardly six months, the girl and her family had not pressed to pursue the case. Now we will reinvestigate the case and file charges against the accused.” The IG said that the role of Kirankumar’s family in Vismaya’s harassment would be probed. When asked whether Vismaya’s death was suicide or murder, as per postmortem report, Attaluri said she would have to discuss with the doctor before commenting on it. “In case of murder, IPC Section 302 will be invoked. Even if it was suicide, the accused is likely to get 7 years to life term under Section 304 B of IPC,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ig-will-reprobe-assault-on-brother/articleshow/83791665.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Total 24,970 beneficiaries took the jab at 249 booths. As many as 22,471 people took the first shot while 2,469 beneficiaries completed the course by taking the second dose of the vaccine. Earlier, the highest turnout of 23,388 was recorded on June 4. District immunisation officer, Dr M K Singh, said, “Vaccination numbers went up because of the increase in the number of booths and awareness campaigns dispelling myths to counter vaccine hesitancy. We hope to achieve the target of 30,000 inoculations on Thursday.” So far, 12.95 lakh doses have been administered in Lucknow. About 2.62 lakh people have been fully immunised. However, the percentage of women beneficiaries is lower than men. On Wednesday also, 11,021 (45%) women got inoculated in comparison to 55% (13,949) men. The participation of the people in the 18-44 age group was the highest with 68% turnout. Those aged between 45 to 59 years constituted 24% (5,978) of the beneficiaries.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Four-way strategy to tackle third wave||LUCKNOW: With growing concerns over the anticipated third Covid wave, experts from the fields of biostatistics and public health, research and epidemiology have suggested ways to at least prevent it from becoming as devastating as the second wave. The four-way strategy given by them is: Rapid vaccination, Covid appropriate behaviour, community awareness and quick imposition of curfew once cases begin to rise. The second Covid-19 wave lasted for only three months, less than half of the first (seven months), but caused more than four (4.5) times average daily infections and nearly three (2.8) times deaths per day, reveals an informal analysis of the data provided in the state covid bulletins till June 17. The actual toll in the second wave is turning out to be higher as nearly 100 more deaths that took place in April and May, but remained unreported then, have been detected in the past few days. Dr CM Pandey, president, International Epidemiological Association, said, “The tendency of a pandemic is to surge suddenly. It has been seen over the years during the plague and chicken pox. During the first Covid wave, lockdown was clamped immediately. It caused inconvenience to people but helped in controlling the surge. However, in the second wave, partial curfew was placed after the surge.” “It may be difficult to predict the severity of the third wave, but preparation to tackle it must be the top priority. Along with it, public must follow Covid norms to curb the spread,” added Dr Pandey, who is also on the scientific advisory committee of the Indian Council of Research. Dr Uttam Kumar from the Centre of Biomedical Research, SGPGI, said mutation in the virus and complacency among people due to low mortality rate in the first wave expedited the transmission rate in the second wave. “Infections make the human body develop antibodies against a strain of the virus. Vaccines make antibodies in advance. But in order to evade antibodies and survive, the virus mutates and becomes stronger. Since the future cannot be predicted, health managers need to be prepared to tackle any situation so that the health system does not collapse as witnessed in the second wave. The preparations should include community awareness in the interior and rural areas,” he said. Prof Shailendra Saxena, head of the Centre for Advanced Research, KGMU, said, “When a vaccine is introduced, both the human body and the virus fight to become stronger than the other, resulting in mutation. It was seen during the 1918 Spanish flu. Now, with new variants like Delta plus coming up, we need to tread cautiously. The best preventive method is to wear masks, observe social distancing, hand hygiene and open markets occasionally.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/4-way-strategy-to-tackle-3rd-wave/articleshow/83793859.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Delhi||Third wave: Delhi University looks to set up oxygen plant, more Covid beds||NEW DELHI: In the wake of over 30 teachers and many non-teaching staff at Delhi University losing their lives to Covid, the university is making elaborate preparations to deal with possible third wave. It has initiated vaccination programme at two colleges and a health centre. It is also working on establishing an oxygen plant and will be signing an MoU with path labs to strengthen three of its health centres. “Covid Care facilities at Janki Devi Memorial College and Hansraj College have offered infrastructure for setting up care facilities with 100 beds each. We will also offer one of the hostels for another 200 beds. These facilities will need oxygen, medical equipment, oxygen supplies with direct pipelines to beds, uninterrupted power supply, medicines, facilities for food and above all, salaries for doctors and nurses. The university is trying its best to make arrangements for the same,” stated the university administration in a document released on Wednesday. The vaccination programme is running at Keshav Mahavidyalaya and Lakshmibai College. “The university is planning to sign an MoU with different pathlabs or other organisations to further strengthen the facilities at three of its health centres. It will set up oxygen plants that can fill in 50-80 medical cylinders using the PSA technology that will cost less, is safe in a campus setting and requires minimum clearance for approval from the government. We will provide the cylinders, when required, to every DU member and to those in the neighbourhood.” The university is also in the process of collecting oxygen concentrators. It requires 240 of them along with 500 pulse oximeters and about 600 thermal scanners. “If the third wave comes in and the number of positive cases increases, we will need to make augmented arrangements for Covid tests. We have prepared well for the same in three colleges—Miranda House, Janki Devi Memorial College and Gargi College,” added the document. DU had recently announced that it will provide free education to those students who have lost their parents to Covid. Meanwhile, the university has stressed that research activities have not been affected despite the pandemic. “DU sanctioned about 165 research grants to teachers from the Institute of Eminence grants to support research in the pandemic period. It also continued providing seed grants to newly recruited faculties to help the research activities. Our researchers have published a rich body of papers and policy documents on Covid-19 and innovated one rapid PCR-based test for Covid diagnostics that is likely to be commercialised soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-looks-to-set-up-oxygen-plant-more-covid-beds/articleshow/83793862.cms||---

The victim, Rubina Ansari, an MBA and currently working from her home in Junagadh, lodged a complaint of cheating and under the Information Technology Act at Junagadh range cyber crime police station on Tuesday. Rubina approached an astrologer named Bandana Bhardwaj in July last year through Instagram after Faheem Ansari, whom she was interested in, had rejected her marriage proposal. Rubina and Faheem had met each other while working in Ahmedabad in different companies. Rubina told the police that after contacting Bhardwaj, she shared Faheem’s birth details among other things with her. Bhardwaj told her that Faheem is under the influence of black magic and to get rid of it some rituals will have to be performed. For the rituals, Rubina transferred Rs 6.2 lakh in instalments to different bank accounts between July and September last year. Even after transferring the money, Rubina was asked to shell out more after which she became suspicious. When she refused to pay more, Bhardwaj threatened her that if the rituals remain incomplete, she will face a bad omen. Rubina, however, did not transfer the money and approached the police. “During investigation, we found that the money was transferred to different banks and not just the astrologer, two more persons named Abhishek Sharma and Akash Bhargav are also involved,” said inspector RV Vaja. He added that they have focused their probe on the mobile phone numbers and bank accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/heartbroken-mnc-employer-cheated-of-rs-6l-by-astrologer/articleshow/83789438.cms||---

Mudiali will be its capital) @ Aami paschimbange 18ti kendrosashito anchal ebong 75ti rajyer dabi rakhchi (I demand 18 union territories and 75 states in West Bengal) Political memes and posts which took a back seat following the declaration of election results are once again seeing an upswing on social media, courtesy a demand for separate statehood for different regions in north and south Bengal by multiple BJP MPs and MLAs, over the past few days. While John Barla, the BJP MP from Alipurduar demanded the entire north Bengal be turned into a Union Territory, Bishnupur MP Saumitra Khan had raised a similar demand for Jungle Mahal region. Two other BJP MLAs — Sikha Chattopadhyay of Dabgram-Fulbari and Durga Murmu of Phansidewa — too supported the statehood demands citing alleged apathy and lack of infrastructural developments by the state government for several years. Banking on the statehood demands, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are abuzz with quirky and funny memes with netizens making random partition requests — some of which have even gone viral and are being shared vehemently over WhatsApp and telegram groups as well. There is however another set of netizens who back the cause and have come out in support through comments and shares. “I have no political inclination. But I still shared a statehood demand for Tollygunge as it was really funny,” said New Town techie Arghya Dutta. “At North Bengal and Jangalmahal where BJP has won quite a few seats, some TMC leaders are threatening to stop ongoing developmental activities. I believe the current statehood demand is being made to divert the attention and ensure developmental activities continue there. I don’t think even the BJP leadership takes these demands seriously. But it’s a good feed on social media,” said Psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/memes-back-on-social-media-riding-on-statehood-demand/articleshow/83791695.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra and Mumbai see surge in new Covid cases; need to review unlock plan: Ministers||MUMBAI: On the day when both Maharashtra and Mumbai reported a surge in daily detections of Covid-19 cases, the state cabinet held a discussion on the Delta-plus variant cases found in the state. The ministers were of the opinion that the five-level unlock plan should be reviewed and if required, stricter restrictions should be brought back to keep the spread of the highly virulent and transmissible strain in check. After a gap of one week, Maharashtra reported over 10,000 cases, while Mumbai reported a 30% jump in cases as compared to Tuesday (568). On Wednesday, 10,066 cases were reported in the state and 864 in Mumbai, the highest in 19 days. The city saw 23 deaths. Wednesday’s case tally was the highest since June 4 (968) and the death toll highest in 12 days. “The third wave in most countries has been fueled by the Delta-plus strain. With 21 cases in the state it is a matter of concern. We have requested the CM to hold a meeting with the task force to review the unlock plan and consider adding some restrictions to keep the spread in check,” said a minister, who attended the meeting. Health minister Rajesh Tope said, “Daily cases in the state have been fluctuating between 8,000 and 10,000 for the last 10-12 days and are not reducing as fast as they should...we are trying to understand the reason for this slow decline.” The state’s total caseload rose to 59.9 lakh and the death toll touched 1,19,303. As many as 345 unreported deaths were also added to the cumulative as part of the reconciliation exercise. Similarly, the total cases in Mumbai touched 7.2 lakh and deaths 15,338. BMC officials said the fluctuations are not alarming and could be the function of more tests (37,905) done in the last 24-hour period. The state has tested over 2.4 lakh people in the last 24 hours taking the total tests conducted since the outbreak of the pandemic to 4 crore, nearly 30% of the 12-crore population of Maharashtra. The BMC is setting up paediatric wards in its hospitals in preparation for the third wave. In jumbo centres, BMC has decided to make separate enclosures for Covid-negative parents of Covid-positive children admitted there. “The parents cannot stay with the infected child, but on compassionate grounds, we will ensure they are in the same facility,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-and-city-see-surge-in-new-cases-need-to-review-unlock-plan-ministers/articleshow/83793873.cms||Bhavika Jain

Nearly 30% seats in the municipal corporations predominantly have voters from the OBC community. The state election commission’s announcement to hold the zilla parishad and panchayat samiti elections was opposed by the leaders belonging to the OBC category. “We have given a memorandum to the district collectorate, stating that the elections should not be held unless the reservation issue is solved. Not allowing these citizens to be in the political system at ease will cause social issues,” said Yogesh Sasane, a corporator in the Pune Municipal Corporation. Community leader Balasaheb Sanap said, “All groups of the community are on the same page and are planning to file review petition in the Supreme Court. No new elections should be declared till the judgment comes.” The Akhil Bhartiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad has declared an agitation to support political reservation for the community. BJP leader Panjaka Munde also said no election should be held without OBC reservation. “The community lost the political reservation due to the state’s improper management. Polls should be postponed till this issue is resolved,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/obc-quota-issue-may-delay-pune-civic-polls/articleshow/83791689.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The decision in this regard was taken by commissioner and IG Balram Kumar Upadhyay after reviewing the case file on Wednesday. Assistant commissioner (CCB) Johnson Charles is the new investigation officer in the case. It was on Monday night, Archana, a BSc Nursing graduate, died of burns after she allegedly immolated herself. Though the police had taken her husband, Suresh, into custody on Tuesday, he was let off after a preliminary round of questioning. Archana’s parents, Ashokan and Molly, had alleged that their daughter would never take her own life and blamed Suresh for her death. Ashokan had also given his statement in this regard before the police. On Wednesday, the residents of Venganoor staged a road blockade along with the body of Archana that was released after autopsy, demanding the arrest of Suresh. Speaking to TOI, IG Upadhyay said that the case was handed over to CCB to ensure a more focussed and efficient probe. “Due to Covid-19 situation, the personnel at local police stations are involved in various duties related to fighting the pandemic. Hence, the case was handed over to the crime branch,” said the officer. Archana and Suresh, a welder by profession, got married in May last year. According to her parents, fights were frequent between the couple owing to the wayward lifestyle of Suresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/residents-protest-against-delay-in-police-action/articleshow/83791714.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Vaccination at many govt units drops to 1/3rd of capacity||Kolkata: Bengal is slated to cross the 2-crore vaccination mark over the next two days. This means, roughly one in five Bengal residents would have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine by then. On Tuesday, at least 2.9 lakh people received their shots from 2,383 sites, taking the total count in the state to over 1.9 crore so far. But health officials said the state still could not scale up the campaign to the full capacity due to supply constraints. As a result, the state is yet to start universal vaccination for all above 18 years, restricting the drive to priority groups. Bengal had a stock of about 14 lakh doses on Tuesday. Now, around 3 lakh people were being vaccinated a day including at private vaccination centres, and the figure was below the state’s capacity, an official said. Vaccination in many teaching hospitals has been reduced to one-third the capacity. “We get queries about the 18-44 age group but since we can vaccinate only priority groups, our number is restricted to about one-third of our capacity,” said a vaccination coordinator at a government facility. Before the state was supposed to launch its drive to inoculate all above 18 from Monday, it received 13 lakh doses of vaccines in three consignments. On Tuesday, it got 38,690 doses of Covaxin. “We should get another 10 lakh doses by June-end. The supply is escalated bit it is not enough for our full capacity,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. Private hospital units are expanding their drive and inoculating 500 to 6,000 people a day. “Our Kishore Bharati centre is giving 4,000 doses a day,” said Alok Roy, chairman of Medica. AMRI Hospitals, which has started venturing into districts, is vaccinating about 3,500 people a day. “We need to pull in our resources to inoculate more residents,” said Rupak Barua group CEO AMRI Hospitals. “With 12,000 doses, we are sticking to our hospital site for now,” ,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccination-at-many-govt-units-drops-to-1/3rd-of-capacity/articleshow/83791724.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Severe Covid rare in children: Study||NEW DELHI: Children affected by Covid-19 are least likely to be severely ill. Death due to the disease is also rare in the 0-12 year age group, except in patients with underlying comorbidities. This has been confirmed by the Indian Paediatric Covid Study Group, led by top doctors from leading medical institutions in the country. The group analysed the clinical profile and risk factors for severe disease in 402 children hospitalised with Covid at five tertiary care hospitals across India between March and November last year. This included 11 neonates, 45 children less than a year old, 118 aged between one year and five years and 221 children aged between five and 12 years. Dr Kana Ram Jat, one of the lead authors of the study, said fever was the most common clinical presentation but it occurred in only about 38% of the patients. Other common symptoms were cough and sore throat, abdominal pain, vomiting and loose motion. The majority of children had mild symptoms and around 10%, moderate to severe disease, added Dr Jhuma Shankar, associate professor, department of paediatrics, AIIMS, who was involved in the study. Shankar said of the 402 children, 13 (3.2%) succumbed to the disease. “All of them had underlying comorbidity — five had diseases involving the central nervous system, three had congenital heart disease, two had rheumatic disease, one acute leukaemia, one Wilson disease and one steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with Type I diabetes,” she said. The majority of symptomatic children received supportive therapy. Asymptomatic children didn’t receive any treatment. Some children received additional therapy, including antibiotic and antiviral therapy, said the doctors. Dr Shankar also said there was no scientific basis to the claim that the third wave of infections would hit children. However, the doctors said it was important to be prepared for any eventuality since there is no vaccine available for children in India yet. India has approved three vaccines for adults, Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik, but none approved yet for children. The US and UK have approved the Pfizer vaccine for children over 12 years old. The drug regulatory body gave its approval to Bharat Biotech, manufacturer of Covaxin, for clinical trials of its vaccine for children on May 12, following which Phase II/III trials began in multiple places, including AIIMS, Delhi. There is hope the vaccine will be ready by September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/severe-covid-rare-in-children-study/articleshow/83793923.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Samajwadi Party, Congress spreading false propaganda on pandemic, says BJP||LUCKNOW: Amid accusations that Uttar Pradesh has hidden the actual number of Covid deaths, government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said that the official statistics of deaths had exposed the “fallacy of the narrative put forth by opposition parties” which was aimed at misleading people. Hitting out at Samajwadi Party and Congress, Opposition parties which have referred to RTI data on death certificates issued in the state to claim that a rise in their numbers was disproportionate in comparison with official Covid death data, Singh said that both parties had given a deceptive account of the deaths by attributing them to Covid mismanagement by the state government. “In a misleading narrative, the Opposition had charged the Yogi Adityanath government with concealing actual Covid death figures and quoted an RTI statement which was manipulated and concocted in order to defame the government,” he said. Singh said that the data quoted by the Opposition pertained to the period between July 2020 and March 2021, while alleging a high death rate during the second wave of Covid. He said that the second wave hit the state in April and the death figures for April were deliberately withheld to spread false propaganda. Against Opposition claims, Singh said, the government had actually strengthened the system of birth and death registration. “The total deaths registered included all deaths whether due to Covid, other ailments and natural causes. The RTI information procured by the Opposition contained data from April but it was conveniently concealed. A comparison has been made between the periods July 2019 to March 2020 and July 2020 to March 2021 while the second Covid wave hit from April and May 2021,” he said. Singh said that in January, 2021, 1.03 lakh death certificates were issued, while in February 2021 and March 2021, the number of death certificates issued were 99,100 and 70,797 respectively. In April, when the second wave started, deaths had slipped to 61,986, a point mentioned in the RTI data but a fact deliberately concealed by the Opposition, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-cong-spreading-false-propaganda-on-pandemic-bjp/articleshow/83793891.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Sri Lankan refugee held for wife’s murder in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The Sri Lankan Tamil refugee, who beat his second wife to death with a cricket bat at their rental house at Gandhi Maanagar in the city, was arrested on Tuesday night. Police had earlier formed four special teams to nab the accused, 49-year-old Lavendran alias Kumar. Lavendran had murdered his 32-year-old wife L Kavitha on Monday night, following a quarrel over her excessive use of mobile phone. While Kavitha’s relative S Nagarajan happened to reach the spot when Lavendran was assaulting her with the cricket bat, he couldn’t do anything to save her. Nagarajan alerted the Saravanampatti police, who registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and formed four special teams to nab Lavendran. One of the teams was sent to Rameswaram to prevent Lavendran from escaping to Sri Lanka. The Q-branch police at Mandapam in Ramanathapuram were also alerted about the incident. On Tuesday night, one of the special teams nabbed the accused near Bhavani Sagar in Erode district. “During the interrogation, Lavendran said he had doubted that his wife was having illegal affairs as she was often on the phone.” Police have produced Lavendran before the judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. Later, he was lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lankan-refugee-held-for-wifes-murder/articleshow/83791727.cms||---

Though the scare of the third wave looms large, people are heaving a sigh of relief that the nightmare that they had been through for over four months is finally over, albeit temporarily. Many complexes had stopped the entry of domestic helps, who come from outside, tutors, yoga instructors, physiotherapists and labourers. The support staff were vaccinated and given space to stay on campuses in batches that changed every fortnight. Even food delivery was restricted till the security area. Those norms have been relaxed in the complexes that have been declared “Covid-free.” Urbana, South City Residency, Upohar and Siddha Pines are among such complexes. “Dear residents, your board is glad to inform that the residents of South City complex are Covid-free. We plan to unlock certain restrictions in a phased manner,” said the notice. Similarly, the notice posted on Tuesday in the Urbana group said, “UWA is proud to announce that we are a “0 Covid case” complex, thanks to the co-operation of all residents.” The announcement at Siddha Pines read, “We are a Covid-free society now...” Some other complexes like Udita and Silver Spring are also Covid-free now. Though their associations are yet to announce it, some relaxations have already been given. “We are allowing residents to call in labourers for repair and maintenance work now. We are finally Covid-free,” said Udita president D Nath. “We are Covid-free and have allowed tutors and physiotherapists to enter. Playing is allowed but in a restricted manner,” said Silver Spring secretary, Indranil Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rwas-declare-housing-complexes-covid-free-relax-norms-gradually/articleshow/83791759.cms||---

---||Pune||Retail assoc conducts rapid antigen tests for members||Pune: The Pune District Retailers’ Association has started conducting rapid antigen tests (RAT) for shopkeepers in the city. The drive is being held across the city in collaboration with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). The association has said that the tests are being conducted as a precautionary measure, following increased footfall at markets. Over 2,000 traders have undergone the tests and those with symptoms have been told to isolate. The association has also started an inoculation drive for shopkeepers in rural areas. A centre at Shirur vaccinated the local shopkeepers. A similar drive will be held in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad soon, the association has said. “We are working on two fronts ever since the government initiated more relaxations. One is testing and vaccination of maximum shopkeepers and staff. This is because the traders are exposed to the people hence their vaccination is necessary,” said Sachin Nivangune, president of the association. Nivangune added that the RAT drive started in PMC limits has received a good response from shopkeepers. “We have strictly told traders to conduct the tests if they develop any symptoms. Our local branches are taking timely updates from traders. There is a plan to conduct at least 500 tests of shopkeepers on a daily basis,” Nivangune said. The association’s office bearers said that they have been following up on the proposal with PMC to hold a vaccination drive for retailers. “We have received positive response from civic authorities. As per the preliminary plan, one centre will be allotted in each area of the city where shopkeepers will receive vaccine. Around 70% retailers aged between 18-44 years are still to get the vaccine,” an office-bearer said. Traders in the city said they were finding it difficult to spend an entire day to get vaccinated. “A dedicated camp will save time and effort of shopkeepers. Also, many shopkeepers cannot bear the expenses of staffers’ inoculation at private hospitals as business is already down,” said Sagar Mehta, a trader from Somwar Peth. Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary of Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP), said that the proposal to hold special camps for inoculation of traders has been submitted to the government and PMC. “There was some delay because of non-availability of vaccines but with the arrival of fresh stock we now expect the administration to hold dedicated drives,” Pitaliya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/retail-assoc-conducts-rapid-antigen-tests-for-members/articleshow/83791802.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Special drive to vaccinate government and private teachers from today||HYDERABAD: The Telangana state government has decided to organize a special vaccination drive for government and private teachers in the state starting from Thursday. The director of school education A Sridevasena said that the special vaccination drives should be organized from Thursday in all districts for the benefit of government, private and gurukul school teachers and non-teaching staff. “As per the direction from the state government, these drives will be held in Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs) in all mandals under the supervision of the health department,” said Sridevasena. She asked all teachers and other staff to get vaccinated in this special drive before the commencement of physical classes on July 1. She suggested that teachers and other staff carry their identity cards and Aadhaar card to the vaccination centers. She also directed the education and medical department officials to work in coordination and complete vaccinating 100 per cent of teachers and other staff by June 30. Ever since the state announced the reopening of schools and other educational institutions, teachers have been demanding a special drive as several of them have lost lives and were infected with Covid-19 during the pandemic. “Hardly 40 per cent of teachers have got vaccinated till date. It would have been even better if the state conducts special drive only for teachers instead of asking us to visit PHCs. It’s not clear yet if there will be separate queue or registration for teachers and other staff and whether or not we will get vaccine on priority basis when several others are waiting for a dose in queue,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary, United Teachers Federations, who has been demanding a special drive for teachers. He said that it would be even better if students are asked to attend physical classes after receiving at least the first dose of vaccination. Apart from organizing a special drive for vaccinations, the teachers said that the state should also renew services of vidya volunteers as there are 7,500 vacancies in high schools and maintaining social distancing in classrooms without them would not be possible. They also asked the state to hire sanitation workers and added that municipal corporations or local bodies are only cleaning school grounds, but not the classrooms and washrooms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spl-drive-to-vaccinate-govt-and-pvt-teachers-from-today/articleshow/83791796.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Four police officers suspended for taking bribe||COIMBATORE: Four cops were suspended in the district on Wednesday in two separate incidents of taking bribe. In the first incident, inspector P Suresh and head constable R Venkatachalam, who were attached to Kinathukadavu police station, were placed under suspension for taking a bribe of Rs 12,000 from a man, whose car hit a two-wheeler, killing the rider. According to an official source, Suresh had rammed his car into the two-wheeler in the Kinathukadavu police limits on Sunday. “To release Suresh on bail after his arrest, the head constable demanded Rs 12,000, which was later handed over to the inspector.” When the incident came to the notice of superintendent of police (SP) S Selvanagarathinam, he launched an inquiry against the duo and placed them under suspension after the probe revealed that they had taken the bribe. In the second incident, head constable Kishore and grade-I constable Jothimani, who were attached to Thudiyalur police station, were suspended for taking bribe from a spa owner. A police officer said Kishore and Jothimani used to collect Rs 20,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively, from the spa owner every week for the past few years. “When they demanded bribe even during the lockdown days, the spa owner lodged a complaint with the SP a couple of days ago. Subsequently, an inquiry was launched and the SP placed them under suspension as the charges were found to be true.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/4-police-officers-suspended-for-taking-bribe/articleshow/83791775.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Relieved with SC nod, CBSE teachers rush to add up scores, others wait for CISCE result||Kolkata: Schools affiliated to CBSE and CISCE heaved a sigh of relief as the Supreme Court approved the formulae for preparing the mark sheets classes X and XII board-year candidates. While CISCE schools have already sent the candidates’ marks—of classes IX and X for ICSE and XI and XII for ISC—to the council, CBSE institutes are tabulating the scores. CBSE principals have been asked to submit the final tabulations by July 15 so that the final results can be declared by July 31. So, teachers have been visiting campuses to collate the data, based on the formula, and in the presence of an exam committee, which has representation of teachers from two other schools. “We have formed our exam committees, where external teachers are present and work will start at a frenetic pace now. We are working till late at night,” said Loveleen Saigal, principal of Birla High School. Both CBSE and CISCE school heads pointed out while candidates last year could write at least some of the papers, this time, students were completely dependent on the scores that will be drawn up for them. They could only submit their projects (20 marks) and do lab-based practicals (30 marks). Many students are upset that all will be weighed on the same scale though they wrote their pre-boards on campus and many took the tests online. Students do have the option of appearing for an exam between August 15 and September 15 if they are not satisfied with the scores drawn up for them. “But after the results are declared, students will get busy with college admissions. Will they choose to go back to the syllabus and write an exam?” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. Some CISCE schools pointed out that while they had no hands in drawing up the marks using the formula because they were asked to submit class IX-X school exam marks for ICSE students and XI-XII marks for ISC students. They will depend on the council to tabulate the final scores. But CBSE schools will have the liberty to prepare the results themselves. “Their students might get an advantage over ours as the school knows each child. This is not the case for us. But we are sure the council will take every child’s interest in mind. There will be a deviation of about 3%-4 %, which will not affect the average student but will somewhat impact the brilliant ones,” said a principal of a CISCE school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relieved-with-sc-nod-cbse-teachers-rush-to-add-up-scores-others-wait-for-cisce-result/articleshow/83791798.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||Disabled man scours Mumbai to find missing stray dog||MUMBAI: A touching tale of bonding between a wheelchair-bound man and a dog has come to light from the city airport which shows that man too can go to any lengths for his furry friend. A ground staffer of Indigo Airline, Joseph Rodrigues (36), would regularly play with a young male dog, Whitey, at the departures area of the international terminal of the airport at Andheri. Their friendship was well-known. However, Whitey suddenly went missing from the airport last week, leading to a lot of distress for Rodrigues. “I became very anxious as I could not find Whitey anywhere at the airport complex. What startled me was that another dog, Browny, a buddy of Whitey, started showing signs of acute stress. Browny would sit very close to my wheelchair and often whimper softly, as if trying to tell me that something awful had happened to our friend Whitey,” said Rodrigues. Determined to find Whitey, despite his disability, he started sending online messages and photos of the missing dog to animal activists in the country, as I did not have contacts of local activists. Here, activists Priyanshu Sharma, Kalyani, Chaitanya, and animal friendly Mumbai cop ACP Sudhir Kudalkar and his team guided me on how to go about searching for Whitey,” said Joseph. After going through a maze of energy-sapping search in city lanes, he went to check dog centres at Bandra and Malad where BMC’s dog-catchers at times bring the canines. As luck would have it, Joseph finally found his four-legged pal inside an enclosure at the Malad centre earlier this week. It was the happiest sight for him in a long time. “Whitey jumped towards me with joy on seeing me at the Malad dog centre. I’d like to thank all animal activists and friends who helped me find Whitey. I can now do my airport duties in peace,” said the relieved Indigo staffer. He now wants to put up Whitey and Browny for adoption as he does not want them to be harassed again. He was told that some airport passengers had complained about Whitey because he used to chase cars.“Those who want to adopt these lovely dogs can contact me,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-disabled-man-scours-city-to-find-missing-stray-dog/articleshow/83794001.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Markets to face closure if Covid norms are violated||NEW DELHI: The district administrations have started building pressure on the market associations to be ready to face closure if Covid protocols are not strictly followed in these areas. The market and bar associations and malls have been served letters by the offices of the district magistrates and the station house officers of some police stations informing them about the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) circular regarding their responsibilities and the penalties in case of violations. The traders’ associations have, however, argued that district officials were allowing street vendors to return while expecting shopkeepers to maintain the Covid norms. Some of them have also requested the authorities to shift street vendors to nearby open sites. “We have received a notice from Delhi Police stating that the DDMA guidelines are not being followed by market associations and shopkeepers are failing to maintain social distancing, increasing chances of infection and endangering efforts of government authorities,” said Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar Market Association. While closure warning has been mentioned in the notice, the authorities have failed to check encroachment, alleged Gupta. “As soon as full-fledged opening of markets were allowed, the entire corridor got flooded with street vendors, followed by illegal vendors on roadsides and pavements as well as mobile vendors who are roaming carefree inside the market. What authority do we have to shift them from the common area?” he asked. The residents welfare association and the market association of GK-II got a similar notice on Monday. “It’s unfair to expect us to look after all types of violations. There is so much encroachment on pavements on colony roads and we don’t have power to even shift them, forget about social distancing,” said Sanjay Rana of GK-II RWA. Ashok Kalra, general secretary of Sarojini Nagar Market Association (big shops), said they had written to the authorities immediately after 92 tehbazaris were allowed to do business. “Eventually many illegal hawkers also start sitting with them, barely maintaining any social distance, and it’s difficult to identify them.” To avoid crowding, the association has also suggested permitting a limited number of customers at a time and shift tehbazaris to a nearby vacant space, he added. The association has engaged 40 volunteers to request people to maintain social distancing. An official of New Delhi district said the market associations representing shopkeepers would have to take the responsibility for restricting their members in such a situation. “Also, it would be unfair to generalise the issue of encroachment. If there are illegal hawkers, shopkeepers should inform civic bodies and us immediately. While we can’t stop authorised vendors, those who are illegal would surely go,” he added. New Delhi Traders’ Association claimed to have written to the lieutenant governor again on Tuesday about street vendors. “We have already started receiving complaints from shopkeepers regarding squatters at some places. A few days ago, Delhi Police carried out a drive to check hawkers doing business from vehicles stationed in the parking area. They were removed, but have started returning one by one. Unless the authorities are strict, shopkeepers can’t do anything,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/markets-to-face-closure-if-covid-norms-are-violated/articleshow/83793988.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kolkata||Schools ask for 10 extra days to upload IX scores||Kolkata: An association of headmasters has written to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, requesting the authorities to extend the deadline for uploading Class IX annual exam marks, required to computate the final scores of Class-X board-year students, by 10 days. After the board cancelled Madhyamik to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, it devised a formula to evaluate the candidates by giving weightage to their Class IX annual exam scores and Class X internal exam marks. Schools have been directed to upload the marks on a special website by June 24, but many principals pointed out the server was either too slow to work on or inaccessible. “Kolkata schools are finding it difficult to access the website. So, one can imagine the condition in the interiors, where the internet connection is weak. Thousands of schools are trying to access the website, which is also slowing down the server. It is not possible for schools to provide all the data by June 24. We have written to the government, board and the council to extend the deadline by at least 10 days,” said Sridam Chandra Jana, president of the West Bengal Headmasters’ Association. Principals said they had all the data but could not upload them. “The server is slow, and it is a struggle to upload the marks. Twelve fields have to filled for each student but the server gives up midway,” said Bivash Saniel, headmaster of Scottish Church School. The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Monday extended the deadline to submit Class XI marks for HS candidates to June 28. Around 2,200 schools are yet to submit the Class XI marks. “Many principals approached the council with their difficulty in collating the data and sending it to zonal centres, after which the council extended the deadline,” said the principal of a government school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-ask-for-10-extra-days-to-upload-ix-scores/articleshow/83791807.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The development emphasises the significance the media team would have in the election year. “There is a need to tell people the truth and expose the false propaganda by SP, BSP and Congress which have always been into corruption, giving protection to criminals, done politics of appeasement, and dynastic and caste-based politics,” said the state party president. “Communication is a strong medium. Its scope is widening through print media, electronic media and digital media. The party’s media cell will hold workshops to train the media in charge at state, region, district and mandal levels,” said Bansal. In July, workshops will be held at state, region and district levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-bjp-chief-gives-tips-to-media-team-members/articleshow/83793956.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They petitioned the Centre on Wednesday. In a press note, the All India Council of Association of MSMEs (AICA) said there was a steep rise in the price of raw materials, especially that of steel and pig iron, despite their low consumption and significant drop in the production during the lockdown. According to AICA, the price of mild steel plate has gone up by 82.22%, aluminium alloy by 94.34%, copper by 109.86%, pig iron by 50%, MS scrap by 48.15% and PVC pipe by 47.44%, since April 2020. AICA has more than two lakh MSMEs as members. The association said the manufacturers of steel and other base materials were logging 10 to 20 times higher profit, while the MSMEs were on the verge of extinction. It said the steel manufacturers were not fixing the price based on the demand and supply situation in the country, but based on the international market prices. Because of the price rise, AICA said, the MSMEs could not execute orders at a lower price and they were facing uncertainty of getting blacklisted by the public sector undertakings (PSUs) and large corporate companies, if they could not supply the products as per the agreement. The association members also demanded the Union government to take necessary steps to bring an easy mechanism to hedge steels for the MSMEs and provide the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) powers to consolidate and hedge overall steel quantity in the market. “The Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and steel makers should publicise prices of long and flat steel products, and HRC coils on a quarterly basis and the price should be maintained for a period of three months at least. PSUs like SAIL and VIzag steel should supply materials to the MSMEs on a priority basis and the steel manufacturers should allocate at least 40% of their production to the local MSMEs,” the association said in the press note. The association also demanded that the MSMEs under the government contract and the suppliers to PSUs should be allowed to revise their price, the government should take steps to provide GST-based funding with minimal marginal rate to them and allow them to import steel materials with nil import duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/170-msme-associations-join-forces-to-fight-price-hike/articleshow/83791804.cms||---

P Praveen, a parent, alleged that the school management of a well-known school in Koti, has refused to promote his elder son as he did not appear for online exams. “Initially, they said my son will be promoted if we clear the pending fee. I have paid Rs 31,800, but my child has not been given access to the virtual classes till date,” said Praveen, whose son Satya is in Class 5. “After collecting the fee, the management is saying that they don’t care about money, but are worried if the child had learned anything as he did not take online exams,” he added. When it comes to his younger son Sathwik, he said that the management is yet to promote him to Class 1 from pre-primary 2 (PP2). “The management want us to pay the entire fee — Rs 47, 000, to promote my younger son to Class 1. They used to conduct online classes for an hour every day. My child had not even accessed these classes as he is young and differently-abled. Why should I pay the full fee,” he questioned. Praveen asked what’s the guarantee that management would promote him after collecting the fee as his elder son is yet to be promoted. According to parents, about 15 to 20 students from each class have not been promoted owing to fee dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/school-detains-kid-in-same-class-despite-govt-orders/articleshow/83791866.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Realtor accuses Coimbatore corporation official of demanding two crore bribe for layout nod||COIMBATORE: A city-based realtor alleged that the city corporation has not handed over the original copy of final layout plan approval despite paying all the fees months ago. He alleged though approval has been granted by the civic body and he possessed a copy of it, the original was not being given as corporation authorities were demanding bribe for it. He has sent a petition to the corporation commissioner, chief secretary and Directorate of Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) seeking their intervention in the issue. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, B Somasundaram said that he along with his associates had planned to develop a layout on 62.38 acres at Kalapatti in the east zone of the corporation limit. “Shortly after I applied for the plan approval, Town Planning Officer (TPO) and Assistant Town Planning Officer (ATPO) inspected the land in July 2019 and asked me to pay Rs 52 lakh as arrear tax and Rs 3.60 crore as future maintenance charge. We paid the pending tax amount,’’ he said. Somasundaram said though future maintenance charge was not collected in other corporations, he paid it as the project was getting delayed. “I had paid Rs 3.6 crore future maintenance charge and Rs 47 lakh UGD deposit on April 30, 2021,’’ he said. Somasundaram alleged that a senior corporation officer had demanded a bribe of Rs 2.5 crore to provide the original approval copy. When contacted, then corporation commissioner Kumaravel Pandian, who is now the collector of Vellore district, refuted the allegations. He said that approval was not granted for Somasundaraman’s layout at all. “When we were about to issue the final approval, three people had raised objections against the project. So, the process was put on hold,” he said. Present corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said he had received the complaint and was perusing the documents. “We are analyzing the documents. Steps would be taken accordingly to sort out the issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/realtor-accuses-city-corporation-official-of-demanding-rs-2cr-bribe-for-layout-nod/articleshow/83791839.cms||---

---||Pune||IMA alleges misuse, seeks parameters for bill audit in Pune||PUNE: Auditors have not come across a single case of overcharging for Covid treatment by private hospitals in the last couple of weeks amid Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) demand to set parameters for the audit of such bills. “We are carrying out the audit but have not found any objectionable case for the last couple of weeks,” said Manisha Naik, assistant medical officer of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). She said the auditors were duly visiting the hospitals and doing their duty of checking the bills above Rs 1 lakh. PMC data shows that 1,400 complaints have been crossverified since August 2020. Bill amounts were reduced in 1,050 cases and around Rs 4.6 crore have been returned to the patients concerned. According to IMA officebearers, the tool of audit was being misused in many cases. Some patients were presenting old bills for scrutiny, some of them even raised objections after getting reimbursement under the medical insurance. They wanted to use the audits with malafide intention, the office-bearers alleged. “Therefore, we have demanded a deadline for submitting objections against the bills. A time-limit of 8-10 days should be set for submitting the bills for audit once the patient is discharged. The complaints coming after the time period should not be entertained. The tool of audit must not be misused,” said Balasaheb Deskhmukh, president of IMA. Deskhmukh said if the patient had taken money from insurance company for treatments, s/he should not be allowed to claim benefit of the reimbursement from the audit. PMC officials said the action taken against errant hospitals included cancellation of their licence. The civic body had issued notices before taking any action. In some cases, permission given to the hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients was withdrawn. Overcharging was done in treatment in intensive care units and charges of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits. Objections were also raised against heavy administration charges, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ima-demands-parameters-as-audit-gives-clean-chits-to-pvt-hospitals-in-past-weeks/articleshow/83791878.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The temple had been shut to visitors from May 15. The number of devotees who visited the temple on the day of reopening was not alarming and everyone followed Covid-appropriate behaviour, a source said. The gates of Kalighat temple will now be open for the devotees from 6am to noon. “Depending on the situation, we will slowly open the gates in the evenings, too,” said a source. Dakshineshwar Temple will reopen on Thursday, when Snan Yatra of Jagannath will be observed. “It will be the foundation day of the temple and we propose to re-start that day. We are making all arrangements to observe Covid-safety guidelines,” said spokesperson for Dakshineswar Kushal Chowdhury. He said they were planning to open the gates twice during the day. “We plan to allow visitors for three hours in the morning and three hours in the evening,” Chowdhury said. Belurmath, the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission, will however remain closed for the time being and there are no plans to re-open yet, officials there said. Iskcon Chandrodaya temple at Mayapur also reopened with restrictions on Tuesday. The Mayapur temple had been locked from May 15 and only monks and resident devotees had been carrying out the essential work in the period.

Sanitisation, masks and other safety guidelines are also being followed. But there is no news of Iskcon Temple Kolkata on Albert Road reopening yet. It has arranged for the puja of Jagannath inside its temple for Thursday’s Snan Yatra but people would not be allowed to attend the ritual because of the ongoing restrictions, said Radharaman Das, vice-president of Iskcon, Kolkata.

---||Chandigarh||Only 327 patients reached rural isolation centres in Haryana||JIND: Isolation centres set up by the Haryana government have failed to attract Covid-19 patients, according to data procured from the state health department. In around 6,800 villages in Haryana where isolation centres have been set up, only 327 patients reached isolation centres in the state. People in Haryana claimed that the state government had made just announcements when it come to isolaton centres and nothing had been done on the ground to tackle the pandemic. According to data, 325 patients had reached isolation centre till May 23. Thereafter, till May 30, only two patients showedup. No one went to these centres after this. The state had recorded 9,246 Covid deaths till June 20. Of which, 3,671 deaths took place in rural areas and 5,574 in urban areas. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala announced on May 10 that every village would get from Rs 30,000 to 50,000 to set up isolation centers. The state government had planned to purchase oximeters, steam machines, thermometers, and blood pressure-monitoring machines for these centres, but people have claimed that arrangements were poor at most of these centres. The respective authorities just set up an isolation centre in government schools by arranging four-five charpoys, said villagers. The isolation centres in Ambala, Yamunanagar, Rewari and Nuh did not report a single patient. In all, 66 patients came to isolation centres in Faridabad, 51 in Charkhi Dadri, 47 in Gurgaon, and 36 in Fatehabad. Less than 10 patients got treatment at isolation centres in Hisar, Jhajjar, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Mahendragarh, Palwal, Panipat, Rohtak, and Sirsa. Vinod Kumar, a native of Karsindhu village in Uchana segment of Jind district, said, “There were no facilities in isolation centres set up in villages which were also lacking medical staff, medicines and other protective gear. People preferred to die at home. Also, government failed to arrange oxygen and other required items at district-level hospitals in Haryana, let alone isolation centres,” he added. Villagers said the centres were just a fallout of the government making big announcements, but having no plan in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/only-327-patients-reached-rural-isolation-centres-in-haryana/articleshow/83794058.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BL Santhosh praises CM Yogi Aditgyanath govt’s ‘vaccination feat’||LUCKNOW: BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh on Wednesday lauded UP government's efforts to step up the vaccination drive against Covid, in what was seen as a fresh endorsement of CM Yogi Aditgyanath by a top party leader, who also happens to be a close affiliate of the RSS. This also comes almost 12 days after PM Narendra Modi, during his meeting with CM Yogi, hailed Covid management by the UP government. “On the back of 7.25 lakh vaccination on June 21, UP vaccinated 8.1 lakh people in the last 24 hours. Momentum picking up...Good going CM,” Santhosh tweeted, while tagging Yogi. The UP government administered over 8 lakh vaccination doses, which was highest in the country. As a matter of fact, CM Yogi has set a benchmark of carrying out 10 crore vaccinations in the next three months. Santhosh's statement attained much political significance a day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav simultaneously upped the ante while cornering the BJP vis-a-vis pandemic. While Gandhi released a while paper suggesting measures which need to be taken to tackle the much anticipated third wave, Akhilesh accused the UP government of hiding the actual number of deaths due to Covid. Political experts said that the pandemic has indeed armed the opposition which has been seeking a political resurrection in UP where assembly elections are due next year. The development comes after Santhosh and BJP vice-president Radha Mohan Singh camped in Lucknow for two days and met the RSS, state BJP leaders and UP ministers to chart out a template for a cohesive strategy to counter the opposition. BJP leaders were quick to read into the fresh message of Santhosh, saying that the party organisation was all spruced up to back the UP government in its rigorous drive to carry out Corona vaccination. “The vaccination is being done by the government. But as a member of the ruling it is our job to make people aware about the benefits of vaccination. We also need to dispel the misconceptions which started gaining ground after the opposition expressed its apprehension about the vaccines,” said a senior UP BJP leader. Party sources said that vaccination has been one of the key issues taken up by the UP BJP ranks during their interaction with Santhosh and Singh. As a matter of fact, the UP BJP had charted out a programme through which party ranks including MPs, MLAs and organisational leaders would fan out across the state and oversee the vaccination process, which is seen as a major step to safeguarding the people from the deadly virus. During his earlier visit to Lucknow, Santhosh had not only hailed the the UP government for bringing down the daily Covid count by 93% but had also termed state government's decision to vaccinate parents of children aged below 12 years as "wise" given the chances of a possible third wave which is expected to affect the children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bl-santhosh-praises-yogi-govts-vaccination-feat/articleshow/83794030.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: What felled Ambazari trees? Heavy winds or illegal cutting||NAGPUR: The case of tree felling at Ambazari garden is witnessing a strong discord. While the civic authority has stated that around 58 trees got uprooted due to heavy winds and rainfall that hit the city some days back, environmentalists disagreed, pointing out that significant evidences suggest illegal felling of trees. The case first came to the fore when young green crusader Kunal Mourya along with few others went to Ambazari garden to campaign for saving trees at Ajni Van. Morning walkers informed the activists that some big trees were uprooted by a JCB machine. As reported by TOI, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) has signed an agreement with operator Garuda Amusement (Nagpur) Pvt Ltd to develop fitness, recreational, amusement and tourism facilities at Ambazari garden. On getting this information, TOI last week visited the area along with activists and found clear marks of huge tyres near some uprooted tree bases outside the garden. “It is evident that these trees have not felled naturally. The marks of tyre clearly show that the trees were deliberately felled,” said Mourya. A nearby resident informed that the work of felling the trees was done during the night. “This has been going on since some days. The authorities have closed the garden for general public hence we don’t know what is going on inside. But we are sure that large-scale tree felling is happening inside the garden,” he said, not wanting to be named. Following complaints of activists, the officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) garden department carried out a spot inspection. According to them, few trees outside the garden have been felled using JCB but 58 trees inside “got uprooted due to heavy wind”. Slamming this, environmentalists demanded a spot visit inside the garden. “How can trees inside the garden get uprooted from heavy winds but not in nearby areas? This has been done with mala fide intentions as there is no transparency. When trees on concrete roads are standing tall, how can the ones inside a dense garden fall? It seems that NMC have also become a spokesperson of policy-makers,” said environmentalist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. On Wednesday, Congress MLA from West Nagpur Vikas Thakre visited the spot with MTDC and NMC officials. Speaking to TOI, Thakre said, “The authorities and the private contractor are fooling the public by saying that such large number of trees and Ambedkar Bhavan collapsed after heavy winds. It is not possible. They are misleading the citizens using taxpayers’ money. While trees hold immense environmental importance, the Bhavan too has significant cultural value.” Thakre will be raising the issue with higher authorities. TOI could not contact MTDC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/what-felled-ambazari-trees-heavy-winds-or-illegal-cutting/articleshow/83789729.cms||Manka Behl

The development comes close on the heels of the arrest of two persons on charges of converting over 1,000 persons. ABAP president Narendra Giri said, “Not only external factors, there are fault-lines within us also. We have to find a solution and provide an equal opportunity to all so that such incidents could be stopped.” “Experiences have shown us that those who have been neglected in the mainstream or those who have been treated as outcasts, tend to take refuge in other religions,” Giri told TOI on Wednesday. He added, “Soon, a meeting of the representatives of all the13 akharas would be held and the only agenda would be to ask out disciples and common Hindus to mull over steps for bringing back to the fold those who have changed their religion.” Agreeing to Narendra Giri, chief patron of Juna Akhara — the largest of 13 akharas in terms of membership — Hari Giri said, “We have always advocated welcoming back those who have switched over to other religions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhara-parishad-set-to-take-steps-to-check-conversions/articleshow/83794063.cms||---

Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) officials said these buses will replace the ATAL (aligning transit on all lanes) bus service which had started in the core areas of the city last year, offering a 5km ride for Rs5 per trip. “The new buses are at the regional transport office for fitness tests and certification. We expect these buses to run in the next10-15 days. We are hoping for a good response as the buses are air-conditioned and commuters have to pay a one-time fare of Rs10 for the whole day,” a PMPML official told TOI . The buses will run in the Shivajinagar, Deccan, Pune station, Poolgate and Swargate areas. If a commuter boards the bus at Swargate till Pune station, he will be charged Rs10 for the trip but the ticket will remain valid from 5am till late in the night and each time the commuter uses this specific service, the same ticket will be valid. These buses are expected to decrease people’s dependency on private vehicles, the official said. ‘Coin box’ systemA PMPML official told TOI, “We were testing the system in one of our depots and the trials have been successful.

This is now the situation at private hospitals, a few days after the Centre announced free vaccines for everyone over 18 on June 21. Some city private hospitals that had bought vaccines for paid drives said turnouts have dropped at least 70%. In early June, these big hospitals were vaccinating several thousand people every day. Data from the health department shows the drop. On June 22, 41,520 doses were administered at public centres compared to the 27,860 at private hospital sites. During the first fortnight of June (on days with available data), private hospitals in the region were vaccinating an average of nearly 35,000 people a day. Officials said with 18-44 drives resuming at civic-run sites, the coverage gap between government centres and private hospital sites could widen even more, provided vaccine supply to the district stays steady. Hospital administrators said they are now in a fix. Many private hospitals in the city had paid crores of rupees to procure large volumes of vaccines. Dr Amita Phadnis, director of Oyster N Pearl (ONP) Hospitals, said, “Footfalls for shots have dropped by 70% over the last couple of days. We were vaccinating nearly 400 people every day. On Tuesday, only about 50 people turned up here, compared to the 150 online appointments that were made. This sudden drop is shocking as we had stocked up on thousands of doses. We can't think of procuring more vaccines for now as we’re stocked up. We have to see if the situation changes in the next few days. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Hospital said, “The Centre opened up free jabs for the 18-plus so, beneficiary count has dropped at private centres. Vaccine procurement — at least for a while — will not be feasible for private hospitals. We have 18,000 doses of Covishield with us, with 31,000 doses still to come. It is best to first use this stock. Vaccines purchased are not returnable and cannot be given to a third-party, as per agreement with vaccine manufacturers. So our doses cannot be sent to our sister concern hospital in Sangli, which has so far not received any vaccines.” Dr Oswal said they would not be placing new orders for Covaxin, Sputnik V or Covishield for the time being. Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said the unit opened 500 slots on the CoWIN platform on Tuesday, but had received only about 40 bookings till Wednesday morning. He confirmed that beneficiary count at private hospitals has fallen sharply. He said, “There has been more than a 70% drop in beneficiary footfall. We have around 18,000 doses with us, which we will use for corporate tie-ups as the number of citizens has reduced dramatically. Housing societies’ vaccinations also dropped by 70% after the Centre announced free jabs.” Dr J Ravindranath, director of Poona Hospital and Research Center, said, “We just have to wait and watch. People who don’t want to wait in long queues at government centres may still want to visit private hospitals, including staff of corporates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-free-jabs-start-pvt-hosps-see-major-drop-in-turnouts/articleshow/83791910.cms||Neha Madaan

But due to the pandemic, it is not possible to go door to door to collect data. We will approach the SC again. The Centre should also provide us with the data they have,” said Bhujbal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-again-move-sc-urges-sec-to-put-off-elections/articleshow/83795752.cms||---
---||Pune||Mukundnagar man gets 1st Sputnik V shot in city||Pune: A 36-year-old Mukundnagar resident became the first person to receive the dose of Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V at Galaxy Care hospital in the city on Wednesday, after the facility received its 600 doses late on Tuesday evening. “I was waiting for the Sputnik V vaccine. The two-dose vaccine is given just 21 days apart and it is easier to finish than other vaccines,” he said. The hospital authorities confirmed that a total of 345 doses would be administered to the employees and family members of Dr Reddy's Laboratory in Pune from Wednesday to Friday. The Hyderabad-based pharma company (Dr Reddy’s Laboratories) has tied up with the Russian company for the production and distribution of Sputnik V in India, which received an emergency use authorisation in the country in April. The company has offices in major cities, including Pune, across the country. “The remaining doses of Sputnik V will be offered to general citizens on Monday (June 28) according to the centralised vaccine policy at Rs1,145 per shot,” said the hospital’s medical director, surgeon Shailesh Puntambekar. TOI had reported a week ago that quite a few private hospitals in the city, citing cold storage costs and the cap on per-dose service charge, had either put purchases of Sputnik V on hold or reduced the order significantly. “We have decided to cancel the purchase order for Sputnik V, which we had put on hold a week ago. The cold storage requirements and other expenses exceed the service cap of Rs150,” said Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati Hospital. Before the Centre had announced the service charge cap, Bharati had decided to procure 5,000 doses of the Russian vaccine. Noble Hospital in Hadapsar — one of the trial sites of Sputnik V in India — has decided to drastically reduce its procurement. “Before the cap on the service charge, we had placed an order for 50,000 Sputnik V doses. We have now decided to cut that order to 10,000 doses. The storage and logistical costs have rendered the exercise unviable, even if we try to provide the vaccine on a no-loss and no-profit basis,” said H K Sale, the executive director of Noble Hospital, on Wednesday. Sale said some corporate firms and individuals had made advance payments for Sputnik V. “So, we have to fulfil those commitments,” he said. Representatives from Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH) said they were never considering Sputnik V. “Both Covaxin and Sputnik have a lot of procurement-related issues as both are in short supply. So, we never thought of purchasing them,” said Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, DMH. Sahyadri Hospital authorities confirmed that they were going ahead with the purchase order placed with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories in Hyderabad though. “We are planning for 5,000 Sputnik V doses and may order more. We will not be cancelling the purchase order,” said Ketan Apte, the head of Sahyadri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mukundnagar-man-gets-1st-sputnik-v-shot-in-city/articleshow/83791994.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Coverage picks up as 18+ throng PMR vax centres||Pune: Huge crowds marked the resumption of free vaccines for the 18-44 group on Wednesday, with officials operating as many as 53 civic-run vaccine centres in the region. Beneficiaries reported a heavy rush at the centres. Vijay Jadhav, a resident of Sangvi, said he had to travel to a PMC-run site to get vaccinated as centres across Pimpri Chinchwad limits were closed on Wednesday. But Jadhav, a walk-in, could not get the vaccine. “I will try again on Thursday because vaccination centres in Pimpri Chinchwad will be open. Hopefully, I will get the shot without much hassle,” he said. Due to the high turnouts, the PMC has decided to increase the number of its vaccination sites for Thursday to 56. In Pimpri Chinchwad, the PCMC is all set to resume free drives for its 18-44 population from a total of 45 centres. In a press statement on Wednesday, the PMC said 70% of its doses will be available for those registering on CoWIN, while 30% would be set aside for walk-in registrations. For 45-plus vaccinations (first and second shot) with Covishield, the PMC will operate around five centres. Another 15 have been reserved to provide only Covaxin second doses. The PCMC said that vaccinations for the 18-44 age group will be 50% via CoWIN bookings and rest for walk-ins across its 45 centres. The civic body added that two centres will host Covaxin drives for those who are due for the shot's second dose. A total of 19 centres will offer Covishield for the 45-plus group (both first and second doses). Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said pace of vaccination has picked up in the district. An estimated 60,000 beneficiaries were vaccinated in the district on Wednesday. The CoWIN dashboard showed 90,000 vaccinated, but the number is likely a mix of Tuesday and Wednesday's coverage.As for 45-plus coverage in the district, Pune rural leads with first dose coverage (see box) with 8.06 lakh beneficiaries. The PMC leads in overall second dose coverage.Health officials said more centres may be opened if vaccine supply to the regions improves on the next few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coverage-picks-up-as-18-throng-pmr-vax-centres/articleshow/83791958.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ICU patient bitten by rat at Rajawadi hospital dies||MUMBAI: A day after a patient admitted to the ICU of Rajawadi Hospital (Ghatkopar) was bitten by a rat on his left cheek came to light, he passed away late on Wednesday night, due to deteriorating health. At the civic standing committee meeting on Wednesday, corporators said accountability should be pinned on those responsible for negligence. Kurla resident Shriniwas Yellapa (24) was admitted three days back with liver-related complications and is on ventilator support. On Tuesday, when his sister visited him, she found a bandage under his left eye, and asked about it. Ghatkopar corporator Rakhi Jadhav said he was serious when admitted three days back due to other ailments. Jadhav, who raised a point of order at the meeting, said BMC outsourced the ICU and trauma care management to an NGO. Vinod Mishra (BJP) said an ICU should not have been outsourced. Opposition party leader Ravi Raja (Congress) said a showcause should be served to the NGO. Rajawadi hospital superintendent Dr Vidya Thakur said the patient had alcoholic liver disease and was severely anaemic when admitted. “We explained his condition to the family when admitted,” she said. A doctor said the bite cannot be connected to his death, but “we don’t want to take chances. If the family permits, a post-mortem will be done”. —Richa Pinto||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-icu-patient-bitten-by-rat-at-rajawadi-hospital-dies/articleshow/83794243.cms||Richa Pinto

The police police have registered a case against Sandeep Bagul, Rajendra Jadhav, both residents of Pune, Subhash Ghogre, a resident of Chandrapur, and two other directors of the company. The case was registered on a complaint by Anandrao Sampatrao Raghatate, 61, a resident of Zenda Chowk, Somalwada. According to the police, the company has its office at Ganesham Phase 2 in Pimpri area of Pune. Jadhav and Ghogre used to work for the company. In 2017, the duo met Raghatate and his relatives and lured them into investing money in the company’s scheme by promising to double it in a short time. Raghatate and his relatives reportedly invested Rs28.32 lakh in the scheme. However, the company directors did not return the money to Raghatate and his relatives even after the maturity. Sonegaon police sub-inspector PS Shinde has started investigation and a team will leave for Pune soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/directors-of-pune-firm-dupe-nagpur-citizens-of-rs-28l/articleshow/83789758.cms||---
---||Pune||PCMC seeks support to protect slum residents||PUNE: The PCMC has now decided to focus on vaccinating residents across slums and low-income neighbourhoods. Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner, said the civic body is now seeking out volunteers and citizens groups that can assist with the coverage. As for overall vaccine coverage in the twin towns, Patil said out of the 5.68 lakh target population in the 45-plus group, the PCMC has vaccinated three lakh beneficiaries so far. Asked about keeping up pace of coverage in the 45-plus group - now that vaccination of the 18-44 category has started - Patil said the PCMC will divert larger vaccine stock to cover the older group and set aside small volumes for the younger population. The attention now will be on low-income groups and areas, he said. “We are working on micro-planning of the whole process for this group," he added. Patil said support and contributions from volunteers and citizen groups will help the civic body mobilise teams to cover the low-income areas. "The third wave is expected, which is likely to severely affect the elderly and people with underlying conditions. We have around 3 lakh people in this bracket who face the risk of being left out of coverage. We would seek help from volunteers and civil society to help cover them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-seeks-support-to-protect-slum-residents/articleshow/83791940.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Kochi||PIL seeks ban on WhatsApp||Kochi: A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the high court seeking a ban on WhatsApp if it fails to comply with the new IT rules and modify end-to-end encryption so as to give government agencies access to users’ messages. The PIL was filed by Omanakuttan KG of Amaravathi at Kumily in Idukki. As per the petition, he is a software professional. A division bench led by Chief Justice S Manikumar has posted the case for hearing on June 28. It is alleged by the petitioner that the app is being used by antinational and antisocial elements as messages cannot be traced as the service is end-to-end encrypted. WhatsApp is not cooperating with law enforcement agencies of the country, the petition said. In the petition filed by the company before Delhi High Court, it has stated that it cannot comply with the new IT rules due to end-to-end encryption feature of the app and that the new rules amount to violation of right to privacy, the petition said. However, WhatsApp has a separate privacy policy that complies with the privacy law of Europe. If it is amenable to European laws, why is it not amenable to Indian laws, the petitioner asks in the petition in the high court. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pil-seeks-ban-on-whatsapp/articleshow/83791984.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Congress starts preparations to contest Kolhapur civic polls alone||KOLHAPUR: Congress state president Nana Patole has been talking about the party going solo in all upcoming elections and the leaders from Kolhapur have begun the preparations for local polls. Many political observers have indicated that the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena will not benefit if they contest elections jointly. Last time too, these three parties had contested independently but formed a post-poll alliance to gain power in the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC). Mahadevrao Adgule, senior political observer from Kolhapur city, said, “The civic elections are different from assembly or general elections. A large number of candidates are interested in getting tickets. The parties benefit if they are able to contest on more seats and can also avoid defections.” He added that if the first or second best candidate from a particular ward moves to the opposition camp, then the parties are affected. In Kolhapur, Congress will benefit if it contests alone. The office-bearers of political parties too claim that contesting independently will benefit them. NCP’s city president R K Powar said there is an understanding between all three ruling parties that they can come together after the results. “The seat-sharing is a complex issue. It can lead to bickering. Every party wants to retain and expand its base. This is only possible by contesting alone and fielding candidates on all seats.” In December last year, Congress district president Satej Patil had said, “Leaders of all three parties are convinced that contesting independently is beneficial for all. We were the first to experiment with the idea of Mahavikas Aghadi in KMC much before it was formed at the state level. We contested independently and then formed an alliance later. We will convince our state leaderships to adopt this strategy for KMC .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/congress-starts-preparations-to-contest-kolhapur-civic-poll-alone/articleshow/83787351.cms||---

Dhantoli police have registered a case against Girish Motilal Jaiswal and Ajay Krishnamohan Jaiswal, both residents of Vrindavan Apartment, Laxmi Nagar, under various sections of IPC, including fraud. The case was registered on a complaint lodged by Angad Singh Gambhir Singh Solanki, 69, a resident of Utkarsh Visakha Apartment. Solanki is a retired officer. In 2013, Solanki and 19 other customers booked flats in the Farm City scheme at Gavsi Manapur through the directors of Ashtavinayak Developers. Girish and Ajay took Rs3.27 crore from 20 customers and promised them possession of flats in three years. But even after eight years, neither did Girish and Ajay handed over possession of the flats to the customers, nor did they return the money. Solanki lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing of Nagpur police. Solanki also lodged a complaint against Girish and Ajay with Dhantoli police, which booked the two directors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-firm-dirs-booked-for-duping-20/articleshow/83789752.cms||---
---||Pune||Cheating case: 12 more complaint applications against builder in Pune||PUNE: The economic offences wing of the city police on Wednesday received 12 more complaint applications from depositors against builder Amit Lunkad, taking the total number of such pleas to 35 so far. Lunkad is in magisterial custody following his arrest in a case of alleged cheating of investors. He allegedly failed to deliver on his promise of handsome returns on investments made in his firm, Lunkad Realty. One of the depositors, Sanjay Vilas Honrao (48) of Dattanagar near Katraj, lodged a complaint stating that Lunkad and his representatives had promised returns of 14% per annum to 15% per annum. Not only the firm failed to pay any returns, but also refused to return the initial investment amount, Honrao said. Deputy commissioner of police (EOW), Bhagyashree Navatake, told TOI, “The collective amount of cheating in these 12 applications is worth Rs13 crore. We are also tabulating the amount mentioned in the 23 pleas received earlier. We will investigate the fresh complaint applications along with those we have received in the last two weeks. So far, police have received 35 complaint applications. On Tuesday, a special court (MPID Act) had sent Lunkad to the temporary jail at Yerawada under magisterial custody while denying police plea for seven-day custodial remand. His lawyer told the court that the builder had returned money due to five depositors mentioned in the FIR and was further prepared to return money to all those who approach the realty firm for refund.” The police have invoked charges under Sections 3 and 4 of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID) Act, besides, Sections 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code against Lunkad. An officer with the Lunkad Realty firm told TOI at the police commissioner’s office, “Our firm has decided to return money to investors. We will return 50% of the amount immediately, and the remaining amount in the next few months. Our firm has good assets and investors should not worry much.” Rameshbhai, an investors from Market Yard, told TOI, “I had invested Rs30 lakh in the company four years ago. I regularly received monthly returns, but the company stopped paying returns since January, citing Covid-19 issues and losses. After I submitted a complaint application on Wednesday morning, I received a call from a company representative asking me to visit the firm’s office at Kalyaninagar to receive at least 50% of the amount invested.” TOI visited Lunkad Realty’s Kalyaninagar headquarters on Wednesday evening and found the entry restricted for outsiders to its 15th and 16th floor offices. The building staff said that most employees had left for the day. A call to Lunkad Realty’s HR also did not elicit an official response. “I am not aware of the refund plan to investors. Our directors and owners would be aware of such plans, if any,” an HR representative told TOI. TOI also contacted Amol Lunkad, a director in the firm, but failed to elicit any response, despite multiple attempts. Meanwhile, Lunkad’s lawyer, Sudhir Shah, told TOI, “We could not file a regular bail application today (Wednesday) on behalf of our client as we are awaiting some necessary instructions from the client’s office representatives.” (With inputs from Shiladitya Pandit & Asseem Shaikh)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/12-more-complaint-applications-against-builder/articleshow/83791988.cms||---
---||Pune||Two Pune-Mumbai inter-city trains to resume operations this week||PUNE: The Central Railway has decided to resume the operations of Pune-Mumbai Deccan Queen and Deccan Express trains this week. “After relaxations of the Covid-induced restrictions in the state, the demand for these trains has increased. So, the services are being resumed. Both these trains were suspended because of lack of passengers,” an official with the Pune railway division said. Pune railway division public relations officer Manoj Jhawar told TOI, “Only those having reserved tickets can travel in these two trains. Those on waiting list will not be allowed to travel. Both the trains will run as Covid specials. The Deccan Express will run with train number-01007/01008 and the Deccan Queen’s number will be 02123/02124.” The Deccan Express will have a state-of-the-art Vistadome coach. “It will provide 180° view with rotating seats for passengers. The air-conditioned coach will have a glass dome roof, a single lookout window and a special observation lounge enabling a panoramic view, LED lights and a GPS-based information system. Passengers in this coach will get an attractive view of the ghat section, especially during the monsoon,” another official said. “The Deccan Express will start from Mumbai on June 26 at 7am and reach Pune at 11.05am. From Pune, the train will depart at 3.15pm and reach Mumbai at 7.05pm. The Deccan Queen will start from Mumbai at 5.10pm on June 25 and reach Pune at 8.30pm. On June 26, the train will start from Pune at 7.15am and reach Mumbai at 10.35am,” the official said. In the absence of any inter-city trains from Pune to Mumbai, many passengers were being forced to commute either by buses, cabs or private vehicles — a very costly affair. The railways had suspended the operations of the Deccan Queen on May 14 because of low passenger traffic. Earlier, the operations of other inter-city trains were stopped because of the same reason. Many commuters claimed that the resumption of the two trains would give them a huge relief. “I was waiting for the Pune-Mumbai trains to start. Even with reserved tickets, commuting in trains is cheaper than travelling in a bus or a cab. Taking personal vehicle is out of the question, considering the distance and the high fuel prices,” a daily commuter said. The railway officials stated that the other inter-city trains would be resumed slowly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-pune-mumbai-inter-city-trains-to-resume-operations-this-week/articleshow/83791953.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Case against naval officer after rape complaint||New Delhi: A case of rape has been registered against a serving naval officer after a woman alleged that she was sexually assaulted by him at a naval guest house. The woman told the police that the accused developed a relationship with her on the pretext of marriage, but she recently got to know that he was already married. The woman told the police that the accused officer was posted in Delhi when the incident took place in December 2019. Police said the officer is currently posted in south India and the girl claimed she had met him there as well. The 30-year-old survivor approached the Tilak Marg police station on Saturday to file a complaint. She told police that on one occasion, the accused took her to Kota House and offered her a drink. The drink was allegedly laced with sedatives and the man assaulted her after she was incapacitated. The officer was posted in Delhi at the time of the incident. The woman also alleged that she met the mother of the accused when she visited him in Kerala. However, she recently came across pictures of him on social media that showed he had married someone else. A senior police officer said that the woman’s written complaint states that she was assaulted in the second week of December 2019. “The case was registered last Saturday. The survivor and the accused studied together in Jawaharlal Nehru University. The accused was doing post doctorate and the woman was pursuing her PhD. She said that she was in a relationship with the accused and they had even spoken about the future, but she recently discovered that he got married. Investigations are underway,” said the police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/case-against-naval-officer-after-rape-complaint/articleshow/83792003.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||KV Dham, housing Gyanvapi mosque, to be fortified with advanced security infra||Varanasi: World class facilities at Kashi Vishwanath Dham project to attract global footfalls will comprise an advanced security infrastructure in the corridor leading to the shrine complex, which also houses the 17th century Gyanvapi mosque, which is now drawn into litigation. The project already includes a vast CCTV network for monitoring every corner of the corridor, including the sensitive sites of Vishwanath temple and Gyanvapi masjid. Surveillance equipment, which were earlier not part of the security detail, including doorframe metal detectors (DFMD), hand-held metal detectors (HHMD), woman frisking booths and X-Ray baggage scanners would be installed, said divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal. “Around 31 DFMD, 19 frisking booths for women, 47 HHMD and 11 X-Ray baggage scanners of Rs 5.43 crore would be installed and the request was forwarded to the state government last week,” he said. Advanced DFMDs and woman frisking booths will be placed at entry points of KV Dham, while baggage scanners will be placed at entry points of pilgrim facility centres on the campus, said the commissioner, adding the proposal was forwarded to the government on June 12. When the Ayodhya temple movement picked pace during the Nineties, the Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi complex was declared a highly sensitive site and a standing committee on security was set up after the Babri mosque demolition in 1992. After serial terror attacks in Varanasi between 2005 and 2010, the complex was declared highly sensitive and security plans were revised. A three-layered security is in place under the supervision of an ASP-rank officer. The temple and mosque is guarded by central paramilitary forces in the red zone (inner cordon) while civil police are involved in frisking and crowd regulation. The site already has an intricate network of CCTVs, power sliding gates, bomb disposal squads and fire brigade. On advanced facilities on the campus, police commissioner A Satish Ganesh said the current security plan hammered out by the standing committee is in vogue. “Any change in security detail will be taken after the project is complete,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kv-dham-housing-gyanvapi-mosque-to-be-fortified-with-advanced-security-infra/articleshow/83794101.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore airport expansion: Land to be acquired for Rs 26 crore soon||COIMBATORE: The district administration has decided to use the reserve fund of Rs 26 crore to acquire more land for the much-awaited airport expansion project within the next fortnight. The move has made many land owners, who are affected by the project, happy. Landowners hoped that the district administration would speed up the process and conclude the land acquisition by the end of the year. On Tuesday night, collector G S Sameeran convened a meeting with the special divisional revenue officer incharge of the land acquisition for the airport, Ashokan, district revenue officer Ramaduraimurugan, and airport director R Mahalingam to review the current status of the project. The collector said, “We have Rs 26 crore in our funds. I have asked them to use the same to acquire some land without any litigation issues like from block I and block II in the next fortnight. I have also asked the special DRO incharge of land acquisition to do the needful to get the allotted fund of Rs 1,000 crore released immediately. It is a matter between departments now.” The collector has also ordered to hand over the land already acquired for Rs 90 crore to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) at the earliest. “We have asked the registration offices, which are now giving only 50 tokens a day, to give 100 tokens, allowing all the land owners to transfer the land to the AAI. Some land is stuck in litigations in the high court and Supreme Court. Those cases will be taken up and handled without any delay,” he said. Many landowners heaved a huge sigh of relief. C R Subramanian, former panchayat head from Chinniampalayam, said it was important to complete the land acquisition immediately by making payments to the landowners. “People are in a fix as they know they can’t continue to live here, but don’t have money to buy alternative houses or land. While we can’t buy anything in the surrounding areas such as Sulur, Arasur and Thennampalayam, where land prices have shot up, with the compensation, the wait will be over if they complete the process.” Natesan, another landowner in block VI, said if they get the compensation, though inadequate, they could move on. “We pray it gets over by this financial year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/airport-expansion-land-to-be-acquired-for-rs-26cr-soon/articleshow/83791981.cms||---

The girl wants to be a TikTok star and her mother had scolded her for neglecting studies, police said. Police started searching for her after the mother, who works in a factory manufacturing mobile chargers, filed a missing report on June 18. The next day, the mother got a call from a woman, Shanti Devi, who said she had found the girl at Etawah railway station. Police were informed and a team went to Etawah to bring the girl back. DCP (south) Atul Thakur said that on reaching Etawah, the police had found Shanti Devi’s number switched off. “Using technical surveillance, the team got her address and reached her house in Pilkhor Ekdil village,” Thakur said. However, on reaching the village, the cops found that there were two women by the same name and the woman who probably made the call had left the place long ago. The team contacted the village pradhan and with the help of his local contacts, it was established that Shanti Devi now lives in Etawah City and runs a stall near Sai Mandir. “The team then reached there and located her house. The girl was found and brought back to Delhi,” said the DCP. The girl told police that her mother had opposed her dream of becoming a TikTok star. She said that after reaching Etawah, she came in touch with Shanti Devi at the station. “The girl said she was scared and, hence, went with Shanti Devi,” Thakur said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/12-yr-old-skips-home-as-mom-says-no-to-tiktok-dreams/articleshow/83794183.cms||---

The incident took place on Tuesday evening when the child was outside her home at the Kananwadi village, towards Bhandardara, in Igatpuri. The child received serious injuries on her neck and died while undergoing treatment at the Nashik district civil hospital on Wednesday. Initially, she was taken to nearby rural hospital and, thereafter, shifted to the Nashik district civil hospital here where she died on Wednesday while undergoing treatment. According to the forest officials, the girl and mother were just outside their home which is on the outskirts of the village. A leopard suddenly pounced on the girl and dragged her a few metres away. Her father and mother started shouting as they saw a leopard dragging the child. Villagers who were in the vicinity soon gathered there. The leopard, meanwhile, escaped towards the forest area. The incident has sparked panic in the area. The forest officials said they are in the process of putting up a cage to trap the leopard. Since April last year, six persons have been killed in separate incidents of leopard attacks in the district. There have been many cases leopards being spotted in Nashik, Niphad, Sinnar and Igatpuri talukas and other parts of the district.

The injured is Pratik Raju Desai, 28, a resident of Hilltop. On his complaint, Bajaj Nagar police registered a case against Arjun, Jatin Khedkar, Subash Hidaria and his three accomplices for assembling an illegal group and injuring Desai. According to police, the two groups were arguing over friendship with a girl. On Tuesday, Arjun and Hidaria invited Pratik to meet him at a restaurant. “At the restaurant, they told Pratik not to talk to the girl and also threatened him of dire consequences,” police said. Pratik refused to budge, which led Arjun and his accomplices to assault him with a cricket bat and sticks. On getting information, Bajaj Nagar police reached there and took control of the situation. Police have also booked Pratik for beating up Arjun.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Sister-in-law, whose body was mutilated, recorded audio of her own, mother’s killing||NAGPUR: Amisha Bobde, whose complicated relationship with her brother-in-law Alok Maturkar led him to murder five family members late on Sunday night, ended up audio recording her own killing, and also of her mother. Maturkar’s extreme emotions for Amisha also led him to cut up her breasts before stuffing the pieces back into her brassiere, and also stab her multiple times on the private parts after killing her. Cops believe Amisha’s murder was planned since April, when she lodged a complaint against Maturkar at Tehsil police station. Maturkar had ordered knives online in April and received delivery in the first week of May. He used those knives to murder Amisha, Laxmibai and his wife Vijaya, who had eloped and married him when still in her teens. On Sunday night, at 11.03pm, Amisha had sent a message to an uncle, stating Maturkar, whom she called ‘Takla’ (bald), had come and was seated in front. The audio clip in her cellphone begins at 11.05pm. The audio recorded a scuffle between the two before she was murdered and savaged sometime between 11.05pm and 11.45pm. After murdering her, Maturkar removed the SIM from her phone, ending the recording 27 minutes after it started, giving the biggest clue to reconstruct the crime scene. The audio indicates Maturkar killed his mother-in-law Laxmibai when she came in and started howling on seeing Amisha’s body. In the next few hours, Maturkar killed his wife and two children also before ending his own life. The preliminary post mortem report suggested Amisha was throttled first and then stabbed to death. Senior officers believe Maturkar had sex with the body before mutilating it. Vaginal swabs were also collected from Laxmibai’s body to rule out sexual assault on her too. CP Amitesh Kumar said Amisha had blocked Maturkar on her cellphone. “There were two calls from Laxmibai's cellphone to Maturkar’s number lasting 27 seconds,” he said. “Maturkar may have used Laxmibai’s phone to make calls to himself, to create the impression she called him to say something. Maturkar seems to have tried to mislead police and sneak away quietly,” said the top cop. Maturkar may also have fought with his wife before the murder. “We are conducting DNA test of Maturkar’s daughter (Pari) to confirm her paternity. Pari’s brutal murder with a hammer, with hand and feet bound, may mean Maturkar suspected he was not her father,” he said. Maturkar had used a pillow to smother his 10-year-old son Sahil. Police said Amisha had a number of male friends, which Maturkar opposed forcefully, paving way for bitterness between the two. Cops are also trying to find out whether Maturkar drugged his wife and children through food or otherwise before murdering them. “We feel Maturkar’s wife and son had consumed food laced with sedatives, but daughter was awake, so he tied her up before murdering,” said a cop. It has come to fore Maturkar’s fortunes had dipped in the lockdown. Unable to repay housing loans, his property in Amravati had been seized by the bank, which forced Maturkar to shift to Nagpur last year. Here he fell in love with Amisha, before their relationship turned from consent to confrontations. Dr Makrand Vyawahare, head of the department of forensics, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital, was also present at the spot along with his team. A team of doctors including Parshuram Brahmne, Rajat Bamnet, Bunty Manpiya and Prashant Samudre assisted senior forensic experts in the autopsy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sis-in-law-whose-body-was-mutilated-recorded-audio-of-her-own-mothers-killing/articleshow/83789787.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Delhi||Court Denies Anticipatory Bail To Two Rape Accused||New Delhi: Referring to a woman’s specific allegations of rape, physical and mental torture against two men, a Delhi court has refused them anticipatory bail. Dealing with their contentions that the woman had filed a false case owing to her employer’s feud with the men, additional sessions judge Ravinder Bedi noted, “The complainant being one of such employees and a lady is not expected to expose herself to ridicule and to be defamed at the cost of putting her chastity and reputation in jeopardy.” The order also took note of the complainant’s version indicating “very direct and serious allegations” against the two men that required investigation, including custodial interrogation. “In case, the applicants are given the concession of bail, police would be deprived of interrogating and effectively investigating the matter of heinous offence of gang rape and the same would adversely affect and weaken the case of prosecution, which to my mind, is not legally permissible,” the judge noted. In the complaint filed on April 15, 2021, the woman alleged that both men were known to her employer and frequently visited the office and told her that they could get her a better paying job. On one occasion on finding her boss wasn’t around, they sexually assaulted her, she alleged. The woman, owing to her reputation, did not report the incident but when they assaulted her for the second time, she decided to take action. The counsel appearing for the two men denied the allegations arguing that the case was the result of a legal proceeding initiated by the company of the applicants against the woman’s employer. It was argued that the applicants did not even know the complainant. The FIR was stated to be full of lies, filed on the basis of the woman’s motive to defame the applicants. The counsel pointed out the company’s office, which was the place of incident, bustled with customers all the time and the alleged gangrape would have not gone unnoticed by other employees or customers. Without getting into the merits of the case, the court held that prima facie the argument that the FIR was a result of the legal battle did not “seem to hold water” for it had come on record that the company had over 200 employees and the woman being one such employee wouldn’t subject herself to ridicule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-two-rape-accused/articleshow/83792070.cms||Aamir Khan
---||Pune||ICMR to test efficacy of vaccines against Delta+||Pune: The Indian Council of Medical Research is currently examining how effective the country’s vaccines are against the Delta-plus variant of SARS-CoV-2. Dr Samiran Panda, an ICMR scientist, said the research body is closely monitoring neutralization capabilities of antibodies drawn from vaccine recipients. He said results of the investigations should be out soon. “We are examining (virus) samples drawn from various regions to see if they get neutralized by serum from vaccine recipients. Let’s hope the vaccine effectiveness continues against this variant too,” he said. He added that states should implement strict containment around infection clusters involving Delta-plus and continue to quarantine close contacts and improve vaccination pace in regions with the new variant. Virologist Dr T Jacob John said, so far, all Variants of Concern are being neutralized by antibodies generated in response to the “founder variant” that caused the first wave of Covid . Essentially, he said vaccines made using the early variants are still successful. “So, it can be said immunity produced by all the vaccines can protect against Delta-plus,” he added. Dr John said cases linked to Delta-plus are still few in number and it's unclear if its transmission efficiency is the same, or more than the Delta variant. “Delta-plus should remain on our radar. We must avoid the blunder we made with Delta, which was detected in December last year and not followed up until it came as the second wave,” he said, adding there shouldn’t be anxiety. “After all, we are calling them ‘variants’ and not ‘strains’. So all vaccines should offer some protection,” he said. In Maharashtra, which has reported 21 cases involving Delta-plus, local health officials and district surgeons have been asked to follow a five-pronged strategy in regions reporting a ‘Variant of Interest’ or ‘Variant of Concern’ of the coronavirus. Health officials have been asked to collect vaccination history of patients, possible reinfection data, trace close contacts of index cases, conduct ILI-SARI surveillance and monitor breakthrough cases. State Covid task force member Dr Shashank Joshi on Wednesday said it's still too early to tell if Delta-plus is an alarming development. “We do need better genomic surveillance on vaccine breakthrough infections and that is being carried out,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-to-test-efficacy-of-vaccines-against-delta/articleshow/83792037.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Nagpur||Nagpur university panel confirms manipulation in MBA exam at Gondia college||NAGPUR: An inquiry committee constituted by Nagpur University (NU) has found manipulation in the MBA examination held at a college in Gondia, senior officials confirmed. Subsequently, NU decided to cancel all papers held by the college and schedule their re-exams shortly. The panel headed by commerce faculty dean Sanjay Kavishwar and Management Council member Urmila Dabir submitted its fact-finding report a couple of days back to vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari. The report indicted a teacher from ‘Kirsan Mission’s College of Management’ allegedly demanding a bribe from students to clear the papers held from May 12 to 18. After NU had entrusted colleges to hold postgraduate exams due to Covid-19 situation, the college teachers had set, conducted and evaluated the papers. Quoting complaints filed by the students, TOI had reported how the teacher had allegedly forced them to shell out money for passing them with flying colours. Some of them had even paid the amount to the teacher. While refusing to divulge details of the probe panel report, NU Board of Examination and Evaluation director Prafulla Sable told TOI that NU had decided to conduct re-exam of all students, as per the committee’s recommendations. “The panel questioned all the stakeholders, including the principal and students based on complaints for over two weeks. Even the teacher who is under the scanner for demanding bribe, was also questioned. With a view that students shouldn’t be put at loss, we have decided to conduct their re-exam where paper setting and evaluation would be done by NU.” The director added the panel report would be tabled before BoEE for further action. “It was found that the accused teacher wasn’t on the college’s direct rolls. We also checked all our records and his name wasn’t found. It’s now up to the BoEE members to make the decision based on the panel's recommendations. The BoEE will soon conduct its emergent meeting in this regard.” Sable, however, made it clear that NU wouldn’t be lodging any police complaint against the teacher and it was the college’s job. “At the most BoEE can recommend any action against the college, but police complaint is out of NU’s jurisdiction,” he said As per NU officials, the college denied its involvement in any wrongdoings and disowned the teacher. “Even the teacher concerned had categorically denied the charges. He said he had asked money from the students for some other work and not for clearing the papers. He offered various excuses when questioned by the panel. The panel had asked the college’s management to take care that students, who lodged a complaint against the accused, are not harassed.” The officials said BOEE can impose a hefty penalty on college management for the incident and even recommend action like disaffiliation. “Since its management members are affiliated to one of the ruling parties in the government, the college would be let off with minor punishment,” they said, adding that NU administration was under pressure in acting against the college. # Probe panel’s findings * Prima facie teacher demanded bribe from students * Calls made by him to students were also confirmed * He denied demanding bribe saying he sought money for other works * Exams were manipulated, NU must conduct re-exam at the earliest * NU and college to take precautions that complainants aren’t harassed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-panel-confirms-manipulation-in-mba-exam-at-gondia-college/articleshow/83789847.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The traders are upset that their demand — seeking permission to operate the shops at least on an odd-even basis — has received no positive response. The shops have been shut since the past 88 days due to the Covid restrictions. Recently, district guardian minister Satej Patil had assured the traders that he would discuss their demand with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. However, for the past two days, there has been no update. Sanjay Shete, the president of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said, “We will not worry about the positivity and oxygen bed occupancy rates. Whatever they may be, we will open the shops from Monday. We will also not be approaching any authority seeking help. The traders have been facing innumerable problems and they cannot afford to keep their shops closed.” The officials have been telling the traders that soon the district’s positivity rate will drop below 10% and the district will enter Level 3 of Covid restrictions. Non-essential shops will then be allowed to open for a limited period. The traders claim that they have been listening to such assurance for the past two weeks, however, the district continues to be in Level 4. The traders are told informally to wait for a few more days. However, the traders said there is a weekend lockdown already in place and only two days are left before that kicks in — Thursday and Friday. That is why they have decided to reopen the shops from Monday. Meanwhile, the level of Covid restrictions for the district for the next week will be fixed on Thursday as the state public health department will release the Covid positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-traders-to-reopen-shops-from-monday/articleshow/83787478.cms||---

The Dharapuram police said they nabbed A Veeraprabhu, a native of Sivaganga district, based on a tip that he was smuggling liquor into the district by taking an alternative route to avoid check posts on the district border. “We nabbed him at Upputhuraipalayam at 6.30pm on Tuesday. He had bought 12 boxes of liquor bottles from Ottanchatram in Dindigul and was carrying them in a car. He is employed with a bar in the Tirupur city police limits,” a cop said.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: If Maha Vikas Aghadi can’t bring stay on bypolls, BJP to field only OBC candidates, says Mungantiwar||NAGPUR: The BJP would field only OBC candidates in the upcoming bypolls for five zilla parishads (ZP) and 33 panchayat samitis (PS) on July 19, if the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) fails to bring stay from the Supreme Court on the election, said former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on Wednesday. The election would be held for 70 seats in five ZPs of Nagpur, Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola and Washim, and 130 in 22 PS. The counting would take place the next day. Addressing a press conference here, the senior BJP leader gave information about the party’s proposed statewide Chakka Jam on June 26 against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray-led state government’s “failure to defend the Maratha and OBC reservations in Maharashtra”. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis would lead the Chakka Jam on Saturday at Variety Square at 10.30am in presence of top party leaders from the city. “It would be a warning for all three constituents of the MVA government to make efforts to stay the bypolls. The government urgently needs to file a review petition in the apex court and rope in 100 lawyers for defending the reservation offered to OBC. If it fails to do so, the BJP will grant tickets to only OBC candidates on all these seats to express solidarity.” Accompanied by BJP city chief Pravin Datke, MLAs Krishna Khopde and Vikas Kumbhare and other BJP leaders, the Ballarpur MLA called on leaders and activists from other parties to join them in the Chakka Jam to get justice for the OBCs. “This government has totally failed in providing justice to the backward communities. It failed to defend Maratha and OBC reservations and promotion in government posts. All these deprived sections of society would teach a befitting lesson to Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress,” he said. Accusing the government of passing the buck on Centre for its failures, Mungantiwar said MVA was unnecessarily blaming the NDA government for not providing an empirical date from the 2011 census. “Even the government can gather that data by spending some money. It could be gathered easily just like a poll survey. It was the BJP government which had granted reservation to the Marathas and OBCs and defended it in the Bombay high court. We were the only one to form an independent department for the OBCs as we believe in justice for all.” ‘Monsoon session should be of 3 weeks’ Flaying the Thackeray government for conducting the assembly session for just two days on July 5 and 6, Mungantiwar stated it wasn’t serious about discussing the issues affecting the people. “Monsoon sessions are usually conducted for four weeks. Considering the Covid-19 pandemic, they should at least hold it for three weeks. There are many issues, including those of farmers and on reservations, needed to be discussed to provide relief to the people.” Speaking on the ever-rising fuel prices, he added the state needs to reduce GST on petrol and diesel to bring down their rates. “The prices are rising due to decontrolling of fuel by former Congress government under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/if-mva-cant-bring-stay-on-bypolls-bjp-to-field-only-obc-candidates-mungantiwar/articleshow/83789852.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Convincing people to step out and donate is tough, but Sri keeps on persuading them till her earnest efforts to help the needy patients are realised. With the shortage of blood, platelets, white blood cells for surgeries, ECMO and lung transplants, volunteers and blood banks run pillar to post to fulfil the needs of patients when the Covid-19 wave II was at its peak. Undeterred Sri put in requests to the government to help her organise blood donation camps a day or two prior to planned vaccination drives. She provides PPE kits to Asha workers, who take up household surveys. “In March 2021, I tested positive. And then wave II was on the rise. I initially did a couple of forwards, retweets etc. But then the seriousness kicked in when a gentleman based in London approached me in DM requesting an oxygen bed for his mother,” Sri, who is popular as Telugu Ammayi (Telugu girl) in social media circles told TOI. Sri believes that if there is a request on Twitter, it literally means one has exhausted every other source outside. That's when I started volunteering. I picked up every possible request for concentrators, cylinders, beds, nursing help at home. “Then came a request from for three siblings (they had lost their parents two years ago), where we couldn't save, the elder brother and sister but were able to bring back the little sister. She keeps asking me why she was saved. We are still connected and there is a lot of emotional support that she needs,” Sri said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/techie-convinces-people-how-donations-during-pandemic-can-help-save-lives/articleshow/83792066.cms||Syed Akbar

Authorities started the repair work at 10 pm on Wednesday. “Lake Line Range Road (LLRR) on A1 Defence land connects Lake Line Ranges to Hanuman temple gate of Secunderabad Military Cantonment. The road is frequently used by military personnel for training and had deteriorated over a period of time. This is said to benefit both the defence personnel as well as civilians,” Army officials said in a statement. As the road was completely neglected, the 2-km stretch now has potholes the size of craters and many two-wheeler riders have met with accidents. All motorists, including ambulances, faced extreme hardship due to the pot holes. During the GHMC election last year, Malkajgiri MLA M Hanumantha Rao was cornered by protestors holding a banner ‘No Road, No Vote’. After multiple meetings and representations by the MLA, residents and GHMC to the military authorities, Indian Army officials in New Delhi gave consent to local authorities to finally take up the repair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pothole-ridden-road-finally-gets-paved/articleshow/83792122.cms||---

The Thudiyalur all-woman police said the accused, Kathiravel Anand, a native of Karnataka, was in a relationship with the minor girl, a school dropout, for the past couple of months. A police officer said Anand had moved to Vinobhaji Nagar at Mettupalayam from Karnataka for work. “He fell in love with the girl, who was living with her mother after her father’s death, a few months ago. They eloped a few weeks ago, got married in a temple and moved to a house at Narasimanaickenpalayam.” The officer said the girl’s mother hadn’t lodged any compliant as Anand was from the same community. “But Anand’s relatives alerted the locals about the relationship and the latter informed the Child Welfare Committee about the marriage.” The Child Welfare Committee subsequently lodged a complaint with the Thudiyalur all-woman police, who with the help of the Mettupalayam police arrested Kathiravel from his workplace at Karamadai on Tuesday. “We have booked him under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Prevention of Child Marriage Act, 2006. We have rescued the girl and lodged her in a government home for counselling and a few medical tests.,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/guest-worker-held-for-marrying-minor/articleshow/83792125.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Each jab counts: Vax wastage in Uttar Pradesh drops to 1% from 8% in March||LUCKNOW: Even as many states continue to grapple with the problem, Uttar Pradesh has managed to drastically bring down vaccine wastage from 8.5% in March to current levels of about 1%, as per official data. According to health agencies across the world, vaccine wastage includes shots which are discarded, lost, damaged or destroyed during immunisation campaigns. Though it is an expected component of any drive, vaccine wastage beyond a permissible limit can adversely affect the programme. Experts believe that vaccine wastage may inflate demand and trigger unnecessary procurement, and in a country like India where such a huge population is to be vaccinated, every single dose matters. The state government decided to bring down vaccine wastage to as low as possible after Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged the issue in March. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath reviewed vaccine wastage in the state and directed officials to bring it down from 8.5% in March to 5% by April. In subsequent reviews, the CM continued to insist on zero wastage. The state health department officials discussed the issue with partner organisations like UNICEF, WHO, UNDP and others to identify the reasons behind vaccine wastage. After brainstorming, UP checked wastage at all the three levels – during transportation, at cold chain point, and at vaccination sites. Interventions were made both at service and delivery levels and judicious use of the available stock and improvisation at vaccination sites helped in checking wastage. Officials associated with the vaccination campaign said the wastage was divided into two categories –sealed and open vials. “In case of sealed vials, wastage is caused due to expiry, exposure to heat, freezing of vials, breakage, wrong entries, theft and discarding of vials at vaccination site,” a senior officer said. He added that in case of open vials, wastage was due to leftover stock, poor micro-planning and non-availability of people to utilise the available stock, besides poor handling and administration practices. Officials said sessions were planned and vials were opened only as per registrations. “For onsite arrangements, centres were advised not to open the vials if they do not have a minimum of 10 persons. Vaccinators were also made accountable for wastage which worked well. They were also imparted supplementary training to ensure precision,” an official said. Monitoring of sites, even random assessment, were increased to ensure that interventions were on track. Health officer, Unicef UP, Dr Praful Bharadwaj said: “Wastage of a dose in a way means denial to someone eligible somewhere. Rising up to the occasion, policy-makers in Uttar Pradesh came up with solutions. Credit also goes to vaccination teams in the field for diligent execution of plans.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/each-jab-counts-vax-wastage-in-up-drops-to-1-from-8-in-mar/articleshow/83794310.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Mandhare has ordered that no excavation for minor minerals will be allowed at any of these places if they are in protected areas, forts, heritage sites, or where such activity is likely to damage the ecological balance of the areas. The directions came from the collector at first meeting of the minor mineral task force formed in the district for sustainable development and balance of the environment. The collector pointed out that the decision related to excavation of minor minerals would be taken in the restricted areas, moderately allowed areas and the open areas on case-on-case basis with the help of all the members. He underlined that any proposal about such work or development would be discussed thoroughly and in a transparent manner along with the developers and even the activists in the interest of the public, the environment and the relevant experts. Small groups would also be formed form the task force that would time and again review the development on the various issues that have been discussed and decided upon by the task force.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court flags concern over students’ safety||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday expressed serious concern over the safety of children, particularly those studying in classes I to IX, if the state government goes ahead with its plans to reopen educational institutions from July 1. Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy sought to know from the government whether it was making physical attendance compulsory for kids. The bench posed several questions to advocate general BS Prasad while resuming hearing in a batch of Covid-19 related PILs filed by advocates Sameer Ahmad, P Thirumala Rao, and a couple of others. On the instructions of the AG, school education department secretary Sandeep Kumar Sultania attended the virtual hearing and said the government was preparing the modalities and guidelines for running the schools offline. “We will run the classes with the consent of parents,” he said. Senior counsel L Ravi Chander said a GO was issued for reopening the schools and colleges, but the government did not mention anything about the attendance. The judges sought to know from Sultania whether the government was making the attendance mandatory. He replied that the consent of parents was crucial and that they were in the process of preparing the modalities. At this, the judges wondered if the government had announced its decision without doing groundwork. “This is a knee-jerk reaction. Parents have apprehensions. You (government) should not insist on parents to send their wards, particularly those below class X, to schools compulsorily. See which way the wind is blowing. Draw your policy keeping in view the children’s well-being,” the judges said. The judges said the students do not know how to maintain social distance and frequent sanitising. “Post the second wave, many cities are still dithering. As the second wave has left a trail of devastation, damage and caused loss of lives, parents are more apprehensive now,” they said, echoing the sentiments of the parents. Sultania said schools and colleges were reopened after the first wave was over in February and March this year. “It was not compulsory at that time also. What was compulsory was not the attendance but the consent of the parents. This time too, it won’t be any different,” he said. Responding to a query from counsel Chikkudu Prabhakar who said the lives of students will be at risk if they were forced to go to schools now, the judges said they will give time to the government to prepare its policy and then examine it. Ravi Chander urged the court to give a direction to the government to continue the online mode even after reopening of the schools. Director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao informed the court they had categorised all teachers and lecturers as high-risk groups and would soon vaccinate all of them. “The combined strength of teachers and non-teaching staff in schools and colleges will be more than five lakhs and we will soon provide vaccination to all of them,” he said. The judges also directed the state government to create a separate mechanism to attend to the needs of those who slipped into depression or suffering from mental disorders during the isolation and also to attend to the increased cases of domestic violence during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hc-flags-concern-over-students-safety/articleshow/83795863.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Acting on a tip-off, the cops raided Hotel New Relax Inn late on Tuesday night and arrested three men involved in the illegal flesh trade. “We found two women inside the hotel in suspicious condition. We questioned them following which they revealed to us about the prostitution racket,” SOG sleuths said. During further investigations, the cops learnt that the mastermind of the racket used to bring women from Maharashtra to the city. The cops have arrested Ramesh Dabhi, who is manager of Hotel New Relax Inn, Praveen Gohil, a resident of Makarpura and Devraj Kapdi, resident of Old Padra Road but originally a native of Maharashtra. The fourth accused Kachru Lalji, a resident of Rajasthan, is declared wanted. According to the police, the accused used to run the racket through a website. Once the user visits the website, he is given a Whatsapp number on which he is asked to send a message. The user then receives photographs of women through Whatsapp. After the customer selects the girl, he is given the address of the hotel where he can meet her. The customer then makes payment to the hotel manager who directs him to the room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/prostitution-racket-busted-in-posh-hotel-of-vadodara/articleshow/83787218.cms||---
---||Delhi||Miyawaki technology to help develop urban forests in 2,200 sqm land in east Delhi||NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has launched an ecosystem restoration initiative with the help of an NGO Green Yatra. The civic body is planning to develop urban forests on vacant land space using Miyawaki technology. EDMC has identified a 2,200 sq metre land parcel at Gharoli village near Mayur Vihar Phase III, where 7,000 saplings were planted on Wednesday. The Miyawaki method, also called the potted seedling method, is an afforestation technique that uses native plant species along with components such as perforators, water retainers, organic manure and mulch. The method guarantees high survival and 20 times higher growth rate of trees. “We have chosen 26 native species in the right mix to create a four-layered system of shrubs, sub-tree level, tree layer and canopy layer. After treating the soil, plants are packed closely so that vertical growth takes place rather than horizontal growth, eventually creating a mini self-sustaining ecosystem. There are three-four plants per square metre,” said EDMC horticulture director Raghwendra Singh. Singh said that for its part, the NGO has dug the land around three feet in depth and placed nutritional elements such as coco peat, rice barn, compost, cow dung, nutritional soil before covering the ditch with soil. “Regarding water supply, we have made arrangements from neighbouring parks and if required, the staff will supply water through tankers,” he said. Some of the species of trees planted are lemon, pilkhan, mango, shisham, peepul, Ashok, neem, pomegranate, Indian gooseberry, jackfruit, etc. A similar project at Ghazipur landfill last year has seen success after ,000 saplings of 40 native Indian species were planted using the Miyawaki method over a 450 square metres by the corporation’s engineering department. “The horticulture department is now planning to develop more urban forests on the other side of the Ghazipur landfill using the same technology and the exercise will start next week. Considering the monsoon will arrive anytime soon, this would be the appropriate time to carry out such drives,” said an EDMC official. The same methodology was used earlier near Barapullah drain at Sarai Kale Khan to reclaim a swampy sewage area and turn it into a carbon sink.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/miyawaki-tech-to-help-develop-urban-forests-in-2200-sqm-land-in-east-delhi/articleshow/83792206.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No 14% hike in property tax rates this year, civic panel rejects proposal||MUMBAI: The civic standing committee on Wednesday rejected the BMC’s proposal for an around 14% hike in property tax rates in Mumbai. With stern opposition from the BJP and the Congress, the Shiv Sena moved a motion to merely “record” the proposal and have it cleared by the standing committee. A motion to “record” the proposal to hike property tax was moved by Shiv Sena corporator Vishakha Raut. Once a proposal is recorded, it usually goes into cold storage and is not revived.  The BMC wanted to hike the property tax rates by 14% by proposing to calculate based on new ready reckoner (RR) rates. Political observers say with BMC elections just six months away, the proposed hike had turned into a political hot potato, especially for Shiv Sena which is the ruling party in the BMC and part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. With revision of taxes based on current RR rates, the BMC wanted to hike the tax for all properties by around 14%. The current property tax rates are calculated on RR rates for 2015. Now, though, the BMC wants to revise the calculation based on the current RR rates. “The BMC reduced premiums for builders in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown and even hotels and restaurants were given a kindness package by means of a waiver in property tax. But the BMC wanted to hike the property tax of the common man,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. Congress corporator Ravi Raja who had first opposed the hike said the proposal must be rejected permanently and not just merely till the BMC polls, scheduled in February 2022. “The BMC must reduce the property tax for middle-class homes instead of hiking it. Many have suffered a loss in income due to Covid-19-induced lockdowns and they must be given relief. The BMC has given relief to contractors too but none to common citizens,” Raja said. BMC officials said the revision in property tax rates took place in 2015. According to the amendment made in Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, the revision in property tax rates is carried out once in five years and usually at the end of the five-year term. The fresh revision was scheduled for 2020-25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-14-hike-in-property-tax-rates-this-yr-civic-panel-rejects-proposal/articleshow/83793094.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh disburses Rs 2,505-crore loans to 31,500 MSME units||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath disbursed loans worth Rs 2,505 crore to 31,542 MSME units on Wednesday, as part of the 'Online Swarozgar Sangam'. The online loan mela was the first to be organised this year and the CM has directed officials to hold one such mela in each district within the next one month. In an interaction with beneficiaries of the scheme, the CM asked them about their projects for which loans had been taken. He then gave tool kits to five beneficiaries under the Vishwakarma Shram Samman Scheme and virtually launched common facility centres under the one district-one product scheme in nine districts including Bhadohi, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Mirzapur, Mainpuri, Mau, Agra, Bijnor and Muzaffarnagar. The cost of these CFCs is Rs 73.54 crore. Additional Chief Secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal said that this was the first such online loan fair organised this year and in 2020, the government had helped more than 34,000 MSME units get loans of Rs 73,000 crore. Declaring that the government was on the verge of giving freedom to people from the second wave, the CM said that despite all the effort by the central and state governments, many people got infected and several people lost their loved ones to the illness. “If vaccinations did not start in India on January 16, imagine how our health workers would have dealt with the second wave. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s far-sightedness should be commended in which he started vaccination for doctors, frontline workers and health workers in January itself,” he said. The CM said that despite Covid-19, the state government ensured that livelihoods were not affected and during the second wave, decided to implement a Corona curfew during which essential services, industrial activity and agricultural work were allowed to continue. “UP has a lot of potential and only needs a platform. During the first wave, 40 lakh migrant workers returned to UP and only 10% of them went back to other states after the lockdown eased. This March those people also returned and have found jobs here itself,” the CM said, adding that despite the largest population in the country and the most number of youth, UP had the lowest level of unemployment with the government having given employment to 1.5 crore people. He said that for money to increase, it needs to be in circulation and therefore, to ensure that businesses continued to run, his government worked with the state level bankers committee to provide easy loans to entrepreneurs. The CM also commended the participation of women in the self-employment programmes and said that this would strengthen the government’s Mission Shakti programme for women empowerment. “Women have shown great enthusiasm in self-employment programs. Today, the youth in the state is focusing on creating job opportunities rather than running after jobs. Schemes like the PM Employment Generation Programme, Mukhyamantri Yuva Swarozgar Yojana, ODOP have provided support to the youth,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-disburses-rs-2505-crore-loans-to-31-5k-msme-units/articleshow/83794348.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The eight-member committee comprises Dr S Manoharan, former additional director, animal husbandry department, joint director, animal husbandry, Ooty, a veterinary scientist from TANUVAS, Namakkal, a representative from Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), the Nilgiris chapter, Boominathan, Landscape coordinator, WWF, Kalidasan, Osai environmental organization, B Ramakrishnan, assistant professor, wildlife biology, Ooty government arts college and a NGO to be nominated by the National Tiger Conservation Authority(NTCA). None of the forest officials is part of the committee. The Madras high court had held that an elephant captured for providing medical treatment should ultimately be let back into the wild and that the forest department should not hold it in permanent captivity. “The elephant is being provided with a special diet and oral medication at the kraal. To decide on the further course of action regarding its treatment, or release in the wild or semi-wild conditions, holistic, multi–faceted, independent expert advice is a must. Hence the committee has been formed,” Kaushal said. The committee is requested to submit its report at the earliest but not later than three weeks from the date of the issuance of this order. The trunk of Rivaldo, 35, was cut in an unknown incident in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/8-member-panel-formed-to-decide-on-rivaldo/articleshow/83792187.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana government caps Covid treatment rates||HYDERABAD: Ambulance rates for inter-state travel will henceforth be double and a patient on a ventilator will have to pay up to Rs 9,000 as the Telangana government on Wednesday announced revised tariffs for Covid-19 patients, even as it asked hospitals to stop experimental treatment and unnecessary investigations. While the basic charges largely remain unchanged, a minimum of Rs 2,000 for an ambulance with basic life support (Rs 75 per kilometre) and Rs 3,000 for an ambulance with advanced life support (Rs 125 per kilometre) was fixed. This will hurt the pockets of long-distance patients by at least two to three times more than the current charges, which hover at Rs 12,000- Rs 20,000 for long-distance travel. Going by the new tariff policy, now, an ambulance with advanced support coming from Adilabad to Hyderabad (300 km) would cost Rs 3,000 basic charges plus Rs 37,500 travel expense. “Currently a patient coming from Nalgonda might be paying Rs 20,000 on the higher side for an ambulance with advanced life support. But now, the per kilometre rate will take the cost to Rs 40,000- Rs 50,000, including fumigation charges, driver charges etc which are not mentioned,” said Sai Teja from Feed the Needy NGO, involved in transporting patients during the pandemic. “The capping should have been made based on distance, instead of kilometre wise rates,” Teja added. Tariff charges of Rs 4,000 for regular bed, Rs 7,500 for ICU (Intensive Care Unit) care and Rs 9,000 for ICU care with ventilator, have been capped as the upper limit. “Capped rates for treatment, however, are not applicable to patients subscribing insurance scheme as well as patients being treated under various agreements/ MoUs entered into with the hospitals by sponsored groups or corporate entities,” said one official. “Interventional procedures (not limited to) central line insertion, chemoport insertion, bronchoscopic procedures, biopsies, ascitic/ pleural tapping etc may be charged at the rack rates as on December 31, 2019. High-end drugs like immunoglobulins, meropenem, parenteral nutrition, tocilizumab etc to be charged at MRP (maximum retail price),” read the order issued on Wednesday. The health department also warned hospitals against any experimental treatment. “All the private hospitals shall follow the treatment guidelines issued from time to time by the government of India/ state government strictly. The hospitals shall refrain from experimental treatment, unnecessary investigations, repeated HRCTs and inflammatory markers are to be avoided. Admissions and discharge protocols shall be followed scrupulously. Non-compliance shall attract action as per the provision of law,” read the order issued by Syed Ali Murtuza Rizvi, health secretary. The super-speciality hospitals association, however, said there was no clarity right now on whether the rules also apply to corporate hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-caps-covid-treatment-rates/articleshow/83795899.cms||Amrita Didyala

Snake rescuers in Kolhapur said they are getting several calls daily and the spotting of venomous snakes in the city areas. The snake friends have appealed to citizens to stay alert and call snake friends or forest helpline for rescue operations instead of killing the snake. Dhananjay Namjoshi, a snake rescuer, said, “Rainy season is the mating period of the snakes and as water enters the holes, these snakes come out. They seek proper shade and take shelter below wooden logs or under stored bricks, tiles.” He added that snakes are ectothermic, which means their body heat is produced from outside heat and with monsoon, the temperature drops in the snake holes and forces the snakes to come out for heat generation. “I get at least four-five rescue calls daily these days. It is true for all of us who work in this field,” Namjoshi said. Indian Cobra, Common krait, Russell viper, saw scaled viper are some of the poisonous snakes found in the urban areas, along with non-poisonous snakes like rat snake, checkered keelback, Grass snake, wolf snake, common kukri snake, trinket, Bronze back. Road kill of snakes is also on a higher side in monsoons. Umakant Chavan, a snake expert, said, “I had done a study on road kill of snakes for three years. It was found that in monsoon the count of snakes in road kill is maximum. The ghat sections only in the western Maharashtra see around 6 lakhs snake road kill every year. Unfortunately, not much of records or data work is done on road kill.” If people spot a snake, then can call a toll-free helpline number (1926) of forest department for snake rescue or snake friends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/snake-rescue-calls-go-up-during-monsoon/articleshow/83787665.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Nagpur||Duggipar GP ‘bends’ forest rights act rules to make road for water park||NAGPUR: The Duggipar gram panchayat in Sadak Arjuni (Gondia) has taken advantage of the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, to develop a 550-metre road through the reserve forest (RF) to benefit a water park. The said road has been developed and widened in khasra number 335, which was first declared a protected forest (PF) in 1954-55, and later RF in 1978. The said khasra is now part of compartment number 555. “Based on a complaint lodged on March 8, 2021 by ex-divisional forest officer (DFO) Ashok Khune, who worked in the Navegaon-Nagzira area, we have ordered an inquiry against the development of the road. Action will be taken if violations are found. As Khune worked in the area the complaint had to be taken seriously,” said P Kalyan Kumar, CCF, Nagpur circle. According to Sadak Arjuni RFO RD Pachbhai, even though the road has been widened, its status is still a forest road. Earlier, it was a three-metre bullock cart road used by locals. It was widened to six metres in 2018, when RFO Gowardhan Rathod was at the helm. “The said road was constructed after Duggipar gram panchayat obtained permission from then Gondia deputy conservator (DyCF) S Yuvraj under FRA,” said Rathod. Yuvraj told TOI, “I don’t exactly remember but some permissions were given to the gram panchayat under FRA for an approach road.” “However, more than the local people, the road touches national highway (NH6) and has been developed to the advantage of the water park under the garb of FRA,” said forest officials. Section 3(2) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 allows diversion of forest land irrespective of Forest Conservation Act (FCA), 1980 for facilities like roads, schools, hospital, anganwadis, fair price shops, electric lines, water supply scheme, tanks and other minor water bodies etc, but the long list of items doesn’t include a water park. “The developed road doesn’t have any villages in between but has farmlands at the backyard of the water park. The road ends up with a water body. The proposal had come from the Duggipar gram panchayat and there was pressure to grant permission,” said forest officials on condition of anonymity. However, one of the partners of the water park, Ajay Lanjewar, said, “The water park is on private land. The road was already developed when a group of people brought the park from one Hitesh Savvalakhe, Gondia. I’m not aware of any inquiry in the matter nor have I been called for any queries.” “The road belongs to the gram panchayat and not forest. We have no role to play in the issue as it was developed for the people from the zilla parishad funds by spending Rs9 lakh. We also don’t use the said road,” said Lanjewar. However, complainant Khune said, “Information under RTI Act reveals that the said road was notified as RF in 1978 and any such development would have required permission under the FCA. It was a small road but was widened to clandestinely benefit entry of heavy vehicles to the park.” CCF Kalyan Kumar said, “The FRA clause cannot be invoked in this case as forest road cannot be developed to benefit any commercial venture. After the report is submitted, we will see what action can be taken if violations are found.” ROAD FOR PEOPLE OR WATER PARK? * In 2018, Duggipar GP granted permission to develop a road through reserve forest which virtually benefited a water park * The road was part of the reserve forest under Sadak Arjuni range notified in 1978 * Gondia forest division grants permission under Section 3(2) of FRA which exempts gram sabhas for development of roads for people * Villagers earlier used a 3-metre road which has now been widened to 6 metres * Ex-DFO, who worked in the same area, lodged a complaint in March 2021 with CCF, Nagpur, about the violations * An inquiry has been ordered and the report will be submitted in a week||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/duggipar-gp-bends-fra-rules-to-make-road-for-water-park/articleshow/83789984.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The police chief, however, did not clarify if the allegations made by Gajendra Patil held any water. DCP Sanjay Barkund, who headed the inquiry panel, also refused to comment on the findings saying that the report had been sent to the police chief. Various senior officials of the state transport department as well as private persons were called to give their statements in the matter during the course of the inquiry. Meanwhile, complainant Gajendra Patil, who was suspended while posted at the Nashik RTO, said he was shocked by the inquiry committee’s report and added that even if the police feel that no illegal activity had taken place in Nashik, the police can register a Zero FIR. (A Zero FIR is a way to register an offence if the crime has not taken place in the jurisdiction of a particular police station.) Patil said he has already filed a writ petition in the high court about the corruption in the transport department and he would be filing an additional affidavit about the Nashik police’s inquiry and their observation into the matter. On May 15, Patil had given a complaint application to the Panchavati police station alleging irregularities and corruption in the state transport department in transfers and postings by senior officials of the state transport department. Taking note of the same, police chief Pandey had set up the inquiry panel on May 27 and the latter submitted its report on June 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-illegal-activity-in-nashik-cp-on-panels-graft-allegation-report/articleshow/83787746.cms||Santosh Sonawane

While the exact reason behind two suicides could not be ascertained, one suicide had the reason of not being able to bear separation from two-year-old daughter. Police recorded a case of accidental deaths in all three cases. In suicide note, deceased Ravi Sidam, a resident of Raghuji Nagar, mentioned that he could not become a good father and that his daughter will get a good father in her next life. Police said Sidam used to work as a clerk in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court. A month ago, following a quarrel, his wife Monali shifted to her parents’ home in Chakrapani Nagar along with their daughter Morvi. Sidam could not bear this and started consuming alcohol, police said. When he did not open the door on Tuesday, neighbours informed Monali, who came there and informed Sakkardara police. Police broke open the door and entered the house to find him hanging from the ceiling fan. In another incident, a 20-year-old Altaf Sheikh a resident of Chandrapur, who recently shifted to Nagpur at his sister’s place in Qutub Shah Nagar, ended his life by hanging himself from the ceiling fan on Tuesday evening. Police are yet to ascertain the cause of his suicide. In a similar case, one Kapil Samarth, 42, a resident of Reshimbagh, ended his life by hanging himself from the ceiling fan on Tuesday evening. Exact cause of Samarth’s suicide was also not known to the Wathoda police, who are probing the case further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/city-reports-three-suicides-in-24-hours/articleshow/83792322.cms||---

The former corporator, in her memorandum, has stated the bridge used by a large number of commuters is in bad shape. “Vehicles moving towards the crematorium, Deolali Camp railway station along with garbage vehicles, among others use this bridge on a large scale,” she said. “Given the current shape of the bridge, an untoward incident cannot be ruled out. Hence, this calls for immediate repair and widening of the bridge,” she added. Meanwhile, corporator’s husband Chandrakant and deputy Sarpanch of Sansari village Shekhar Godse on Tuesday went to the bridge along with the officials of the CBD and demanded immediate repair.

---||Delhi||No new admissions, but budget schools in Delhi told to take in EWS kids||NEW DELHI: The 2,000 budget private schools in the city are in a fix as most of them haven’t got any fresh enrolments in nursery, KG and Class I owing to the pandemic. However, the directorate of education (DoE) has allotted children from economically weaker section/disadvantaged (EWS/DG) category to these schools. School authorities say the rule is one EWS/DG admission for three general category students, so what does it mean for them now? Most of these recognised schools, which enrol students from nursery to Class VIII, are located in the bylanes of unauthorised and other colonies. For instance, Ideal Radiant Public School in Shiv Vihar used to get around 100 students for entry-level classes prior to the pandemic, but this year they haven’t got a single admission. Chandrakant Singh, principal of the school, said, “Last year, I had three admissions. Parents do not prefer online classes and say they will wait till the school opens physically. Now, the government has sent 18 EWS children to my school, 13 in nursery and the rest for KG.” These children are yet to be admitted because the school is unsure if it can sustain itself. Rajesh Malhotra of Sai Nath Public School in Sangam Vihar said, “We haven’t been able to collect fees from even general category students. In this situation, the government should have thought about giving us the EWS reimbursement.” He was lucky to get four general category students admitted in Class I. “Five EWS children were allotted to my school. I have admitted one of them against the four general category admissions. I don’t know what to do about the others. It’s unfair for parents too as they have to run from pillar to post. No one understands our position,” said Malhotra, who has been waiting in his office every day for admission walk-ins, but without any luck. Hiralal Pandey, the manager of Bharti Model School at Nawada in southwest Delhi, doesn’t know what to do with the 48 EWS students allotted to his school. The last date of admissions is June 30 and the schools are worried. “I have been running this school for the past 20 years. I’m at a huge loss as I’ve been paying teachers from my own pocket. I do not have admissions in nursery, KG and Class I. Earlier, close to 600 children were studying here, but now there are only around 200, most of them under the EWS category,” said Pandey. Rajdhani Public School in Vikas Nagar has been allotted 46 EWS children, who are bound to face problems. “No one wants to clarify on this issue and take accountability. The schools will be blamed for not admitting students, but no one understands our problems,” said Umesh Tyagi from the school administration. DoE director Udit Prakash Rai did not respond to TOI’s calls for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-new-admissions-but-budget-schools-told-to-take-in-ews-kids/articleshow/83807895.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra EC to allow only 50 people for bypoll rally||Pune: State election commissioner UPS Madan on Wednesday said only 50 people would be allowed for election campaign gatherings for the five zilla parishad and 33 panchayat samiti bypolls on July 19. Madan said all poll staffers involved in the by-election process have to take at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Polling would be conducted for 70 seats in Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur zilla parishads and 130 seats in the 33 panchayat samitis of the five districts. The bypolls were necessitated by the March 4 order of the Supreme Court disallowing the political reservation of the OBC community in local bodies. The state election commissioner said a close watch would be kept on case positivity rate in the districts. “We have not announced the bypolls in Palghar due to the rise in cases. If there is any rise in cases in the districts where the by-elections are scheduled, we will intervene,” Madan said.  “Besides the other Covid-19 protocols that have to be followed during elections, this additional clause (cap on 50 people) has been put to avoid any unnecessary gathering. We will also closely monitor each staff selected for the bypoll duty and ensure they get at least one dose of the vaccine,” he said. During the assembly bypolls in April, there were many reports of violation of Covid-19 protocols. The state election commissioner said they wanted to take utmost care this time. “The five-level unlock measures are in place and the state has issued guidelines. These guidelines to have to be strictly followed,” Madan said. Experts, however, said elections should not be conducted at all.  “The districts where the bypolls are being held may be in ‘level one’ now. But one cannot rule out the possibility of surge in Covid cases after election gatherings,” an expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-ec-to-allow-only-50-people-for-bypoll-rally/articleshow/83795923.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad cyber cops warn against vulgar video call tricks||AURANGABAD: With 10 offences of “nude video call” trick to extort money being registered in Aurangabad city, the cyber crime branch officials have warned people against falling prey to such traps. As a modus operandi, the suspects lay honey traps on social media platforms by putting up profile pictures of good looking women. Whenever any man gets chatting with them, the suspects provoke him to start a sleazy interaction. This is followed by exchanging of phone numbers and eventually the target receives a video call from a female member of the racket, who performs vulgar acts. The racketeers then convince the target to respond by indulging in similar acts. As soon as their target relents, the suspects record the video call and use the same to extort money. If the target fails to pay, the suspects share the video with the target’s contacts. Authorities said the number of victims of these traps is much higher than those on record. “In many cases, people only lodge oral complaints. Fearing further embarrassment, they hesitate to get the offence registered,” said cyber crime inspector Geeta Bagwade. The Aurangabad cyber crime police have warned citizens against such calls and have asked victims to lodge cases. Police commissioner Nikhil Gupta said: “It is best to follow a self-imposed moral code of conduct while interacting on social media with known and unknown people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cyber-cops-warn-against-vulgar-video-call-tricks/articleshow/83787832.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi: Enemy at gates... apathy gives Lok Nayak Hospital guards jitters||NEW DELHI: The 24-year-old security guard stationed at the entry to Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi’s biggest Covid facility, had a traumatic time during the peak of the recent wave of Coid-19 infections. He saw patients gasping for air outside the hospital and felt helpless when their sobbing kin begged him to find a bed or an oxygen cylinder for them. That is why he is apprehensive when he sees people without masks at the hospital these days, knowing that such carelessness can take Delhi back to those grim days. “Ambulances, personal vehicles and autorickshaws with patients in critical condition used to line up outside the hospital. They were difficult to manage because most people would fight with us for admission in the hospital,” the guard said. “We felt very bad to see helpless relatives weeping as they stood by the side of the patients.” Nearly 20,000 Covid patients have been treated at the hospital since the outbreak last year. Security guards of Lok Nayak Hospital, who watched hundreds of patients desperately battling the coronavirus when the city was running low on oxygen and medicines, have been cautioned by the hospital authorities against talking to the media about their experiences. So they preferred to remain anonymous while recalling their stories. A 20-year-old deployed outside the emergency ward told TOI, “There were many patients who hadn’t got a bed in three-four hospitals and had reached here, desperate for a bed or an oxygen cylinder,” he said. “However, our hospital was running at full capacity at the time and was struggling to accommodate more patients. In my one year of duty at the hospital, it was the first time I witnessed such frightening and disturbing sights.” As a precaution, all security guards were instructed to wear PPE suits during the peak of the second wave. “We used to be drenched in sweat. It was tough to wear PPE kits and stand in the scorching sun for an eight-hour,” said a 23-year-old guard who commutes daily from Faridabad. “We were scared to go home as we didn’t want to infect our parents or other relatives. In this threatening period, I took great care to maintain physical distancing from my kin.” The security guards at the hospital, still cringing at what they went through recently, are nonplussed that people are not doing anything to prevent a repeat of the disaster. “Eight out of every 10 people coming to the hospital do not wear masks properly,” grumbled a 25-year-old guard. “What is more, they ignore our pleas to them to protect themselves properly with masks. Even after so many deaths, people don’t seem to have learned the lessons.” He added with a shudder that it was as if people were deliberately keen to repeat the hellish experience, crowding the markets and flouting all Covid norms after the lockdown restrictions were relaxed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/enemy-at-gates-apathy-gives-hosp-guards-jitters/articleshow/83823106.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The complaint further states the suspects kept on issuing cheques bearing different amounts, but on deposit all of them were dishonoured. When contacted, in-charge inspector Salgarkar said the offence is based on the complaint received from the hotel. “During pandemic the couple stayed in one of the rooms of the hotel for over 11 months.

Two other friends sustained grievous injuries and are now battling for life at a local hospital. The SUV in which the six friends were travelling rammed into a divider and overturned after a tyre burst on a connecting road in Agra’s Etmadpur area, according to police. It was 10:30pm. The impact was so powerful that Ashish Tomar (19), Arshad Khan (19), Nikhil Baraulia (18) and Krishna Singh (16) were killed on the spot. Two others — Kashif (17) and Kabeer (16) — were pulled out from the mangled remains of the vehicle and were rushed to the hospital. Krishna’s father Rajkumar Singh, a civil court lawyer, told TOI his son's birthday was on July 6. “My wife had died on April 29 due to a heart attack and now my only son also left me,” the devastated father said, adding that he wasn't aware of his son's night drive. Singh added that Krishna was excited to get admission in class 10 in St Mary’s Convent School after finishing the 9th from Bal Bhavan School. He was about to start here next month. Ashish Tomar was also the only son of an ex-army man, BS Tomar. He was a class 12 student of Heritage School. “We are totally shocked after the news of four deaths from the same locality. They were all friends,” said Ashish’s uncle Pitambar Singh Tomar. It was Arshad Khan who took out his younger uncle’s vehicle for a ride. No one ever thought it would take such a disastrous turn for so many families, said Arshad’s uncle Ammanullah Khan who reached the postmortem house. Arshad’s father, Aslam Khan, is an engineer and he was the elder among his two sons. Nikhil's family is also shattered. The class 12 student called his father around 10.19 pm informing that he was returning home soon, but after a few minutes the family received a call from a neighbour with the news. “We last saw our son at 8 pm when he was going to attend the birthday party,” said his father GP Baraulia, a lecturer in Uttarakhand who was at home on leave. On Wednesday, SP (West) Satyajeet Gupta said the incident took place after the car rammed into the divider. "It is yet to be ascertained whether it happened after or before the tyre burst as both the front tyres were found flat," he added. Gupta added that legal action will be taken and further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/4-teenagers-dead-two-critical-as-suv-on-way-from-birthday-bash-crashes-into-divider-in-agra/articleshow/83787850.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Aurangabad||In Nanded, police station-level personnel trained in rescue ops||Aurangabad: The Nanded police have started training physically-fit police personnel to carry out successful rescue operations during natural or man-made calamities. The rescue operation training is traditionally imparted to riot-control police commandos and quick response team personnel. Superintendent of police Pramodkumar Shewale told TOI: “We have decided to train a handful of cops from each of the 36 police stations. In case of an emergency, our men, instead of waiting for expert rescue teams to arrive, can start the rescue operation themselves.” The officer said the decision to train the police personnel in the disaster management-related rescue operations was taken after he found that the Nanded district falls in an earthquake prone zone. Already, a batch of 84 policemen has been trained and the training for the second batch has been initiated. In each of the training sessions, the policemen are taught how to respond to situations like flooding, inferno, lightning, storms, earthquakes, terror attacks, stampede, cloud bursts etc. The personnel are also trained to climb structures of more than 60 feet height in the absence of a ladder/staircase and rescue people stuck inside. They are being trained in the use of different types of fire extinguishers, identifying different types of fires and scientifically proven methodology in extinguishing each of them. In addition, the cops are also being trained in preparation of jumping sheets, ladders, sacks, stretchers, ways of lifting injured in different scenarios, tying of different knots etc. Following each training session, the policemen are made to undergo physical and written tests. On clearing the tests, they are awarded certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/in-nanded-police-station-level-personnel-trained-in-rescue-ops/articleshow/83787892.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Officials face attack in their bid to reclaim forest land||New Delhi: Over 200 hectares of encroachments in the Southern Ridge were reclaimed by the Delhi government forest and wildlife department over the past two years by demolishing illegal constructions, setting up boundary walls and deploying guards. However, the department met with resistance, sometimes violent, in a few cases. On Tuesday morning, around 20 men attacked the forest department personnel and tried to “reclaim” the freed encroached land in Dera Mandi by breaking down the boundary wall using an earthmover. The ecological task force (ETF), equipped with the job of protecting these reclaimed pockets and carrying out plantation, was quick to call the police, who have now placed the offenders under arrest. An ETF official told TOI that the encroacher of the land had been protesting against the forest department’s demolition drive. On Tuesday morning, he showed up with 20 men and an earthmover, warning the team of around 10 ETF officers to step away from the site. “We issued them a warning, but within 15 minutes they demolished a part of the boundary wall. A team documented this. We stepped aside as we did not want to make the situation more volatile. Police were called and a PCR van showed up immediately. The cops nabbed the offenders who had till then broken the boundary wall from two ends,” said the ETF official. A senior forest official said they were also informed immediately about the ruckus after which a complaint was registered at Maidan Garhi police station in the evening. “Initially, we had met with resistance for carrying out the demolition drive. However, this is the first major altercation where violence occurred after encroachments were removed. The ETF is stationed at these sites to ensure that the land is not encroached upon again,” added the official. Despite the pandemic impacting work to a large extent, the forest and wildlife department claims to have reclaimed around 110 bighas (roughly 10 hectares) of encroached forest land in the last 12 months. Before the last lockdown, encroachments were removed in Prem Nagar and Dera Mandi. Forest officials said the drives would resume in the next couple of months during which permanent structures and buildings in Tughlaqabad, Asola, Pul Pahladpur, Jaunapur, Bhatti, Maidan Garhi, Dera Mandi and Shahurpur would be targeted. Police said that during investigation they found that a person named Darshan Kumar and his son had illegally broken the boundary wall, measuring 20-25 metres in length, constructed by the forest department. A few months ago, the forest department had removed illegal encroachment done by Kumar and had taken over possession of the land and later constructed a boundary wall there. However, Kumar claims ownership of the said land. DCP (South) Atul Thakur said, “The man was arrested under CrPC provisions. On Wednesday, a complaint of trespassing on the said land was received from the deputy conservator of forests, south forest division. An FIR under appropriate sections of Indian Penal Code, Damage to Public Property Act and Indian Forest Act has been registered against Darshan Kumar, his son and others. Further investigation is in progress.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/officials-face-attack-in-their-bid-to-reclaim-forest-land/articleshow/83792420.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Under the new initiative, kin of the Covid-19 victims will be invited to plant tree saplings at Bhagirathi Van on the banks of the Ganga in memory of their loved ones whom they lost to the pandemic. The area where the trees will be planted will come to be known as ‘Smriti Vatika’. Kasganj district magistrate Chandra Prakash Singh said, “We will be inviting kin of the Covid-19 victims to plant tree saplings in a dedicated one-hectare at Bhagirathi Van that will come to be known as Smriti Vatika. The move is aimed at promoting environmental conservation, which will also help provide solace to the people who lost their loved ones to the pandemic. The forest department has started digging pits for the plantation.” Sharing further details, district forest officer Diwakar Vashishth said, “We have started contacting such families and have been getting positive response from them. Each tree planted at Smriti Vatika will have a plate bearing the name and other details of a Covid victim. A universal identity of the trees planted will be generated by geotagging.” “Under the initiative, we have planned the plantation of trees that have a lifespan of over 100 years. Saplings of amla, mango, Indian blackberry, Sheesham, Khair, banyan, peepal and neem are being arranged. Besides, water supply will also be made available at the Vatika and we will encourage people to visit here regularly and nourish the saplings that they will be planted in remembrance of their loved ones with water and manure. Besides, a caretaker will also be deputed here,” he said. Developed last year by reclaiming over 300 hectares of encroached land, the state government had planned to develop Bhagirathi Van as an eco-tourism spot. The DM said, “It is also a perfect place for the people on a spiritual sojourn.” The DFO said, “The forest that finds a mention in Puranas is located in Datlana Khaam village, now declared as Ganga gram, in Soron block of Kasganj. It has Soronji tirth, which is visited by people from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and other states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/eco-friendly-initiative-kin-of-covid-victims-to-plant-tree-saplings-in-their-loving-memory/articleshow/83787888.cms||Deepak Lavania

In another two weeks, a key and crucial flyover in the city, connecting Secunderabad Cantonment and Balanagar, Kukatpally and Quthbullapur, will be thrown open for commuters, according to Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) engineering wing. “Covering a length of 1.13-km under the ‘Strategic Road Development Plan’(SRDP) at a cost of Rs 387 crore, except re-carpeting the roads under flyover, major construction of the flyover work has been completed,” said one official. By overcoming various hurdles in land acquisition, shortage of workers and legal tangles, the six-lane two-way Balanagar-Bowenpally flyover, is ready for take-off. This is the HMDA’s eighth flyover in the city. Commuters coming from Medchal (national highway) and adjoining areas of Secunderabad Cantonment, Bowenpally, Sikh Village, Tadbund, and other areas towards Balanagar via Narsapur X road, Shapur, Jeedimetla, Kukatpally and up to Miyapur via Kukatpally ‘Y’ Junction, will be benefitted, courtesy this six-lane two-way flyover. HMDA had built the Balanagar-Bowenpally flyover using ‘pre-cast & pre-stress’ technology, which can bear heavy loads of vehicles. Even commuters can commute with 60 kilometres per hour (KMPH) without bumps, said sources. A few daily commuters TOI spoke with said they used to spend nearly half-an-hour to reach Narsapur X Roads (near Balanagar) “I used to lose so much fuel and time. Over eight to 10 traffic cops used to regulate traffic at Narsapur X Roads, now with the new flyover, traffic woes will hopefully come to an end,” said Senu Rao, a motorist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/balanagar-flyover-to-tackle-decades-old-traffic-issues/articleshow/83792392.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Not enough nitrogen-fixing bacteria in Indian soil: Experts||Hyderabad: Researchers from the University of Hyderabad and Oxford University have decoded the reason behind the low yield of Tur dal or pigeon pea in India. They noticed that nitrogen-fixing bacteria required for higher yields in pigeon pea are lacking in soils in the country and suggested inoculation of nitrogen fixing bacteria to improve the produce. Certain plants like pigeon pea require symbiotic bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen for a well-balanced growth with good yields. The bacteria are present in the nodules formed on the roots. The symbiotic bacteria present in the soil belong to the genus Rhizobium. It is generally thought that all the species of the bacteria belonging to the Rhizobium genus are symbiotic and thus capable of fixing nitrogen for the pigeon pea plant to thrive. But UoH and Oxford University researchers found that not every species of Rhizobium is symbiotic in nature. Indian soils are abundant in non-symbiotic Rhizobium species. They also found that the bacterial species that form symbiotic relationship (by forming nodules) with pigeon pea plant are actually those of Bradyrhizobium. Since the Indian soils do not contain the symbiotic type of Rhizobium, the yields are lower. The team headed by Prof Appa Rao Podile of UoH and including three research scholars Ch Danteswari, Anirban Basu, and PVSRN Sarma, assessed the microbial community associated with pigeon pea roots in different soil types with a comprehensive approach and found the root microbial composition was primarily determined by the plant developmental stage and soil type rather than the plant variety. From the Oxford University the team comprised Prof Philip Poole’s group at the Department of Plant Sciences, and Dr Andrew Neal at Rothamsted Research. The study concluded that the low nodulation efficiency of pigeon pea is due to the inadequate presence of appropriate symbionts in the soils. Indian soils were mainly found to harbour non-symbiotic Rhizobium species, rather than symbiotic Bradyrhizobium species. “These findings will pave the way for selecting and applying appropriate symbionts to improve pigeon pea yields and nodulation under Indian conditions,” the researchers said. Pulses and other legumes develop complex symbiotic associations with rhizobium at root nodules. Rhizobium ‘fix’ and supply nitrogen to the host plants and plants, in return, provide carbon and energy to the bacteria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-enough-nitrogen-fixing-bacteria-in-indian-soil-experts/articleshow/83792428.cms||Syed Akbar

The accused have been identified as Rameshwar Tale and Suresh Wankhede. According to police, the suspects would target an ATM and steal only a few thousand rupees before moving to another machine. Nanded range’s special IGP Nisar Tamboli said the suspects are aware that ATMs have insurance and banks or third party agencies will not lodge any complaint for small amount. Hingoli’s assistant superintendent of police Yatish Deshmukh said, “The suspect would use a debit card for withdrawing meagre amount of Rs 500. Soon after the machine would open its cash dispensing shutter to deliver cash, suspects would stick a metal object in it. This would give them access to the cash stashed in different racks of the machine and the suspects would collect a minimum of Rs 15, 000, before removing the metal object and allowing the dispensing section to close down.” A complaint was lodged with police by a third party agency hired by the bank for upkeep of the ATMs. On screening the CCTV footage, it was found that four suspects have committed theft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hingoli-police-arrest-two-for-stealing-money-from-atms/articleshow/83787947.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Ragpicker stabbed to death by friend at Sanathnagar||Hyderabad: A ragpicker was stabbed to death allegedly by his friend in an inebriated state at Sanathnagar on Tuesday night. Police said a petty argument led to the murderous assault. The victim, Sachin, 22, was a native of Maharashtra. For the past few years, Sachin had been eking out his livelihood by collecting scrap at Fatehnagar and Sanathnagar. On Tuesday night, Sachin was attacked with a knife by his friend, Anil, when they had an argument after getting drunk, police said. According to Sanathnagar inspector M Muthu Yadav, Sachin was staying in a rented accommodation at Lal Bahadur Shastri Nagar in Fatehnagar and he used to collect plastic bottles and other scrap items along with Anil, who also hails from Maharashtra. “Recently, differences cropped up between Sachin and Anil as the latter became jealous of Sachin for earning more than him,” the inspector said. On Tuesday night, the two consumed liquor and, during the argument over money, Anil stabbed Sachin in the chest with a knife. With severe bleeding, Sachin died on the spot. The accused fled from the spot. Police registered a murder case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ragpicker-stabbed-to-death-by-friend/articleshow/83792436.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Partner at agency named in Kumbh fake test scam gets protection from ‘arbitrary arrest’||NAINITAL: The partner at the Delhi-based agency accused of conducting one lakh fake Covid-19 tests during the Maha Kumbh in Haridwar in April has been granted protection from arbitrary arrest by the Uttarakhand high court and asked to join the investigation. Mallika Pant, partner at Max Corporate Services, one of nine private agencies asked by the state government to conduct Covid-19 tests during the month-long Kumbh Mela, had approached the high court challenging the FIR filed against the agency. Pant had argued that the agency was just a “service provider”, and the collection of samples and data entry was not its responsibility but that of two ICMR-accredited labs it had engaged — Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lal Chandani Labs Limited. Pant had also said she was willing to cooperate with the investigation. On Wednesday, the bench of justice NS Dhanik “granted protection to the petitioner from arbitrary arrest in the light of Supreme Court judgment in Arnesh Kumar v State of Bihar,” Pant’s counsel Kartikey Hari Gupta said. The Arnesh Kumar judgment had placed checks and balances on the powers of the police before an arrest. “The court has also directed us to join the investigation and appear before the investigating officer on Friday,” Gupta said. An SIT had been formed to probe the case last Friday. “We will go to the SIT with the data directed (to be provided). We will inform the investigators about all relevant information.” TOI has reported that one lakh Covid-19 tests were allegedly faked during the Kumbh Mela — with hundreds of samples from the same address and the same mobile number on hundreds of reports. Many sample collectors the agency said had conducted tests in Haridwar were found to be living in other states, and some had never been to Uttarakhand. Haridwar Police then filed an FIR against the agency and the two labs under several IPC sections, the Disaster Management Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/partner-at-agency-named-in-kumbh-fake-test-scam-gets-protection-from-arbitrary-arrest/articleshow/83785394.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves verdict on state plea to drop 2 paras from FIR||MUMBAI: The state on Wednesday submitted before the Bombay high court that the point of its plea to drop two paragraphs from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR against Anil Deshmukh is “what mandate did the HC give in its April 5 order” when it directed the preliminary enquiry into allegations of corruption against the former home minister. While the state and CBI differed over interpretation of the mandate to probe the allegations against Deshmukh, the HC concluded the hearing and reserved for judgment the state’s plea to drop the two paragraphs from the CBI FIR filed on April 21. The CBI is probing the allegations based on former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s petition in the HC stating that Deshmukh had asked dismissed API Sachin Waze to pay him Rs 100 crore every month by collecting money from restaurants and bars. If the CBI is allowed to carry out a “pillage” of a probe into transfers and postings as an independent agency, without mandate of the court, it would be irresponsible and defeat the morale of the police administration which has an excellent record, said state’s senior counsel Rafique Dada. He added that the plea was also invoking HC’s extraordinary powers to do justice under Article 226 of the Constitution, not merely a quashing petition. The paragraphs which the state wants removed refer to Waze’s reinstatement in 2020 after 15 years, Waze being assigned most of the sensational cases, and alleged exercise of undue influence over transfers and postings and hence, over performance of police officers’ duties. Senior counsel Rafique Dada, for the state, said the CBI had breached the mandate given by the HC by cutting and pasting a paragraph straight out of Singh’s PIL and relied on pleadings in a petition by advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay for a probe against Deshmukh. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing CBI, concluded his submission to seek dismissal of the state plea. He, as well as advocate Subhash Jha for Upadhaya, said there is a mandate given by the HC and the state cannot now allow such a mandate to be defeated. The state said that despite former state intelligence unit chief Rashmi Shukla’s report being closed as mentioned by advocate general before the Chief Justice’s bench, the state is probing how it was leaked and the CBI wants to “mutilate” its probe. Mehta said the difference is that the state is looking at the “leak”, while the CBI “its contents”. Till the high court judgment is pronounced, the CBI extended its earlier statement to not pursue its requests for certain documents, including Shukla’s report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-reserves-verdict-on-state-plea-to-drop-2-paras-from-fir/articleshow/83794719.cms||---

The colony has now become a role model for other residential societies in the city. On Wednesday, Chandrasekhar received an official communication from the ministry about the honour, given to him under the ‘The Rainwater Project’ category. Sharing the achievement with others from the area, he said: “We refurbished old RWH pits built by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) in this colony, at our own expense...inspired by this honour, we have now set a target to help all our residents build their own RWH pits in their homes, based on the space available within their premises.” At present, residents of the colony divert the entire rainwater, that collect on their rooftops, through a pipe to an underground storage tank. When that overflows, its diverted to RWH pits for ground water percolation. Thus, bores which have been dry for several years get a new lease of life, those this concept. “There are a lot of high-rise buildings that have come up here and depend on borewells. As a result, groundwater extortion is high in this area. So, there is a need to dig RWH pits to save groundwater for the future,” said Sudesh Kumar, treasurer of the Sai Baba Officers Colony which has about 220 houses. Deepa Shailendra, resident of Sainikpuri said that building RWH pits will also cater to people’s regular needs, like gardening and cleaning. Apart from spearheading RWH projects, Chandrasekhar has also been part of the residents movement seeking reopening of 21 civilian roads in the Cantonment area, for close to six years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-resident-gets-blue-hyderabad-champion-honour/articleshow/83792468.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Delhi||NDMC hikes health licence fees for hotels, restaurants||New Delhi: New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) on Thursday increased its annual health licence fees for grant/renewal of various trade licences. The changes, introduced as per a decision taken in a 2018 meeting, have been made effective from April 1, 2021. Business establishments like hotels, restaurants, coffee shops, lodging houses and sweet shops in the NDMC areas will have to pay the increased fees, stated an order issued by the health licensing department. “There would not be any increase in the fees for small kiosks/stalls, Mother Dairy booths, water trolleys, etc. In the rest of the categories, too, the increase is minimal — from Rs 100 to Rs 1,700 annually — except in the case of five-star hotels,” said an NDMC official. The five-star hotels will have to pay Rs 65,500 instead of the previous Rs 61,200. The licence for shops and cafes in hotels will be taken separately, not as part of the hotel. In all cases, any delay in obtaining or renewing the licence beyond the prescribed period will attract an additional 5% penalty of the fee per month, said the official. There will be no increase in health licence fees for 25% cases, which cover all small shops, stalls, water trolleys etc. In 40% cases, there will be an increase of Rs 400, 30% cases will see an increase of Rs 900, 2% cases Rs 100 and 1% cases covering five-star hotels etc. will pay Rs 4,300 extra, said the official. Traders are not at all happy with the move and defined it untimely and a burden on them as they are already trying to come out of the pandemic losses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ndmc-hikes-health-licence-fees-for-hotels-restaurants/articleshow/83823255.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Kumbh, deaths have clear link, Char Dham will be disaster: Uttarakhand high court||NAINITAL: The state government’s proposal to flag off the Char Dham yatra on July 1 could be a “recipe for national disaster,” the Uttarakhand high court said on Wednesday. It added that there was a “direct correlation between the Kumbh mela gathering and consequent deaths” in the state. The court observed that the right to worship and religion cannot be higher than the “right to life”. It has asked the state government to review its decision. The court was hearing petitions about the Covid-19 situation in the state. Additional secretary (tourism) Ashish Chauhan informed the bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma that the government plans on holding the yatra in a phased manner from July 1, allowing locals in the three districts on the Char Dham trail — Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag and Chamoli — to visit the shrines in their villages. The bench cited reports of mass gatherings in Haridwar on Ganga Dussehra (on Sunday) and Kainchi Dham shrine in Nainital (last week) and said whenever devotees gather in large numbers “SOPs are the first victims, followed by people at large....there is a direct correlation between holding Kumbh and consequent deaths that occurred in Uttarakhand in May.” The month-long Kumbh mela had drawn over 60 lakh pilgrims this year. The court also expressed concern over the ‘delta plus’ variant of Covid-19, which may “defeat the vaccines.” It said, “Moreover, according to a Scottish study published in ‘The Lancet’, the delta variant poses almost twice the risk of hospitalisation compared to the earlier alpha variant.” It added that the variant has begun to emerge as a deadly one since its transmissibility is higher, it directly affects the lungs and causes longer hospitalisation. “The court is of the firm opinion that a catastrophe should not be invited by holding and permitting large congregations. Therefore, this court directs the state to review its decision to commence the Char Dham on July 1, 2021. Perhaps, the yatra needs to be postponed or cancelled,” the court said in its order. During the hearing, chief justice Chauhan said children are being orphaned because of Covid-19, but the Centre’s instructions are “falling on deaf ears”. The judges added, “If children are lost or sacrificed at the altar of Covid-19, the loss will not only be of parents but also the nation at large.” The court recorded chief secretary Om Prakash’s undertaking that the decision would be reviewed by the cabinet and the court would be informed about the decision by Monday||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/clear-link-between-kumbh-deaths-char-dham-yatra-recipe-for-natl-disaster-hc/articleshow/83785608.cms||Prashant Jha

The manuscript with 173 palm leaves was in the possession of a family in Sivaganga district. It was documented by one of the deputy registrars of Alagappa University and released on the website in the form of an e-book recently. While the manuscript was written in Tamil by one Karuppanan, son of Veerapathra Servai, it was in the possession of P Narayanan of Kandaangipatti. K Kaalairajan, former deputy registrar of Alagappa University, decided to document the content about seven years ago when he came across the family which had the manuscript. Kaalairajan learned the art of cleaning ancient palm leaves using lemon grass oil and went on to digitise the content in the manuscript. While a major portion of the palm leaves in the manuscript narrates the popular Chithirai festival, it also speaks about Srimad Bhagavatham, incarnation of Vishnu, Ramayana, Mahabharat and war strategy during the olden days up to 99th palm leaf. Trichy-based archaeo-symbolist T L Subash Chandira Bose who read the ebook said it has the mention of the second Veerappa Nayakkar’s army commander Lingama Nayakkar who had strengthened Thiruchirapalli fort in 1659 AD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/17th-c-manuscript-speaks-about-chithirai-festival/articleshow/83792526.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Telangana high court slams state for delaying capping government order||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday slammed the state government for issuing a GO on capping charges in private hospitals at a time when the second wave was almost ebbing. The court asked the government if it was willing to impose heavy penalties on errant private hospitals for fleecing patients. Blaming the government for the belated GO, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said: “People asked you (government) to rein in the private hospitals. We asked you to bring the GO. You brought it finally at the fag end of the second wave.” When director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao informed the bench that the government had issued a GO (No. 401 dated June 22, 2021) capping charges for various tests, treatment, medicines, etc., the judges said the GO did not specify quantum of penalties to be imposed even now. The DPH admitted that the GO needed amendments and assured the court that he would get them done by incorporating penalties for each offence. “Keep prohibitively high penalties. That should make them (private hospitals) wary of collecting excess charges,” the judges said. They asked the DPH to come out with a fresh affidavit by July 7. “Give wide publicity to the capping GO,” the judges said while hearing a batch of PILs on Covid-19. Senior counsel L Ravi Chander, advocates Karam C Komireddy and Arjun Kumar elaborated on how Kerala was imposing penalties that are 10 times more than the excess charges collected by the hospitals there. The judges said this would certainly act as a deterrent on hospitals which may think twice before collecting huge bills from the patients if the state government also implements a strict regime like the one in Kerala. The DPH said the government is already taking action on the private hospitals and added that he had received 350 complaints against 170 private hospitals. “We refunded Rs 70 lakh to the families of patients in 30 cases,” he said. However, the advocates were not convinced with his reply and said hospitals were charging the same amount from each of the patients during the thick of the second wave. “People must have the option to get back their hard-earned savings,” they said. The judges said a mechanism was already there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-slams-state-for-delaying-capping-go/articleshow/83792533.cms||---

National highway authority of India (NHAI) said that the lockdown restrictions had adversely impacted the availability of raw materials and manpower, which has delayed the completion of road development work on time. As a portion of the Thanjavur-Trichy NH between Ariyamangalam and Thuvakudi was damaged, NHAI in April 2021 took up the road renewal work (once in five years) that was supposed to be initiated in 2020. The NH stretch covering Ariyamangalam and Thiruverumbur road over bridges (RoB) between NHAI toll plaza and NIT-Trichy and a stretch between Thiruverumbur ITI and Palpannai were sanctioned for the renewal project. While 60% of the work was accomplished as of June, the work at a stretch in Thiruverumbur near New Town Muthu Nagar and Amman Nagar residential localities was stopped abruptly. However, as the road was milled to remove the old surface, the leftover silt has been causing two-wheelers to skid. “Small scooters are skidding while applying brakes,” A Sathik Basha, a resident of Muthu Nagar said. “We will resume and complete the work within 10 days. Silt accumulated will be removed. Raw materials and labourers are available now,” an official source overseeing the road work said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/negotiating-milled-trichy-thanjavur-nh-a-risky-affair/articleshow/83792505.cms||---

The incident, which happened in Mathura’s Chhata area, was recorded by a CCTV camera installed on the street outside her house on Monday night. The girl’s father said he got an abusive call from an unidentified person at about 8pm. “They wanted to talk to my daughter,” he said. “When I refused, they threatened me. A few minutes later, three men barged into our house and started beating us. They molested my daughter first, then one of them flung her across his shoulders and carried her up to the terrace on the second floor of the house from where they just threw her down.” Superintendent of police (Agra rural) Shireesh Chandra said, “Dileep and Avnish Tewari, who are from Bihar, have been arrested. Kaushal, a local, is absconding.” The accused left behind a Pulsar motorcycle and two mobile phones while fleeing from the spot. Mathura’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Guarav Grover, who met the victim’s family, said, “Whenever the girl is in position to give her statement, we will record it. Strict action will be taken against the suspects.” The teenager has, meanwhile, been referred to a hospital in Agra from Mathura due to her serious condition. “Her MRI and CT Scan are being conducted,” her younger brother told TOI on Wednesday. He said that two of the accused live in a rented room in the same locality, just 1.5km away from their house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/girl-17-breaks-spine-as-stalkers-barge-into-home-throw-her-from-terrace/articleshow/83788085.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The girl, a resident of Faridabad, complained of high-grade fever, abdomen pain, vomiting and persistent headache for a week, following which she was admitted to a local hospital. When her condition deteriorated, she was referred to Apollo Hospital, Delhi. “The child was brought to us on June 5. Her condition was critical, with low levels of blood pressure, oxygen and dipping pulse rate. While she had tested negative for Covid-19, her Covid antibodies levels were very high, making her a case of multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS),” the hospital said. At the time of admission, the girl’s oxygen saturation was low and she needed very high ventilator support. “We decided to put her on ECMO support. She improved gradually and it was only after a week that she could be taken off it,” Dr Nameet Jerath, senior consultant, paediatric intensive care, said. MIS in children can manifest three to six weeks after asymptomatic or symptomatic Covid-19, and early detection is important to reduce the risk of death, the doctor said. Dr Muthu Jyothi, senior consultant, pediatric cardiology at the hospital said, “If MIS-C is not identified and treated quickly, the condition of the patient can deteriorate within hours and make it life-threatening.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-save-8-year-old-girl-from-post-covid-respiratory-distress/articleshow/83823359.cms||---

While textbooks are being distributed in these schools over the past few days, fresh stocks of notebooks and stationery items are expected in a few days. School education department staff in the districts were in a fix on finding out that many government and aided schools had stocks of notebooks and school bags with pictures of the former chief ministers. Every year, government and aided schools across the state will have unused stocks of notebooks, crayons, colour pencils and school bags. A portion of these remains unused as students fail to collect them from schools. Sources in the school education department said that a district chief education officer had raised the issue at an online meeting with the secretary, school education department. The chief education officers were asked to stop using the pending stock and wait for fresh stocks to arrive for distribution. Earlier, officials were planning to paste stickers on the images and and were awaiting orders so as to avoid wastage. Meanwhile, free distribution of textbooks worth Rs 292 crore is happening in all the1,632 government and aided schools in Trichy district. Two textbooks were given to students from classes I to V. One text book has Tamil and English and the other maths, science and social studies. Three textbooks are to be given to students of classes VI and VII.

---||Agra||Maneka Gandhi-vet spat trends on Twitter||AGRA: An audio clip where BJP MP Maneka Gandhi is purportedly heard responding angrily to a veterinary doctor for conducting “the worst surgery in the country” on a dog went viral on social media on Wednesday. The Indian Veterinary Association observed a ‘Black Day’ following the controversy and wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the matter. While Gandhi declined to comment on the issue, telling TOI she didn’t want to speak about it, the Agra-based veterinarian at the centre of the spat, Dr L N Gupta, said that he had performed an ovariohysterectomy (surgical removal of the female reproductive organs) on a Rottweiler in his private clinic on June 1. “I had told the owner, who hails from Gwalior, to bring the animal daily for five days for post-operative care. The owner didn’t do so and when he finally turned up, the animal had caught an infection,” Gupta said. According to the doctor, 41, the dog owner demanded a refund of Rs 15,000 that the latter had spent on the procedure. “A few days later, I got a call from Maneka Gandhi,” he said, adding that the dog is admitted in another hospital at present. In the purported audio clip, the animal rights activist is heard telling the doctor that the canine’s stitches had opened twice since they were of “cheap quality” and that it was the “worst surgery in the country”. At one point, Gandhi purportedly tells the doctor to pay Rs 70,000 to the owner to “cover the cost of the treatment of the dog at another hospital”. When he is noncommittal, she gets angry. President of Indian Veterinary Association Umesh Sharma said they have written to the PM expressing concern over the “unparliamentary language” used by the BJP MP. Sharma added that Gandhi should apologise else the association would take legal action. “If there was wrongdoing on the part of the vet, then the dog owner should have filed a complaint with the veterinary council,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/maneka-vet-spat-trends-on-twitter/articleshow/83788123.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Regular genome sequencing to spot Delta+ strain’||AHMEDABAD: After the second wave of Covid cases caused by the Delta variant of Covid-19 in Gujarat and India at large, the state is bracing for further mutation of the Delta variant, currently named ‘Delta-plus.’ Gujarat has upped its ante with its neighbouring states Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh recording confirmed Delta-plus Covid cases. The Centre has already alerted Kerala along with Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh after the variant was found. Indian Council on Medical Research (ICMR) has also asked other states to remain on guard to ensure quicker identification of the mutation. Jai Prakash Shivahare, state health commissioner, told TOI that Gujarat is following ICMR guidelines. “Our focus is on increasing screening, testing and sequencing. We have already started random screening of those who are coming from outside the state. Moreover, we have not reduced the testing for Covid, despite the drop in cases, to get early signals on rise in cases,” he said. But most importantly, the state is betting on exponentially increasing genome sequencing of confirmed Covid-19 positive samples. Shivahare said that the state-funded Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) will carry out genome sequence every month to find the Covid-19 variants including Delta-plus. Dr Atul Patel, infectious diseases specialist and member of the Gujarat Covid-19 task force, said that Gujarat needs to be cautious about the Delta-plus virus. “The Delta-plus virus is reported to be extremely infectious and possibly can immune escape the antibody defence the body has gained against coronavirus,” he said. Dr Urvesh Shah, professor and head of microbiology at GCS Medical College, said that the Delta-plus has the mutation K417N on spike protein — first found in the Beta variant found in South Africa. “This, coupled with the fact that it also possesses all other features of its predecessor Delta, might make the latest variant a lot more transmissible. We may however need more data to work on,” he said. “We are yet to know more about its severity and mortality compared to its predecessor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/regular-genome-sequencing-to-spot-delta-strain/articleshow/83790433.cms||Parth Shastri

The mosque in the village was at the centre of a row following a scuffle that took place after the wedding procession on May 26 was allegedly asked to stop playing music until people had offered their prayers. Police later booked 11 people for rioting. The matter had snowballed and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Sadhvi Prachi had announced that she would perform a havan at the mosque. She didn’t turn up but some saffron outfits tried to enter the village. They were, however, stopped by police. Talking to TOI, Gautam said since there was no temple in the village, he had decided to build one. “This was a demand of the Jatav community in the village. So we laid the foundation stone on Monday keeping their sentiments in mind,” he said. Virendra Kumar, who belongs to the Jatav community, said he was not aware of any such demand by their community. “We only follow Dr B R Ambedkar and his ideology. But a few people from Dalit community have recently joined the BJP and may have put forth this demand.” Tahir Khan, a businessman and local resident, said a “verbal confrontation” had taken place between the two parties during the incident in May but it was portrayed as a rift between two communities for “political gains”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mp-lays-foundation-stone-of-temple-near-mosque-where-dalits-were-assaulted/articleshow/83788177.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Justice Anup J Bhambhani directed the applicant be taken in custody by jail or police officers in plain clothes to allow him to attend the function of his elder brother from 11am to 11pm on the day of the ceremony and be brought back to the prison on the same date. The counsel for the applicant told the court that, though this application was moved earlier, it had been listed now since the convict approached the court through the jail-visiting counsel of Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee. The additional public prosecutor contended that although a pre-verification of the ground cited for interim suspension of the sentence was made and it stands confirmed that the applicant’s elder brother is scheduled to get married on June 24, further verification from the to-be bride’s family could not be completed. He told the court that the convict’s father dissuaded police from conducting verification from the bride’s family, saying if her family finds out that the applicant is in prison, they might not go ahead with the marriage. However, in the latest plea, the convict was able to produce details of the proposed function, which police also verified and found to be genuine. The prosecution then didn’t oppose the order of custodial parole by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pocso-convict-gets-bail-for-bros-wedding/articleshow/83823408.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Madurai||Thumb cut off: Madras high court orders Rs 75,000 interim relief to baby’s parents in Thanjavur||MADURAI: Madras high court on Wednesday directed the state to pay Rs 75,000 as interim compensation to the parents of a newborn child a portion of whose thumb was cut off by a staff nurse negligently while removing the paediatric venflon (cannula) from its hand at the government hospital in Thanjavur. Passing the interim order in a petition by M Ganesan, the baby’s father, seeking compensation and proper treatment for the child at a multi-specialty hospital, the court said the “strict liability” theory should be applied in such cases. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed that prima facie consideration of materials submitted shows the parents of the child were made to helplessly watch its left hand thumb lay on the floor and the baby writhing in pain. It is such a horrifying experience which would have caused so much pain, suffering and mental agony to the parents. “Since the incident itself shows that there was negligence, some interim compensation must be paid by the government to the parents of the child. This is the minimum that a government must undertake in a welfare state,” observed the judges. Since a recommendation has already been made for award of compensation and it was under active consideration, the judge directed the state government to pay an interim compensation of Rs 75,000 to the parents within four weeks. The petitioner’s counsel submitted that the child has permanently lost its left thumb as the doctors were not able to refix it even though an operation was performed. Taking note of the submissions, the judge directed the authorities to admit the child to a multispeciality hospital in order to conduct any specialised surgery to ensure that the child does not permanently suffer from the loss of its left hand thumb. The judge directed the director of medical education and Thanjavur district collector to file a counter in the case. During the course of hearing, the state informed that a panel has been constituted to monitor the child and effective steps have been taken to treat it. Inquiry report was also sent to the higher officials. The case was adjourned to July 26 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/thumb-cut-off-hc-orders-rs-75k-interim-relief-to-babys-parents/articleshow/83792613.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Trichy||Trichy: Healthcare workers pressed into action to prevent Covid in kids||TRICHY: The paediatrics department of Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) attached to K A P Viswanatham government medical college (KAPVGMC) has geared up to prevent and treat incidences of Covid-19 in children by training frontline healthcare workers in the public health department and integrated child development services (ICDS) scheme in Trichy. At a video conference with village health nurses (VHNs), sector health nurses (SHNs) of the public health department and child development project officers and anganwadi workers of ICDS recently, neo-natal specialist Dr T Senthilkumar discussed the protocols of the national health mission (NHM) on managing paediatric Covid-19 cases. “Field level staff have started their task of keeping in touch with parents of newborn babies, infants and children to give them basic advice about the prevention and medical treatment,” Dr Senthilkumar told TOI. The staff were asked to take the list of newborns in their areas and Covid-19 infected antenatal care (ANC) and lactating mothers for providing advice. The staff were taught the symptoms for home isolation and hospital treatment. Trichy district witnessed a negligible number of children falling sick to Covid-19. “The step is taken to safeguard children from the infection irrespective of the incidence of third wave,” said Senthilkumar. The task of persuading parents of the children to get vaccinated was also entrusted to the field level staff. DDHS Dr S Ramganesh, who is heading the public health department, said VHNs and SHNs will once again undergo orientation. “There is no case of paediatric Covid-19 in our district as of now. Yet, we have to keep a steady vigil. The survey will commence in a few days to keep track of such cases,” he said. The paediatrics department at KAPVGMC has suggested the public health department ensure pulse oximeter suitable for children at all the 84 primary health centres(PHCs) in Trichy to track SpO2 level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/healthcare-workers-pressed-into-action-to-prevent-covid-in-kids/articleshow/83792605.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Pune||Maharashtra: CBSE-like marking for HSC after changes, say experts||PUNE: Experts and principals in junior colleges in the state want the state to adopt the evaluation method announced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) after tweaking it for HSC students. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has told the education department to examine if the CBSE pattern for HSC evaluation can be adopted for state board students. A L Deshmukh, educationist and president award winner for best teacher, said the formula would need to be tweaked giving 40% weightage to SSC marks and the remaining two classes (Std XI and Std XII) be given 30% each. “SSC is the only marks which can be taken without any biases and will also be acceptable to parents. Hence, maximum weightage must be for these marks. While the final exams were not held for Std XI, unit test I and II were held by March and hence, we can get 30% from Std XI too, based on how the student performed in these exams. The major challenge would be Std XII. Now, except Mumbai, classes were open for at least some weeks across Maharashtra for SSC and HSC. So, there must be some assessment possible for them. But, no schools reopened in Mumbai making it very difficult to assess the students here. Some online assessment is the only way out for Mumbai and even other areas where no assessment happened in Std XII,” Deshmukh said. Avinash Takawale, principal of Poona Night High School and Junior College, said it will be very hard to trace students who applied by filling form number 17 or those who are studying in night schools. “It would be very hard to get practical marks because many students are not in contact with the school. Most students enrolled in night schools work in the mornings but have been out of work because of the strict restrictions in place due to Covid-19. This has led to many going back to their villages where the network is a big issue. The lack of earnings means, education is becoming the last priority. Hence, contacting them, even for practicals, orals, internal assessments is very tough. Without contacting them, we cannot give marks. Even if we contact them on phone, what is to say that the person speaking to us is not a proxy,” he said. Ramdas Abhang, retired principal of Vimlabai Garware High School and Junior College, said, “Adopting CBSE pattern will not be a problem. All students have their SSC marks. The schools had also calculated Std XI marks or at least had the unit test marks till March and by then, all regular exams of Std XI, except the final exams were over. The only thing the colleges may not have is Std XII marks and practical marks. But, like in the case of SSC, colleges can award marks based on online exams were conducted over the year. The practicals can either be conducted online via a written project or can in batches at the colleges now that the cases have come down.” Tanvi Pawar, an SP College student, said she would like her college to take an internal exam now on the basis of which HSC weightage must be decided. “We don’t mind SSC results but there should be less weightage to std XI marks. Also, the colleges must hold an online exam for HSC now. There were no pre-boards and this can be a good way to assess students and give fair marks,” Pawar said. However, Nikhil Badad, a student of Saraswati Mandir Night School, said he was confused about the entire issue. “Sometimes, I feel there should be a board examination. Then, looking at the Covid-19 situation, they should give marks based on the CBSE pattern. I don’t know what will be good for us. I am really confused, but I would like them to declare something and be done with it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbse-like-marking-for-hsc-after-changes-say-experts/articleshow/83790361.cms||Ardhra Nair

Even if it means taking a longer detour and spending extra bucks to get there. So, while there would be restrictions on direct air flights between Ahmedabad and Toronto, many students from the city are seeking transit visas, hopping from one country to another and using stopovers at international airports. All this to reach Cananda in time for the second term of their college studies. The direct flights from Ahmedabad to Canada have been suspended during the second wave of Covid-19 in India and they are yet to resume. Yash Patel, 23, who had booked his air travel ticket for Canada, for May 4, has been stuck for over a month now after the direct flights from Ahmedabad were cancelled from April 22. “Presently online studies are on, but I want to be in my campus and study with my classmates,” Patel said. Apart from the campus experience, many students are also looking at working part-time to cover their study expenses. The annual college fees for postgraduate studies would range anywhere between Rs 15-30 lakh depending on the course chosen. Earlier, there were three connecting flight routes apart from the direct flights. They included one via Muscat and Ethiopia and another one via Russia and Siberia for reaching Canada. “Students are desperate to reach their destinations for college studies in Canada before the third wave of Covid-19 hits India. While direct flights would take 1.5-2 days to reach from Ahmedabad, these longer route flights take four days. Also, the travel fare is double or even more,” said Bhavin Thaker – director of a career consultancy firm in Ahmedabad. Thaker is hopeful that with Covid-19 cases going down, more flight routes to Canada will be resumed shortly. Students are required to take RT-PCR tests at the last destination of the flight before entering Canada. This would require them to stop over at places like Frankfurt for a day or two before they can get the test result. In case they test positive for Covid-19, they will have to abandon further travel till they get treated. Computer science, hotel management, big data architecture, cyber security and food chain management are some of the courses being pursued by Ahmedabad students in Canada. For students who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, there is no need to quarantine for Canada travel as with some other countries. The hopes of Karan Patel, 22, to travel to Canada have been dashed multiple times for he had to thrice cancel his tickets due to Covid-19 related travel restrictions. “My first term of college has ended and I am still stuck here. I have been waiting for the last four months to travel to Canada for my higher studies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-detour-canada-route-longer/articleshow/83790424.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Party Sivaganga district president Selvaraj has forwarded his resignation to the state leadership. Raja’s supporters had allegedly pinned the blame for his defeat on BJP cadres in Sivaganga, which irked Selvaraj. Following his decision, Thirupuvanam west union president of the BJP, Balamurugan, has also resigned. Balamurugan said Selvaraj was instrumental in nurturing the party and bringing in members to develop it. But when he is not given due recognition, there is no point in people who joined the party because of him staying back. He said that 59 branches of the party in Thirupuvanam were also being dismantled as a result of their resignation. Meanwhile, the party’s Karaikudi urban district president, K Chandran, has submitted a petition to the district president alleging threats from Raja. In his letter, Chandran said he had discharged his duties to the party with utmost loyalty for the past four years. But, Raja was blaming him for his defeat in the elections. Instead of introspecting on the defeat and his own role in it, he was putting the blame on other party cadres. He was threatening him through the party’s vice-president of Karaikudi and also through his nephew R Surya. Chandran said he feared that they may harm him or his family members, and requested the party high command to relieve him of his party post and all other responsibilities. The cadres have also alleged that Raja had mismanaged the fund given by the party towards election expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bjp-cadres-up-in-arms-against-h-raja-in-sivaganga/articleshow/83792648.cms||---
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: High court directs BSNL to pay up man for grabbing land||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday directed the BSNL to pay the market value along with interest for the 59 cents property it had virtually grabbed from a man by paying him a paltry sum of just Rs 1. Observing that it is a textbook case as to how the instrumentality of a state has attempted to unjustly enrich itself by grabbing the property, the court said that the BSNL can also reconvey the property back to the man, if there is no proposal to construct telephone exchange in there. The petitoner A S Marimuthu owned land at Samusigapuram village at Rajapalayam taluk in Virudhunagar district. While he was planning to construct a memorial for his father, the divisional engineer of BSNL approached the petitioner seeking his land for construction of telephone exchange. The petitioner stated that he will give the property free of cost to BSNL provided that the building is named after his father. Since the divisional engineer stated that the property cannot be taken as a gift as per government policy, the petitioner asked them to pay Rs 1 as token consideration and subsequently a sale deed was registered in 2001. Since there was no construction for 13 years, the petitioner filed a present petition before the HC Madurai bench in 2014 seeking for the cancellation of the sale deed and consequently sought for reconveyance of the property in his name. Justice N Anand Venkatesh observed, “Even when the state or its instrumentalities enter into a private contract, it is expected that they maintain a higher degree of fairness and reasonableness and it should not be assessed from the point of view of a private individual who may be driven with the only aim of making a personal gain out of the transaction.” “Having induced the petitioner to part with his property on these terms, the BSNL reneged on its promise to put up a building. The net result is that the petitioner suffered a double whammy. He has lost his property and the building that was promised has not come up for the past 20 years, although the BSNL says (and is still saying) that it intends to put up a superstructure. With BSNL playing cloak and dagger, the petitioner has been deprived of a valuable property of 59 cents for just Rs 1,” observed the judge. Hence, the judge observed that the court has no hesitation in concluding that the contract entered into between the petitioner and BSNL by virtue of the sale deed is totally unfair, arbitrary and unreasonable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-directs-bsnl-to-pay-up-man-for-grabbing-land/articleshow/83792637.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Reopen schools in areas free of Covid, say educators||PUNE: Many experts and teachers in rural areas hope that the government allows reopening of schools in Covid-19-free villages to compensate for the academic loss. A study by the Pune District Institute of Education and Training has said that over 89% of parents and 94% of teachers believe that students have suffered learning losses due to the extended closure of schools in the state . While online classes are happening, issues such as access to devices and cellphone network have affected its reach, especially in rural areas. Even in urban areas like Pune, 43% of the students did not have access to online education. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has told the education department to examine the possibility of reopening schools in Covid-19 free villages at least for standards X and XII. Hiware Bazar gram panchayat, which was opened its school offline for senior classes on June 15, but was told to shut down earlier this week, has written to Thackeray for permission to reopen. “We’ll initially explore the possibility of reopening class X and XII classrooms in villages where there have been no new cases in the last few months, provided they commit to Covid appropriate behaviour and adopt measures for keeping the virus at bay in future as well. The health and safety of our children remain our priority,” school education minister Varsha Gaikwad tweeted on Tuesday night. SB Deshmukh, secretary of Nashik District Principal Association, said, “There are many schools in remote areas and tribal villages across Maharashtra. These villages have not had any Covid-19 cases yet the schools are closed due to the blanket rule in the state. These villages have no access to the internet, which means for most of last year, and even this year, the students could not access education. However, the reopening of these schools will help students and villagers to a great extent. Nashik district itself has four talukas with a tribal population. Only reopening schools can ensure that education reaches these areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/reopen-schools-in-areas-free-of-covid-educators/articleshow/83790380.cms||Ardhra Nair

In the past one week, the elephant has trampled five people to death in Deoghar and Jamtara districts. According to forest officials here, the jumbo has so far killed 14 people across Santhal Pargana, Dhanbad and Giridih districts. In the past 24 hours alone, three people have lost their lives. Chaitali Devi (31) and her neighbour Vandana Kumari (16), residents of Dahua village under Pathrol police station of Deoghar district were trampled to death by the jumbo on Tuesday when they had gone to bathe in a nearby river. “Both Chaitali and Vandana had gone to take a bath in river Jayanti in the afternoon but did not return. Anticipating something is wrong, I along with a few others started looking for them. We spotted the jumbo hiding alongside the Dahua forest with the dead bodies of both lying at some distance,” recalled Chaitali’s husband Rakesh Kumar Bhudeo. The corpses were retrieved after foresters drove the elephant away, Bhudeo claimed. According to the district forest officials, the jumbo was later driven away towards Jamtara district where it again killed one Shankar Singh (50) in Kalajhariya village under Karmatand police station area the same evening. A married couple were killed by the same elephant in Maldiha village under Fatehpur police station of Jamtara on June 20 before been driven away by the forest department team to Deoghar district. “The jumbo is being attempted to be driven away to the Tundi forest area in Dhanbad and people have been asked not to indulge in any such activities so as to tease it which might prove dangerous to their lives,” the district forest officer of Jamtara Achintya Banker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/wild-elephant-tramples-3-dumka-villagers-to-death-in-24-hours/articleshow/83790905.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Police have not been able to crack the previous three cases and had tried keeping the recent episode a secret but it got leaked to media on Wednesday.  The threat mail, written in abusive and objectionable language, addressed to the CM was sent to the CM’s secretary on May 25 following which a case was registered at Gonda police station on June 1. Confirming that the mail was received by the CMO, Sadar deputy SP Deepak Kumar said that the sender was identified as Vikram Gadhrai and was traced to Raj Rajeshwari Nagar in Bengaluru, from where he was arrested. “The accused had not issued a direct life threat to the CM. However, the language was abusive and had several objectionable accusations. During interrogation, the youth was apologetic over his behaviour and claimed that he wrote it out of frustration during the second Covid wave prevailing in the state,” Kumar said, adding that he was later released on bail. After receipt of the mail, Gonda police had registered an FIR on June 1 under sections 385 and 387 of the IT Act, 2000, but once the sender was traced and interrogated the sections were changed to Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Gadhrai was released on bail. The CM had received similar mails in July 2020 and a case was registered with the Cyber Police station on July 13. Two such mails received by the CMO in July were self-destructive, wherein the mails were sent using a temporarily created ID. Police had then said that the mails had originated from servers in Switzerland and Germany. Once again threatening mails were sent to the CMO in January this year but the matter came to light in February. The then DGP M V Rao admitted before media in Chaibasa on February 9 that threat mails were received. ADG CID Prashant Singh said that he was not aware of the exact status of the previous cases. “We can share details after verifying,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-gets-another-threat-mail-accused-held-in-bengaluru-released-on-bail/articleshow/83790982.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Floated by a Twitter page named @WeareRanchi, the online campaign started on June 21, which is aimed at demanding jobs promised by the ruling parties of JMM and Congress to the state’s youth in their respective 2019 assembly election manifestos, is gaining momentum in the virtual space. “The youngsters of Jharkhand are asking questions on the issue of jobs on various social media platforms for a few days. I completely support their demands and the hashtag #Jharkhandi_Yuva_Mange_Rojgar,” Kumar tweeted. Youngsters are using the hashtag to demand timely conduction of state civil services exams and other competitive exams aimed at filling up various government vacancies. Recently,chief minister Hemant Soren's tweet on Yoga Day was flooded with the hashtag and questions about stalled exams. Seizing the opportunity, BJP tweeted: "The honourable MLA accepted that the JMM government has done nothing to provide employment to the state's youngsters. It takes courage to accept the truth. We thank the honourable MLA,” BJP state spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo tweeted. Responding to BJP's statement, Kumar tweeted stating that BJP had misled the state's Moolvasis in the name of employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-mla-supports-job-campaign-bjp-spies-opportunity/articleshow/83791371.cms||---

We hope that Lohra will set an example for others to follow.” Quadragenerian Lohra, who has lost both his arms, took the jab on his left thigh at the Manoharpur community health centre and said that he did not experience any health problems after taking the jab. “Due to the lack of awareness, many villagers are afraid of falling sick or worse, losing their lives after taking the jab. That is why many are unwilling to take it,” Kunal Saraf, the district governor of the Lions Club of Chaibasa, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/double-amputee-takes-jab-in-w-sbhum-officials-hope-it-will-inspire-others/articleshow/83791270.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Congress MLAs meet senior AICC leader, Jharkhand unit unruffled||RANCHI: The state leadership of the Congress on Wednesday seemed unruffled with the recent developments wherein four of its lawmakers reached the party’s Delhi Durbar seeking sweeping reforms. “The party’s democratic setup gives every karyakarta the opportunity to meet the national leadership. There is nothing wrong in it,” Congress legislative party leader Alamgir Alam told TOI on Wednesday. While Alam shrugged off the episode, state Congress chief Rameshwar Oraon also seemed unfazed about the meeting of four Congress MLAs with AICC general secretary K C Venugopal on Wednesday morning. Jamtara MLA Irfan Ansari, Barhi MLA Umashankar Akela, Khijri MLA Rajesh Kacchap and Ramgarh MLA Mamata Devi met Venugopal on Wednesday morning at the latter’s residence and held discussions for 45 minutes. Speaking after the meeting, Ansari said: “We discussed the ways in which our organization can be strengthened in Jharkhand. We demanded that the 20 points committee should be constituted at the earliest and that our MLAs and karyakartas should be given their due share of respect.” Ansari, who is also one of the five working presidents, underscored that Congress should be allocated the vacant berth in the state cabinet. “JMM is the bigger party in the alliance. It holds the offices of the CM and the Assembly speaker. Congress should be given the vacant berth,” he claimed. Akela claimed Venugopal and AICC national in-charge for Jharkhand RPN Singh sought detailed reports on the work done by the party during the second wave of the pandemic. Congress sources in Ranchi, however, said Ansari’s ‘dissent’ stemmed from the fact that he was left out of the cabinet berth. “But it needs to be reminded that he holds the post of the chairman of the Haj Committee as well,” a senior functionary said. The meeting of the four MLAs with senior AICC leadership can lead to stormy sessions in the Congress legislative party meeting, which is scheduled for Thursday in Ranchi. "Various issues will be discussed and debated," Alam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-mlas-meet-senior-aicc-leader-state-unit-unruffled/articleshow/83791228.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Surat||Maharashtra: Two bootleggers held for police informer’s murder||SURAT: The Surat crime branch sleuths arrested two persons on Wednesday for their alleged involvement in the murder of a businessman Bhavesh Mehta, who was also a police informer, in Navapur of Maharashtra on June 17. The accused are associates of historysheeter Anil Kathi. Four other accused involved in the murder are yet to get arrested. Police arrested Aakash Oad (28) and Aakash Jorwal (20) for their alleged involvement in the murder of Mehta who was found murdered in a car near D J Agarwal School in Navapur of Maharashtra. Bloodstained body of Mehta, a resident of Bhatar in Surat city, was tied using adhesive tape. The case is being investigated by Navapur police. Sources in the police said that Mehta was a police informer. Both the accused are bootleggers and have been arrested multiple times in the past. The accused informed police that they had thrashed Mehta on orders of Kathi, but Mehta succumbed to the injuries. The accused duo was identified from the CCTV footage. “The accused are historysheeter hence they were identified and we were in search for them,” said a police officer. Anit Kathi has cases of issuing threats, assault, extortion and bootlegging registered against him. He is currently active in bootlegging and it is suspected to have developed dispute with Mehta over his criminal activities, police sources informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-bootleggers-held-for-police-informers-murder/articleshow/83788734.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Rights panel picks holes in cop version of firing incident||RANCHI: Civil rights activists under the banner of Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM) investigated the incident of firing in Kuku-Piri forest on June 12 in which one Bramhadev Singh was killed. The JJM team’s findings were similar to that of the BJP ST wing, which accused the security forces of opening fire on villagers and ruled out the involvement of Maoists. The only difference between the observations of the two fact-finding teams remained in the identification of the security forces. While the BJP team blamed the Jharkhand Jaguar and district police, the Mahasabha did not identify any security wing. The Mahasabha team comprising representatives of Adivasi Adhikar Manch, Adivasi Women’s Network and Human Rights Law Network, among others, visited Kuku-Piri village on June 17 and spoke to the affected families and the local administration as well. On Wednesday, the team met the deputy commissioner of Latehar, the DIG of Palamu range and the deputy SP of Latehar to discuss the findings and later addressed the media. The team said there was no exchange of fire and “innocent villagers were fired upon by the security forces.” The team said that six tribal youths went out for traditional Sarhul hunting with a ‘bharatua’ gun, used in killing birds and small animals. “But they had not fired a single bullet as they were hardly 50 feet away from their homes and had seen the security persons coming,” a member of the team, Siraj, said. The Mahasabha claimed that the youth had raised their hands in surrender and shouted that they were villagers. “But the security personnel kept firing. One of the bullets fired by them hit one of the villagers, Dinenath, in the hand. Another bullet hit Bramhadev. The firing continued for about half an hour. Fearing being shot at; the five men ran away from the forest. Thereafter, the security forces took Bramhadev to the edge of the forest and fired three shots at him, which led to his death,” she said quoting the villagers. Pointing finger at the intent of police, Mahasabha said that the FIR does not mention Bramhadev’s death by police firing. “According to the FIR, this incident was an exchange of fire in which the first shot was fired by the group of armed villagers and some people fled into the forest. The FIR also mentions that Brahmadev’s body was found at the edge of the forest. These statements are contrary to the facts. The police have filed a case against the six Adivasis, including Bramhadev, under various sections which exposes the true intentions of the police,” another member of the team, Prafull Linda, said. Based on its findings, the Mahasabha said: “A fresh FIR should be lodged against the security personnel or officers responsible for the firing and the death of Bramhadev and action should also taken against the local police for registering wrong FIR based on concocted facts,” the delegation in its letter to the DC has said. The JJM has also demanded an ex-gratia relief of Rs 10 lakh for the widow of Bramhadev and special training for security personnel in tribal traditions, languages and customs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rights-panel-picks-holes-in-cop-version-of-firing-incident/articleshow/83791326.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Contrary to the expectations, the SDMA headed by chief minister Hemant Soren did not allow any further relaxations over and above the existing ones. “We are still passing through the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and there are apprehensions about an impending third wave. We will evaluate the situation again in some time and decide accordingly (on further easing of the curbs),” Soren told journalists at Jharkhand Mantralaya. Notably, the health safety week, which was imposed on April 22, was extended for the fifth time till June 24. However, the government had eased curbs a bit and allowed all business establishments to remain open till 4pm in between Mondays and Saturdays. “The provisions of the order number 207 dated June 16, 2021 related to the observance of Swasthya Suraksha Saptah shall stand extended from 6am of June 24 to 6am of July 1, 2021,” an order signed by chief secretary Sukhdev Singh read. Extensions of the ongoing provisions will mean that inter-state and inter-district bus transport will remain grounded while the state will continue to remain under complete lockdown from Saturday evenings to Monday mornings. Religious places shall remain out of bounds for devotees while social, cultural and political gatherings will remain restricted. Assembly of more than five persons will also be deemed violation of the disaster management Act Of 2005. Commercial establishments shall remain open for business till 4pm while private and government offices will operate with curtailed workforce. Dining at hotels, restaurants and eateries will remain prohibited but takeaways will be allowed. Parks, gymnasiums and swimming pools will continue to remain closed. The members of Ranchi Bus Owners’ Association were a dejected lot on Wednesday. “Over 1,000 buses, which ply between the district headquarters and neighbouring states, are grounded for over two months now. We are incurring huge losses. The government should have at least allowed us to operate inter-district with 50% sitting capacity,” a functionary of the association said. Notably, Jharkhand had imposed the lockdown when the state’s weekly positivity rate stood at over 16%. As on June 20, the state’s positivity rate had dropped to 0.3%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-disaster-wing-extends-partial-lockdown-till-july-1/articleshow/83790942.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Vadodara||Anand: Sardar Patel university chief accounts officer, auditors summoned in Rs 29 crore irregularity case||VADODARA/ANAND: A committee appointed to probe alleged financial irregularity to the tune of Rs 29.22 crore at Sardar Patel University (SPU) in 2015 has issued summons to chief accounts officer (CAO), former and current auditors of the university. The trio has been called on Friday. According to case details, irregularities had come to light in 2015 that the university had defaulted Rs 4 crore in tax deduction at source (TDS) since 2004-05. Prof Shirish Kulkarni, who had taken over as the varsity’s vice-chancellor in 2016, had removed all the chartered accountants (CAs) who were handling the university accounts. Further probe in the university accounts revealed that there was an accounting mismatch to the tune of Rs 29.22 crore. It is not known whether the irregularity is a scam, accounting error, fraud or serious financial mismanagement but financial transactions of the university are not matching, said an official. “Apart from an existing account by the name of university’s own funds, another account by the name of university’s own funds (general) was created on April 1, 2015. This account shows Rs 29.22 crore debited from it,” said the official. The university’s CAO could not provide any satisfactory explanation for the mismatch. “If this amount is debited, there has to be expenditure against it or some asset worth the amount,” the official said. After SPU’s syndicate members demanded strict action against CAO NK Bhatt, Kulkarni has appointed a committee which is headed by retired judge of Gujarat High Court Dhiren Karia and has accountant general from Rajkot office Narendra Dave, professor PK Priyan from MBA department, syndicate member KP Patel and CA Sanjeev Shah, forensic auditor as members. The committee has held three meetings so far. On Friday, it has summoned Bhatt, former auditor K G Patel and current auditor Alok Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/spu-cao-auditors-summoned-in-rs-29cr-irregularity-case/articleshow/83787156.cms||---

Deputy mayor Manisha Dhawde, ruling party leader Avinash Thakre, superintending engineer Vijay Pohekar, executive engineer Sonali Chavan, assistant municipal commissioners Prakash Warade among others attended the meeting. The mayor also expressed anguish over potholed roads and asked the civic administration to carry out patchwork without delay and submit a report within seven days.

---||Goa||In Sattari, Malabar gliding frog crossbreeds with common Indian tree frog||Keri: The natural crossbreeding between two different species of frogs was recently witnessed and recorded in Kumthal hamlet of Caranzol in Sattari taluka. Kumthal is a remote hamlet situated at the foothill of Huland dongar, inside the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. It is here that a local, Pravin Gaonkar, saw the phenomena of natural crossbreeding taking place between the male of the Malabar gliding frog and female of the common tree frog. The Malabar gliding frog, endemic to the Western Ghats, possesses the ability to glide when leaping down from treetops, covering a distance of 9-12m by stretching the webbing between its toes. The female Indian tree frog, with a brownish colour and darker marking on it, sometimes comes near human settlement in search of food. Though this frog is arboreal, it descends during mating. “I was fascinated to see the mating of these amphibians belonging to different species. The frogs were found mating after the rain,” Gaonkar said. Amit Sayyed of the Wildlife Protection Research Society of Satara - Maharashtra, has studied the natural crossbreeding of these frogs. He found that among the tree frogs, more or less the same natural breeding and nesting behavior prevails. However, though both these species share a common habitat, crossbreeding is usually avoided, Sayyed has found. He observed that after the monsoon downpour male and female frogs of the Malabar gliding species emerged from hibernation. Males give calls to attract females. The female selects a leaf on a twig of a tree overhanging a water body where mating takes place. The male releases seminal fluid to form the foam nest in which the female lays eggs by covering the foam with leaves. Sayyed had studied this crossbreeding in the forest of Amboli. “The foam nest formed by these crossbreeding pairs was observed undisturbed for eight days and was found to have unfertilized and hence underdeveloped eggs,” Sayyed said. Gajanan Shetye, a wildlifer from Keri Sattari, told TOI, “I had witnessed the natural breeding of the Malabar gliding frog and common tree frog in the forests of Sacorda in Dharbandora. Despite the cross breeding, fertilization of eggs does not take place. As the number of females is less, the males of Malabar gliding frogs prefer mating with common Indian frogs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-sattari-malabar-gliding-frog-crossbreeds-with-common-indian-tree-frog/articleshow/83792750.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

Although Wednesday saw 53,920 cases and 971 deaths, the weekly trend based on seven day’s rolling average is showing an overall decline in cases. On Wednesday, the sevenday rolling average of daily cases, a more reliable indicator to capture long-term trends, fell to 54,380, which is at the same level as the average in the last week of March. Despite the decline in cases in India, the international picture is not very encouraging. Many countries are again witnessing a surge in cases. The seven-day rolling average of cases was 73,595 for Brazil which has now overtaken India and is the world’s worst-affected country in this yardstick. Similarly for Colombia — the world’s third worst-hit country in daily cases — the average reached its peak value for this month on June 19 when the country saw 27,812 cases. It has remained at that level since then. Russia, Indonesia, South Africa and the UK are also going through a phase of rise in cases. All of them reported this month’s highest average cases on June 23. Even in our neighborhood, cases are steadily increasing in Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Myanmar – they too reported this month’s highest average case on June 23. Among states, Kerala reported 12,787 cases, the highest among states, and was followed by Maharashtra (10,066 cases). These two are the only states to report over 10,000 cases on Wednesday. Seven other states reported over a thousand cases on Wednesday, led by Tamil Nadu with 6,596 cases and Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka with 4,684 and 4,436 cases respectively. The case count was between 1,000 and 4,000 for Odisha, Assam, West Bengal and Telangana. Four states reported over a hundred deaths, with Tamil Nadu reporting 166 deaths, highest among the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-cases-falling-steadily-in-india-but-rising-in-uk-brazil-russia/articleshow/83796856.cms||---

BJP members are learnt to have objected to the committee discussing ‘vaccine development’, arguing that this was not appropriate at the current juncture when the country was still fighting the pandemic. This argument was rejected by Ramesh. A couple of BJP members even demanded for vote on postponing the meeting when the opposition members sought to question the government’s vaccine policy. Ramesh is understood to have refused to postpone or hold a vote and even threatened to resign as chair of the panel saying such a meeting is always conducted through consensus. Threefour out of 11 participating BJP members who walked out returned to the meeting. One of the participants, however, insisted that it was not a walkout as being speculated but a kind of ‘strategic timeout’ for putting up appropriate questions. Allaying concerns of certain members over the gigantic task of vaccinating the entire adult population in absence of adequate vaccines, officials are understood to have clarified how the progress since June 21 would be in tune with the road map to do it by December through involvement of more vaccine manufacturers and allowing new vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stormy-house-panel-meet-discusses-vaccine-road-map/articleshow/83796858.cms||---

Corporal Yogendra Kumar (28), who works at Pechora Missile System as group-124 crewman, moved the HC after his department asked him to show cause why his services should not be terminated for putting air warriors at health risk. Issuing notice to IAF, a bench of Justices AJ Desai and AP Thaker sought IAF’s reply and ordered that Kumar should not be forced to get vaccinated at least till further hearing, which is scheduled on July 1. In his petition, Kumar submitted that in February he showed his unwillingness to get vaccinated. He was issued a show-cause notice on April 24 by the air commanding officer on why action according to the rules of the Air Force Act should not be taken for his reluctance. In response, Kumar said that the Covid-19 vaccine was not safe and had been given only emergency use authorisation. This invited another show-cause notice on May 10, seeking an explanation about why he should not be dismissed from service. It said, “Your defiance verges on gross indiscipline and your continuation in service is likely to adversely impact the health of other air warriors and Air Force civilians…” Seeking quashing of the notice, protection of his job and protection from forced vaccination, Kumar submitted that he used ayurvedic medicines/products to increase immunity against coronavirus, adding that it was prescribed by the Ayush ministry. He also contended that the Centre had said that taking the vaccine was voluntary and cited a Supreme Court judgment that said a person had the right to choose the medication of his choice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/iaf-corporal-saved-from-losing-job-over-jab-jitters/articleshow/83796875.cms||Saeed Khan

Over 80% (84,998) beneficiaries were from 18+ age group in the city, rural as well as rest of the division. Nagpur district too recorded its all-time high of 42,230 inoculations as per the 10pm report uploaded on Co-Win system. As per data recorded before 8pm, 23,703 vaccinations were done under Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) limits while 18,018 were from rural areas under zilla parishad. This made up for 41,721 put on record by officials. The deputy director of health services office said the day’s figure in the district stood at 40,239 before 8pm. The 23,703 vaccinations were also the highest for NMC, which had recorded 16,451 on April 10. Around 20,300 were from the 18+ group. At most centres, youths queued up quietly for their turn. Though this group was expected to increase footfall, the entire drive went off without much crowding. NMC allowed 50% slots for on-the-spot registration. The district had recorded 20,634 jabs while division figures stood at 35,517 on April 10. The next day, district total had come down to 6,731 and division’s to 13,679. On Tuesday, the division recorded 53,827 inoculations, with Nagpur district at 25,311. The district was way ahead of the remaining five districts with none crossing more than 17,000 mark in the day. At Wednesday’s rate, the entire 18+ city population could be vaccinated with first dose in next 28 days. As per NMC estimates, 11.50 lakh population falls in this age band. However, NMC is left with around 15,000 doses of Covishield and 4,000 of Covaxin, which indicates the figures are likely to come down on Thursday. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) convenor Dr Anup Marar welcomed the vaccination figures. “It is gratifying. But it is not sufficient. Non-inclusion of private hospitals who have shown enthusiasm and conveyed their vaccine requirements to NMC to join in this mission is incomprehensible,” he said. Dr Marar added that having all private hospitals and clinics in the team will help authorities hasten vaccination to cover all in 18+ age group. “National Health Authority portal, where vaccine charges are to be paid by private hospitals as per new GR, is also yet to open. There seems to be confusion on this matter, which needs urgent attention,” he said. VHA had already given cumulative requirement of one lakh doses to Serum Institute of India, when they said large orders are being given priority. “Surprisingly, even that order did not materialize, raising questions on the sale and distribution methodology. Transparency in allocation and distribution is desired to allay misgivings in this direction. When other cities are flush with vaccines, why step motherly treatment to Nagpur?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/record-1-05-lakh-inoculated-in-nagpur-division-on-wed/articleshow/83793205.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Two of the unidentified bodies, of a woman and a teenage boy, were found on Tuesday while the third, of a young girl, was found on Wednesday. The bodies of a woman, aged around 40 years, and the teenaged boy were found near Amboli village with their one hand tied together with a dupatta. The body of an infant girl, aged around five months, was found on the bank of the river near Kathore Bridge. Police are yet to confirm if all three bodies are connected to each other. Local fishermen alerted the police after spotting the bodies of the woman and the teenage boy floating in water. The bodies were recovered at around 4.30 pm on Tuesday. The girl’s body was found on Wednesday morning and cops suspect that few of the parts were eaten by scavengers. Police have sent all three bodies for post mortem. “All three bodies are decomposed and they are yet to be identified. Police contacted nearby police stations to check if a missing report was registered,” said a police officer in Kamrej police station. Cops are examining CCTVs in the area to identify if the woman’s movement is recorded.

The university’s name did not appear in GSRIF 2021-22, the summary report that had rankings of 34 universities of Gujarat including both public and private universities. While Gujarat University tops the chart, even neighbouring universities in and around Vadodara have featured in the rankings. Last year, MSU was ranked 13th in GSRIF which was launched by the state government in 2019 on the lines of the National Institutional Ranking Framework which is released by the ministry of human resource and development (now ministry of education). MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas admitted that the university has not participated in the state rankings. “Our focus is on NAAC preparations and hence we did not participate in the state rankings,” he said, adding that MSU stands at structural disadvantage as it runs both under- and post-graduate programmes. “A lot of other universities are at an advantage as they run only PG departments where the strength of students is less and there are enough teachers. We have 47,000 students,” he said, claiming that the university is focusing on national and international rankings. GSRIF aims to create world class institutions in Gujarat by the Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat in partnership with the Indian Centre for Academic Rankings and Excellence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-absent-from-gsrif-ranking/articleshow/83787277.cms||---
---||India||LAC deployment meant to foil India ‘land grab’: China||NEW DELHI: China blamed India again on Wednesday for the LAC standoff as it described its own military deployment along the western section as a “normal defence arrangement” aimed at preventing and responding to “encroachment and threat on China’s territory” by India. For a long time, the Chinese foreign ministry claimed, the Indian side had been increasing its military deployment along the China-India border and encroaching on China’s territory. Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said this was the “root cause” of tension along the China-India border. “China always stands for a peaceful settlement of the boundary issue through negotiation and against linking the boundary issue with bilateral relations,” the official said, reiterating China’s position that the boundary issue should not be allowed to come in the way of overall development of ties. The spokesperson was responding to a query on foreign minister S Jaishankar's remark that China's military deployment along its disputed border with India and uncertainty over whether Beijing will fulfil its promise on troop reduction remained a challenge for relations between the two countries. India and China have so far had 11 rounds of corps commander-level talks for LAC disengagement and deescalation. While both sides have agreed on the need to resolve the outstanding issues in accordance with existing agreements and protocols, India has repeatedly stressed that completion of disengagement in the remaining areas would pave the way for the two sides to consider de-escalation of forces and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity and enable progress in bilateral relations. China, however, has continued to drag its feet on the issue while blaming India for the deadlock.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lac-deployment-meant-to-foil-india-land-grab-china/articleshow/83796882.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: SSLC exams SOP out, Covid positive too can take exam||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government on Wednesday released standard operating procedures (SOP) for holding SSLC exams in the third week of July, allowing students with symptoms or Covid too to write the exams. More than 8.7 lakh students will appear for the exam, now reduced to a two-day affair in the multiple-choice format. The exams were earlier scheduled to be from June 21-July 5. A Covid care centre will be identified at every taluk level for Covid-positive students, who can write the exam only after seeking the advice of local health officers. Home-isolated students will be taken to the Covid care centres in ambulances. State health department officials will be invigilators in these centres. Students’ OMR sheets will be sanitized before evaluation. Last year, a similar protocol was in place for supplementary SSLC exams and Common Entrance Test. Teachers and other officials present at exam centres must have taken at least one dose of Covid vaccination. Officials will also have to undergo an RT-PCR test and must wear a face shield. Students with symptoms like cough, cold, or fever will be seated in separate rooms and provided N-95 masks. Students from other states who cannot attend SSLC exams can write supplementary exams as freshers. The government has given students an option to change the exam centre to a place closer to home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-sslc-exams-sop-out-covid-positive-too-can-take-exam/articleshow/83803266.cms||---

The initiatives were launched by chief minister BS Yediyurappa at Vidhana Soudha and includes distributing tablet PCs to 1,55,000 students amounting to Rs 163 crore, creation of 2,500 smart classrooms by spending Rs 27.8 crore, and development of a learning management system (LMS) at a cost of over Rs 4 crore. “The initiatives of empowering students by providing tablet PCs and creating 2,500 smart classrooms are expected to largely benefit students belonging to economically weaker sections of society, who pursue their studies in government educational institutions,” said Yediyurappa. Tablet PCs will be distributed to first-year students of 430 government first grade colleges, first and second-year students of 87 government polytechnic colleges and first, second and third yearstudents of 14 engineering colleges. Around 2,500 classes have been converted to smart classrooms by equipping them with a projector, whiteboard, Android box, UPS, and internet connections to facilitate use of modern teaching. The department of higher education had earlier launched the LMS system which offers powerpoint presentations, video lessons, study and assessment materials and analysis of students’ performance. CN Ashwath Narayan, minister of higher education, said the implemented programmes will enable ‘any time, anywhere learning’ for 25,000 teaching faculty and five lakh students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/over-1-5-lakh-government-college-students-in-karnataka-get-smart-tabs/articleshow/83796921.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||High court slams Telangana govt for delaying capping GO||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday slammed the state government for issuing a GO on capping charges in private hospitals at a time when the second wave was almost ebbing. The court asked the government if it was willing to impose heavy penalties on errant private hospitals for fleecing patients. Blaming the government for the belated GO, a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy said: “People asked you (government) to rein in the private hospitals. We asked you to bring the GO. You brought it finally at the fag end of the second wave.” When director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao informed the bench that the government had issued a GO (No. 401 dated June 22, 2021) capping charges for various tests, treatment, medicines, etc., the judges said the GO did not specify quantum of penalties to be imposed even now. The DPH admitted that the GO needed amendments and assured the court that he would get them done by incorporating penalties for each offence. “Keep prohibitively high penalties. That should make them (private hospitals) wary of collecting excess charges,” the judges said. They asked the DPH to come out with a fresh affidavit by July 7. “Give wide publicity to the capping GO,” the judges said while hearing a batch of PILs on Covid-19. Senior counsel L Ravi Chander, advocates Karam C Komireddy and Arjun Kumar elaborated on how Kerala was imposing penalties that are 10 times more than the excess charges collected by the hospitals there. The judges said this would certainly act as a deterrent on hospitals which may think twice before collecting huge bills from the patients if the state government also implements a strict regime like the one in Kerala. The DPH said the government is already taking action on the private hospitals and added that he had received 350 complaints against 170 private hospitals. “We refunded ₹70 lakh to the families of patients in 30 cases,” he said. However, the advocates were not convinced with his reply and said hospitals were charging the same amount from each of the patients during the thick of the second wave. “People must have the option to get back their hard-earned savings,” they said. The judges said a mechanism was already there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-court-slams-telangana-for-delaying-capping-go/articleshow/83796901.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
