---||Goa||‘Felix was the most sincere and dedicated footballer’||PANAJI: Felix Barreto hardly put a foot wrong for Dempo Sports Club. During the 12 years that he spent at the club from 1968 to 1980, Barreto had multiple partners in central defence, yet he remained steady. He gave his all and when he appeared to make a mistake, thought about it for years. “I still can’t forget the mistake at the Rovers Cup in 1976,” he once told TOI. “I was at fault with the clearance and Central Bank of India scored. We were the defending champions but lost 1-0 against a comparatively weaker team.” This is not how Barreto, who passed away on Tuesday at age 78, is remembered at the club. He’s known as the man who was at the top of his game whenever he took the field and inspired others to give their best. “He made a big impression on all of us,” said Francis D’Souza, Dempo’s star striker and Goa’s first professional footballer. “Felix was a gentleman, both on and off the field. I would rate him as one of the most sincere and dedicated footballer I met with no malice towards anyone.” Barreto joined Dempo in 1968 after impressing during his days at Shantilal Sports Club. It was coach Cyril Ferrao, also from Chinchinim, who spotted and groomed him, and once the Dempo doors opened, there was no looking back. “I was initially playing as a midfielder and it was Cyril who turned me into a central defender. I respected his understanding of the game and when he suggested I would be better off in defence, I blindly accepted his decision,” Barreto was quoted as saying in Golden Eagles, a book that celebrates the club’s 50 years (1967-2017). Barreto – who coached Salcete FC after his retirement -- essayed some brilliant performances that helped Dempo win major trophies like the Rovers Cup, Stafford Challenge Cup, Nizam Gold Cup and Bandodkar Gold Trophy. In 1976, the year he uncharacteristically erred against Central Bank and blamed himself for the loss, he was at his peak and caught the eye of national selectors. Barreto was summoned for the national camp but could not make it to the final team. “There will be a generation of younger players who remain indebted to Felix,” said Armando Colaco, former Dempo player and coach. “He encouraged all of us. You can ask players like Rosario Rodrigues, Francis D’Souza, Dionisio Trindade, Alex Miranda and others. He was a guide.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/felix-was-the-most-sincere-and-dedicated-footballer/articleshow/83903016.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

They lost against eventual champions Mumbai City on penalties in the semifinal. In this interview with TOI, the club’s director of football, Ravi Puskur, explains how the club nullified star departures, what goes behind all those successful foreign signings and why Goa will be stronger next season. Excerpts from an interview with TOI… Given the departures and all that transpired, last season was difficult at the start for FC Goa. But were you happy in the end?If you look at how we began the season, we did well with a brand new team. Given how we progressed, there was some sense of unfulfillment. We lost a game in December against Chennaiyin FC, which was our seventh game. To get knocked out despite being unbeaten is disappointing. Are we happy with our performance? Yes. Are we satisfied with the result? No. FC Goa looked a different team after the January transfer window. Why were so many reinforcements needed? A couple of them were forced. When (Mohammed) Nawaz told us that he wasn’t going to stay with us, we had to bring in someone who would be with us for the long term. Dheeraj (Singh) stood out as an obvious candidate and showed plenty of interest in Goa. With Lenny (Rodrigues) wanting to move out, we brought in Glan (Martins). Adil (Khan) helped us defensively, and Amarjit (Singh) was another option. We needed the reinforcements due to the AFC Champions League as well. Goa have mastered the art of making great foreign signings. What goes behind the scenes before you decide who’s the best candidate?We have three different ways of identifying players: one is agency network where multiple agents and intermediaries offer players. Second, we identify players from within the league and third is through profiling, which we do quite a bit. We extensively watch other leagues and have a database built over the years. Given the fact that we are very clear of how we want to play, it’s not difficult for us to identify the four or five (players) who will fit us. Then, we do extensive amount of video work. We have a team of four or five people who go through all the videos. Each one gives the assessment, and when we have a player who stands out from all the assessments, we ask (coach) Juan (Ferrando) to give his opinion. Once we get the green light (from the coach), negotiations start. How many player profiles do you look at before making a signing?For the striker alone, about 30-35 profiles, where we had an indepth look. There would be another 20-30 who we looked at casually. We always have four or five names who we look at seriously. In football, till the paper work is done, you never know what can happen. Is there an element of luck in foreign players becoming a success? For example, everyone spoke highly of Adrian Colunga during pre-season in 2017, but it was Coro who became a star.When Colunga came to India, he was the sharpest I’ve seen on the training ground. We saw him in an ISL game for only 45 minutes and he was really, really sharp. If he had played an entire season, his numbers (goals and assists) would have been similar or very close (to Coro). It didn’t work out because he was injured and didn’t settle well. Goa have retained four foreign players. Given the new rules, will you have five or six? We will sign two more. Then we will reassess and see how much contribution they have made to the team and take a call next year. Why is there change in foreign policy with maximum signings, unlike previous seasons?Let me be completely frank. The shift is necessitated because Indian players are getting very expensive. I don’t believe the market is very efficient at this moment, and if I am very honest, it’s cheaper for us to find a good quality foreign player than a good quality Indian because the Indian market is saturated. Prices are inflated. It makes better financial sense to sign a cheaper foreigner than a good Indian player who might be on the very expensive side. Goa have relied largely on foreign players. Will the reduction in foreign players be a disadvantage?I can see why you are asking that question, but I don’t see it as a disadvantage for us next season because we have a very good spine. We have multiple options now on the pitch. We should be fine. An example of this was in the AFC Champions League, which was a great testing ground for us against extremely high-quality opposition. A large majority of the squad who competed in ACL will be with us next season. We can only get stronger. We are not worried that we will have four foreigners on the pitch. We will have two foreigners on the bench (next season), a luxury which we didn’t have last season or in ACL. How long can you ignore the absence of a quality domestic centre-back in the team?I do realise in the past couple of seasons, we have gone with foreign centre-backs, so there is some sense of doubt whether we have someone who can fill that space for the entire duration of ISL. We are in the market looking for good centre-backs, but it’s not just us; everyone wants that kind of player and there are only a handful. To be fair to our players, we are asking them to do quite a lot. We are asking them to play a very risky game, pass the ball out from the back and that has an element of risk. I am confident in Juan. We have a coach who is keen on building those capabilities, rather than finding players from the market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/makes-financial-sense-to-sign-cheaper-foreigner-than-good-indian-ravi-puskur/articleshow/83904239.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

This was also the week that saw the seven-day rolling average of daily deaths fall under 1,000 after 61 days. On Sunday, India recorded 689 Covid deaths, the lowest toll in 81 days since April 7, when 685 deaths were registered. For the time since April 12, fatalities reported on Sunday were below 1,000 even after the addition of 262 "backlog" deaths reported by Maharashtra. Last week (June 14-20), Covid deaths had declined by 45%, the highest weekly fall in fatalities since the beginning of the pandemic. Even though cases have been declining for seven weeks, the fall in deaths had been slower till two weeks ago. Moreover, the seven-day average of daily cases fell below 50,000 on Sunday. The last time the index was below 50,000 was on March 25, three months ago. India recorded 3,45,028 fresh cases during the week, down nearly 19% from the previous seven days. This was also the lowest count of cases in 14 weeks since March 15-21. However, there has been a discernible slowing of the decline in cases. In each of the four weeks prior to the current one, cases had declined by around 30%. On Sunday, 46,315 fresh cases were recorded, as per TOI's Covid database. Active cases in the country stood at around 5.8 lakh, having dropped below 6 lakh on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/weekly-deaths-fall-by-38-covid-toll-at-81-day-low/articleshow/83906412.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||Watch out for four emerging variants of coronavirus, warn health experts||HYDERABAD: Health experts have called for strong surveillance on four emerging coronavirus variants, apart from the Delta-plus (B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1) strain, which has already been designated as a variant of concern (VOC). The variants to be watched out for includes B.1.617.3, a sibling of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2); B.1.1.318, which has 14 mutations; and Lambda (C.37), which was designated as a variant under investigation on June 23. Kappa (B.1.617.1), another sibling of the Delta variant, too needs to be closely monitored, though it has thus far been less infectious than Delta or Delta-plus. While B.1.617.3 and B.1.1.318 are already present in India, Lambda is yet to make its way into the country though it is spreading fast across the world. Experts fear that opening of international air travel may bring a cocktail of new variants, including Lambda, into India. They also called for more genomic surveillance to identify and find solutions to emerging variants. Follow TOI's live blog for latest updates on CoronavirusThe double mutant B.1.617, first identified in Maharashtra, gave rise to three variants - B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3. The WHO had named B.1.617.1 as Kappa and B.1.617.2 as Delta. It did not name the B.1.617.3 variant and it is now clubbed under the Kappa group. As on June 22, India has reported 148 genome sequences of B.1.617.3 from the total worldwide sequences of 161. As far as the Kappa variant is concerned, India has thus far reported 3,083 of the 4,217 sequences from around the world. Read AlsoCovid vaccine for kids above 12 likely to be available by July-end or August: GovtThe government on Sunday said that Covid vaccination of children in the 12-18 age group may start by the end of July or in August. Trial for Zydus Cadila vaccine is almost complete. By July end or in August, we might be able to start administering this vaccine to children of 12-18 age group, said DrThe variant B.1.1.318 contains the mutation E484K. According to GISAID data, India has reported two genome sequences of this emerging variant of 173 reported around the world. According to Dr Vighnesh Naidu Y, consultant physician at Yashoda Hospitals in Hyderabad, viruses tend to mutate as they multiply, and mutations are tiny errors in the original genetic makeup of the organism. "As these mutate, they change the ability of the virus to infect in terms of faster rate of transmission, increased virulence and their ability to evade our immune response," he told TOI. The Public Health England (PHE) announced Lambda as a variant to be kept under watch as its presence was reported from several countries. Senior geneticist Dr M Khaja said the PHE has noticed a combination of mutations in the Lambda variant. The GISAID data shows that 1,845 sequences of Lambda have been posted from across the world. None of them is from India. The PHE, in its June 25 report, warned that Lambda has the potential of increased transmissibility and possible increased resistance to neutralising antibodies. The effectiveness of existing vaccines needs to be tested against Lambda. Dr Vighnesh told TOI that continued genome sequencing of emerging variants will help in understanding the kind of symptoms they might present, the severity of the disease or the rate at which they could spread. Such studies will also help experts understand if the mutations have no consequence to humans. “The more we test the better we understand the prevailing strains,” he added.

---||India||Trust science and take jabs, Modi exhorts people||NEW DELHI: Seeking to counter vaccine hesitancy and dispel rumours around inoculation, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday exhorted people to accept vaccines by trusting science and scientists. Over 31 crore Indians, including his nearly 100-year-old mother, have got the jab, he said. During his monthly radio programme 'Mann ki Baat', the PM warned people Covid-19 wasn't gone as it had the potential to hit back in mutated forms. It was, therefore, important to get vaccinated and follow all Covid-appropriate behaviour, he added. "This ailment is like a master of disguise. It keeps changing its looks... surfaces in myriad new forms and colours," Modi said during his conversation with two persons of a tribal village, Dulariya, in MP's Betul district. With villagers telling him about rumours in their village that vaccines were even causing deaths, Modi cited his own example and that of his elderly mother to instil a sense of confidence among naysayers. “I’ve myself been vaccinated with both doses. My mother who is close to a hundred years of age has taken both doses. At times, some people develop fever on account of this. But it’s very minor, just for a few hours. Not getting vaccinated can prove dangerous,” he said. “You know how much hard work our scientists have put in to make this vaccine. Through the year, many scientists have worked and that’s why we have to believe in science, believe in scientists, and should explain to these propagators of falsehood that nothing untoward happened to so many people who have taken vaccine. “I would urge you and friends like you to stop these rumours not only in your village but in other villages too. Tell people that you interacted with me. Tell them my name,” he said. The Prime Minister also spoke about the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and paid tribute to the legendary Milkha Singh who recently died of Covid-19. Recalling his last conversation with Singh when the latter was in hospital, Modi said he had urged him to motivate the Tokyo-bound Indian contingent. “I had said you have represented India in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, so this time when our players are going to the Olympics in Tokyo, you have to boost the morale of our athletes, and have to motivate them. He was so committed and emotional for sports that he immediately gave his consent even during his illness. But, unfortunately, fate had other plans,” Modi added. The Prime Minister also spoke about certain difficulties faced by some Tokyobound athletes due to their poor backgrounds, noting how they reached the highest stage where they will represent India in the Olympics after braving tough phases of their lives. He urged all Indians to cheer for sportspersons who are representing the country. Emphasising on rainwater conservation, Modi urged people to work for water conservation and utilise the monsoon season to conserve as much rainwater as they can through innovative practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/trust-science-take-jabs-modi-exhorts-people/articleshow/83907399.cms||---

It also faces increasing criticism for not addressing issues that led to this action.

There was no reprieveThe lone unaddressed item relates to the need to demonstrate that terror-financing investigation and prosecution target senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terror groups.

The political group, however, was formed without dismantling the extremist ideology of JuD. "Mainstreaming of militant groups should not be taken as a step but as a process. Before bringing them into mainstream politics, work should be done on them to give up their extremist ideology. In the current situation, this process has not even begun yet," said analyst Nazrul Islam. Pakistan has attracted strong criticism following the FATF decision, despite the government's stand that the treatment meted out to it by the global watchdog was too harsh and the country's efforts have not been recognized enough. "Pakistan was not telling its people what its officials were being constantly told in FATF and Asia Pacific Group (APG) meetings. It is time for Pakistan to put in place a mechanism and actual plan to address what needs to be addressed. Buying time by doing what might be important but not required would keep complicating the relationship between Pakistan and international financial institutions and regulators," Aamir Ghauri, editor of The News, told TOI.

The development comes at a time when the micro-blogging platform is facing severe regulatory heat in India over the new IT rules and other run-ins with law enforcement agencies. The company, which was found to be in violation of the new rules, has now got in its global legal policy director Jeremy Kessel for the position, although his appointment is not seen to be in line with guidelines, which mandate that the grievance redressal officer should be based out of India. Kessel, who has been with Twitter for a number of years, is based out of San Francisco, although he has been given an email ID specifically for India: grievance-officer-in@twitter.com Chatur not a direct employee of Twitter USTwitter refused to answer specific queries on the issue. “We have no comment,” a spokesperson for Twitter India. Twitter’s regulatory relations in India have been under acute stress due to the company’s reluctance to follow the new IT rules, announced on February 25, mandating the company to appoint three specific officers – for grievance redressal, nodal and compliance — by May 25. The delay in appointment of the officers has also seen the company lose the coveted ‘safe harbour’ immunity granted under the IT Act, making it liable for criminal and penal action for any unlawful content posted on its platform. The problems for the company have also compounded after its India MD – Manish Maheshwari – was summoned by the Ghaziabad police with regards to a criminal case (though he got relief on the matter from the Karnataka high court). The company has so far been unable to make the statutory appointments, despite being given a grace period by the government. While it is still unclear whether it has appointed a nodal and a compliance officer, even the appointment of Chatur had been under regulatory uncertainty as he was not a direct employee of Twitter US, but was a partner designate at a law firm representing the company at the Delhi high court. According to the new rules, the key officers are required to be on the payroll of the global headquarters, and not be hired by the Indian subsidiaries. This has been prescribed as content handling, processing and moderation is a domain of the headquarters in America for the social-media giants, while their subsidiaries — such as India — are mainly tasked with advertising, marketing and promotional activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-india-grievance-redressal-officer-quits-us-based-replacement-doesnt-meet-it-norms/articleshow/83907502.cms||Pankaj Doval

Not surprisingly, these states are the ones that contain some of largest metros — Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bengal, Delhi and Telangana in that order. Interestingly, in the most populous state of UP, just 4.8 lakh doses were administered in the private sector, a little over what was administered in Gujarat, with less than half of UP’s population. Data for Bihar showed a blank, but it is not clear whether this meant private hospitals administered almost no doses there or whether data was not available. CoWin showed just three private vaccination centres in Bihar on Sunday. There were zero private vaccination centres in most Union Territories and hardly any in the Northeast. The data was presented in the Centre’s affidavit to the apex court but did not specify the period for which the data was. A table preceding this one as part of the same annexure on how many doses the Centre has provided to states specified that it was for January-May. It is not clear whether this data too is for the same period. In many large states, the private sector provided few vaccines. In Jharkhand, it had administered just 18,700 doses, in Odisha 35,500, and just 40,000 in Madhya Pradesh. Recently, Odisha asked the Centre to cut down private sector’s allocation from 25% to just 5% in the state as the presence of private hospitals in the health sector was poor. There were reports from Tamil Nadu that half the vaccine allotted to private hospitals were lying unused. Private sector accounted for just 7.8% of the vaccine doses administered in the state in May-June. Of the 1.56 crore doses administered by the private sector, according to the affidavit, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin was just 17%. Of this, almost 40% or 10.26 lakh, were in Telangana. Though the affidavit was filed on June 26, the period not being specified means it is not possible to draw any conclusion regarding the share of the private sector in total doses administered till now. If it is indeed for January-May, that would mean the private sector has administered a mere 7.2% of the 21.6 crore shots provided till the end of May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/5-states-with-27-of-18-population-account-for-75-of-private-vaccine-doses/articleshow/83907564.cms||Rema Nagarajan

This year, fares are high as government hiked its lowest fare cap by around 15% for travel in June-July. The drop in Covid cases brought about a spike in demand for air travel, and what you have is the cheapest fare, say on the Mumbai-Delhi route, pric-ed over Rs 10,000, even for travel late next month. But for August, the cheapest return fare on a Mumbai-Delhi flight is Rs 4,600. A similar fare drop can be seen across most domestic sectors. On sale or not, most airlines have put out cheap fares for travel in August-October to rake in much-needed forward booking revenue. Read AlsoVaccinated? Get 10% discount on base IndiGo fareGot your jab and itching to travel? Though domestic airfares are rather high now, you could comfort yourself with a small discount offered by IndiGo, which on Wednesday launched a 10% discount scheme for its vaccinated customers. The catch is only limited inventory is available under the offer.Among routes on which fares dropped considerably from August, compared to June-July, are those from Mumbai to Kolkata, Srinagar, Chennai, Kochi, Varanasi and Lucknow. The cheapest return fare to fly from Mumbai to Srinagar is over Rs 15,000 for the next five weeks, but for August, the fare starts at Rs 8,300. Alliance Air, Vistara and SpiceJet offered monsoon sale schemes last week, though airfares for August-October are low across most airlines. But if there is one reason to not book now, it's uncertainty over the third Covid wave. Airlines have considered that. "In the monsoon sale, most airlines are offering one date change free depending on the sector and fare category, due to lockdown," said Jay Bhatia, vice-president of Travel Agents' Association of India. "It's always easy to change bookings and obtain refunds when the ticket is booked through travel agents. Travellers are tired of staying home and are ready to holiday or commence business flights on completion of two shots of the vaccine,'' he said. Another incentive is that airfares from August are not yet capped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/airfares-for-august-october-drop-as-carriers-eye-early-bookings/articleshow/83907605.cms||---

Modi said the partnership was relevant for global stability and prosperity during the times of Covid-19. The PM was speaking after virtually inaugurating a Japanese Zen garden and Kaizen Academy set up at the Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA). "The current prime minister of Japan, Yoshihide Suga, is a very straight-forward person. PM Suga and I believe during this Covid-19 pandemic crisis, the Indo-Japanese friendship and our partnership has become even more relevant for global stability and prosperity. Today, when we are facing several global challenges, it is the need of the time that our friendship and relationship get stronger day by day," Modi said. The PM said efforts like setting up Kaizen Academy were a beautiful reflection of this relationship. "I would like Kaizen Academy to spread the work culture of Japan in India, and increase business interaction between the two countries. We also have to give new energy to the efforts already going on in this direction. I am sure our efforts will continue like this, and India and Japan will together reach new heights of development," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/current-challenges-demand-deeper-india-japan-ties-says-pm-modi/articleshow/83907660.cms||---

Several people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the second wave, continued having symptoms like respiratory illness, lungs fibrosis, extreme fatigue, heart ailments, anxiety or depression and fever while some even diagnosed with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and tuberculosis. AIIMS-Patna nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Sanjeev Kumar said as per the latest study conducted in England, it takes minimum 20 days and maximum up to two months for a patient to recover from the general fatigue. He said shortness of breath due to pneumonitis may persist up to one year and it was seen in 70% of the patients who were hospitalised in ICU and 45% of those admitted to the Covid-19 wards, depending on the damages to their lungs. “Recently, we have also seen that many recovered patients are diagnosed with diabetes as a post-Covid complication. They didn’t have it before. The reason could be the use of steroids during the Covid-19 treatment, which increases the sugar level, stress in the body or may be the damage of pancreas (the gland that makes insulin which is needed to convert blood sugar into energy). Several patients came with fluctuation in blood pressure and heart rate and thrombosis. It may be short-term complications, which may persist from three to six months,” Dr Sanjeev said and added: “Some of those who suffered severe lungs fibrosis may have the complications for up to seven years.” In the last few days, at least 10 recovered patients were diagnosed with the symptoms of tuberculosis at PMCH. According to health officials, these patients were administered medicines to treat tuberculosis. PMCH nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Ajay Arun, said several tissues of organs (lungs, liver, pancreas and heart) may get damaged due to impairing oxygenation during the Covid infection, which may lead to long Covid complications like breathlessness and hypertension, among others. IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said there was a rise in the number of patients with post-Covid complications like Type-2 diabetes (happens because the body cells become resistant to the insulin produced), bleeding from intestines, fluctuation in blood pressure, among others. “The functioning of the internal organs gets hampered and imbalanced because of the clot due to which people are experiencing post-Covid complications.

Besides other criminal elements, it has been found that the liquor mafia too also generated a huge wealth,” said ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan. After the seizure of Rs 31 lakh Audi car of Mukhtar’s wife and in-laws on Wednesday and properties of liquor mafia in Mirzapur in the past four days, TOI took stock of the action initiated against the gangsters in the past 12 months. It surfaced that among the criminals booked under Gangster Act in this period, the highest number — 961 — was of cattle smugglers while over 287 were liquor mafia involved in hooch manufacturing and liquor smuggling. Providing details of the action taken to check organized crime, the ADG said, “In the 10 districts of Varanasi zone, around 2600 criminals were booked under Gangster Act. We also registered 166 new gangs and opened a history sheet of over 1,100 criminals. Operations were also launched to hit their economic empires and armoury apart from putting effective checks on their illegal earnings. It resulted in confiscation of movable and immovable properties of Rs 210 crores, demolition of properties of Rs 151 crores. Illegal earning to the tune of Rs 61 crores was also checked.” “Of the over Rs 286 crores losses caused to Mukhtar gang, properties of Rs 140 crores have been demolished. Movable and immovable properties of Rs 85 crores were seized. Illegal earning through extortion and fish trades, grabbing contracts in PWD and other government departments of Rs 60 crores of Mukhtar, his family and gang members was also checked,” he added. “Also, 122 arms licences of Mukhtar’s men were cancelled, externment orders were issued against 34, 150 booked under Gangster Act, six booked under NSA and 200 criminals and white collared persons associated with him were sent to jail. Major action against Mukhtar and his gang had been started after May 2020,” he said. Gangster Dhruv Singh Kuntu, who is lodged in jail as an accused of killing of Samajwadi Party’s ex-MLA Sarvesh Singh Sipu in July 2015, is other major loser after Mukhtar as his properties of around Rs 18 crores were seized or demolished while illegal earning of Rs 60 lakhs was also checked. The name of muscleman jailed MLA Vijay Mishra and jailed don Ramesh Singh Kaka has also figured among the big losers. “The liquor mafia active in the zone have suffered loss of over Rs 28 crores following confiscation of their properties,” said the ADG, adding, “On June 21, Mirzapur police confiscated properties of a dreaded liquor mafia Anup Malviya worth Rs 4.92 crores. On June 22, the property of Rs 49 lakhs of Malviya’s accomplices, including Kamlesh Maurya and Sanjay Maurya were also seized. Properties of Rs 8.40 crores of cattle mafia had also been seized in the same period, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rs-425cr-illegal-properties-of-mafia-groups-seized-in-a-year/articleshow/83901037.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

According to Samastipur DRM Ashok Maheswari, the officials concerned have rushed in stone boulders, sand bags and coal ash bags in sufficient numbers to vulnerable sites on the Saharsa–Badlaghat and Samastipur–Darbhanga routes, adding that Kosi and Bagmati rivers pose threat to rail traffic operations in the division during monsoon every year. Besides, railways has installed water-level measuring devices in each major river to get warning signal in advance in case of any emergency. “Track men are continuing with night patrolling along the vulnerable places. Instructions have been given to allow traffic operations with cautions if any emergency arises,” the DRM said. The division has been carrying out various rail development projects to streamline traffic and cope with huge passenger rush in peak summer amid Covid-19. The DRM said railways has worked out a plan to keep circulating areas of most the major stations including Bettiah free from waterlogging during monsoon either cleaning the choked drains or constructing new ones. Besides, each station in the division is being provided with high-level platforms and construction of new foot overbridges (FOBs), he said adding railways is also carrying out work to provide lift facilities at Bettiah and Raxaul stations to facilitate easy movement of physically challenged people and senior citizens. Railways intends to construct FOB at Ramgarhwa station and gives extension to the FOB at Adapur on the suggestions of the Bettiah MP Jaiswal.

---||Business||Haryana govt pays IL&FS Rs 1,925cr metro project dues||Mumbai: IL&FS has recovered Rs 1,925 crore from Haryana Shehari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), the state’s urban planning agency, as interim termination payment in the Gurgaon Metro Project case. This payment follows the Supreme Court’s March 26, 2021 order that ruled in favour of IL&FS in the metro case. IL&FS’s subsidiaries Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon (RMGL) and Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon South (RMGSL) had developed the projects. The Supreme Court order bodes well for IL&FS in its recovery attempt from state governments that have been holding payments after the group went bankrupt. For instance, IL&FS has around Rs 500-crore claims on the government of Jharkhand as annuity on the road projects. The SC order said that the money must be deposited in an escrow account and appropriation would be subject to further orders of the NCLAT or any other competent legal authority. The benefit of the payment will flow to the lenders to the project. Andhra Bank (now a part of Union Bank) was the lead bank in RMGL, along with Punjab National Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of India and Dena Bank (now a part of Bank of Baroda). Canara Bank is the lead bank in RMGSL, along with Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank (now part of Union Bank of India), Punjab & Sind Bank, Central Bank of India and IIFC (UK).While dues from the Haryana government are at about Rs 2,400 crore, the SC has asked the government to deposit 80% of the debt due. “This ruling will set a precedence for other projects wherein infrastructure companies, including IL&FS, are seeking payment of their legitimate dues and enforceability of valid contracts and concession agreements with various state governments,” the company spokesperson said. The Rs 1,925-crore recovery forms part of the Rs 61,000-crore recovery estimated by the Uday Kotak-led board of IL&FS. If the board recovers Rs 61,000 crore of debt, it will have resolved 61% of the overall debt of approximately Rs 99,000 crore as of October 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/haryana-govt-pays-ilfs-rs-1925cr-metro-project-dues/articleshow/83903730.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Used vehicle financiers become aggressive with differential rates||Chennai: Used car sales have been picking up speed faster than new cars right through the pandemic. Now used vehicle financiers are upping the ante with aggressive products, lower rates and higher targets looking to garner at least a fifth of their loan book from used car finance. “The finance penetration is more than 75% in new passenger vehicles but around 20%-21% in used vehicles so the scope of growth is much more. The demand for used vehicles is going up as it is more affordable, the industry is getting organised and technology is playing an enabler. All of these factors will increase finance penetration,” said Vyomesh Kapasi, MD, Kotak Mahindra Prime. According to a recent survey by Volkswagen and Frost & Sullivan, the financing penetration in used passenger vehicles will go up to 35% by 2025. For auto financiers this is the time to plan aggressive measures to increase their used loan book. “Currently used car financing (now 12% of loan book, an expected to increase to 15 to 20%) is not according to vehicle age as most cars are sold after 3-4 years but with people selling newer cars due to loss of income in the pandemic, 1-2 year-old used cars will enter the pool. We will look at offering lower rates based on the age of the vehicle,” said Ramesh Iyer, MD, Mahindra & Mahindra Finance. Differential rates for low-risk customers is the option that Sundaram Finance is exploring as it expects demand to return next month. “The demand surge should come from July and we are preparing for that. We are active in both new and used financing but the latter gives better yields. We may consider offering better interest rates depending on customer segments,” said N Ramachandran, national head-auto, Sundaram Finance. Sundaram Finance hopes to increase the used share in its loan book from 10%-15% to 20%-25%. Used financiers say the size of the used car business vis-a-vis the new has made it an attractive segment. “Currently the used car industry is around 1.2 to 1.3 times of the new car industry in India and it will continue to grow rapidly in the near future so we are watching this space closely,” said Ravi Narayanan, head-secured assets, ICICI Bank. Financiers say if the sales of used cars are much higher than new, financiers will want to make the rates more aggressive too. Currently the interest slabs in used car finance are between 13%-15%, around 300-400 basis points higher than new cars. India sold around 4.4 million used cars in FY21 compared to 2.7 million new passenger vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/used-vehicle-financiers-become-aggressive-with-differential-rates/articleshow/83900942.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Speaking at the 6th annual Rashtretara Telugu Samakhya’s virtual conference here on Sunday, Naidu said that the Telugu people should come together as one for the cause of the Telugu language and the revitalisation of ‘our local traditions’. Highlighting the power of language to unite people across generations and boundaries, Naidu called for a concerted effort to preserve, enrich and propagate ‘our languages, cultures and traditions’. “It is the duty of every individual to preserve and promote one’s mother tongue, without belittling other languages and cultures,” said Naidu. Naidu also underscored, as envisaged by the National Educational Policy-2020, the need for primary education to be in one’s mother tongue. “People presently occupying the highest constitutional offices of the country, including the President, Vice-president, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India, had their primary education in their mother tongue. People should not have the false impression that one cannot succeed and grow in life if they learn in their mother tongue. We have many past and present exemplars to disprove that,” he said. He also called for more initiatives in translating Telugu literature into other Indian languages and, thereby, spreading the richness of one’s linguistic tradition. Noting there are more than a thousand organisations outside the Telugu states which are meant for the preservation and propagation of the Telugu language, Naidu commended the initiative of the organisers in coming together on a common platform called ‘Rashtretara Telugu Samakhya’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/keep-languages-alive-with-public-support-vp/articleshow/83899425.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Autos get riders’ support to bypass checks in pandemic times||KOLKATA: Although autos are officially on the no-ply list of Covid restrictions, they have returned to the streets in numbers, ferrying office-goers on familiar routes but bypassing main crossings by taking detours through neighbourhoods. Officially, autos services have been suspended till at least July 1. They are only allowed to take people to hospitals in case of emergency. However, it is this exception to the rule that auto operators are using to their advantage. On the Dharmatala-Lohapool route, autos are running packed, even carrying five passengers instead of four. But instead of the main road, they are taking the bylanes of Taltala and Entally to reach Park Circus crossing. When travelling on the main roads, they ask passengers to keep documents, like prescriptions and office authorization letters, ready to show they are out on an emergency. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said that unless passengers admit they are travelling in a shared auto, it is difficult to act. “We have stopped organized attempts to restart normal services at Jorabagan and Ultadanga. We are talking to local union leaders. Although some autos are plying in an unorganized manner in the garb of emergency services, it will be unfair to say we have allowed them to operate despite the restrictions,” said Sinha. Sergeants say passengers turn hostile whenever autos are stopped for checks. “They argue that they cannot afford cabs and this is a cheaper option. They argue we are going soft on shuttle cars charging a fortune and targeting autos,” said an officer from Tollygunge traffic guard. Auto union leaders Gopal Sutar and Meghnad Poddar either did not take calls or refused to speak on the issue. “This issue will need some explanation. Call me later,” Sutar said. Auto operators claim they get passengers only during office hours between 9.30am and 11.30am. “We sit idle in the afternoon,” said an operator on the Dharmatala-Lohapool route. The union here has come up with a unique solution. “Not all autos are operating everyday. WE have drawn up a roster of who gets to operate on which day,” said an auto driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/autos-get-riders-support-to-bypass-checks-in-pandemic-times/articleshow/83902651.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Bihar state bar council chairman Ramakant Sharma said there are around 1.5 lakh lawyers enrolled in the state and 1.25 lakh of them are practising at the high court and in subordinate courts. “Once all lawyers are fully vaccinated, they will be protected from the third wave. It would greatly help in restarting physical functioning of the courts, which are running in virtual mode,” he said. “A fortnight ago, I wrote to the state government to allocate Rs50 crore for lawyers in the state to assist them financially.

---||Kolkata||First-timers treated at state’s nodal Covid hospital praise health facility that changed their perception||Kolkata: Amit Jana (38) stepped into Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital on April 29 with severe Covid infection after no private hospital could assure a bed. This was a first for him since the Patuli resident who runs a travel business had never sought medical care at a government-run hospital before. Like Jana, many who had never stepped into a government hospital prior to the pandemic have undergone intensive care treatment at the state’s nodal Covid hospital. Back home, they all agree there was no need to doubt the facilities and services at such state-run health institutes. “My treatment at ID Hospital for close to two months has changed my perception about government health facilities. From medical care and food to morale boost, I got everything in that hospital that brought me back home,” said Jana. Even after his discharge on June 21, the hospital is regularly in touch with him for check-ups. Jana and his family had frantically called up almost all major private hospitals in the city when his oxygen saturation kept dipping. With no vacancy there, a neighbour volunteered to check with Swasthya Bhawan, where officials asked Jana to be taken to the Beliaghata hospital. When 56-year-old Anannya Chanda’s oxygen saturation started dipping, her family frantically called up various private hospitals in Kolkata. Unable to find a bed in any one of those, a neighbour contacted Swasthya Bhawan, which, in turn, asked the patient to be brought to ID Hospital. Chanda’s treatment lasted almost two months, including a long ICU care, and the patient’s daughter, Debankita, praised the facility. The Covid facility at the government hospital was ready by September 2019, six months ahead of Bengal getting its first confirmed case on March 17, 2020. In preparation, the state had sent two faculty members from the hospital for training under WHO to learn to handle Covid patients. Later, a host of other doctors joined the dedicated Covid team, including two infectious diseases specialists who passed out from AIIMS. “We have also catered to patients shifted here from private facilities as they were unable to foot the bill. There has been help from Swasthya Bhawan, a dedicated principal, doctors, nurses, technicians, ward boys and the Covid warrior club,” said Asis Manna, medical superintendent and vice-principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-timers-treated-at-states-nodal-covid-hospital-praise-health-facility-that-changed-their-perception/articleshow/83902667.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

While it is known that mangroves work as bioshield in coastal protection, they also play a role in prevention against greenhouse gases. Two studies by marine researchers at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) and researchers in Nature and Elsevier Science Direct journals show that Cochin estuarine system and the Mangalavanam are now a source of nitrous oxide — atmospheric greenhouse gas. It shows that destruction of mangroves has led to more greenhouse gas emission because the existing vegetation is just not enough to capture the nitrous oxide (N2O). “We looked at two different coastal systems — the area around the Cochin estuary and the Mangalavanam which is called the green lung of Kochi city. There was high nitrous oxide concentration in these areas basically due to extensive pollution caused by dumping of urban, industrial and agricultural waste into the waters,” said S Bijoy Nandan, professor and dean, faculty of marine sciences, Cusat. During their tests, it was found that the atmospheric N2O contribution from the Cochin estuarine system ranged from 53%-889%, which was higher than what was documented in earlier reports. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the major greenhouse gas that causes global warming; however, the role of minor trace gas (N2O) in the atmosphere is more hazardous due to its greater global warming potential which is 300 times more than that of CO2. The N2O production and its water-to-air interaction in coastal systems is continuously changing at an alarming rate. This has already led to the degradation of several coastal systems, including mangroves, estuaries and coral reefs. “We are aware of the increasing pollution in our coastal waters but our natural vegetation of local mangroves has played a role in checking the production of greenhouse gases. In the wake of the several changes occurring in the coastal waters and the Arabian Sea, we have to look at it as one of the sources of what could be a contribution to climate change. Since it has begun to impact lives and livelihoods, the government and locals will have to come out with effective management of our coastal systems,” he added. Fragmented mangroves may represent a significant source of N2O to the atmosphere. Ernakulam district alone has about 933 minor mangrove stands, covering a total area of 206 hectares. It suggests that fragmented/minor mangrove stands may have a yet unquantified but significant influence on atmospheric N2O budgets and atmospheric warming in the future. “As part of mangrove afforestation, tourism can also be linked which could serve as an economic benefit to the local populace and ecological benefit to the coastal system,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/disappearing-mangroves-could-trigger-greenhouse-emissions-study/articleshow/83902696.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Two districts in the state, along with one in Jharkhand, have been chosen by BEE to map energy intensive sub-sectors of MSME industries to introduce energy efficiency measures. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), which has been entrusted with the responsibility of mapping such energy intensive industries, has found a good potential to save energy in the state’s refractory industry. The TERI conducted a detailed energy audit in refractory clusters in East and West Godavari districts. TERI, on Sunday, organised a dissemination workshop with AP State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM) with the objective of developing a roadmap for the Indian refractory sector to make it energy and resource efficient. Speaking on the occasion, senior energy economist/director, BEE, Milind Deore, and director TERI, Girish Sethi, said that based on TERI’s study in two districts of Andhra Pradesh, there is lot of potential to save energy in this sector. “The study was conducted in 26 refractory units of a MSME cluster in East Godavari district, producing 62,500 tonnes per year. It was found that around 10 per cent of energy (8.3 million units) can be saved per annum that costs Rs 5.56 crore as per existing tariffs in Andhra Pradesh. These units are consuming 99.4% of thermal energy and 0.6 % of electrical energy, causing emission of 40,313 tonnes of CO2 per annum. In energy auditing, it has been noticed that only 20% of energy is found as useful energy and the rest 80% of energy is getting wasted,” said Milind and Deore. BEE is now examining the proposal of APSECM to initiate an energy audit and technology assessment in spinning, cold storage and dal processing units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/bee-to-develop-roadmap-for-msme-sector-using-ap-study/articleshow/83899160.cms||---

The civic body, which has identified 3.2 lakh households in the city, has started distributing three different dustbins to promote garbage segregation at homes. Households residing in slums have to pay Rs 30 per month as user charges for garbage collection while those residing in non-slum areas have to pay Rs 120 per month. The VMC, which is rigorously implementing the Solid Waste Management Rules-2016 (SWMR-2016), is a front runner in the Swachh Survekshan rankings. Door-to-door garbage collection, on-site composting, garbage segregation and other initiatives are being implemented in the city. The civic body is also in talks to purchase more compactor vehicles and drain cleaning equipment to ease maintenance. With expenses on the Swachh initiatives running into large sums, the civic body had been spending tax revenue and special grants to take up these works. Now, user charges collected for garbage collection will be spent on maintenance and cleanliness activities. “We are not adding a huge burden on the public. People residing in slums need to pay Rs 1 per day as user charges and residents of non-slum areas have to pay Rs 4 per day. The amount collected in the form of user charges will be spent for the development of wards and one can visibly see the difference. Three dustbins will be given for free to the households and only segregated garbage will be collected soon,” VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh said. Left parties and civic associations, however, have raised strong opposition to the VMC’s proposal. “It is the responsibility of civic bodies to take up sanitation work, but it is escaping from its responsibility and trying to add burden on the public. We will not let it happen,” said Ch Babu Rao, CPI(M) state secretariat member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-to-levy-user-fee-for-garbage-collection/articleshow/83899392.cms||Venu Lanka

Sources at AIIMS said Nitish returned to his official residence at 6, Kamraj Lane after the operation conducted by senior ophthalmologist Dr Jeewan Singh Titiyal. Sources said the CM spent a few hours at the AIIMS after the operation. Sources also said the CM would again visit the hospital on Monday for further check-up. He might stay in Delhi for the next two to three days due to his health-related issues. Earlier on Tuesday, Nitish reached Delhi amidst speculations of meeting the BJP top brass to seek a decent share in the Union cabinet during its next expansion. Soon after landing in Delhi, he, however, told mediapersons that it was his personal visit. “I have come here for eye treatment. There is no scheduled meeting with PM Narendra Modi. It will depend on the PM how and when he does it (cabinet expansion). We have no information regarding the cabinet expansion,” Nitish had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-undergoes-eye-surgery/articleshow/83899635.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||RJD's Tejashwi Yadav reaches out to Chirag Paswan, again||PATNA: RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday reached out to Jamui MP Chirag Paswan again, urging him to join the opposition camp to carry forward the legacy of his father and LJP founder late Ram Vilas Paswan. When contacted, Tejashwi said RJD has already offered him (read Chirag) to join hands with the opposition in the state. “I think he will think over it and take a final call at an appropriate time,” he said. “Lalu ji and Ram Vilas ji have been close friends and also worked with each other for a long time. Moreover, the party which Chirag and his father helped and stood by in the hour of crisis has betrayed him (read Chirag),” he said. The remarks of RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son assumes significance in the wake of Chirag’s growing dissatisfaction with the BJP and PM Narendra Modi’s silence following a coup in the LJP by his own uncle and Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras. Moreover, the RJD has decided to celebrate the birth anniversary of Ram Vilas at the state party office in Patna on July 5, which coincides with the foundation day celebration of the RJD. Lalu will attend the function virtually. The decision is being perceived as an attempt to persuade the Chirag faction of the LJP to join the anti-NDA camp. Tejashwi had earlier lashed out at Paras for the crisis in the LJP. “I fail to fathom as to why he (Paras) is playing in the hands of the people, who orchestrated break-up in the LJP twice,” Tejashwi had said, adding that RJD had helped the senior Paswan get a berth in the Rajya Sabha when the LJP had lost all seats. Reacting to Tejashwi's offer, Chirag had thanked him by calling him like his younger brother. Political observers feel the two young leaders may come closer in the days to come as both have a common political adversary in the JD(U) and CM Nitish Kumar. Meanwhile, LJP principal general secretary Sanjay Paswan said on Sunday that the birth anniversary of late Ram Vilas will be celebrated at a Dalit hamlet near Hajipur on July 5. In a statement, he said preparations for the celebrations have already been started. Chirag will be the present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejas-reaches-out-to-chirag-again/articleshow/83900040.cms||Ramashankar

Sukanta Karmakar (47), comes to Howrah five days a week from Monday to Friday around 8.30am for the treatment of his wife Jotsnya (46) at the radiology department in SSKM Hospital. Throughout the restrictions, he has been travelling by staff special trains from Chinsurah station to Howrah and taking a taxi to the hospital — the only mode of transportation available now. But his troubles begin when he tries to catch a taxi for the hospital as the cabby invariably asks for an astronomical rate, much beyond what he can afford. “Taxis parked outside Howrah station will demand a very high fare. The only option is to strike a deal with the cabbies reaching the station to drop off passengers. It costs me Rs 200-Rs 250 per trip,” he said. Additionally, in the early morning hours, there are hardly any cops on duty. Normally, it never used to exceed Rs 170, but a well-oiled network of middlemen and taxi operators, he claimed, has been working fleece hapless passengers. “Initially, we were trapped by some middlemen who fixed up the deal and arranged a taxi for us and the fare varied between Rs 400 and Rs 500,” said Karmakar. Chandra Nath Tudu (28) from Harit in Hooghly district, who came to Howrah station for the first time on Thursday for his wife’s check-up at the gynecology & obstetrics department in SSKM Hospital, got trapped by a middleman who duped him into paying Rs 500 after fixing a cab to take them to the hospital. While most patients come to Howrah station to go to SSKM Hospital, a few go to Medical College and NRS Hospital, and the taxi fares in their cases vary from Rs 400 to Rs 600. Sometimes it is a little lower when these middlemen can arrange another passenger bound for the same destination and share the ride. Abu Hasan Mollah from Burdwan Town came to Howrah station around 8am on Thursday with his wife to go to Tata Cancer Hospital & Research Center at New Town. After waiting for almost 25 minutes at the taxi stand, he managed to make a deal of Rs 1,000 with a taxi driver who initially asked for Rs 1,700. Around 9.30am, when a duty officer of Howrah Station Police reached the spot, the middlemen disappeared. The cop said, “We tried to help the passengers catch a cab at an existing prepaid rate. Most of the time we have to make an arrangement of shared taxis due to the lack of transportation. But it has been very difficult to arrange an affordable commute for people.” At Sealdah, most patients are bond for NRS and B R Singh Hospital, which are within walking distance. But those who head towards Medical College or R G Kar face problems as the fare ranges from Rs 200 to Rs 600.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/patients-forced-to-shell-out-rs-400-to-rs-2k-to-reach-hospitals-from-stations/articleshow/83902636.cms||---

But that didn't happen despite the fact that my intention behind joining politics was to serve the weaker sections of the society,” Pandey, who has turned a religious preacher now, told the mediapersons. Pandey hinted at quitting politics. “I would have continued to serve as the DGP till my retirement from service. But I sacrificed my job for serving the humanity. Now I am disenchanted with politics,” he said. Talking about his penchant for religious preaching, Pandey said, “I have been doing so since the age of 14. There is nothing new in it. It’s just a matter of time,” he added.  Pandey said his case was an exception in the sense that he had quit the job of a senior IPS officer about six months before his retirement from service to play an active role in politics. Pandey, a 1987-batch Bihar cadre IPS officer, had taken VRS in September and joined JD(U) in anticipation of being fielded as a candidate in the 2020 assembly elections in October-November. After being denied a ticket, he was expecting a legislative council seat, but in vain. When asked about his future plans, Pandey said he has now started his journey towards ‘adhyatma’ (spiritualism), which is the ultimate goal of life. Pandey had hogged the limelight when he, as the state DGP, lashed out at Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty for making comments on Bihar CM Nitish Kumar in the backdrop of Sushant Singh Rajput suicide case in 2020. Sushant’s death in his Mumbai flat had led to a tussle between Bihar and Maharashtra governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lack-abilities-to-succeed-in-politics-says-ex-dgp/articleshow/83899882.cms||Ramashankar

The boy is now stable, according to SSKM sources. Mustakin Ali had been brought to the city from Hatgachhi in North Dinajpur. After the family failed to get him admitted to another government hospital in the city, he was finally brought to SSKM. Doctors conducted tests to locate the nail that had penetrated the respiratory tract. The 7cm-long nail had impacted the right main bronchus and a ‘rigid bronchoscopy’ was done to extract it. On Saturday, Mustakin had swallowed the nail while playing near his home. He was taken to Raiganj Hospital, but it didn’t have the required equipment and he was referred to Malda Medical College. They conducted an X-ray but didn’t have a bronchoscopy facility. He was then referred to a government hospital in Kolkata. “The child is recovering well and we have kept him in NICU for better observation for 24 hours post the surgery,” said ENT department HOD Arunabha Sengupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-extract-7cm-nail-swallowed-by-2-yr-old/articleshow/83902683.cms||---

Jahangir Alam Khan replaced Prasad as the new SHO on Sunday. “I had recommended Prasad’s suspension after an inquiry into his overall behaviour, especially after a havildar and two constables extorted Rs4,000 from a hotelier,” the SSP said, adding several complaints were received against him. Havildar Umesh Paswan and constables Sanjeev Thakur and Sanjeev Ram were arrested on June 21 for allegedly extorting Rs4,000 from hotelier Abhishek Kumar and demanding Rs10,000 monthly as protection money from him. Sources said Kumar is a close relative of a senior bureaucrat. Kumar had called the SSP after a brawl in his hotel at Akshay Nagar on June 18. The SSP had directed Prasad to look into the matter but he sent the havildar and the constables as he was in a court. Man shot at on highway: Five unidentified bike-borne criminals shot at one Kanhaiya Lal Pandey (45) while attempting to loot his bike near Kasara under Deedarganj police station area in rural Patna Saturday night. SHO (in-charge) Manoj Kumar said Pandey works at a petrol pump in Fatuha and was returning home after duty. He said the criminals opened fire when Pandey didn’t stop.

---||Patna||If current trend continues, normalcy may return by July-end: Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey||PATNA: Health minister Mangal Pandey on Sunday said if the declining trend continued and no new Covid variant made an inroad, normalcy may return in the state by July-end. A lot will depend on the behaviour of people in following Covid norms and getting vaccinated, he said. The night curfew and certain restrictions are in place till July 6. Many experts feel that any decision on reopening of educational institutions, religious shrines, malls and theatres must be taken only after assessing the probability of the third wave and also the behaviour of the new variants. Senior vice-president of IMA (Bihar), Dr Ajay Kumar, said, “Instead of seeing the declining graph of Covid cases, we should ascertain as to what percentage of the state’s population has been vaccinated with both the doses. No further relaxation should be given until 50 to 60% of the people are vaccinated.” Aryabhatta Knowledge University’s dean of health and medicine and principal of Madhubani Medical College, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, is in favour of the restrictions to continue till July-end. Schools should reopen only after all the teachers and parents of children are vaccinated with both the doses. At best, they can be reopened after Chhath so that maximum number of people are vaccinated and by that time. Hopefully, even children would start getting inoculated. “However, commercial activities may be resumed with full Covid protocol,” he added. Gynaecologist Dr Punam Raman cautioned the authorities against the possible threat of Delta-plus strain. She suggested that night curfew should continue for another fortnight or month. Patna University botany department teacher Birendra Prasad said even though unlocking is necessary keeping in view the losses being incurred by businessmen and industrialists, effective steps must also be initiated for protecting the lives of the people. The officials must impose heavy penalties on people for any Covid protocol violation. He also suggested that any decision on complete unlocking must be taken in the light of apprehension about the third wave. Retired telecom engineer Gopal Sharan Singh said the administration should ensure that people follow Covid norms and check the spread of infection. More than 30% people are moving in the market without wearing masks and having scant regard for social distancing. Such people must be punished for violating the norms and endangering the lives of others, he said. Echoing almost similar feelings, retired bank official T N Roy said restrictions imposed by the state government after lifting the lockdown on June 8 must continue for some time more. He also pleaded for speeding up the process of ongoing vaccination in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/normalcy-may-return-by-july-end-minister/articleshow/83899767.cms||B K Mishra

A total of 117 teams were declared winners of Toycathon 2021 under the different themes. Abhinav Basak, one of the three members of team Makersclan from Sangam city and P. PhD scholar at IIT Kanpur told TOI on Sunday that the team had submitted their game idea in the first Toycathon summit of India on January 5, 2021. This game is meant to teach Chemistry to young kids in a playful way. He adds, "This board based game is an interesting concept where the players are scientists searching for elements throughout the board to convert them into essential compounds. In the course of doing so, it develops a kid’s critical thinking, planning and decision making skills as well as encourages interest in children for Chemistry." This game also educates kids about the applications of the elements and their real-world use thereby making the subject interesting which otherwise is a difficult subject for most of the children, he added. He further said, "Our team members had an interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24 through web conferencing about this board game and we feel proud and appreciate the PM for the suggestions provided by him to us. We are keen on developing and launching this game into national as well as international markets." Abhinav, meanwhile, added, "The team has a start-up incorporated with the name Srijamyham Innovationpvt. Ltd., where the team members Vivek Banra and Abhinav Basak are visual designers from IIT Kanpur and Neeraj Kr. Singh is a production expert. The game CheMystery is a product under this brand. Abhinav claimed that a total of 17,770 ideas were submitted to the Toycathon among which 1,567 teams were shortlisted for participation. As the ministry wants to develop our country as an emerging hub for toy ideation and production, seven teams had an interaction session with the Prime Minister where each team explained their gameplan. Toycathon 2021 was jointly launched by the ministry of education, WCD Ministry, MSME Ministry, DPIIT, Textile Ministry, I&B Ministry and AICTE on January 5, 2021, to crowd-source innovative toys and games ideas. Around 1.2 lakh participants from across the country registered and submitted more than 17,000 ideas for the Toycathon 2021, out of which 1567 ideas were shortlisted for the three days online Toycathon Grand Finale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/citys-team-makersclan-win-toycathon-2021-for-their-board-game/articleshow/83901078.cms||---

Moreover, around 100 medical and paramedical staff were also imparted training by Dr Ajit Singh, senior paediatrician and master trainer of Prayagraj district at Dufferin and TB Sapru hospitals. Dr Varun Kwatra, public health expert told TOI that the health department is setting up two PICU in city pockets including TB Sapru (40 Beds) and MLN Medical College (100 beds facility). Besides, PICU having 10-10 beds facility would also be set up at four community health centres including Phulpur, Kotwa, Ram Nagar, and Manda. All the PICU would be functional by next month, he added. Moreover, the health department has also taken up the distribution of medicine kits at the block level and also set a target of distributing 29,000 free medicine kits with syrups and dissolvable tablets to keep kids battle-ready. The distribution began on Sunday in the district and five-gram sabha monitoring committees of 20 block each were given 20-20 (four categories) medical kits as a precautionary measure. For that, children under the age of 18 have been divided into four categories — 0-1 years, 1-5 years, 5-12 years and 12-18 years — and different medicines have been prepared for each category. A senior health official, meanwhile, said, the department has started the distribution of medical kit for children symbolically and five-gram sabha Nigrani Samiti of each gram sabha has been given medical kits with a view that these kits could be utilised whenever required. The dosage will be adjusted as per age and weight. He further added the kits are containing paracetamol tablets, ORS packets, multivitamins and Ivermectin tablets that have been prepared at the suggestion of medical experts and paediatricians.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/picu-to-be-set-up-at-2-city-hospitals-and-four-chcs-in-dist/articleshow/83902504.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||PGIMS proposal on genome sequencer, used for detecting Covid variants, gathers dust||Chandigarh: Three months after the state’s premier health institute sent an application, Haryana health authorities, the Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited and associated departments are yet to act on a proposal related to the procurement of Next Generation Sequencer — an equipment which is key to detecting the variants of Covid. The equipment, apart from being used to detect new variants of Covid, is used for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and fungal infections, said experts in health department. Sometime in February-March this year, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, had sent a proposal for procuring the equipment and staff for handling the machine. At the time, there was a decline in Covid cases. The proposal continued to shuttle between various hands and there is no sign of it now. Senior officials associated with Covid diagnosis and control apprehend that delayed results of sequencing could end in a situation Haryana saw in April and May during the second wave. “Thankfully, the Faridabad resident (who had tested positive for the delta-plus variant) has recovered and all his close relatives have tested negative twice. AT the moment, we are waiting for genome sequencing of 150 samples,’’ said an officer. On Saturday, health authorities received a report related to the Delta variant, which superseded the Alpha variant . The delay is there as sequencing is being done at centralised labs, already burdened with samples from other states. According to a report, 62 cases of Delta variant were found in Nuh, 48 in Ambala, 40 in Jind, six in Gurgaon, and one each in Yamunanagar and Palwal. The Faridabad resident’s sample hd tested positive for the delta-plus variant at the National Centre for Disease Control lab. His sample was collected during random sampling in the first week of May. Though Haryana health and family welfare minister Anil Vij and other officers remained inaccessible, a CMO official promised to look into the matter and expedite the process of procurement. “I shall take this issue up with the CM. We shall ensure all hurdles of procurement are cleared and equipment is installed in time. If there would be any procedural delay, we will procure it through CSR as we procured an ACMO for Kalpana Chawla Medical college of Karnal. We are always there to save lives,’’ said an official. A total of 150 samples, collected till June 20, are waiting to be put for sequencing and the delay could prove fatal in case there are patients of Delta plus. Black fungus: 2 die, 7 discharged Hisar: Two patients of black fungus (mucormycosis) died at the medical college in Agroha town of Hisar on Sunday, while seven were discharged. Eight patients were admitted for treatment. Now, the number of patients admitted here has increased to 57. College ophthalmologist Dr Praveen Atri on Sunday said a patient each from Hisar and Sirsa died during treatment, while seven were discharged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgims-proposal-on-genome-sequencer-used-for-detecting-covid-variants-gathers-dust/articleshow/83904717.cms||Manvir Saini

According to the bank, relaxing the loan-to-value ratio for these loans to 90% was a mistake as it has triggered auctions and resulted in the portfolio — otherwise the most secure among advances — registering some non-performing assets (NPAs). CSB Bank MD & CEO C V R Rajendran told TOI that for the first time the bank has had to have a recovery team for gold loans. “One mistake was that when the RBI said you can lend up to 90% of the value of gold, we should not have followed that as a price fall can wipe out the margin and require us to call for additional margin,” he said. The bank reverted to 75% LTV in December, although the RBI allowed the relaxation in LTV norms up to March 2021. More recently the bank revised its pricing strategy to link interest rates to the LTV. “There is nothing to worry about at the portfolio level, but the recovery effort is much higher,” said Rajendran. Adding to recovery problems were the lockdown measures. The Kerala government had declared every alternate day as a holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act. Given the market conditions, there are not many participants in the auction and the recovery is around 95% of gold value. The 100-year-old CSB Bank, which is majority-owned by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax group, had announced plans to transform itself into a new-age bank. After a clean-up of loan books and infusion of capital, the bank decided to focus on gold loans until the transformation is in place. Last year, its gold loan business rose 60% with the share of such loans rising to 40%. The bank is currently working on reducing its cost-to-income ratio even as it expands its network. Rajendran said the bank added 100 branches last year and would add another 100 in the first half of FY22 and 200 in entire financial year. “This will take us to 700 branches and in two years we aim to be at 1,000,” he said. The bank has exited the Indian Banks’ Association wage agreement as the productivity levels are below the industry average. Earlier during an earnings call, Rajendran had told analysts the bank was taking over branches that were being vacated by PSU banks following a merger. The 10 PSBs that have merged into four are in the process of consolidation where they are closing or relocating branches when there are more than one in the same street because of the merger. The banking is working on the back-end systems to prepare for the future. Digital transactions that were just 27% before the acquisition in 2018, have gone up to 73% at the end of March 2021 and in the last three months have risen to 77%. The bank has taken on board Pralay Mondal as president to lead its retail, SME, operations and IT functions.

The entry of devotees in temple was permitted from June 8 by ending provision of carrying RT-PCR report in view of second wave of Covid-19, but the entry in sanctum sanctorum was not allowed. KVTs chief executive officer Sunil Verma said, “The doors of sanctum sanctorum of the temple have been opened but the Covid-19 protocol is being followed strictly as not more than five devotees are being allowed inside at a time. Wearing os maks and sanitisation are also must for all the devotees.” Devotees thronged the temple on Sunday and performed rituals like Jalabhishek and Dugdhabhishek to the presiding deity by entering the sanctum sanctorum since early morning. KVT had been closed completely for over 100 days during the first wave of Covid-19 in 2020. But, when the second wave hit the region in April, the district administration had made carrying negative RT-PCR test report of past 72 hours mandatory for entry into KVT from April 14. Entry in Garbhgriha (sanctum sanctorum) while sparsh darshan (touching Jyotirlinga) had been stopped. Though the district administration and temple authorities had not announced closure of the temple, making negative RT-PCR test report mandatory for entry into the temple led to decrease in the number of devotees visiting the temple to almost zero in past 54 days. The officials said SOPs for crowd management in the temple, from entry till exit, are being followed to maintain proper social distancing for which markings have also been made. KVT had an average footfall of over 10,000 devotees per day before the Covid menace started in March 2020. Despite reopening of the temple on June 8, 2020, devotees had been coming in small numbers even in Shrawan month and on its Mondays. The arrival of devotees, including pilgrims especially from southern and western states, started in winters but the second wave of Covid-19 stopped it in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvt-allows-entry-of-devotees-in-sanctum-sanctorum/articleshow/83902583.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Ahmedabad||Research Findings: New toxic threat preying on vultures in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: A new toxic threat to vultures has been identified by researchers — the painkiller nimesulide has been found to be as dangerous as diclofenac, a similar drug known to cause vulture fatalities in Gujarat.  Nimesulide is used to relieve pain in both humans and animals. Researchers say if the veterinary use of nimesulide continues, it is bound to take a toll on white-rumped vultures in the state. A research paper by Kanthan Nambirajan, Subramanian Muralidharan, Aditya Roy, and Shashikant Jadhav reveals that at least four white-rumped vulture deaths can be attributed to nimesulide in recent times in Gujarat. Two of the birds were found in Sanand in Ahmedabad and the other two in Dhrangadhra in Surendranagar. The research paper stated that after postmortem examinations, tissues of several vultures were received for toxicological investigation at the National Centre for Avian Ecotoxicology, Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History. “The tissues were screened for a set of toxic pesticides, and none of them was at a detectable level,” the paper said. “Subsequently, the tissues were analyzed for thirteen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol. Of all the drugs tested, only nimesulide was detected in all the tissues, indicative of exposure.” The first vulture census in 2005 found 2,642 birds in Gujarat; the 2018 number was only 820. So the number of avian scavengers in Gujarat has dropped by nearly 70% between 2005 and 2018. “In the four vultures, we found only nimesulide which is an indication that nimesulide is as toxic as diclofenac,” said Roy, one of the researchers. “Visceral gout was also observed in all the four vultures during postmortem examinations.” Roy added: “Residues of nimesulide in tissues with symptoms of gout indicated that the vultures died due to nimesulide poisoning as no other NSAID was found.” The researchers have said it is recommended that nimesulide be banned by the government to conserve white-rumped vultures on the Indian subcontinent. Roy said that the Saving Asian Vulture from Extinction (SAVE) group will make a representation to the Union ministry of environment and forests and to the Union animal husbandry ministry to ban nimesulide. “We in Gujarat will meet the food and drugs controller and the officials of the animal husbandry department,” Roy said. “We will urge the officials to ban the drug in the state or at least in the districts with sizable vulture populations.” Roy said that the European Union has already banned the drug and Gujarat should follow suit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/research-findings-new-toxic-threat-preying-on-vultures/articleshow/83904909.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Though the government’s new directions mandate 12-16 week gap for the two-dose Covishield course, those who have to travel abroad can get the booster dose 28 days after the first. The exemption has been given as only fully vaccinated people are allowed entry in many countries. In Lucknow, health officials said, Balrampur Hospital has been a designated site for the people who want to get the booster dose of Covishield before the prescribed period. The waiver is meant for students, working professionals and sportspersons. Officials accompanying the Indian sports contingent to the Tokyo Olympics can also avail the facility. Medical superintendent, Balrampur Hospital, Dr Himanshu Chaturvedi said: “Beneficiaries under these categories can directly walk into any of the booths in the hospital for the second dose of Covishield after 28 days of the first. An online vaccination certificate will be issued to them that can be used for travel.” Recipients are required to produce relevant documents to support their claim. For instance, students going abroad for education need to provide a letter/document of the college/university in a foreign country where they have got admission, passport and Aadhaar card/government recognised photo ID. Those going for job abroad need to carry a copy of appointment letter issued by the employer, passport and Aadhaar card/government recognised photo ID. Similarly, a sportspersons have to furnish a letter issued by a competent sports authority verifying that the person has to take part in the sporting event abroad along with Aadhar/government recognised photo ID and passport. In addition to these documents, people can also bring photocopies of visas and flight tickets. These are not mandatory, but can be produced to further buttress their claim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/foreign-travellers-can-get-covishield-booster-shot-after-28-days/articleshow/83905866.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Actor and MP, Mimi Chakraborty, whose complaint led to the fake camp being busted on Wednesday, had gone to the camp on Tuesday as an invitation she had accepted because it had claimed it was being held to vaccinate those with disabilities and transgenders. There, she had also taken a vaccine shot that she had then believed was Covishield. But when she did not get a message from the Co-Win app and could not access her vaccine certificate, she alerted cops that led to the raids and Debanjan Deb’s arrest. At the Malda camp at DN Saha Vidyabhaban, physically challenged people from English Bazaar poured in. For the last few days, information was sent to them through social welfare department. District magistrate Rajarshi Mitra, who inaugurated the camp, said, “Those who are physically challenged and face problems in getting vaccinated standing in the queue are getting jabs in this camp. There will be a second one for those who are left.” For 35-year-old Tapas Mandal who cannot walk owing to his paralysed leg, this camp was a boon. “I cannot take the pain of getting registered and waiting in queue. It was really of immense help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-con-job-1st-real-jab-camp-for-disabled-held-in-bengal/articleshow/83902700.cms||---

Health officials in the district are on their toes ever since it came to light that a 38-year-old female resident of Jarod had become the first recorded case of the new variant in Vadodara. While the female resident, who had tested positive in April and her family are healthy, there were concerns on whether the new variant has infected others in the neighbourhood. Health teams started scanning the neighbourhood as part of the precautionary measure. “Our teams had collected 27 samples from the society. All the samples have tested negative of Covid-19,” said Dr Uday Tilawat, additional district health officer. The residential society has 130 houses, of which 33 are closed. “Our teams had carried out door-to-door survey of the remaining 97 homes. None of the 286 residents have any health-related complication or symptoms of Covid-19 like fever, cough or cold. Their oxygen saturation level too are good,” he said. While 37 residents of the society were vaccinated on Saturday, another 60 residents were vaccinated on Sunday. Nearly 118 residents had already taken their vaccines before the news of new variant surfaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/delta-variant-27-samples-in-vadodara-test-negative/articleshow/83901257.cms||---

Additional chief medical officer and nodal officer (National Health Mission) Dr Satyendra Rai told TOI, the entire district has been divided into 216 clusters, including 200 in rural and 16 in urban areas, where 319 vaccination teams would be deployed. In urban areas, 10 vaccination teams would cover 16 clusters (80 wards). The teams would administer Covid 19 vaccine to at least 1,250 recipients per day in a single cluster. As many as 200 clusters have been identified in 20 blocks of rural areas and over 300 teams would be pressed into service for the vaccination campaign. Moreover, joint teams of health, administration and education department have already engaged mobilisation teams to promote vaccination in villages and brief locals about the details of vaccination centres and timing. The mobilisation teams comprise of ANM/ASHA workers, pradhan, aganwadi workers, panchayat secretaries and primary teachers. The department aims to cover all the clusters on or before July 31. To cover rural areas and maximum crowd of recipients, spots like panchayat bhawan, primary schools and gram sabha have been converted into vaccination sites after calculating the number of eligible recipients. Quick response teams and cluster response teams have also been deployed to deal with any untoward incident. As many as 8,29,628 shots were administered to recipients of all age groups, including those above 45 years, in the district till June 27.

---||Patna||Some areas remain waterlogged in Patna||PATNA: While some of the areas in Patna remained waterlogged till Sunday evening following heavy rainfall on Friday night and faulty drainage system, most of the rivers, including the Ganga, were flowing below the danger level in the state. The heavy rainfall on Friday-Saturday was not uniformly widespread as Barh received 70mm rainfall while Patna, 85km away from it, had 146mm and Masaurhi, 25km away from Patna, received only 15mm rainfall. However, roads and lanes in many localities of Patna had waterlogging due to the faulty drainage system. In fact, Patna and towns in its adjoining districts are expected to be further plagued by heavy rainfall and waterlogging, as dense rain-bearing clouds have overcast the sky in Patna, Bhojpur, Arwal and Jehanabad, but heavy rainfall is expected at isolated places only. “Even on Sunday, these districts were marked yellow. They will receive heavy rainfall at isolated places, but it is unlikely to bring any dramatic change in the volume of water flowing through the Ganga,” a water resources department (WRD) official said. “At present, the south-west monsoon has weakened. Whatever rainfall Bihar, Nepal and eastern states are receiving is due to the cloud movement originating from the Bay of Bengal,” the WRD source said. However, on Sunday-Monday, the catchment areas of Kosi and Mahananda rivers in Nepal are expected to have heavy rainfall, but only at isolated places. It will be on the same pattern as was witnessed on Saturday, when the catchment areas of the Mahananda in Nepal received isolated heavy rainfall to the tune of 155mm at Chandragarh in Jhapa district. For the last couple of days, the heavy rainfall received has been only at isolated places. The water discharge through the Birpur barrage across the Kosi and Valmiki Nagar barrage across the Gandak fell on Sunday from 1.06 lakh cusecs to 1.03 lakh cusecs at Birpur and from 99,800 cusecs to 81,800 cusecs at Valmiki Nagar on Saturday. However, the discharge through Indrapuri barrage across Sone river has increased from 21,894 cusecs to 38,224 cusecs. Further, the water levels of the rivers flowing through north Bihar were below the danger mark at most places along their downstream, the WRD flood bulletin on Sunday said. As to the Ganga, it was flowing below the danger mark at Buxar, Digha and Gandhi Ghat in Patna as well as at Hathidah, Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon. However, the volume of water flowing through the river from Hathidah onwards was increasing, but was still much below their respective danger level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/some-areas-remain-waterlogged/articleshow/83899809.cms||Abhay Singh

The exclusive variety of black guava with red pulp inside is claimed to be rich in antioxidants, minerals and vitamins. It has been developed with more than three years of scientific research at BAU and is likely to be launched for commercial farming soon following some improvement in its size, fragrance and longer shelf life. This variety of guava is rich in antioxidant.BAU professor and associate director (research) in its department of horticulture, Dr M Feza Ahmad said the black guava has been developed at the university’s horticulture nursery after years of scientific research. This variety of guava is rich in antioxidant, including nearly 250 milligrams of Vitamin-C in 100 grams of fruit, Vitamin-A and B, high percentage of calcium and iron besides other multivitamins and minerals, some amount of protein and other beneficial elements that have ‘antiageing’ effects on human beings, Dr Feza said. The fruit will be fully ripe by August-end or September, Dr Feza said. “We are trying to further improve the quality of this guava that has manifold nutritional benefits lots of potential for commercial production and exports,” he added.  Dr Sandip Lal, president of the local chapter of IMA and HoD of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JLNMCH), said the newly developed black guava has drawn the attention of medical fraternity and needs further exploration in view of its antioxidants, vitamins and minerals and can be helpful in combating human diseases. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) should collaborate with the BAU in research and create awareness about the black guava as claimed, Dr Lal said. Prof C B Singh, HoD of Botany at Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU), in reference to senescence or biological ageing of human body, said the black guava needs further research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bau-develops-black-guava-rich-in-minerals-vitamins/articleshow/83899604.cms||Kumar Rajesh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Long road to recovery for steel sector||HYDERABAD: The road to recovery for Telangana’s steel sector is expected to be a long, winding one. With infrastructure projects drying up and no respite from the burden of fixed costs like high power tariffs, labour charges and interest on borrowings, the sector feels that only a revival of demand in the near-term and government support can help it get back on its feet. Vinod Agarwal, managing director, Mahalakshmi Profiles Pvt Ltd, pointed out that there was no oxygen availability since mid-April and only few units that were holding liquid oxygen stocks could operate. In steel plants, oxygen is used in furnaces and in cutting metals. “While oxygen supply to steel units resumed from the first week of June, demand is subdued due to lack of government spends on infrastructure,” he said. Vinod Kumar Agarwal, director, Salasar Iron & Steels Pvt Ltd, feels it will take at least a year for the sector in Telangana to recover from the lockdown blow. Pointing to the high labour costs, said a majority of the workers are migrants from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand, among others. “With no clarity on how long the lockdown would last, there was no way that we could have let the labour go as it would have posed a massive challenge while reopening units. Hence, we continued to pay their salaries,” he added. Anil Agarwal, promoter, Jeevaka Industries Pvt Ltd, pointed out that commodity prices are at an all-time high, impacting prices of raw materials like iron ore and coal. To make matters worse, steel units are also grappling with high power tariffs. “While power cuts have become a thing of the past, the high-power tariff has made us uncompetitive,” he rued. Steel is a power-intensive industry and plants had to pay the minimum demand power tariffs even when their plants were not operational. This issue is currently sub-judice. “Telangana must look at reducing tariffs from over Rs 6.50 per unit to bring them at par with Chhattisgarh (around Rs 5.50 per unit) and Maharashtra (around Rs 4.50 per unit),” Agarwal of Mahalakshmi Profiles said, adding that this will not only boost growth and employment, the state government would be able to recover power tariffs concessions by way higher GST earnings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/long-road-to-recovery-for-steel-sector/articleshow/83904770.cms||Swati Rathor

The varsity, which has a mangrove research centre, is conducting several awareness programmes and encouraging planting of mangroves in the natural habitat where it existed earlier. “We had done a project funded by the science and engineering research board (SERB) on mangrove conservation. As part of the project, we had conducted a survey to understand the perception of locals towards mangroves. We realized that they didn’t understand the ecological value of mangrove forests and how it protects them. So, to generate awareness among people on the need to conserve mangroves, we formed ‘Mangroups’ with students and trained them,” said Dinesh Kaippilly, head, department of aquaculture, Kufos. The mangrove research centre was established with the financial assistance from the state under its Plan Project. As part of the awareness programme, ‘Mangroups’ were formed, including schoolchildren from vocational higher secondary schools situated in various parts of Kerala. Each group comprised five students, one parent and a teacher. This group mainly focused on spreading the ecological importance of mangroves among the schoolchildren and local people in the respective localities. As part of the project, the fisheries station organizes mangrove festivals on a regular basis to improve the awareness of students/scholars/public on mangroves. Germplasm conservation was also carried out as part of the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mangroups-to-protect-mangroves/articleshow/83902709.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

With this, there are now 11 micro containment zones that have been set up within Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) area. Three of them are falling in Salt Lake and the rest of the eight zones are towards Rajarhat side — Kestopur, Raghunathpur, Jyangra Mahamayatola, Hatiara Road, Jhawtola, Ashininagar and Deshbandhunagar — of the civic body jurisdiction area. Following instructions from the health department authorities, a lane inside Laboni Abason was cordoned off by the police, as residents within the zone asked cops to help them with their daily requirements. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) board of administrator member Tulsi Sinha Roy, who is also the local ward coordinator, said that four persons from one of the buildings in the housing block are Covid-infected. “On Monday, a free RT-PCR test will be conducted for about 70 residents of the housing estate, surrounding the micro containment zone, to check if any other resident is infected by Covid. Civic health workers will collect samples from the residents at the community centre hall,” Roy said. Roy added that most of the residents of the housing estate have already been inoculated through both paid and free vaccination camps and that the ones still left will be vaccinated soon. “We will see who are left to get vaccinated. Whoever is left will be inoculated. We have also provided an oxygen concentrator to the residents there. Food has also been provided to the Covid-hit families earlier,” she said. Laboni housing estate secretary Sumit Sarkar said that sanitisation drive inside the housing was being conducted on a regular basis. “There is also a Covid help desk for the residents,” he added. The first micro containment zone within BMC area was set up earlier last week at Kestopur Rabindra Palli locality, following which the BMC authorities worked out taking data from all its 41 wards to see which of the localities or standalone buildings have been most affected by Covid in the last few weeks. “The number of active Covid cases has reduced, with only about an average of 25 daily new cases getting reported from entire BMC area. However, we are constantly keeping a check on the localities that had been majorly affected and are urging people to continue following all the Covid safety protocols, including wearing mask and washing hands,” said a BMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-new-micro-c-zones-in-salt-lake-to-check-covid-spread/articleshow/83902722.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Goa||Goa: Rough sea coughs up large amounts of plastic waste along Salcete’s beaches||COLVA: Huge quantities of plastic waste washed ashore along the Salcete coastal belt and the worst of this was seen at Fatrade beach in Varca where the garbage was strewn across the beach. With the monsoon season progressing and winds and tidal waves picking up, the light waste material discarded into the sea at various locations eventually makes land-fall, littering beaches and leaving an ugly reminder of the garbage issue. The trash washed up on the shores consists mainly of plastic carry bags and milk packets, caps, spoons, cups, glasses, straws, driftwood either entangled in discarded fishing nets or free floating. One villager blamed the plastic pollution on single-use plastic and lack of civic sense compounded by an ineffective waste management system. “We are getting back what we have casually discarded in the sea,” he said. On Saturday a visit to various beach stretches in Salcete showed plastic trash and waste across beaches but it was particularly noticeable at Fatrade beach. Among the beaches in the south, only the Colva stretch was being cleaned up as three women personnel employed to keep the beach clean were collecting the plastic which had washed ashore. They said that heavy rainfall and turbulent sea poses a severe challenge as the rough sea throws up large quantities of the garbage overnight. “We end up repeating the exercise at the same spot,” one of the workers said. The workers said that high tide and lashing waves does not make their work easier as it does not permit them to sweep or collect the plastic on the shore which is closest to the waves.

This is your obligation under the National Food Security Act,” the high court said on Friday, adding that Delhi government has “randomly and arbitrarily” reduced the quota, while hearing a plea in this regard. “The figure of 69.6 lakh beneficiaries has been ascertained on what basis? Then how do you randomly and arbitrarily reduce the allotment to 20 lakh. If you are a state, it’s your obligation. If somebody who is hungry comes to your distribution centre, will h’e wait for your policy? Why have a figure at all? Anybody who is hungry should get food,” a bench of Justices Anup Bhambhani and Jasmeet Singh, sought to know from the AAP-led government. It questioned Delhi government further and wondered what would be the stand of the government agencies. “If somebody shows at your distribution centre saying that I need food grain, will you deny him food,” the court asked. The bench noted that one time relief will be inadequate, especially at the time of the pandemic and also when there is possibility of a third wave. The court’s comments came in response to an affidavit filed by Delhi government, where it told the court that as of June 23, out of the cap of 20 lakh, 15.5 lakh people had already availed of rations under the guidelines. The bench, however, refrained from issuing any directions and asked the government’s lawyer to seek instruction on the matter after it was informed that the Delhi cabinet is seized of this issue. It also directed the government to file a fresh affidavit and scheduled the next hearing for July 9. It was hearing a petition filed by the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA), challenging the guidelines issued by the state government to distribute ration to people without ration cards or the non-PDS beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-questions-govt-cap-on-non-pds-food-distribution/articleshow/83902735.cms||---

The decision was taken almost a year ago as part of the ease of doing business programme but due to lockdowns, the final approval to the notifications and execution was delayed, said principal secretary state excise Valsa Nair Singh. Before the 2019 elections, the state government had turned down a popular demand from hotels, liquor manufacturers and tipplers to reduce the number of dry days in the state from nine to five. Maharashtra has among the highest number of dry days in the country. While neighbouring Karnataka has just one (October 2), Bengal and MP have three each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/with-october-8-struck-out-one-less-dry-day-in-maharashtra-now/articleshow/83904844.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: 80% above 45 years receive first vaccine dose in tribal hamlets||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A group of medical teams in remote panchayats in the district have been trudging kilometres along tortuous paths for more than a month to accomplish the tiring task of completing vaccination drive in the tribal panchayats and settlements. Set with a target of vaccinating over 18,000 people spread across 38 panchayats and nine tribal settlements, the medical teams comprising doctors, nurses, ASHA workers and tribal promoters have so far managed to attain 80% first dose vaccination to those in the 45 plus age category and around 60% first dose coverage for 18 plus age category. It was not just forests and slippery paths they had to deal with during the past month. These doctors had to revisit settlements repeatedly to create awareness, battle misconceptions and bust myths long ingrained in their minds. “Sometimes, we spend around 45 minutes with one person to get them convince about the need to get vaccinated. Often many settlements were hard to reach and we took a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get near the settlement and then we would walk to each centre,” says Dr Joy John, medical officer, Kuttichal. The team at Amboori would leave every day at 10am, and owing to the terrain and other factors, even after spending a whole day, they would sometimes be able to cover 40 persons a day. “When it rains, our journey will have to be halted since the vehicle won’t move ahead. Often we reached these places on foot. During our course of vaccination, there were interesting instances like we were able to vaccinate persons who had not till now had a tablet or vaccine in their entire lives. They had heard about Corona and were following appropriate behaviour by wearing masks. Initially, we restricted our surveys in these areas because we didn’t want to cause an outbreak. Later, when we began surveillance, some people would come and tell us not to take them to quarantine if they tested positive and if we did, they would jump into the river. We were able to convince them all about ways to prevent infection and they became aware of the need to get vaccinated,” says Dr Pradeep, medical officer, Amboori. The medical teams were ably helped by the Hamlet Ashas, hailing from the same communities. “They would create proper awareness and many people were willing to come for vaccination. This helped us schedule the drives accordingly. We also organised spot registrations at our hospital for the people,” says Dr Rajeev, medical officer, Bharathanoor. The teams also had to balance their daily routines and often would turn up for duty without fail after draining treks to and from the tribal settlements located in remote areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/80-above-45-yrs-receive-first-vaccine-dose-in-tribal-hamlets/articleshow/83902727.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Mumbai||Maratha Morcha runs bike rally, cops keep a distance||MUMBAI: The Maratha Kranti Sangharsh Morcha (MKSM) undertook a bike rally flouting lockdown rules to highlight their demand for reservation in jobs and education for the community. This is the first rally in the state since the Supreme Court rejected the Gaikwad Commission report allowing reservation for the Maratha community. The rally began from the Somaiya Grounds in Sion and ended near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Community members turned up with fancy bikes and expensive cars to show solidarity. With Level 3 restrictions in Mumbai prohibiting gatherings, police turned the bikers back after they reached CSMT. No details were available on legal action being initiated. This is the second such political gathering in recent days in violation of lockdown restrictions; a large protest was organised in Navi Mumbai to demand that the upcoming international airport be named after D B Patil, a 5-time MLA from Panvel. Rajan Ghag, convenor of the Maratha Morcha, said the rally was held to show support for their brethren in rural Maharashtra who are socially, educationally and economically backward. “Ever since the agitation began, we’ve held 58 morchas across the state, one in every district. In 2017, all the districts together held a rally in Mumbai, but the Mumbai district wing had so far not held a rally. Hence we decided to hold it today,” said Ghag. BJP leader and MLC Prasad Lad who was at the Somaiya Grounds said the rally was to awaken a dormant government. “If five crore Marathas take to the street, it can shake up those in power,” he said. Lad’s office claimed he has been receiving threats for his aggressive stand. Ghag said the Std X and XII results will be out soon and students of his community would lose out on opportunities. “All this has happened because the present government could not present the Gaikwad Commission report properly in court,” he said. As of now, reservations are available for Marathas under the 10% EWS (Economically Weaker Section) quota. The decision was taken by the Thackeray government after SC struck down the state’s SEBC (socially and economically backward) Act meant for Marathas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maratha-morcha-runs-bike-rally-cops-keep-a-distance/articleshow/83904884.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Man arrested for raping woman after promising job||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Nedumangad police on Sunday, have arrested a 39-year-old man on charges of raping a job aspirant. The police identified the accused as Renjith Chandran of Thara Nivas, Manava Nagar at Palkulangara near Pettah. Police said that the accused trapped the survivor through a fake advertisement of a job vacancy, which he posted on a popular online portal for classifieds. The 24-year-old survivor responded to the advertisement, which was for the post of a personal assistant to the manager of a soon-to-be launching construction company called Ambuja Homes and Constructions. The accused introduced himself as Harilal, an advocate practising at the high court and as the company manager, which he was going to launch in partnership with his brother-in-law. Nedumangad sub-inspector B S Sreejith, who was part of the investigation, said that the accused collected the survivor’s personal details, including residential address, via phone and then monitored the activities at her home. On the afternoon of May 11, he paid a visit after ensuring that her husband was not at home and allegedly raped her. The woman alleged in her petition that the accused also clicked her nude photos on his phone. Later, he blackmailed her using those pictures and forced her to have video calls with him for his sexual gratification. He threatened her that he would post the photos on social media if she refused to do his bidding. Police took action within two days after receiving her complaint. They also seized his mobile phone, which would be sent to forensic experts for detailed examination. “He was neither an advocate nor did he have any plans to launch a company,” the sub-inspector said, adding that the accused did not have any particular job. Following his arrest, three more persons approached the police, alleging that he charged them Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 as registration fee when they contacted him for the job. The accused was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody following the arrest. The police team was led by Nedumangad DSP J Umesh Kumar and inspector P S Vinod.

Hitting out at the so-called whistle-blowers, VHP said those alleging irregularities in land deals should move court and table evidence. Giving a clean chit to the temple Trust, VHP stated Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust hammered out the deals with honesty and transparency and termed those hurling accusations as traitors, who betrayed Hindus and ‘Ram Bhakts’. Talking to TOI, VHP general secretary Vinod Bansal said, “they should move court if they have concrete evidence to prove their claim. There is no scam in the deals. They can also approach government investigation agencies to carry out a probe. These vested interests are only creating media hype.” Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh and former Samajwadi Party MLA from Ayodhya, Pawan Pandey, had recently alleged mammoth corruption in land deals by the temple Trust, citing purchase of ‘nazul’land for Rs 2.5 crore from Ayodhya Mayor's nephew, who had bought it for 20 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vhp-jumps-to-rescue-of-temple-trust-daresso-called-whistleblowers-to-move-court-if-they-have-proof/articleshow/83906236.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Don’t build memorials, work for dalit uplift, says Rashtriya Lok Dal||LUCKNOW: National spokesperson of the Rashtriya Lok Dal Anupam Mishra on Sunday questioned the state government’s intention behind the announcement of a memorial after Dr BR Ambedkar and asked why the government did not remember the dalit icon in the last five years. “When only a few months left for the elections, instead of starting welfare programmes for dalits, a desperate attempt is being made to mislead them,” Mishra said. Last week, the state government had brought the proposal to establish Dr Ambedkar Cultural Centre in Lucknow, for which land is being searched in Aishbagh. “When a grand Parivartan Sthal has already been constructed by the BSP government in the past, what is the need for wasting crores of rupees on a new centre? If the CM wants to establish a cultural centre, he should get it constructed at Samajik Parivartan Sthal, so that the money to be spent on land can be saved and put to good use. But the CM will not do this because he feels that by doing so, the credit for this would go to former CM Mayawati,” Mishra said. He said dalits had risen above superficial politics and the Rs 45.4 crore meant for the memorial could be used for the uplift of dalits. “Today, dalits want health, education, security and prosperity and not any memorial or museum. If the state government wants to do something for Ambedkar and his society in true sense, the government should strengthen social and economic condition of dalits which would be a true tribute to Dr Ambedkar,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/dont-build-memorialswork-for-dalit-uplift-rld/articleshow/83906175.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Residents welfare associations take third wave guard, identify moms with kids below 12 for vaccination||KOLKATA: The possibility of a third wave of Covid-19 is not only keeping the government and healthcare facilities on their toes but has also led local residents, citizens’ groups and residents welfare associations in housing complexes to take pre-emptive measures, so that they are not caught off-guard. From identifying mothers with children below 12 for vaccination and procuring oxygen concentrators, vaccinating domestic helps and other service staff to earmarking space for safe homes and tackle mild cases, they are leaving no stones unturned. A list of women with children below 12 years has been drawn up at Lake Oasis in Beliaghata. “This is to track how many have taken their first dose vaccine and when they are scheduled for the second jab,” said Mohit Saraf, a member of the residents association. Many residents’ association have already held tele-conferencing with healthcare specialists to sensitise their members. The state government has initiated a series of measures considering that children could be more vulnerable in case a third wave of Covid-19 hits. New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity has already started distributing oxygen concentrators, pulse oximeters, soaps and sanitisers in the adjoining villages. “We are trying to sensitise residents and prepare them for the third wave. Many vendors, domestic helps and other service providers come from these areas. We are providing a concentrator and oximeter to local panchayat office in these villages,” said Sameer Gupta, secretary of New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rwas-take-3rd-wave-guard-identify-moms-with-kids-below-12-for-vax/articleshow/83902753.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Thiruvananthapuram||From out in the streets to a police officer, a story of grit||Thiruvananthapuram: With a lean, sturdy physique topped by cropped hair, Anie Siva, the 31-year-old sub-inspector of Varkala police station was often mistaken for her son’s elder brother. In casuals, she prefers to wear shirt and trousers. Her boy calls her Appa. It was not a deliberate decision to mask her feminine side, she says. “When he started calling me Appa instead of Amma, I never corrected him. I don’t find any difference between being a man or woman, after all, we all are humans…Above all, I am to him, a father and a mother at the same time,” says Siva. When Siva was left on the streets with her six-month-old son after her husband ditched her and her family shut the doors on her at the age of 19, her sole aim was to gain her father’s acceptance. Though it remains a distant dream, Siva has succeeded in getting to police force. She took charge as the SI of Varkala station two days ago. Her life has been nothing short of a limited series OTT thriller. While she was doing her first-year graduation in Sociology, she got married to her boyfriend against the will of her family. But after having a baby, he abandoned her and her family too made it clear it won’t accept her. “I worked as a salesgirl, selling curry powder and soaps house-to-house. Then I worked as an insurance agent. I used to prepare records and projects for students as well. I also sold lime juice and ice creams on festival grounds,” says Siva. It was not easy for a single mother and her son to find out a safe shelter. “Landlords were hesitant to rent out their houses. Sometimes they look down upon you,” she adds. It was her father’s greatest wish to see Siva as an IPS officer. So, in 2014 when one of her friends told her about the SI test, she thought of giving it a shot. “I thought if I could achieve my father’s dream, he would accept me. Also, my son is named after my father,” she says.In 2016, Siva was appointed as constable and cleared the SI test in 2019. After her probation period, on June 25, 2021, she was posted as SI in Varkala station. As she looks back, she feels all flaws and testing times in her life helped her become a compassionate police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/from-out-in-the-streets-to-a-police-officer-a-story-of-grit/articleshow/83902763.cms||---

Teachers say LU should make adequate arrangements for the maintenance of 200 saplings of peepal, which will be planted on the campus in the upcoming drive, otherwise their fate will be the same as 35 saplings sowed last year. The three gardens — Navgrah Vatika, Panchvati Vatika and Aushadhiye Vatika — were set up at a cost of Rs 40,340 at Tagore Lawn near commerce faculty and at ONGC building respectively. All the nine medicinal plants planted in the Navgrah Vatika are now missing. Nine different species of plants, trees, herbs or shrubs in this vatika represented nine planets. These plantations included that of banyan, palash, shami, gular and madar, among others. TOI found that not a single plant has survived. Similar has been the fate of the Panchvati Vatika near commerce faculty. Here, saplings of five trees considered sacred in the Hindu mythology were planted like peepal, banyan, bel, amla and ashok. In Aushadhi Vatika at the ONGC Building, around 20 medicinal plants and aromatic plants, including brahmi, madar, amla and sandal were planted, but only a few have survived. The entire money spent on the project has gone down the drain. Some teachers said that making plants survive with due care is as important as planting new ones. “If survival rate is zero, what’s the use of spending so much money and effort,” said a senior professor. When contacted, in charge of these three vatikas Prof Amita Kanaujia said, “Since it was a public place, the plants were either stolen or uprooted by students or outsiders. Not only plants but even the iron display board mentioning the name of the vatikas and plants with their specialities have been stolen.” “I have learned from the experience that before planting a sapling, the spot should be analysed. For example, plants survived in the ONGC building because of less movement of outsiders. I will now re-establish the vatikas at a safer place most likely in girls' hostels,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-set-for-new-plantation-drive-but-last-years-survival-rate-is-almost-zero/articleshow/83905666.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP heads for direct contest In 41 districts for Zila Panchayat chief polls||LUCKNOW: After getting a walkover in 17 Zila Panchayat chairman seats, the BJP is headed for a direct electoral contest with the opposition, essentially the Samajwadi Party, in at least 41 districts, including the Hindutva nerve centres of Ayodhya and Mathura. State election commission data show that only two nomination papers each were finally accepted in these 41 districts, in what may shape up a direct political contest between the ruling BJP with the opposition in the rural local bodies’ polls. Data show that a total of 57 districts had more than one nomination, with Jaunpur receiving a maximum of five nominations. The seat was given by BJP to its ally Apna Dal (S). Of the rest, four districts -- Baghpat, Etah, Pratapgarh and Sitapur – received four nominations while 11 districts saw three nominations. While the BJP supported candidates are headed for a win in Varanasi and Gorakhpur, unopposed, a direct electoral battle between the saffron party and a belligerent opposition brews up in Ayodhya and Mathura, the two Hindu religious hotpots, said to be the socio-political crucible of Sangh parivar. The polling and declaration of results will be on July 3. In Ayodhya, BJP supported candidate Roli Singh will be up against SP backed Indu Sen, daughter-in-law of late SP strongman Mitra Sen Yadav. Singh. Singh hails from an influential business family is learnt to be close to Ayodhya MP, Lallu Singh. The BJP supported candidates had fared unsatisfactorily in elections for Ayodhya panchayat wards in April, winning only eight of the 40 seats. The Samajwadi Party-backed candidates had won 21 seats. Likewise, the BJP is set to run into a muscle flexing opposition in Mathura. Here, BJP-supported candidate Kishan Chaudhary will face Jayant Chaudhary’s RLD- backed Rajendra Sikarwar. Of the total 33 wards in Mathura, RLD-backed candidates registered a win on eight wards. The BJP-supported candidates, too won eight seats. Significantly, Mayawati’s BSP which won a maximum of 13 seats in Mathura, will not be contesting the ZP chairman elections, in what has set political circle abuzz about both BJP and RLD hobnobbing with the BSP camp to garner support for their party supported candidates in Mathura which has a significant population of Dalits and Jats. The Samajwadi Party, which has been supporting RLD through back channels, had won only one ward, while four were won by independent candidates. The direct contest between BJP and its rivals comes against the backdrop of SP posing a formidable challenge to the saffron political outfit in the rural local bodies’ elections, a development which indicated resurgence of the opposition, especially in the rural areas which are crucial for poll fortunes of any political party. An unrelenting BJP, however, charted out a deft political strategy in a bid to put the Akhilesh Yadav-led political party on the mat, stoking knee-jerk reactions from the SP leadership which suspended as many as 11 district presidents on charges of “anti-party” activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-heads-for-direct-contest-in-41-dists-for-zp-chief-polls/articleshow/83905998.cms||Pankaj Shah

Mayawati’s concerted decision to stay away from a Muslim-dominated party was to scuttle any impression of her pursuing minority appeasement. This is in sharp contrast to the 2017 UP assembly elections, when Mayawati fielded nearly 100 Muslim candidates, a move that backfired on the Dalit party with its strength in the assembly reducing from 80 in 2012 to just 19 seats in 2017. Mayawati, in fact, tweeted a pointed riposte to rumours on a probable alliance with AIMIM, calling it “false, misguided and factually wrong” even as the Hyderabad-based party plans to contest 100 seats, essentially in Muslim-dominated areas of Uttar Pradesh in the state polls early next year. The development gains political traction in the wake of Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party nursing ambitions of consolidating Muslim vote-bank to take on the BJP in 2022 assembly elections. The BSP supremo had stitched an alliance with Samajwadi Party in 2019 Lok Sabha elections and managed to bag 10 parliamentary seats, a giant leap from zero in 2014. This followed her successful experiment to back SP in Gorakhpur, Phulpur, Noorpur and Kairana. Mayawati, however, snapped ties with SP, claiming the alliance did not work as per expectation. Her positioning on going alone in UP and Uttarakhand, comes days after her party announced cobbling up an alliance with former BJP ally, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab. BSP agreed to contest on 20 seats, leaving 97 seats to SAD in the 117-member assembly to take on the ruling Congress and BJP, which seeks to come back to power. The BSP chief also announced that party general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra would be the national coordinator of the party media cell. Mishra, a close associate of Mayawati, has been the brain behind the social engineering formula — upper caste-Dalit consolidation — that catapulted the Dalit queen to UP with absolute majority for the first time in 2007 assembly elections. It was, in fact, Mishra who represented BSP while announcing its tie-up with SAD in Punjab. Mayawati’s decision to further cement Mishra’s position is viewed as a deft move to silence detractors, who have been alleging the Dalit party was in the control of a Brahmin leader even as 11 party MLA, including the two veterans, Lalji Verma and Ram Achal Rajbhar were sacked. Significantly, Mayawati maintained the media should exercise restraint before peddling speculation and instead get it confirmed from Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mayawati-junks-talk-of-alliance-with-owaisis-aimim-to-fight-solo-in-up-uttarakhand/articleshow/83906034.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Delhi||Sub-city of lakes? Hope floats in Delhi's Dwarka||NEW DELHI: The recent creation of a seven-acre pond in Dwarka by Delhi government using treated water from Pappankalan sewage treatment plant (STP) may have paved the way for constructing four more waterbodies, which are planned to be completed in less than a year. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) would be using treated water to create two more waterbodies inside the Pappankalan STP in Sector 16, one inside the Dwarka water treatment plant and another inside the Najafgarh STP. All projects would utilise in situ measures, such as aeration, floating wetlands and ozonation to remove excess nutrients. Dwarka has seen several citizen-oriented efforts in the past few years to revive waterbodies, which has resulted in rejuvenation of ponds and lakes in sectors 5, 20, 23 and 24. The focus is now on two waterbodies in sectors 8 and 25. A DJB official said the waterbody in Sector 16, which was created in March, had resulted in recharging two million gallons of water daily and the groundwater level had increased by 0.5 metres. Measurement of the groundwater table 400 metres away from the lake also showed a recharge rate of 30 centimetres per day. Under the “City of Lakes” project, 155 more waterbodies would be created or revived. The first phase would finish in June. Phase-II would be completed by June 2022 and Phase-III by December 2022. An official said while there were two STPs at Pappankalan, they would be using the Phase-II STP as it was designed to remove nutrients. Locals who have revived waterbodies in Dwarka, meanwhile, have gone for a more traditional approach by diverting excess water from stormwater drains and increasing the catchment area nearby. Plants have been used to absorb excess nitrates and phosphates. Diwan Singh, an activist, worked with several locals and the group Sukh Dukh Ke Saathi to revive waterbodies in sectors 20 and 23 and, recently, Sector 24’s Dhool Siras. Singh said they were against using STP water, adding that the revived waterbodies would be able to sustain themselves throughout the year by natural means. “Dwarka has adequate stormwater drains. If they are simply cleared out and diverted to a depression, a waterbody can easily be revived or created,” he said. The group also worked on reviving a waterbody in Sector 5, which was now being maintained by Delhi Development Authority. Singh said two more waterbodies, in sectors 8 and 25, required attention and could be rejuvenated in the future. “The government can look at these. The one in Sector 8 has dried up completely. Efforts to create more waterbodies will help Dwarka and its groundwater table return to normal once again,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sub-city-of-lakes-hope-floats-in-dwarka/articleshow/83902804.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Ahmedabad||‘Govt should devise SOP for vulture tissue collection’||AHMEDABAD: In a research published this April, “Nimesulide poisoning in white-rumped vulture Gyps bengalensis in Gujarat, India,” the authors found the anti-inflammatory drug nimesulide in the tissues of all the dead vulture from Gujarat they studied. The research was part of a project funded entirely by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. The collection of tissues of dead vultures sampled in the study were permitted by Gujarat forest department, and shared by Jivdaya Charitable Trust, Ahmedabad.  Besides suggesting a ban on use of nimesulide in veterinary treatment, the researchers have also recommended that the Gujarat government devise a standard methodology for collection of tissues of dead vultures for toxicological examination. The research paper pointed out that between March and April 2020, there were at least two other incidents of deaths of white-rumped vultures in Assam and West Bengal. While 13 vultures died after eating the carcass of a pig in Jalpaiguri district, in West Bengal, 19 vultures died in Sibsagar, Assam possibly due to poisoning However, tissue samples could not be collected for analysis. The study found that residues of all the 32 most commonly used pesticides in the tissues from kidneys, livers and guts of the four white-rumped vultures collected from Sanand and Dhrangadhra were below detection limits. It was confirmed that the vultures did not die due to any of the tested toxic pesticides. Subsequently, the tissues were analysed for fourteen drugs as listed in methodology. Of all the fourteen drugs analysed, only nimesulide was detected in all the tissues considered for the investigations. Banned drug used widelyThe research paper stated that despite the ban on diclofenac, it was reported to have accounted for 10–46% of all NSAIDs available in the Indian market for veterinary use. Studies revealed that in addition to diclofenac, other NSAIDs, namely, aceclofenac, ketoprofen, nimesulide, flunixin and carprofen are also toxic to Gyps vultures. White-rumped vulturesWhite-rumped vultures are listed as a critically endangered species since the year 2000. Their population have drastically reduced due to the effects of diclofenac presence in animal carcasses. Diclofenac was banned for veterinary use in India from 2006, but the vulture population is yet to recover. White-rumped vultures are included under Schedule I of Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972 What is nimesulideThe paper stated that nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Data from a case study on drug-induced liver injury of drugs, namely, nimesulide, ketoprofen, ibuprofen, diclofenac and paracetamol in Italy had revealed nimesulide to be associated with higher, and ibuprofen and ketoprofen with moderate risk of hepatotoxicity in humans. Because of the death of a six-year-old child due to nimesulide-induced concomitant hepatic and renal failure in India, controversy exists in the safety of the drug for humans. In many countries, including the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, nimesulide is not permitted for human use due to its high risk of liver damage. However, it is being widely used in India (banned for use in under-12 patients).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-should-devise-sop-for-vulture-tissue-collection/articleshow/83904957.cms||---

The seizures were made at Pettah and Poojappura police station limits. They have also arrested two men in connection with the cases. Both seizures were made by the respective local police with the help of district anti-narcotic special action force (Dansaf), who were maintaining high vigil in the city, as part of a special drive launched on the occasion of International Day against Drug Abuse on Saturday. In Pettah station limits, police seized 100kg ganja that was hidden in an empty plot of land on a bylane near National Highway 66 near Chackai. They also arrested Mohammed, 59, hailing from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, on charges of smuggling the contraband into the city. Deputy commissioner of police Vaibhav Saxena said that the ganja was sourced from Andhra Pradesh. It was then smuggled across the state border in trucks transporting vegetables from Tamil Nadu to Kerala. Mohammed was just one of the members of a large racket that involves people from both the states, the DCP said. Investigation into information collected from persons arrested recently in narcotic cases in the city led to Mohammed, he added. The seized ganja was packed in 46 packets, kept in two gunny bags. Police have launched a probe to trace and arrest the remaining members of the gang. At Poojappura, police arrested Sriram, 24, of Kattachal Road near Thirumala, with 10kg ganja. The contraband was seized from his residence. Police searched his house based on a tip-off received by T R Pradeep Kumar, assistant commissioner of city narcotic cell. Police said that Sriram and his twin brother were habitual offenders who had cases pending at various police stations in the city for the same offence. Both men were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody. The Dansaf members involved in both catches were led by assistant commissioner T R Pradeep Kumar and city special branch assistant commissioner M K Binukumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/110kg-ganja-seized-in-city-two-arrested/articleshow/83902780.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Road fatalities double with nearly half of victims cyclists, walkers in bike-friendly Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: Road fatalities have more than doubled in the first half of the year as compared to the same period last year, an alarming fact that becomes all the more worrisome as many victims were cyclists and pedestrians in a city touted as one of the safest for bicycle lovers. A total of 48 people — nine of them women — were killed in 47 fatal accidents from January to June 23. The figure was 20 for the corresponding period in 2020. One of the probable reasons for the lower count was the nearly two-month strict national lockdown announced in March-end to curb the spread of coronavirus. This time too restrictions were in place, but they were hardly as severe as the ones that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ordered last year. As many as 13 pedestrians and eight cyclists lost their lives on the roads, according to the data that listed 20 two-wheeler riders among the victims. Members of a standing committee during a meeting held at the police headquarters in Sector 9 on March 24 had proposed to levy penalties on cyclists and rehri-rickshaw pullers for not using cycle tracks. Police are planning to start a drive on these lines soon. A maximum of 19 victims were in the age group of 45 to 60 years, 12 in the 25 to 35 age category and nine in the 35 to 45 age bracket. Five victims were senior citizens and two minors. Traffic police blamed overspeeding for most of the accidents. SPS Sondhi, DSP, traffic, said cops have been putting up overspeeding nakas at different timings and locations, challaning hundreds of violators daily. Last year, police had recommended cancellation of 6,510 licences of people caught driving above the permissible speed limit in the city. Police had issued 30,700 challans for overspeeding in 2020. Police are in the process of buying night vision speed cameras to catch vehicles overspeeding during night hours. Data showed a maximum of 20 fatal accidents were reported in the east zone. South west zone came next with 13 fatalities and six deaths each were reported in south east zone and central zone. The city also reported 38 non-fatal accidents that left 75 people, including 12 women, injured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/road-fatalities-double-with-nearly-half-of-victims-cyclists-walkers-in-bike-friendly-city/articleshow/83902766.cms||Pawan Tiwari

He was accompanied by his wife Savita and daughter Swati. While interacting with residents of Paraunkh, a hamlet in Kanpur Dehat district, the President recalled his humble beginnings, saying his village was his motherland which catapulted him to the august office of Rashtrapati Bhawan. “Paraunkh’s inspiration has taken me from High Court to Supreme Court to Rajya Sabha to Rashtrapati Bhawan,” he said. President Ram Nath Kovind, Governor Anandiben Patel & CM Yogi Adityanath in Paraunkh on SundaySpeaking on the occasion, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, “The President has donated his lifetime earnings for constructing the Veerangana Jhalkari Bai Inter College and this helped Paraunkh to make its mark. I also visited the Pathri Devi temple, where the President’s father contributed to its construction.” The CM then announced setting up of a medical college in Kanpur Dehat. Speaking on the occasion, the President praised the culture of ‘matri devo bhava’ (mother is God), ‘pitru devo bhava’ (father is God) and ‘acharya devo bhava` (teacher is God). “It’s a tradition in my family to provide status of mother to the oldest woman in the village and father to the elderly men, irrespective of caste, class or sect. Today, I am happy to see this tradition is intact,” he said. “I am happier than you to come to Paraunkh. I never imagined that a boy like me would get the privilege to serve the position of President, but the credit goes to our democratic set-up, my village and your love and blessings. I bow to freedom fighters and the drafting committee of Constitution for their sacrifice and contribution. UP has given many Prime Ministers, but now the path is open for people from UP to become President after me,” he said. Walking down memory lane, he was ecstatic to witness concrete houses in his village and the rohaniya ‘bazar. He also recalled his classmates, Jaswant Singh, Vijaypal Singh, Hariram, Chandrabhan Singh Bhadauria, Rajaram and Dashrath Singh. The President said, he studied with them and shared dreams together. “My friends and classmates have a special place in my life,” he said.

---||Lucknow||Foreign funds used for illegal conversions, tracks Rs 2 crore from UK: Uttar Pradesh ATS||LUCKNOW: Continuing its probe into the alleged illegal conversion of poor people to Islam, the Anti-Terrorist Squad of the Uttar Pradesh police has claimed that Rs 2 crore were diverted from the United Kingdom and misused by the arrested duo, Umar Gautam and Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi. According to ATS, bank accounts of a Gujarat-based businessman were used for transactions. Inspector general of police, ATS, GK Goswamy said, “Transactions to the tune of crores of rupees have been made from UK into the accounts of a businessman in Gujarat, who is under our scanner. We are verifying the accounts.” Another officer privy to the investigation said the transfer of Rs 2 crore was done from UK without following the guidelines and the account of a trust/society was used to make private transactions, which was illegal. “Evidences show violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), which is being probed. ED is also looking into it,” the officer said. ATS officials said they were tracing the details of transactions from the Middle East countries to the accounts of Umar Gautam and Jahangir Qasmi. ATS is also looking into the properties owned by the arrested duo, besides identifying other members of the gang. The agency also claimed to have come across more conversions carried out by the duo in Ghaziabad district. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has also issued a notice to the Fatehpur district administration, seeking information about the allegations made by a teacher of a private school that Umar Gautam visited the campus and ask students to study Urdu and Arabic. The teacher claimed that Umar Gautam pressured Hindu students to convert to Islam and when she protested, she was sacked by the school authorities. SP, Fatehpur, Satpal told TOI that following NCPCR notice and the allegations levelled against a school, the district magistrate has constituted a four-member committee to conduct an investigation. “Statements of the teacher who levelled the allegations and students will also be recorded,” he said. On June 21, ATS had arrested Mohammed Umar Gautam and Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasmi on charges of converting around 1,000 people, including poor women and children with speech and hearing disabilities, to Islam. Qasmi is the chairman of the Islamic Dawah Centre (IDC) in Delhi’s Jamianagar. Most of the funds were received in the name of IDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ats-says-foreign-funds-used-for-illegalconversions-tracks-rs-2cr-from-uk/articleshow/83906185.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

While two men have been arrested in connection with the incident, Rajesh has already lost a calf while three cows who suffered wounds haven’t eaten much for two days. “We have had issues with a group of youths who would frequently assemble here at night and do all sorts of stuff like vandalizing street lights, drinking, etc. There was an argument over how they took away the bark of a tree from private property. But I never thought they would take it out on the cows,’‘ said Rajesh. “They were merciless with the animals. A five-day-old calf nearly lost its eye when they attacked the animals with swords and iron rods. One of the calves wouldn’t recover from the attack,” he said. Rajesh immediately sought the help of veterinarian Dr Mumtaz who rushed to the farm to attend to the injured animals. “I hope the cows recover. Owing to stress from the attack, many of them are not eating. Milk distribution has also been affected,” said Rajesh. Rajesh had got a call two nights ago about the attack. Initially, he thought they had destroyed the lights on the farm. However, when he checked on the animals, he found them were bleeding. The police are on the lookout for three other men wanted in connection with the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-men-held-for-attacking-cows/articleshow/83902801.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav, Uttar Pradesh BJP chief spar over democracy||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday launched a frontal attack on the ruling BJP accusing it of ‘muzzling democracy’ by blocking filing of nomination by opposition supported candidates in the Zila Panchayat chairperson elections. His statement invited sharp riposte from the BJP with party’s state president Swatantra Dev Singh taunting the former CM of leading a party which never toed democratic lines and was largely limited to just one family. Akhilesh’s attack on BJP came a day after the saffron party’s supported candidates got a walkover in 17 districts after opposition failed to put a candidate. A formal announcement of the BJP supported candidates getting elected unopposed will be announced on Tuesday. The SP chief said that the BJP fared poorly in various districts, including Varanasi and Gorakhpur. “Yet its candidates getting a walkover is no less than a magic,” he commented, adding that the BJP was using money and muscle power to gag the democratic process in the rural grass roots. Reacting to Akhilesh’s stinging barbs, Singh said that the SP boss remained confined to his house throughout the pandemic and tried to misguide the people. “Now when the SP is losing in rural polls, he (Akhilesh) is raising an unwarranted hue and cry,” he said. The UP BJP chief said that the SP culture has largely been promoting corruption and criminalisation of politics. He also accused the former UP CM of fostering casteism, nepotism and communal appeasement. Singh said that Akhilesh had already accepted the defeat and is therefore holding his party functionaries accountable for the poor show. The SP had suspended 11 of its district presidents on Saturday, hours after 17 BJP supported candidates managed to get a walkover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-accuses-bjp-of-muzzling-democracy/articleshow/83905649.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Marginal rise in Covid cases amid Delta variant concerns||LUCKNOW: After registering less than 200 Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the state again recorded a jump with 222 fresh cases in the last 24 hours. The surge, albeit marginal, comes amid concerns of Delta variant of the virus spreading in some parts of the country. UP had recorded 173 cases on Saturday. According to health bulletin, the number of new Covid-19 cases went up from 11 on Saturday to 23 on Sunday in Lucknow, from 5 to 15 in Varanasi, 4 to 11 in Prayagraj, four to 17 in Kanpur, and three to nine in Meerut. The number of deaths rose marginally from 40 on Saturday to 45 the last 24 hours. The number of people recovering from infection also witnessed a steep fall – from Saturday’s 328 to 169 on Sunday. However, Gautam Budh Nagar recorded a fall in new cases from 14 to just 2 in last 24 hours while total 22 districts, including Rae Bareli, Mainpuri, Azamgarh, Hardoi, Mau, Unnao and Maharajganj, did not record any fresh case. Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said the state government was keeping a close watch on people coming to UP from states where Delta variant was being reported. “Vigil is being maintained with the help of health workers and nigrani samitis (in case of villages). People must exercise restraint by using facemasks and avoiding crowded places, even after being vaccinated. The state government has not reduced testing. At least 2,77,890 samples were tested on Sunday which were up from 2,66,957 tests a day ago,” Sehgal said. He added that the state government was committed to getting 10 crore people vaccinated by the end of August which would substantially reduce the impact of the third wave. The state government has managed to inoculate over 3 crore people by conducting special drives to vaccinate different category of people. Meanwhile, the state government has kicked off door-to-door distribution of special medicine kits with syrups and chewable tablets for children under ‘Corona Ki Jung Mein Har Jeevan Anmol’ campaign in view of the possible third wave. The state government said it has prepared over 50 lakh pamphlets-cum-envelopes in which medical kits for children would be distributed by surveillance committees in all 75 districts of the state. The kits include syrups and chewable tablets of lesser dosage than adults. There are four kinds of kits — for children below one year, 1-5 years, 5-12 years and those between 12 and 18 years – which will be provided even in remote regions of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/new-covid-cases-rise-in-stateamid-delta-variant-concerns/articleshow/83905625.cms||---
---||Dehradun||PM Modi lauds Uttarakhand environmentalist Sachidanand Bharti for his water conservation efforts in hills||DEHRADUN: For making more than 30,000 water pits in the Pauri Garhwal hills, environmentalist Sachidanand Bharti — who initiated the ‘Paani Raakho’ andolan — was on Sunday lauded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Mann ki Baat programme. Bharti, a teacher, converted the parched land in his village, Gaad Kharak in Thalisain block of Pauri Garhwal into a water-abundant place by digging more than 30,000 water pits known as chaal khaal after involving locals. Speaking about Bharti in the context of water scarcity during summers, the PM said that water shortage is turning into a major concern for the country and the efforts of Bharti in creating water pits and planting trees alongside them were laudable. Sachidanand Bharti converted the parched land in his village into a water-abundant place by digging more than 30,000 water pitsBharti,66, started the Paani Raakho Andolan in 1989 after a severe drought in Pauri in 1987. Recalling the circumstances which led him to initiate the movement, Bharti told TOI, “I was in college at Gopeshwar in Chamoli in 1974 when I got inspired by environmentalist Chandi Prasad Bhatt and joined the Chipko movement which had just been started. I planted a lot of trees in Pauri during that time but my efforts came to naught during the drought of 1987 when the trees could not get sufficient water.” This, he says, made him realise the importance of water conservation. After the drought, in order to save the remaining plantations in his village —where he used to teach General Science to intermediate school students — Bharti decided to dig pits of 1 cubic ft near each tree so that water percolates to the roots of the trees. Over 2000 such pits were dug by Bharti and other villagers in Ufrainkhal, a hill near their village. “As a result of digging of the pits, gradually over the course of a decade, a seasonal rivulet in Ufrainkhal got converted into a perennial stream, and villagers named it Gaad Ganga after our village Gaad Kharak,” he recalled. He added that the pits — also known as ‘jal talaiyas’ locally — were constructed in a natural way without use of plastic, cement or any non-biodegradable item and are around 1 cubic meter now. He also involved the villagers in plantation of broad-leaved trees such as baanj, deodar, buransh etc. “We have planted forests in 133 villages so far along with these jal talaiyas,” he added. On being praised by Modi, Bharti, who credits his wife Manjulata for having played a significant role in his journey, said that he was hopeful that the country will realise how important it is to conserve water for a safe future. He added that one of the prime reasons of forest fires in Uttarkhand is its dry moistureless land. “A state which has 72% of its geography under forest department should intensively focus on water conservation to save its forests from wild fires.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/modi-lauds-uttarakhand-environmentalist-sachidanand-bharti-for-his-water-conservation-efforts-in-hills/articleshow/83900918.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Delhi||45 lakh doses needed in July to keep up with present speed of vaccination: Atishi||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Sunday said that the Centre should provide at least 45 lakh Covid vaccine doses in July, to keep up the current vaccination rate of 1.5 lakh jabs daily. More than two lakh people were given vaccine doses in Delhi on Saturday, an all-time high. Atishi said that Delhi’s vaccination speed is increasing on an everyday basis and for two days, Delhi has administered more than 1.5 lakh doses per day. “Delhi government has already written a letter to the Centre stating that, going by 1.5 lakh vaccinations per day, Delhi will require 45 lakh vaccine doses in July, and if the vaccination speed keeps increasing, then Delhi will need more than 45 lakh doses per month. The increase in vaccine supply will help us in vaccinating about 70% of our population and achieving herd immunity in Delhi, making Delhi safe for everyone,” she said. She said that the vaccine stock available in Delhi as on Sunday is more than seven lakh, out of which there are 5.4 lakh Covishield doses and 1.6 Covaxin doses. “If we look at the vaccine stock available with us, at the present speed of vaccination, we have three days of stock left. Even if we add the 50,000 Covishield doses that we received yesterday, then also we only have three days of vaccine stock available,” Atishi said while giving the vaccination bulletin on Sunday. “We were able to vaccinate more than 50% of the 45 and above age group population a long time ago, but since the vaccination of the youth started at a later stage and the vaccine availability was also an issue,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/45-lakh-doses-needed-in-july-to-keep-up-with-present-speed-of-vaccination-atishi/articleshow/83902879.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Pune||ASHA worker walks miles to save villages from virus||PUNE: Health worker Suman Dhebe walks for about eight hours every day to screen the hamlets and lone huts that make up five villages near the Panshet Dam. It's an arduous trek in difficult terrain. With no proper roads, all she has in her favour are some dirt tracks and a bamboo stick. The 45-year-old is one of 48 ASHAs caring for a population of over 55,000 people in Velhe taluka. For nine years, she has been 'Doctor Bai' for pregnant women and babies here in these hills. But Covid-19 has brought about significant risks. In over a year of pandemic duty, she hasn't been able to wear protective clothing. "I can't climb a hill or cross a river in a PPE kit. All I can carry is my stick," Dhebe says. Suman checks blood pressure of a pregnant woman at a tribal hamlet near Pole village in Velhe taluka, 70 km from Pune city.Last July, when two villagers tested positive in Maangaon village, she walked 10 hours daily for days to trace contacts in neighbouring villages. When Shirkoli village reported two cases during the first wave, she walked three hours in rain and crossed swollen streams to screen 219 people living in the surrounding hills. She kept up the checks twice a week for the next three months. For scores, Dhebe was the sole source of information on a new coronavirus. The first time she herself was told about Covid was during a training session for ASHAs last March. "That was also the first time we saw a bottle of hand sanitiser. We were told it's a new disease and asked to check for fever, cough and weakness. We were given gloves, masks and some sanitiser. That day, every ASHA realised this was going to be different." But all of them stepped up. They had had just one day of training, but they quickly improvised, launched large-scale screenings and walked hours to reach remote hamlets. An entire administration's anti-Covid efforts came to rest on their shoulders. Then came the second wave. Dhebe would set off from her home in Pole village (about 50km from Velhe town) at dawn to cover as many homes as possible. She had to make it to every doorstep to ensure the administration was not missing a patient. In May, for example, she walked four hours just to reach three houses on a hillcrest near Velhe. “The situation had become normal until suddenly, the surge hit. When cases were reported in villages near Panshet and Velhe, I spent the next two days visiting every home to tell residents about precautions. The lockdown had already upset many, and people just got more angry when I asked them to stay indoors. But I told them it was the only way to stop the spread," she says as she stops for a drink of water. It took weeks of work, but Dhebe succeeded. None of the five villages assigned to her reported a single case during the second surge. People had listened to 'Doctor Bai'. "These are isolated regions. People will need help," says Dhebe. Her son who works in Pune wants her to move to the city and find another job, but the ASHA says that may never happen. "We get Rs 2,000 per month. But I've been visiting these villages for years and I feel responsible for them. So, I cannot move to the city." Her days end with a few phone calls, made from wherever there's connectivity. She first calls the rural sub-centre to report on the day's screenings, then calls her son and finally, her husband, who comes to the main road near their home to pick her up. Once she's back home, her younger daughter greets her with a splash of hand sanitiser. After a thorough round of hand-washing, she rushes to start dinner before dark in a home that still doesn't have electricity or an approach road. The next day will be another walk along some of Covid's lesser-known frontlines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/asha-worker-walks-miles-to-save-villages-from-virus/articleshow/83902967.cms||Aditya Waikul
---||Delhi||Delhi: Cybercrooks pose as bank executives to hack mail, dupe actor of Rs 3.8 lakh||NEW DELHI: A 65-year-old actor and a former journalist, Sohaila Charnalia — better known as Sohaila Kapur — was duped of around Rs 3.8 lakh by crooks posing as bank executives. An FIR has been filed and police are trying to trace the suspects. “I was defrauded of the money when I called a call centre number of the bank that I had found on Google. The person who answered the call hacked into my phone and bank account and siphoned off the money,” said the victim, who lives in a southeast Delhi locality. In her complaint, the victim said that she was facing problems in paying her credit card dues. She then called the bank’s customer care number she found on the internet. While the “representative” was helping her with the issue, the call got disconnected. She then received a call from a mobile number and the caller claimed to the bank executive. He allegedly hacked into her email by asking her to change its password. Soon, money started getting debited from her account. When the victim saw the alerts, the caller said that her records were being updated. Multiple transactions of Rs 25,000 and two transactions of Rs 9,999 were made to a Paytm wallet. Sensing trouble, Charnalia disconnected and blocked her account. The crook called her back to ask why she had blocked her account and asked her to unblock it so that the money could be refunded. He even sent her her personal details on WhatsApp to make her believe that he was indeed from the bank. However, the victim immediately complained to the bank and police. Charnalia wondered why the bank’s internal systems did not flag the suspicious transactions in real-time. “Why doesn’t the bank check whether fraudulent numbers are listed under its name on the internet? Also, why wasn’t an alarm raised when Rs 50,000 was siphoned off within a minute and over 20 transactions were made in succession? Genuine account holders can only take out a limited amount,” she said. “I’m a senior citizen and almost half of my hard-earned money has been stolen. I want my money back,” added Charnalia. Delhi Police has urged people to dial their helpline — 155260 — and report such frauds immediately. This helpline helps freeze the siphoned off money in the recipient’s account or wallet so that the crooks cannot withdraw it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cybercrooks-pose-as-bank-executives-to-hack-mail-dupe-actor-of-rs-3-8-lakh/articleshow/83902995.cms||---
---||Pune||Work in Covid times makes fringe area homes inviting||PUNE: Work-from-home is poised to enter a state of permanence followed by at least a hybrid model, making homebuyers and real estate observers say that moving to the peripheries of the city, especially in Pune, has greater economic sense despite the infrastructure challenges that they might face. Both work models will be the norm for employees in the information technology and IT-enabled services (ITeS) sector, observers said. Industry estimates indicate up to 4 lakh professionals are working in small and large IT and ITeS firms in and around the city. Most have been renting or buy houses near to their office spaces, primarily at the tech hubs located in the eastern and western parts of the city. With proximity to one’s office no longer a primary consideration, homebuyers, especially new entrants to the market, have the bandwidth to look at more affordable and larger housing options in the outskirts of the city, observers said. “Homebuyer preferences changed perceptibly post-pandemic. The previous ‘walk-to-work’ concept no longer led home buying decisions. Instead, bigger and more affordable properties in greener, less polluted areas are in favour, driven by work-from-home, e-schooling compulsions and safety concerns. Developers quickly changed track and those with land banks in the peripheries, and even otherwise, saw it an opportune time to launch new projects there,” Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock, a property consultant and observer, said. According to data compiled by Anarock, the city’s realtors are also gearing up to service that market. In the 2020-21 fiscal, three out of four launches in the Pune metropolitan area was in the peripheries of the city, the highest proportion among the top seven housing markets in the country. The national market in the peripheral areas also grew, with 58% of all launches in the top seven markets, the four metros, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, happening in the fringes. According to observers, the outermost extents of the city have a lot going for them currently, with lower prices, and infrastructure such as access roads, the proposed ring road, or the Pune Metro, slowly taking shape. Many areas are under the jurisdiction of gram panchayats, though some have been absorbed by the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations. “The fringe areas are more affordable, and have yet to see the price rise seen in the more prime locations in Pune. Those affordable areas include Wagholi, Charholi, Pirangut and among others where a lot of first-time homebuyers are going in. There are issues with social and physical infrastructure, but as more people go into those areas, those will develop. A classic case is that of Wakad, which had next to nothing a decade ago, but has everything that a person needs now,” Paramvir Singh Paul, the Pune branch head of real estate observers Knight Frank, said. Homebuyers also added that water and roads are still teething issues in such areas as are other civic infrastructure issues. “After the slightest of rains, there are huge craters on the access roads here. Despite water connections to our society being sorted recently, tankers are still the sources of survival for many housing societies here. While the garbage issues were taken care of sometime back, they are creeping back once again,” Soumyadeep Roy, a resident of Wagholi, said. Others said affordability is still the primary consideration before homebuyers venturing into the market, and not necessarily the proximity from their workplaces. “There has always been a demand in the peripheral areas, due to land prices being lower, and thus being more affordable for homebuyers. Affordability will always drive demand in housing. Over the past year, people claimed that the market in Tier-III cities will explode because people will be able to work from anywhere, but that has not happened, because CEOs are now saying that the time has come to go back to offices, or at least have a hybrid working solution,” Rohit Gera, managing director of Gera Developments, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/work-in-covid-times-makes-fringe-area-homes-inviting/articleshow/83902960.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Dehradun||Mussoorie tunnel could hit 65% of town’s water supply, dry up springs||MUSSOORIE: A nearly 3-km tunnel running below the hill town and meant to “decongest” it could threaten Mussoorie’s water supply. The Rs 700-crore project, announced by the Centre earlier this month, could affect nine of the 23 springs that feed the town, where summers are already difficult because of water scarcity, and alter the hydrology of the region, experts warned. The proposed tunnel is supposed to connect Cart Mackenzie Road and a point near Kempty Falls, a 2.74-km stretch. “At least nine major springs that are sources of drinking water are located within a 2-3-km radius,” a water department official told TOI. “We fear the impact of the tunnel.” Data accessed by TOI shows the nine springs close to the proposed tunnel route — Jincy, Bhilaru, Kandighat, Khanalti, Bansi, John McKinnon, Under Cliff, Newbie and Chamarkhud — have a daily discharge of over 6 million litres per day, of which over 5 million litres per day is used to supply water to the town. Average water availability in the town is about 7.7 million litres per day, which means these nine springs provide about 65% of the town’s water supply. But during peak summer, demand almost doubles to 14.4 million litres a day, to resolve which a project to pump 6 million litres of water a day from the Yamuna is underway. However, environmentalists are worried the tunnel could exacerbate the scarcity. “The tunnel could affect the underground aquifers (water-bearing rocks which transmit water to springs) which, in turn, could have an impact on the discharge of water from the springs that the town depends on,” said Dr Vikram Gupta, senior scientist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology. The problem could begin right from the construction stage. “Excavation for the tunnel could also hit the catchment of springs. The entire region is fragile and landslide-prone. Landslides could also cut off water sources,” said Reenu Paul, a Dehradun-based environmentalist. Paul had earlier told TOI that this could have ramifications beyond the hill town — disturbing the dolomite rocks in the Mussoorie Ridge, a natural divide between the Ganga and Yamuna river systems, would disturb the entire country’s water system. Even locally, it would affect more than just the town’s water supply. “The springs are critical for local biodiversity and villages located downstream,” said Surabhi Aggarwal, who organises historical walks to many of these springs. Gupta added, “Environmental impact assessment, including a detailed study of the geology and hydrology of the area, must be conducted before moving further. When the project had been announced, the institute had said it had not been consulted on the planned tunnel.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/mussoorie-tunnel-could-hit-65-of-towns-water-supply-dry-up-springs/articleshow/83901012.cms||Anmol Jain

Referring to the professional courses offered by private unaided institutions, Samant told reporters that the autonomous Fees Regulatory Authority (FRA) was the competent body to take a call on such issues either on its own, by way of a hearing process, or by submitting a proposal for reduction in professional course fees which the state shall consider. Samant was in Pune to attend a meeting with senior education department officials and representatives of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). He said, a common entrance test (CET) for admission to professional courses will be held towards the end of July or in August first week. Regulatory bodies like the All India Council for Technical Education have said that the academic year should commence sometime between September 1 and 15, he added. Samant said whether to conduct a CET for admission to non-professional courses in the state will be decided after the Std XII results are declared and mark sheets are distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vcs-meet-today-on-reduction-in-fees-says-edu-minister/articleshow/83902990.cms||---

As more and more economic activities have been allowed as part of the gradual unlock process in the capital, the number of challans has also gone up and the figure for this month stood at nearly 1.3 lakh till Sunday noon, a rise of nearly 66.6%. As per Delhi government’s figures, 35,773 of these challans were issued between June 21 and 26, an average of 5,962 a day. On Sunday, the total count stood at 1,29,493 by the late evening, with the day’s figure at 6,502, the highest in two months. On Saturday, it was 6,210. In the last two weeks, all markets, malls and standalone shops have been allowed and restaurants and bars have opened their doors, too, with 50% capacity. “There have been orders to carry out stringent enforcement drives though the number of Covid-19 cases has been consistently dipping. This is being done keeping in mind the risk of a likely third wave and also the Delta-Plus variant,” a government official said. “Most of the violations are being seen at markets, which see most of the footfall. As the number of people coming out of their houses has increased, so have the violations. Our teams are keeping a close watch at all places where crowding could be happening,” he said. “Teams have also been deployed at major intersections and pedestrian crossroads.” The average number of challans issued last week was 5,090 as against 5,962 this week. The previous week, when shops were allowed to open on odd-even basis, 4,192 challans were issued on average and the week prior to that, when manufacturing units and construction sites were allowed, saw an average of 3,870 challans. Delhi was under lockdown in May, except for May 31 when the unlocking began. The month saw 77,715 challans, a daily average of about 2,507. District authorities say around 250 enforcement teams across the 11 districts have been deployed to keep a hawk eye on those not wearing masks, spitting, not following social distancing to keep the Covid situation under control. The highest number of challans has been issued in South East district this month — 17,988 — followed by North (17,317) and then Shahdara (15,784) and North East (13,417) districts. The lowest count is at South West (6,264). New Delhi saw 8,114 and North West 8,747 challans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-violations-soar-as-city-opens-up-challans-rise-67-this-month/articleshow/83903009.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: RBI lists rules for risk officers in urban co-op banks||MUMBAI: With irregularities increasingly coming to light in the sector, the RBI has asked urban cooperative banks (UCBs) to appoint risk officers. On Friday, RBI issued guidelines for their appointment in line with amendments to the Banking Regulation Act which was amended in September 2020. The NDA government made two key changes—a ban on appointment of MPs, legislators, members of local bodies as whole time directors and secondly, seek appointment of risk officers. In Maharashtra, corruption and irregularities have been unearthed in more than a dozen UCBs, including Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank. Flaws in risk management and sanctioning of loans have come to light. Most directors of the UCBs are found to be either politicians or their kin. But NCP chief Sharad Pawar had opposed the amendment, saying it was an attempt by the BJP to gain control over the cooperative sector. “…urban cooperative banks are gradually getting exposed to greater degree of risks. It is therefore necessary that every urban cooperative bank focusses its attention on putting in place appropriate risk management mechanism commensurate with its business profile and strategic objectives,” RBI said in its order on June 25. Under the rules, UCBs with assets of Rs 5,000 crore or more shall appoint a chief risk officer (CRO). A CRO will have voting powers in the credit sanction process, particularly for high value proposals. All credit products shall be vetted by the CRO for inherent and control risks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rbi-lists-rules-for-risk-officers-in-urban-co-op-banks/articleshow/83905135.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||E-vehicle sales pick pace, 876 sold in Maharashtra this month; 124 in Mumbai||MUMBAI: With more people preferring CNG variants now, the gap between CNG and diesel cars has been reducing, a car dealer said. In 2020-21, Maharashtra saw sales of 10,363 CNG vehicles, compared to 11,785 diesel vehicles. However, when it comes to petrol, despite the huge costs involved, there were 1.43 lakh new petrol-driven vehicles registered in 2020-21. “Those owning fleets of aggregator cabs like Ola and Uber are now purchasing CNG-run sedans instead of diesel. Also, there is a demand for hybrid CNG (petrol-CNG) cars which save operational costs and are good for intra-city drive,” said S K Raut, a car dealer. Nilanjana Bhattacharya, a resident of Thane, said people are frustrated with the rise in petrol and diesel prices. “Recently, I witnessed a huge rush of new CNG cars at the refuelling outlets,” he added. As for electric vehicles, 885 e-vehicles were registered this year between January and March. While there was a lull in sales due to the second wave of Corona in April-May, the registrations picked up pace since the first week of June and a total 124 e-vehicles were registered in Mumbai and 876 across the state this month, a RTO official said. Milind Shinde, an IT professional, said he had spotted a few electric SUVs with green number plates. “They look good, are cheaper to maintain and the overall running costs are very low as compared to petrol and diesel,” he said, adding that he planned to replace his petrol vehicle with an electric car sometime this year. The government, too, is promoting e-vehicles with its new policy under which it will install 1,500 new charging stations across MMR. “We will also give incentives to those purchasing new e-cars, e-autos or e-bikes besides waiver on tax,” an official said. Meanwhile, petrol price hit a new high on Sunday at Parbhani where it is the costliest in Maharashtra at Rs 106.9 per litre. Amravati diesel rate was Rs 97.94 at the HP pumps -- just around Rs 2 short of a century.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/e-vehicle-sales-pick-pace-876-sold-in-state-this-month-124-in-mumbai/articleshow/83905210.cms||Somit Sen

The number of Covid-19 patients who recovered or got discharged in the last 24 hours was 285, more than three times the number of fresh cases. As a result, the number of active Covid cases has gone down to 1,568. The total number of Covid-19 cases this month stood at 7,694 till Sunday, with an average of around 285 cases a day with an overall positivity rate of 0.38% from an average of about 73,170 tests a day. This month has seen 728 Covid-19 fatalities till Sunday, an average of around 27 deaths a day. The numbers are a huge dip from the 2,76,907 Covid-19 cases recorded last month and 4,86,903 cases recorded in April. The number of cases this month has seen a drastic fall from the nearly eight lakh cases seen in the last two months when the capital battled its worst wave of Covid-19. The month of May saw 8,932.5 cases on average daily and a total 8,090 fatalities, with nearly 262 average deaths per day. The month saw an overall positivity rate of 12.87% from around 69,371 average tests per day. April saw a massive 16,230 Covid-19 cases a day on average and a total of 5,120 fatalities, nearly 171 deaths on average a day. Around 85,871 Covid tests were carried out on average a day with an overall positivity rate of 18.90%. April saw the peak of 28,395 Covid-19 cases in a single day, recorded on April 20 and a positivity rate of 36.24% recorded on April 22. The number of people succumbing to the disease has been very high in the months of April and May, with May 3 recording 448 fatalities, the highest in a single day since the outbreak. The situation, however, has improved massively since then, but the Delhi government is not taking any chances keeping in mind the likely risk of a third wave of Covid-19 cases and also the new Delta Plus variant. The new cases recorded on Sunday were from 74,198 tests, including 54,297 RT-PCR and 19,901 via rapid antigen tests. The capital also recorded four Covid-19 fatalities on Sunday, taking the toll to 24,965, with a case Fatality Rate of 1.74%. The number of patients recuperating in home isolation as on Sunday is 478, down from 600 last Sunday. A total 989 patients are admitted in hospitals and out of the total 23,692 hospital beds, 22,703 are vacant. Out of the total 6,635 Covid ICU beds in Delhi, 6,104 were vacant at 10 pm on Sunday, according to the Delhi government’s online Corona dashboard, including 2,107 vacant ICU beds with ventilators out of a total 2,503.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/7694-cases-added-to-tally-in-june-april-had-4-8-lakh/articleshow/83903048.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The project has been started in association with ITC’s Well-being Out of Waste (WOW) initiative. SDMC has started the project in 10 neighbourhoods. People who have already been composting for a long time and are ready to help their neighbours take the plunge into the world of composting will be called buddies. The buddies will spread the importance of composting of organic wet waste from households at source and thereby reducing the waste that reaches landfills. “Each colony is required to select their buddy for coordination with residents and SDMC. The buddy, who is well informed about composting, will clear any doubts,” said an SDMC official. “After explaining the process to residents through online training in selected colonies, the corporation will provide 10 sample composting kits for free to each colony. The initiative has been taken by deputy commissioner, south zone Sonal Swaroop in collaboration with ITC WOW as a technical partner.” The compost kit contains two bins, coco peat and microbial solution. The staff will also review results after some time. SDMC claimed to have completed the first phase of the programme by conducting online introductory sessions in 10 colonies. Under the second phase, the project was kick started at six colonies including Neeti Bagh, Anand Niketan, GK-2, Saket, Neeti Bagh and Chittaranjan Park. “Initially, 100 households have started doing composting at home and eventually half a dozen residents start joining the initiative every day in these colonies. To get more support, we are even organising awareness campaigns for participation from most households through online sessions on how to do home composting using kits during the lockdown period,” said SDMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/buddies-to-help-houses-get-started-with-composting/articleshow/83903057.cms||---

The ward is located around 40km away from Quepem town. The bus was flagged off on Thursday by deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar in the presence of Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar. Sans public transport since Goa’s liberation, it was only a few years ago that one private bus started plying the route, making just one trip a day. Tucked away in a remote corner of Quepem taluka, nine km away from the main village, locals had been facing tremendous hardship for the past 15 months after the bus services to the area was stopped after the lockdown was imposed in the state. Interestingly, though Mangal is located about 9km beyond the Neturlim panchayat, due to delimitation, it comes under the jurisdiction of Cavrem-Pirla panchayat, over 18km away. To add to the woes of the villagers, the nearest fair price shop is located at Sulcorna, around 15km away from the village. “The villagers have suffered a lot during the lockdown. Since the withdrawal of the private bus service, they had to resort to walking through the forest area to collect their quote of ration from the fair price shop at Sulcorna,” Goankar said at the ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-15-months-wait-quepems-tribal-village-finally-gets-public-transport-service/articleshow/83905459.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Submit tenants’ details, cops urge Salt Lake homeowners||KOLKATA: The Bidhannagar police on Sunday sought cooperation from the residents of Salt Lake and requested them to submit the details of tenants and paying guests staying in rented accommodations and guest houses. A meeting between the cops and the representatives of nine block committees in Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty’s own ward (29) was held at the BJ Block community hall on Sunday. Several security issues were discussed at the meeting. Chakraborty said that the initiative was taken from her ward while other wards in Salt Lake would also hold such meetings soon. “There are several houses where elderly people live alone. So, there should be a robust security arrangement for them. There is a need to check who are coming and living in the guest houses and we are urging the residents to submit the Aadhaar card and other related documents of the tenants and paying guests with the police and BMC,” said Chakraborty. Cops said that there have been some lapses in security issues on the part of resident welfare associations as was noticed during the probe into Sukhobristi shootout case. “We are sending forms and requesting residents to submit with us the detail information about the tenants and paying guests. To identify a suspected criminal, we need proper information. This will not be possible for us without the cooperation of the residents,” said Bidhannagar police commissioner Supratim Sarkar. BMC officials said that several such guest houses have come up in Salt Lake without informing the civic authorities who are in the dark regarding how many such guest houses are operating without trade licence. The representatives of block committees, who attended the meeting, said that despite the guest house menace in Salt Lake increasing day by day, no significant step has been taken so far to keep the rented accommodations under scanner. They also said that the incident at Shukhobristi housing in New Town was an eye opener for Salt Lake residents as one of the guest houses at CL block was raided by cops recently in connection with the case. “The administration needs to check and have strict vigilance on every guest house. If the guest house is not commercial or does not have valid documents, it should be shut,” one of the residents suggested. Other issues that were discussed at the meeting included the need to keep tabs on the parks in the township to curb anti-social activities. “Apart from the guest houses, another concern is illegal parking. Since the Sector V Metro station is set to be one of the busiest stations in the near future, there should be a permanent police kiosk for the help and safety of the residents of DL, CL and BL blocks,” said CK-CL block committee assistant secretary Dipankar Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/submit-tenants-details-cops-urge-salt-lake-homeowners/articleshow/83903139.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Land of the rising Zen||AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Zen Garden and Kaizen Academy at the Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) via a video-conference on Sunday. The PM said that these facilities will be the symbols of the growing friendship and co-operation between the people and governments of India and Japan. Mod said that during these trying times of the pandemic, the Indo-Japan friendship, under the leadership of Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, has become even more important for global stability and prosperity. Current challenges demand that the friendship and partnership be further strengthened, the PM said. He praised the Indo-Japan Friendship Association, Gujarat, for infusing the ties with new energy.  Pointing to the similarities between ‘Zen’ and the Indian concept of ‘Dhyan’, the PM dwelt on the two cultures’ emphasis on inner peace as well as on progress and growth in everyday life. “Indians will find the glimpse of the same peace, poise, and simplicity in this Zen Garden which they have experienced in yoga through the ages,” the PM said. He said that kaizen entails not just ‘improvement’ but ‘continuous improvement’. Outlining his vision for making Gujarat a “Mini Japan”, the PM said that he was satisfied to see the confidence that Japan has reposed in Gujarat and in the power of its people. “About 135 Japanese companies operate in Gujarat, in sectors including automobile, banking, construction, and pharma. These companies are also imparting skills to the youth of Gujarat,” he said. Tax guru Mukesh Patel, who has been instrumental in the creation of the Zen Garden and the Kaizen Academy, said that the facilities represent the growing friendship between India and Japan. He said that over the years, more than 1,000 trainees who learnt Japanese at the AMA have been posted in Japanese companies operating in Gujarat and other parts of India. Others who spoke during the inauguration included Toshido Ido, the governor of Hyogo; deputy CM Nitin Patel; ambassador of Japan to India Satoshi Suzuki; and Indian ambassador to Japan Sanjay Kumar Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-land-of-the-rising-zen/articleshow/83905298.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||‘Monitor air quality at care centres to find mucor source’||HYDERABAD: A multi-city study on mucormycosis by researchers from across India, including Hyderabad, has called for monitoring of air quality in hospitals, particularly ICUs and Covid-19 care centres, to find out the source of the black fungus. The mortality rate among patients with black fungus infection was 14%, much higher than that of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus). The reason behind the sudden spurt in mucormycosis cases in the country during the second wave of Covid-19 is not clear yet with scientists postulating theories linking the black fungus infection in Covid-19 patients to use of medical oxygen from industrial oxygen plants, steroids, diabetes and hypertension. None of them has been scientifically proved as Covid-19 patients, who were not on oxygen or steroid support, too developed black fungus. Cases were also reported from non-diabetic patients. With the cause behind the black fungus in Covid-19 patients still eluding a scientific backing, researchers, including those from five hospitals in Hyderabad, have now suggested that air quality surveillance of hospitals be carried out. The Hyderabad team was drawn from Sarojini Eye Hospital, Centre for Sight, Apollo Cancer Hospital, Mamata Academy of Medical Sciences, Citi Neuro Centre and Virinchi Hospital. As part of the observational study of patients with Covid-19 associated mucormycosis managed or co-managed by ophthalmologists in India, the researchers scoured through data between January 1, 2020 and May 26, 2021. Though mucormycosis was present in the first wave, it took the centrestage of infection in the ongoing second wave with both Telugu states reporting about 4,000 cases so far. The researchers said in the absence of diabetes, corticosteroids, and hospitalisation, the risk of acquiring mucormycosis was rare. Future studies should address the issue of healthcare-associated mucormycosis, including breach in aseptic precautions during hospitalisation and air quality control in hospitals as potential risk factors. However, the team noted that corticosteroids and diabetes were the most important predisposing factors in the development of Covid-19-associated mucormycosis. “Covid-19 associated mucormycosis needs to be tackled as aggressively as the disease itself with a concerted effort from multidisciplinary medical teams and the government. Accepting the facts that Indians inherently have a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, the tropical climate predisposes to mucormycosis. Moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 will need corticosteroids for life salvage, we can expect to continue to see mucormycosis in the days to come,” the researchers said in their study published in ‘The Indian Journal of Ophthalmology’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/monitor-air-quality-at-care-centres-to-find-mucor-source/articleshow/83905261.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Registering and Licensing Authority earns Rs 28 lakh from 99 vehicle numbers||CHANDIGARH: The Registering and Licensing Authority (RLA) of the UT administration has earned over Rs 28 lakh by auctioning 99 left-out vehicle registration numbers of previous series, a record of sorts if the amount is considered. The RLA had advertised around 250 numbers. People had first registered themselves and then participated in the auction. As the left-out fancy numbers were in good quantity, the RLA had put all of them in a single auction to attract maximum bidders. Earlier, the authority had given a week to bidders to register themselves. Three days of the last week were kept for the auction. It was an e-auction like previous ones. The owner of the vehicle had to register on national transport website: https://vahan.parivahan.gov.in/fancy and the link of the same was available on the administration’s transport department website: ww.chadtransport.gov.in. The owner of a vehicle purchased at Chandigarh address was only allowed to participate in e-auction. The auction of fancy registration numbers of vehicles is one of the key mediums to generate revenue for the administration. The RLA focuses on securing a good amount by advertising the auction to ensure maximum participation. Last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the RLA failed to fetch a good amount. The RLA was recently opened for limited services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rla-earns-rs-28l-from-99-vehicle-numbers/articleshow/83901042.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Kolkata||IPS and supercop-on-screen pens crime thriller on Covid||KOLKATA: An IPS officer, known for his portrayal of a supercop in a popular Bengali serial, has written a crime thriller in the backdrop of the pandemic. According to him, the absence of post-mortem in suspected Covid deaths has left room for criminals anywhere in the world to get away with cold-blooded murder. This story, ‘Covid 19’ — which is set in Europe — is being adapted into a film. Cops acting in Tollywood are not new. But Prasun Banerjee is perhaps the first IPS officer to be playing a cop in a Bengali megaserial on a regular basis. Way back in 2007, Banerjee had attended a three-month-long training by the United Nations in Italy. “When the pandemic was at its peak in Italy, I saw the shocking visuals of bodies piled up outside the hospitals since the morgues were full. An Italian cop friend told me that the health infrastructure there had completely collapsed. No post-mortem was being conducted on the deceased because of the sheer high death toll,” said the DIG, Barasat Range. As a cop, Banerjee has been aware that every unnatural death needs a post-mortem. “Fear is the key in the case of Covid. Anywhere in the world, there is a chance that a murderer can dispose of a body as a Covid suspect. Nobody will touch it due to the fear of contamination. So, the pandemic provides an opportunity for killers to settle scores this way,” Banerjee added. He began writing his story after his conversation with the Italian cop in 2020. “If there is no post-mortem, a case can’t even be treated as murder. I thought this is the ideal time to set a revenge drama. Though my story is set in Europe, we will film it in Kolkata. Computer graphics will take care of the rest,” he added. Subrata Sen, who will be directing the film, is “fascinated” by the script. “I think he could come up with such a story only because of his police background. I am planning to begin the shooting next month,” said Sen. Before the work on the film begins, Banerjee is busy shooting as IPS officer Avimanyu Dasgupta for ‘Desher Mati “The makers, Saibal Banerjee and Leena Gangopadhyay, have been kind enough to adjust to my timings. I usually shoot once a week after 5.30pm,” he said. Only once did he have to cancel a shooting after he had to rush out following a major accident on the Barasat highway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ips-and-supercop-on-screen-pens-crime-thriller-on-covid/articleshow/83903140.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Doctors flooded with absurd requests from restless locals||HYDERABAD: With lockdown restrictions being lifted, doctors in the city are now concerned with the barrage of absurd requests coming their way from patients and others. These requests range from patients wanting to set their arbitrary recovery deadlines to permissions to use certain steroids they think will hasten their recovery. Most of these requests come from people who state they have family functions or marriages to attend and want to cured by that time. “Sometimes they ask for steroids and medicines that are written on social media. They come to hospitals and tell doctors what medicines to prescribe. Many don’t understand recovery from infection and being free from virus are different and is not in our hands,” said Dr Munigela Apoorva, consultant internal medicine specialist at AIG Hospitals. Associate professor at the Government General Hospital, Nizamabad, Dr Kiran Madala said that some patients also have “blind faith in their immunity.” He said that a young patient admitted in the hospital had died after constantly refusing to follow protocol. Doctors said that despite multiple advisories being issued, many are still removing their masks while talking or touching it constantly. “Some argue with us that is not unsafe to remove the mask while speaking as they exhale when they speak instead of inhaling and hence the virus cannot enter their nose or mouth. Such notions have no scientific backing and these commonsensical errors will cost them,” said Dr Y Sridhar, critical care consultant at Apollo Hospitals. “Some of them have this notion they can face the third wave as they know the ‘tricks’.” Dr Sridhar said that despite the times, many tipplers are still adamant on going for drinks with their friends. Some of them have asked doctors if they can get a jab on a particular day as they have a party in the evening. “It is the same thing with smoking too. Avoiding drinks for a day or two is good,” the doctor said. Among other concerns is that in fear of contracting infection, many are getting tested multiple times. “Even if doctors rule out the infection, many don’t listen (and get tested). It is almost like a phobia,” said the manager of a city diagnostic centre. He said that going for too many tests means interacting with many people hence becoming more exposed to the risk of infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/docs-flooded-with-absurd-requests-from-restless-locals/articleshow/83905286.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The SEC told the Congress in a written response that the final ward boundaries will be published after considering the feedbacks. In a written reply to Congress corporator Ravi Raja, who is the opposition leader in the BMC, SEC deputy commissioner Avinash Sanas has said that the draft ward boundaries will be published in the government gazette and suggestions and objections will be called on them. “The suggestions and objections will be examined and the final ward boundaries will be published. Once the draft ward boundaries are published, and suggestions and objections are called, then the same should be filed,” Sanas said to Raja in a letter last week. Raja had alleged that ahead of the 2017 BMC polls, the BJP-led state government had directed that ward boundaries be changed to help the BJP’s candidates. “In 2017, the then state changed electoral wards which favoured BJP in at least 40 to 50 constituencies. This was unfair,” Raja wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-polls-draft-boundaries-of-electoral-wards-to-be-out-soon/articleshow/83905333.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Extra weight to English in CET: Vernacular SSC schools||MUMBAI: Students of non-English medium schools are upset over the state giving weightage to English over other languages for the common entrance test (CET) for junior college admission. The CET for class X students across education boards is expected to be held in July or August. It is an optional paper. of two-hour duration. The 100 marks multiple choice questions will have 25 questions each from Secondary School Certificate (SSC) English, mathematics, science and social science syllabus. Schools with medium of instruction in Marathi, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati and other languages feel that the English language questions will be tough for their students. English is the second language in these schools. Teachers and principals said the 25 marks should be allotted to the first language, be it English, Marathi or any other language. “In the MHT-CET for admission to engineering and pharmacy courses, students can choose English, Marathi or Urdu for papers 2 and 3,” said the headmaster. of a school. Paper 1 is the maths which is in English. The state education board has details of students’ medium of education. Based on the data, CET papers should have all the first languages, said Anil Bhavsar, principal of Dnyanmandir Marathi medium school, Powai. While students from non-English language schools are preparing for the CET, some said that a decision on appearing for the exam will depend on their SSC results. “The English questions can bring down my CET scores. I would rather see my SSC results and then decide on the entrance test,” said a student from a Gujarati medium school. Officials of the state education board said that the English language has been chosen since the CET will be taken by students of all boards. Officials said that the English questions based on grammar can be taken by students studying any language. For maths, science and social science (SSC syllabus) too, as the concepts are similar, students of all boards will be able to crack it, said an official. For the SSC exam that was cancelled in April due to the Covid surge, 14 lakh students had registered. For CET, the number may not be huge. Students of CBSE, CISCE are worried about the SSC syllabus in CET. Principals, however, said concepts are the same for all class X students. “In case of English too questions will be drafted keeping students of all language mediums in mind,” said the principal of an English school in Chembur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/extra-weight-to-eng-in-cet-vernacular-ssc-schools/articleshow/83905368.cms||Sandhya Nair

The weekend rush in Mussoorie led to a large influx of tourists from Delhi-NCR, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh resulting in long traffic jams on Saturday evening as well as on Sunday. The hotels reported almost full occupancy. “It is good to see the rush. We had nearly 100% occupancy on Saturday and around 70% on Sunday,” said Sanjay Aggarwal, secretary of Mussoorie Hotels Association. "There were long traffic jams on Gandhi Chowk in Landour and at Picture Palace. Both tourists and locals were stuck in traffic jams," complained a local resident. Police officials said that considering the weekend rush, additional police force had been deployed to man the traffic, 90 wrongly parked vehicles were challaned and several persons were fined for violating social distancing norms. For the second consecutive weekend, thousands of tourists also flocked to Nainital. Every famous tourist spot like Mall Road, Band Stand, Pant Park and Tibetan market were brimming with tourists and the pleasant weather made many opt for boating on Naini Lake. Locals said that for the first time since March-end, they have seen tourists in such high numbers. “Even last week, most of the tourist spots were full but this weekend, the number has increased substantially. Throughout the day, dozens of boats were dotting the Naini Lake while every restaurant saw a large queue and several hotels were full,” said a resident. The tourists meanwhile also said that they had been waiting for months to visit the hill stations. “The intermittent rains and the pleasant weather have only added to our joy. We had been waiting to visit Nainital since April. However, we wish that the restaurants allowed people to dine in as it is difficult to eat while walking,” said Prithijit Roy, a tourist from Kolkata. However, some of the locals also complained that many tourists were flouting the Covid norms and were not even wearing masks properly. “We understand that tourism is the backbone of the town but many places like the Mall Road got overcrowded and people were not even wearing masks properly,” said Ranjit Sinha, a local.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/high-tourist-footfall-in-hills-traffic-jams-in-mussoorie/articleshow/83901211.cms||Anmol Jain

Several interesting suggestions have come up such as imposing a fine of Rs 10,000 on those individuals who make a false allegation against a private school. Parents should be given an option to pay their child’s fee in multiple instalments, others pointed out. The draft for the Fee Act has been made after studying the acts implemented in Hindi-speaking areas of the country. The suggestions of district administrations of Uttarakhand were also considered. The private schools have made several demands to form the act in such a way that it doesn’t create a hostile environment for them to operate their education business. “I have asked my officials to come up with a draft for the Fee Act which can be accepted by all the stakeholders. We don’t want to create a hostile business environment for the private schools where they would have to take permission from the government officer for every other school-related thing and eventually creating a situation in which they [private schools’ owners] start leaving the state,” said R Meenakshi Sundaram, state education secretary. Notably, there are around 6,000 private schools in the state in which more than 13 lakh students are enrolled. Earlier, the state education minister Arvind Pandey had said the "new Fee Act" will be implemented from this academic session, but it looks unlikely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/education-dept-finalises-draft-on-fee-act-after-stakeholders-suggestions/articleshow/83901197.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Amritsar||Punjab: Posters announce ex-IG Kunwar Vijay’s entry into AAP||BATHINDA: In a season of putting up posters and banners, especially those of faction-ridden Congress leaders, including those of chief minister Amarinder Singh, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Partap Singh Bajwa, the posters of retired inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who was recently inducted into AAP, are the latest addition in the highly charged-up political scenario. The posters point towards Kunwar Vijay joining the AAP and have bigger pictures of party’s national convener and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Kunwar Vijay besides smaller pictures of party’s Punjab convener and MP Bhagwant Mann and leader of opposition in state assembly Harpal Singh Cheema. His posters are not limited only to his hometown of Amritsar, but have been put up at various places in Punjab. The way Kejriwal reached Amritsar to induct Kunwar Vijay Pratap in AAP, the party seems to be trying to make it a bigger issue and banking on it to get emotional benefit of the investigations carried out by Kunwar in Kotkapura, Behbal Kalan cases (even though Kotkapura investigation was quashed by court). The posters point towards expected big role for him in the party, says political watchers. As Faridkot has remained the nerve centre of sacrilege and related police firing cases in October 2015 and Kunwar Vijay Pratap had spent a lot of time in the past in Faridkot area while making investigations as a senior member of Special Investigations Team (SIT), he is learnt to have a lot of clout in the area and a lot of followers, who had even found fault in the court, which had quashed the investigations in Kotkapura case. The party wanted to cash in on that goodwill, said a party leader. AAP Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said, “Kunwar Vijay Pratap has a clean image and honestly completed his service in the police force. He will prove to be an asset for the party”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/posters-announce-ex-ig-kunwars-entry-into-aap/articleshow/83903326.cms||Neel Kamal

The cops said they were informed of the incident around 8pm on Saturday, after which they rushed to the residence. The police said both the mother and daughter, who herself looked severely ill and was likely suffering from mental disability, were taken to the hospital, where doctors declared the senior citizen, Krishna Das, brought dead. After returning to her residence, her daughter Soma has so far refused to meet any of her relatives. The incident has left local residents in shock, since they tried to help the family earlier this month. The incident came to light after foul smell began coming from the house on Saturday afternoon. Police received information from the locals about the smell and an elderly woman was found in an unconscious state in her house. “When we entered the house, we found the elderly woman unconscious and smell coming from the body. An unnatural death case has been initiated. It seems the woman had died several hours earlier. We are ascertaining the exact time of death after conducting the post-mortem as rigor mortis had set in,” said DC (ESD) Priyabrata Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/body-lies-at-home-for-over-72-hours/articleshow/83903335.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Second wave’s ‘thick tail’ in Maharashtra, Mumbai a worry||MUMBAI: The Covid-19 graph in Maharashtra has hit a plateau in the last two weeks with daily detections oscillating between 8,000 and 10,000 cases and the all-test positivity hovering around 5%. The situation is similar in Mumbai: The positivity rate—for both RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests—has been less than 3% and cases haven’t increased beyond 900 in the last fortnight. The worry is if the second wave graph will dip any further in Maharashtra. While Delhi’s cases dropped from 25,000-plus a day to 76 on June 26, the decline in Mumbai and Maharashtra again appears stuck with a “thick tail”, just as it did during the first wave. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of the state health department, told TOI, “We are close to the baseline of the second wave.” A senior Mantralaya official admitted there is widespread concern about the daily cases stagnating between 8,000 and 10,000. “Most states, which saw a severe second wave such as Delhi and Karnataka, report low detections now. Why not in Maharashtra?” he asked. In Mumbai, too, senior doctors believe the local numbers won’t dip below 600 cases a day. “Even if they do, it would be for a few days in between,” said a BMC doctor. During the end of the first wave in December 2020-January, cases dropped to 300-plus on a couple of days before the second wave’s rise began in late February. The reasons for the “thick tail”, according to experts, are not too clear. It could range from accurate reporting of Covid data to the size of the state to the density of the population. One of the theories discussed in the Mantralaya is the different “peaking time” for different districts in Maharashtra. Districts in Vidarbha were the first to report a surge in the second wave in February before the wave spread to the other districts. “When cases in the first-hit districts reached a plateau, cases in others began to peak,” said a senior official. At present, he added, six districts seem to be in the midst of a peak. “Kolhapur, Sangli, Sindhudurg and Osmanabad account for 60% of the daily cases reported in Maharashtra now,” he added. The reasons for the “thick tail” in Mumbai could be a mix of more testing, better reporting and population density. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “It could be due to our huge population density or the floating population.” Statistics released by the Western Railway show that 28 lakh people returned to Maharashtra, including 7.8 lakh people to Mumbai, in the May-June period. A doctor from a government-run hospital provides a statistical answer based on the average number of tests conducted in Maharashtra daily. “We conduct roughly 2.5 lakh tests daily. Given our population size and failure of people to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour, one can presume that we will at least witness a 2% positivity daily. This works out to 5,000 cases on the best day which hasn’t yet come,” he said. The lowest daily caseload during the first wave was 1,842 on January 25, but the number of daily tests at that time was around a third of the present count.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/2nd-waves-thick-tail-in-maha-city-a-worry/articleshow/83907055.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Hyderabad||Rains lash Hyderabad, many areas flooded||HYDERABAD: After a hiatus of a few days, heavy rains of up to 91 mm lashed parts of the city leaving many areas waterlogged and plunged into darkness on Sunday. The southwest monsoon was slightly weak for the past few days across Telangana. However, on Sunday, the rainfall made a comeback with cloud bands entering from the northern parts of the city and covering the entire city by the evening hours. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures, up to 7 pm, Tarnaka recorded highest rainfall of 91.8 mm followed by 83 mm at Madhusudan Nagar in Malkajgiri and 82.5 mm at Osmania University among others. The heavy rainfall led to waterlogging in many areas such as Tarnaka, Punjagutta, Lalapet and Tolichowki among others. Water entered a few houses and cellars in Tarnaka, Lalapet, Karthikeya Nagar, Nacharam and neighbouring areas and also damaged a few vehicles that were partially submerged. “This is the first rain of the season and as usual our colony is flooded with almost four feet of drain water,” tweeted Vinod Kumar, a resident of Padma Colony, Nallakunta. Deputy mayor M Srilatha Shobhan Reddy visited rain-hit areas in Tarnaka division at Manikeshwari Nagar, Lalapet, Tarnaka and other colonies and instructed officials to clear water stagnation points. The disaster relief teams were activated at Punjagutta, Tolichowki and other areas to clear water stagnation. The heavy downpour also plunged many areas into darkness for a brief period. “As soon as it started raining, the power supply to our area was interrupted. If this is the kind of supply we get just at the beginning of monsoon, I wonder what would happen at the peak of it,” said Ravi Kumar, a resident of Punjagutta. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Telangana will continue to witness light to moderate rains, at times heavy, for the next few days. “A cyclonic circulation that lies over south Odisha and neighbourhood has moved towards coastal AP and its neighbourhood. Under its influence, Telangana will experience wide spread rainfall for the next few days. The minimum temperature is likely to drop by two to three degree Celsius,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rains-lash-city-many-areas-flooded/articleshow/83901205.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Post-Covid complications impact life of recovered||HYDERABAD: For Covid-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms, the fight against disease doesn’t end with a discharge from the hospital or a negative report of the virus. In most of these cases, doctors say the fight continues for several weeks as many continue to suffer with chest discomfort, breathlessness and an increased levels of stress hormone, cortisol, post recovery. “Currently, we are seeing more of post-Covid patients coming with breathing difficulty apart from generalised weakness, headache and sleeplessness. Breathlessness in Covid-19 recovered patients is mainly caused due to post-Covid lung fibrosis, viral triggered allergic bronchitis or anxiety hyperventilation syndrome,” said Dr V V Ramana Prasad, consultant pulmonologist, KIMS Hospital. “People are experiencing anxiety, stress and fear. There will be no breathing difficulty when they are sleeping, sitting or walking but they will suddenly feel like there is some vacuum in their chest which will make them want to take deep breaths through their mouth to fill that vacuum. If that continues for a long time, they will get tingling and numbness around their cheeks, fingers and lips due to hyperventilation. During that process, there will be loss of carbon dioxide and calcium,” said Dr Prasad. While 30%-40% of patients come with lung fibrosis, doctors said that about 40%-50% of them have viral triggered allergic bronchitis or bronchospasm which mimics asthma and 10%-20% of patients recovered from Covid-19 will have anxiety hyperventilation syndrome. “We are seeing a significant increase in people suffering from post-Covid symptoms related to stress and anxiety. Some of them are landing in depression and PTSD,” said Dr Y Srinivas, professor and HOD, psychiatry, Kakatiya Medical College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/post-covid-complications-impact-life-of-recovered/articleshow/83905429.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Two months after Virar hospital fire, kin await Rs 2L relief from PM||MUMBAI: Two months after the fire in a Virar hospital killed 15 and injured three Covid patients, their families are waiting for compensation promised by the Centre. The fire was in the second floor ICU of Vijay Vallabh hospital on April 23. Two doctors were arrested for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Additional public prosecutor Jayprakash Patil had said that the negligence of the hospital was brought on record. Prime minister Narendra Modi had tweeted on April 23 that an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) would be given to kin of those dead and Rs 50,000 to the injured. Families have taken to social media urging the Centre to release the money. “The loss of our dear ones can never be overcome. At least help families who are in dire need of money,” said Ajita Goda, whose father Pravin (65) was among those killed. While the state early this month released Rs 5 lakh compensation to the kin of those killed, Rs 1 lakh promised to those injured is still awaited. “I am in dire need of money as my finances are drying up,” said Subha Das (39). He escaped as his bed was closest to the exit. “The Centre and state should release the promised compensation to help me continue with my treatment,” said Das, a butler.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-months-after-virar-hosp-fire-kin-await-rs-2l-relief-from-pm/articleshow/83905409.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Delhi||Delhi: 50 guests too less, say big banquet hall owners over DDMA's new unlock guidelines||NEW DELHI: The rush to cancel wedding venue bookings has come down with Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) allowing 50 guests at these ceremonies from Monday, say representatives of the wedding and banquet associations in the city. While the majority has welcomed the Saturday order, several banquet and wedding venue operators have suggested that the number of guests should depend on the size of a venue. They argue that several banquets and wedding venues are big enough to accommodate around 2,000 people at a time and allowing only 50 guests won’t be justified. “We are thankful to the lieutenant governor and the chief minister for finally considering our plea and increasing the number of guests,” said Rajeev Jain of Event and Entertainment Management Association (EEMA). “After the order, customers who had made bookings four-five months ago are finally convinced to hold functions. But it is surprising that the order doesn’t specify any formula for allowing the number of guests depending on space,” he added. The industry has suggested allowing guests at 3 square metre per person at a venue, said Prerana Aggarwal Saxena, vice-president (north India) of EEMA and founder of a wedding planner and designer company. Considering that some venues have huge space and owners will have to decorate the entire venue, “it would be better if some liberty is granted to increase the number of guests”, she added. “The owners of hotels, banquets and marriage halls will anyway strictly adhere to the Covid guidelines as they don’t want their losses to continue.” Banquets and wedding halls owners said that after the weddings scheduled from July 1 to 18, the next auspicious dates would be in November. “Many impatient hosts have already cancelled their bookings as they were trying their luck in NCR areas,” said Vijay Arora, Venue Operators Management Association (VOMA). “We would request the authorities to allow us to use at least 25% of the capacity of a hall. Otherwise we would incur huge costs on running airconditioning, doing lightings and arranging other facilities just for 50 people.” There has also been a demand to allow corporate events. “The Saturday order has specified that the banquets can be used only for holding marriages. But permission should be given to hold office events and workshops, even if at a small scale and with limited entries,” said Jain. “Thousands of people are associated with this hotel, event and wedding industry and they all want to be out of crisis now,” he emphasised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/50-guests-too-less-say-big-banquet-hall-owners/articleshow/83903367.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Madurai||Madras HC upholds 10 years rigorous imprisonment for man who sexually assaulted minor||MADURAI: Observing that sexual assault of a girl child is the most heinous, barbaric and savage act, Madras high court upheld the conviction and sentence awarded to a man by a trial court in a case in which he sexually assaulted a minor girl in Pudukottai in 2010. The court was hearing the criminal appeal filed by the accused challenging the order of the Pudukottai mahila court which had convicted and sentenced him to 10 years rigorous imprisonment in 2016. The man had sexually assaulted the girl when her parents had gone to attend a condolence meeting. Justice K Murali Shankar observed that the right of the girl child is always at peril. Despite stringent laws and punishment, it is shocking and disturbing to note the increase in the number of cases where children are sexually assaulted by known people. Such brutal acts create a deep impact in the minds of the child, traumatising her for a long period or her entire life, affecting her physically as well as psychologically. The judge observed that the accused/appellant deserves stringent punishment and that awarded by the trial court cannot be found fault with. On considering the entire evidence, the trial court had found the accused guilty for offence under Section 376(2)(i) of IPC, which this court is in complete agreement with. Hence the judge dismissed the appeal and confirmed the conviction and sentence. The judge also directed the trial court to take necessary steps to secure the accused to undergo the remaining period of sentence, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-10-years-ri-for-man-who-sexually-assaulted-minor/articleshow/83903357.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Anirudh Chaoji’s book an anecdotal info from forests||NAGPUR: A collection of anecdotal information, right from the hinterland of forests, ‘Wild by Nature’, compiled by Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) Conservation Foundation biologist Anirudh Chaogi, was launched by PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar on Sunday. The book launch was held at Laburnum Hall, Chitnavis Centre. Speaking about the book, Chaoji said, “The book is a product of four years of weekly nature bytes about a variety of wildlife species which were read by forest guides and nature lovers. We took it to the next level by compiling these bytes into a book and added photographs in it.” Kakodkar engaged in a QnA session with the audience where he also shared his experiences in the forest. When asked about the commercialization of forest areas, Kakodkar said, “We should look at its advantages as well. The revenue generated is used for staff welfare, protection and development of surrounding village areas. Tourism is always subservient to conservation. There is growing enthusiasm among tourists to explore the forest and the wildlife it shelters.” About protected areas, he said, “One-sixth of the forest area in the state comes under protected areas like sanctuaries, national parks, tiger reserves, etc. New species of plants, reptiles, amphibians and other flora and fauna have been found on a large scale in these areas.” Appreciating the efforts of Maharashtra government and forest department, Kakodkar said, “Stories revolving around tigers catch the public eye but the steps taken by state government and forest department for conservation of mangroves, coastal biodiversity, rusty spotted cat, etc are unmatched. Maharashtra was the first state to declare a state butterfly. This signifies that authorities are focusing on endangered species and creating awareness.” Kakodkar stressed on the need to spread awareness regarding wildlife among the students in Nagpur. “There are organizations that conduct nature camps. These camps are also a source of livelihood for people. In Nagpur, it is somehow lacking. Such initiatives should be encouraged in the city to inculcate interest in students about the forest ecosystem.” The book has been designed by Anirudh Ghosh and published by Ran Mangli Foundation. Chaoji spoke about the works of Ran Mangli Foundation like animal, medical and eye camps for forest-neighbouring communities.

---||Madurai||Madras HC orders posting for jail warder candidate||MADURAI: Madras high court has directed the state to appoint a candidate to the post of grade II jail warder saying he had no intention to suppress the registration of criminal case against him and that the case itself was closed as a mistake of fact in a few days. Appellant R Arulraj’s application for the post of grade II jail warder was rejected by Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) in 2018 on the ground that he had suppressed the fact about a case registered against him in 2016 by Petta police in Tirunelveli district. When he filed a petition challenging the order, the matter was clubbed with a batch of cases and the single judge dismissed them by a common order in 2019. Challenging the order, he had filed the present appeal before HC Madurai bench. A division bench of Justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that the factual matter in the case on hand is quite different from the other cases. The judges observed that within three days of the registration of FIR, the case was closed as a mistake of fact. In the absence of any material, it has to be considered that there was no intention on his part for suppression. Also, a government instruction says that whenever FIR has been registered and closed as a mistake of fact, the benefit should be granted to the applicant for recruitment to any uniformed services. Hence, the judges set aside the single judge’s order and directed the state to appoint the appellant to the post of grade II jail warder within eight weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-posting-for-jail-warder-candidate/articleshow/83903364.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Transport woes may intensify as contract carriage operators demand rise in fare||KOLKATA: Transport woes are likely to intensify from Monday, with contract carriage refusing to ferry passengers at the rate mutually decided on June 15. Contract carriage operators now demand hefty rise in the fare because of substantial rise in fuel prices. But commuters found such demands unreasonable. “The contract carriage, which seven of us have booked since June 16, refused to ferry us to our workplaces and from there to our homes, citing rises in diesel and petrol prices. The operator has demanded a hefty raise, which we refused. We could not organise alternative arrangements and had to miss our workplaces,” said Sagar Dutta Roy, an employee with a fizzy drink bottling plant at Baruipur, who travels there daily from his Bansdroni residence. Many office-goers have faced similar situations. “Many of the contract carriage operators understand that the demand is sky high and supply is meagre so they have found in it an opportunity to make a killing. They are now raising the fare, sometimes double what they had quoted on June 14-15,” said Banani Dasgupta, an IT employee at Sector V. The contract carriage had agreed to ferry her at Rs 250 a day between Behala Silpara and SDF building to and fro. But the same carriage is now demanding Rs 600 a day after a week, she said. The diesel price has increased by Rs 1.92 per litre and petrol by Rs 2.24 per litre since June 14. But many believe the rises in fuel price do not justify such a hike in fare. “When we had agreed to ferry them, we did not understand the exact distance we were to run. But we have found that we are running much more than what we had calculated. Moreover, we cannot raise the fare at every small change of fuel prices,” said Dayal Ghosh, a contract carriage operator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/transport-woes-may-intensify-as-contract-carriage-operators-demand-rise-in-fare/articleshow/83903405.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Some of them have also decided to give discounts to those vaccinated and enrol only a limited number of members till the time the situation normalises. Bhupender Sharma, president of Delhi Gym Association (DGA), said that after a long lull, they now had something to look forward to. “We were among a few business activities that were closed first and have been permitted to open after almost all trading activities and offices have resumed operations. The same was the case last year when we were asked to shut down on March 15 and given permission to reopen on September 15,” Sharma pointed out. He said they had faced this situation though no confirmed Covid-19 case had been reported from gyms in Delhi. “Rather gyms help in immunity building. Still we accepted the decision taken by the authorities for the safety of all. The struggle has, however, brought together the gym owners and they also formed a body to raise their voice,” he added. Thanking the government for the permission, Sharma said they had already started calling their clients, instructed staff to ensure regular sanitisation of equipment and requested people to leave after their stipulated slot. “No gathering or socialising will be allowed and visitors up to 50% of the number of gym equipment will be allowed inside at a time.” Chirag Sethi, the owner of a gym in Malviya Nagar and vice-president of DGA, said the standard operating procedures for running gyms were approved last year and visitors would need to get their own towels, yoga mats, shoes and bottles. Even the shower areas won’t be opened to avoid crowding, he added. People are excited about visiting gyms again, especially at a time when they are fed up sitting at home for a long time and want to exercise under proper guidance for their mental and physical well-being, claimed Sethi. “As soon as the order came out, at least 20 clients called to know about the timings and SOPs for visiting gyms from Monday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-a-stretch-but-gyms-ready-to-meet-norms/articleshow/83903441.cms||Vibha Sharma

The girls along with their family members were on their way to Agra from Delhi and Ghaziabad to celebrate the birthday of a relative when they met with the accident, said police. The deceased were identified as Lavanya Sharma, a Class V student and a resident of Ghaziabad, and Shreya Sharma, a BTech student and a resident of Chhattarpur, Delhi. Shreya’s father Mukesh Sharma, 50, mother Nisha, 49, and brother Yash 24, and Lavanya's grandfather Jugal Kishore Sharma, 62, sustained grievous injuries and were admitted to a private hospital in Mathura, said police. Police said Mukesh, Yash, and Jugal were stable, while the condition of Nisha was stated to be critical. “Mukesh Sharma is a property developer and his son Yash is pursuing MTech. Mohit Sharma is the manager of a State Bank of India branch in Ghaziabad,” said Mohit’s brother Amit Sharma. “Everything changed in a few seconds,” said Mohan Shyam Sharma, a lawyer and a relative of the victims, while speaking with TOI. “We were going to Agra to celebrate the birthday of Amit’s daughter Anshika. Unfortunately, Amit’s niece and Mohit’s only daughter Lavanya and their cousin Shreya died in the road accident. Shreya’s parents and Lavanya’s grandfather have been admitted to the hospital. Lavanya’s parents broke down after seeing her body.” Station house officer of Yamunapar police station Rakesh Kumar Singh said, “The accident occurred around 12 in the noon. It appears that the driver dozed off at the wheels and the uncontrolled vehicle crashed into the divider. The car was badly damaged in the accident. The families didn't agree for the postmortem of the bodies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/two-girls-12-19-from-ghaziabad-delhi-killed-4-injured-in-accident-on-yamuna-e-way/articleshow/83901278.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Officials in Madurai said 714 buses will be operated for intra-district and 120 for inter-district movement. The numbers include special buses to be operated for women. There are over 930 buses in Trichy region and officials said that they will assign buses to the Central and Chathiram bus terminus based on demand from passengers. After months, SETC has also resumed reservation for the long-distance bus services to Chennai. SETC has planned to operate 14 omnibuses to Chennai from Trichy including two non-AC sleeper-seater buses. From 7 am, SETC will start operating buses with the last service originating from Trichy to depart by 10.30 pm. AC omnibuses will not be operated, official sources said. An official said that all buses have been sanitized and kept ready for operation. Maintenance and small repair works required for some of the buses have also been done during the non-operation period. The workers were instructed to report at their respective depots on Sunday for overhauling the fleets including checking the fuel level, condition of brakes and tyres. “Our workers washed and disinfected the buses. Sanitiser will be placed in every city and mofussil bus. Passengers without facemask will not be allowed to board the buses,” an official with Trichy TNSTC said. Teams will be in place at all major bus terminals for assessing crowd movement and additional buses will be deployed on routes which have good demand. They will also ensure that only 50% of the seats are being occupied by passengers and prevent overcrowding. Similarly, State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) will also operate buses to longer routes. Officials said that Madurai has a fleet of 93 buses. One-third of the strength will be utilized on Monday. If the demand is more, the buses will be increased accordingly, officials said. Destinations such as Thanjavur, Ariyalur, Perambalur and Pudukkottai are expected to face demand as there are workers from adjoining districts employed in the commercial establishments. Buses to Thanjavur will halt at Valavantankottai while buses heading to Karur from Trichy will be operated till Pettaivaithalai and those to Salem will be halted at Melakalnayakkanpatti. Buses to these districts will not enter the districts as they have high test positivity rate. After May 23, public transportation had come to halt due to the surge in infections. The Trichy Central bus stand functioned as a makeshift wholesale fish market while the three depots in Trichy city and two in the suburbs accommodated the grounded fleets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tnstc-to-increase-bus-services-on-demand/articleshow/83903406.cms||---

He finished second after Haryana’s Krishan Kumar. Kumar, however, missed out on the qualification mark for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics which was 1:45.20 minutes. He fell short of the Olympic mark by six seconds, clocking 1:51.20. “We are extremely proud of Kumar as he defeated boys much older than him in the race,” said KJS Kalsi, secretary of the Uttarakhand Athletics Association. Interestingly, Kumar also practiced in the same barren pothole-ridden field in Dehradun where middle-distance runner Ankita Dhyani is forced to train. On Friday (June 25), Dhyani had won a bronze medal in the women's 5,000 metre race at the 60th National Inter-State Senior Athletics Championships being held in Patiala. TOI had earlier reported that Dhyani, a national record holder, was not given the permission to access basic training facilities before the crucial race.

Punjab BSP president Jasbir Singh Garhi and state affairs in-charge Randhir Singh Beniwal called on Maywati at her Lucknow residence on Friday. Garhi on Saturday said the meeting continued for three hours in which every detail was discussed threadbare. On Sunday, he announced expulsion of Raju, from whom he had taken charge as state president. Garhi’s statement said party high command had been getting reports of Raju’s anti-party activities and also mentioned the meeting of discontented workers at Garhshankar. Raju was state president during 2019 elections, when party had alliance with Punjab Democratic Alliance and made significant gains on the three seats it contested. Discontentment has been brewing in party workers over the quality of seats their party has got in seat sharing with SAD, and meetings have also been held at a few places. Raju also participated in one such meeting of party workers at Garhshankar on June 17. After attending and addressing the meeting, Raju later told the media that all workers present at the meeting supported the alliance and expressed happiness, but they were concerned as some good seats had not been given to the party. Apart from other seats, he also mentioned Garhshankar seat and appealed to party supremo Mayawati that seat sharing should be re-negotiated and Garhshankar should be given to BSP. Some party workers have been trying to blame state leaders, but the meeting and directions of Mayawati on Friday made it clear that all details of seat sharing were worked out at her approval. In a statement issued after returning from there, Garhi said Mayawati’s direction to state unit was clear: that there would be no review or change in seat sharing, and the decision was final. “Those leaders who would not be able to contest the election from their seats would be honourably adjusted in the government. She has also made it clear that indiscipline would not be tolerated as alliance is imperative because party has been struggling for the last 25 years without getting results,” Garhi said, claiming that the party supremo had complete knowledge about all issues and leaders. As party cadres have been happy at the alliance, but peeved at the ‘quality’ of seats, they were anxiously waiting for the meeting as they expected that there could be shuffling of couple of seats.

---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana among districts with low vaccination adverse events||LUDHIANA: Ludhiana has crossed one million vaccination recently and the district witnessed about 0.002% persons suffering from adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), according to a recent report. Ludhiana is among the districts with low adverse events among vaccinated persons. According to a health department report of Thursday, of the 9,63,237 persons who received first dose, there were 20 cases of AEFI in Ludhiana. The report suggests that Amritsar has highest number of AEFI among the districts of state with 36 such cases reported in the district. Sangrur and Kapurthala shared the third position in 19 AEFI cases. Fatehgarh Sahib district had no such cases till June 24. The report suggests that Ludhiana district has highest number of persons who received first dose whereas Jalandhar is ranked second with 6,24,826, SAS Nagar ranked third with 5,37,602. Mansa had lowest number of persons who received first dose at 76,347. The data derived from the report suggests that Fatehgarh Sahib district has 0% AEFI, Gurdaspur 0.0005%, whereas Faridkot and Fazilka at 0.0008%. Sangrur and Kapurthala had highest percentage of AEFI among vaccinated (who received first dose) at .01%. Health authorities said less number of vaccinated persons facing AEFI is a good scenario. District immunisation officer (DIO) Dr Puneet Juneja, said it is good that Ludhiana has witnessed less AEFIs even as it has vaccinated highest number of persons. Health experts said people should go for vaccination as AEFI in Ludhiana district is low. “Persons suffering serious and severe effects are to be reported immediately. These AEFIs require hospitalisation as well. Routine fever, body ache, headache, pain in arm where vaccination is done, are routine reactions that are not reported. There are more chances of reactions after first dose and those who face such events normally don’t get second dose,” said former senior medical officer Dr Rajinder Gulati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ludh-among-districts-with-low-vax-adverse-events/articleshow/83901280.cms||Shariq Majeed

Justice G Ilangovan directed the Tirunelveli superintendent of police to monitor the investigation. The court was hearing the petition filed by R Usaikumar, a resident of Palayamkottai who sought CB-CID probe into the murder of his son Rajamani, who was a first year student at a polytechnic college in the district. The petitioner stated that in 2018, members of another Hindu community threw flowers on the houses of people belonging to the scheduled caste community during a funeral procession. As Rajamani and others questioned their act, it caused enmity between him and members of that community. He stated that this led to the murder of Rajamani in February 2019. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-probe-into-murder-of-sc-youth/articleshow/83903390.cms||---

Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbag Singh termed the twin explosions, one of which pierced a hole in the roof of a building, a "terror attack" even as teams from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the National Bomb Data Centre arrived at the airbase to probe the blasts. "Drones with payload were used in both the blasts at Jammu airfield. Police have registered an FIR at Satwari police station," he said, hours before the NIA formally took over the probe. The injured personnel were identified as warrant officer Arvind Singh and airman S K Singh. Neither of them needed hospitalisation, officials said. The IAF tweeted from its official handle that one of the explosions caused "minor damage" to the roof of a building while another IED exploded in an open area. "There was no damage to any equipment," it said. Sources said the twin explosions at 1.27 am and 1.32 am may have been targeted at the aircraft parked in the dispersal area of the station, which houses Mi-17 V5 helicopters and drones. Another theory is that this may have been just a trial run to test the ability of a drone with payload to breach a high-security zone undetected and carry out an attack to evaluate preparation and response. Defence minister Rajnath Singh, on a three-day visit to Ladakh, reviewed the situation by speaking to IAF vice chief Air Marshal H S Arora. Delhi-based Western Air Command chief Air Marshal V R Chaudhari flew to Jammu to take stock of the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-iaf-base-hit-in-1st-drone-strike-on-indian-military-facility/articleshow/83907964.cms||M Saleem Pandit

President of the Ramanathapuram Archaeological Research Foundation, V Rajaguru said the temple was constructed during the period of Rajendra Chola I, who is belived to be the first king to have crossed the ocean to conquer other nations. He conquered Kidaram (Kadaram), a place near Malaysia, in the year AD 1025, among 14 south east Asian countries. He was given the title of ``Kidaram Kondan’’ following which a place in Ramanathapuram was named Kidaram Konda Cholapuram in his honour. Rajaguru said the Thiru Vanatheeswaramudaiyar temple at Mela Kidaram near Sikkal in Ramanathapuram does not have a compound wall, or gopuram (tower) that are usually seen in temples. The remains include only four parts of sanctum sanctorum. There are nine stone inscriptions belonging to the later Pandiya period and this was deciphered by epigraphist C Santhalingam. The top portion of the sanctum is a hollow pyramid-shaped tower commonly seen in Chola architecture. The vimanam (tower-like structure) has been constructed with big bricks and comprises intricate designs. The other parts have been constructed using rocks from the coastal areas. The walls have developed cracks and breaches. The vimanam is also crumbling. He said this temple, which may have been constructed in the eleventh century AD when the king conquered Kidaram, has no Chola inscriptions despite being constructed during their rule. During the Pandiya period, the word chola has been purposely removed from the name of the place, says Rajaguru. He says, a stone inscription from the period of Maravarman Sundarapandian 11, where the place is mentioned as Kidaram Kondapuram. However, another inscription from the fourth year of Sundarapandian’s regime in the Thilageswarar temple in Devipattinam, refers to this place as Kidaram Konda Cholapuram. Traders play a crucial role in the history of the temple. ‘Puram’ in Kidaram konda Cholapuram translates to ‘a region where traders live’. A trader named Nagarathu Andapiram donated a lamp to this temple, which has to be kept burning eternally. Another trader Thiru Appanur Urar had donated a piece of land to the temple. T Senthil Kumar, a native of this village, who conducts poojas in this temple, says that it was taken over by the HR and CE in the year 2017, nevertheless the locals request the restoration to take place without compromising its originality and aesthetics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/call-to-restore-1000-year-old-chola-temple/articleshow/83903434.cms||---

These doctors are bonded doctors, who studied in government medical colleges and were under obligation to serve in rural areas for few years after completion of their studies or else they should surrender the bond amount in lieu of the rural service. The high court is likely to hear their case on Monday. On May 4, following the surge in Covid-19 cases and falling short of human resource in dealing with the crisis, the state government took a decision to recruit bonded doctors as medical specialist Class – 1 in Covid facilities from May 7. There were 1,415 such doctors who were called for Covid duty and nearly 1,000 doctors failed to report. The state health commissioner on June 20 ordered chief district health officers and the medical officers in corporations to file FIRs under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 against 799 doctors who did not respond to the government’s call and for their failure to discharge their moral obligation to serve the society after having taken the benefit of the subsidised education in government medical colleges. On June 21, the state government decided that the bonds submitted by the bonded doctors would not be received. Moreover, the health authorities were asked to issue show-cause notices to the doctors. The petitioners have urged the HC to quashed the order for registration of FIRs against bonded doctors, to junk the order to assign Covid-19 duty to them and show-cause notices issued by the authorities. They have also demanded that the National Medical Council should formulate a pan-India policy regarding compulsory service bonds. In a petition filed through advocates Angesh and Amit Panchal, the bonded doctors have contended that they are unable to meet the additional obligations under the bond and therefore requested to submit the bond amount, but the government refused to accept it. The bonded doctors have raised a contention that both the state government and petitioners are bound by the terms of the bond. There is no clause in the contract that the state government would refuse to accept the bond amount. The refusal is unreasonable. By threatening criminal action, the attempt to enforce the contract for personal service is a violation of Article 23 of the Constitution. The bonded doctors have also questioned why the state government chose to assign Covid-19 duty to only those medical professionals who studied medicine in the government colleges. Two more petitions have been filed by the doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bonded-doctors-challenge-govts-fir-diktat/articleshow/83903445.cms||---

Protesters also wrote their demands on their body. They claimed that the health of protester Surinderpal of Gurdaspur had been deteriorating as he had started hunger strike a week ago, whereas he had already been sitting on protest on the mobile tower for 99 days. “We tried to convince him to come down and call off his hunger strike. We are worried about his health. His blood sugar level has fallen to 40 and he seems to have lost too much weight. We offered him juice and chocolates, but he refused and demanded that the government should at least provide a written assurance over the demands, including notification of 10,000 posts and preference to ETT in 2,364 posts already advertised, and had undergone selection proceedings,” said Deep Banarsi, press secretary of the teachers’ front. “We blocked the road near Leela Bhawan on Sunday for around half an hour, and later marched towards YPS Chowk without wearing our shirts and T-shirts. We asked the administration to at least once visit the protester. The government should either provide assurance or release a notification to fill ETT posts before it is too late,” added Banarsi. Meeting between representatives of the protesters, Punjab education secretary and minister Vijay Inder Singla have been held twice this month, but remained fruitless as the protesters wanted an assurance in writing and release of notification for new posts. These protesters have faced a lathi-charge several times during their protest. Protesters are demanding the recruitment of only ETT-TET pass unemployed teachers for the advertised 2,364 elementary teacher training (ETT) posts, including 664 backlog posts. Besides, protesters are demanding notification for recruitment of 10,000 posts of ETT teachers. Also, they want extension in the age limit from 37 years to 42 years in recruitment on grounds that many had turned overage while waiting for jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/youth-remove-shirts-at-protest-for-teacher-jobs/articleshow/83903468.cms||---

Over 1.5 lakh commuters from Medchal and other parts of Secunderabad take Bowenpally crossroads to proceed towards Balanagar through this bottleneck. In October 2020, the Secunderabad Cantonment Board passed a resolution of re-classification of A-1 defence land into class ‘C’ (Cantonment) land in survey No. 569 in Bowenpally (ad measuring around 1.5 acres) for widening the narrow road to prevent accidents. “Recently, a team of SCB engineering wing officials inspected the defence land and prepared a blueprint to get approval from the ministry of defence,” J Maheshwar Reddy, former SCB vice-president, said. Currently, road width in this bottleneck is 40-60 ft and plans are afoot to widen the stretch to 100-120 ft. “Once we get the MoD nod, traffic mess in the bottleneck will get resolved,” Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/efforts-on-to-get-defence-land-for-road-widening/articleshow/83901311.cms||---
---||Chennai||Author who respected tradition, but went against convention||By Rajagopalan KalyanaramanQuestioning, introspecting and analysing the woman’s place in society was author T Janakiraman’s unique capability at a time when education and independence were a distant dream for many. In the early 1940s T Janakiraman, fondly known as Thi Ja, began writing about ordinary women who were not highly educated, employed and didn’t have family wealth and yet had strong personalities and refused to adhere to society’s stereotypes. Through his characters he began to push the boundaries within which women were allowed to operate, and the cultural mores which decided their destiny. His narrative remains relevant today and gains importance as the literary world celebrates his centenary on June 28. His stories were taken from life as early on he was perceptive to the treatment meted out to women. Growing up with four sisters, he began to observe the rituals the women in the family were expected to follow. His eldest sister was married to a village landlord but soon fell ill and was expected to be living out her last days. Pressured by society, Janakiraman’s father Thiyagaraja Shasthri promised his son-in-law the youngest daughter. But after their marriage, the eldest survived. The two sisters lived under the same roof but the elder one renounced conjugal relationship with her husband. Despite living a life of compromise, when the husband died, it was the elder sister who wanted to shave her head keeping with convention, while the younger one declined. Janakiraman’s passionate appeal made his eldest sister retain her locks. His second sister too had a tumultuous life. Married at the age of 17, she lost her husband followed by the death of her daughter. She lived till the age of 70 and followed all the customs of a widow, living with a shaved head. A mention of this is present in the novel ‘Mohamul’, confirms Janakiraman’s daughter Uma Shankari. The experience of his sisters, dramatically changed Janakiraman's perspectives of life. He felt the need to portray women as stronger and greater personalities than men. He rebelled against society through his words, creating a space for such ideas in the male-dominated Tamil social life. Alangaram in ‘Amma Vandhal’ (translated into English as ‘Appu's Mother’) is an inimitable character who broke away all the norms of the family system. Despite giving birth to three children, she refuses to have sex with her orthodox philosophical husband. She goes on to have three more children with another man. To atone for this ‘sin’ or ‘guilt’, she puts her third son Appu in a ‘padasala’ to learn Vedic scripts. The author cleverly turns around the idea of sin or guilt that Alangaram feels; rather it is the sin of the hypocritical social conventions. It is society that makes her think of her act as sin and hence, she endeavours to expiate the same by sending her son Appu to a ‘veda padasala’. Alangaram eventually disowned her six children, husband, lover and decided to go to Varanasi. In south Indian Hindu tradition, only male seekers of truth are allowed to denounce their life and spend their last years in Kasi, but Thi Ja’s Alangaram is quite an exception. She is the very first woman to relinquish her ties with family life and travel to Kasi alone. There is no such precedent to this act in Tamil literature. By creating Alangaram, Janakiraman threatens the patriarchal Indian family system. Alangaram is a rebel, living life on her own terms, celebrating life to the fullest. The master stroke of Thi Ja was that he could strike a chord of individuality and independence, especially, for a woman going against social, cultural systemic bonds. While praise came his way, so did scorn. In the late 1960s, Janakiraman was boycotted by his village for writing ‘Amma Vandhal’. His elder brother was also miffed with him, as he was the one who studied in the ‘veda padasala’ along with well-known Tamil writer and friend of Janakiraman Karichankunju. His insightful poetic dialogues, subtle and thought provoking, attracted readers. From men and women, he moved on to deeper self. He argued for women and their rights with a rare rebel attitude as seen in ‘Amma Vandhal Alangaram’ and ‘Marappasu Ammani’. A master craftsman in employing the nuances of Tamil language, Janakiraman’s conversational narrative style was the striking feature of his writing. He chose his words carefully, especially the figurative meaning of his titles, such as ‘Mohamul’ (Thorns of Desire), which may hint at happiness, but makes readers aware of the thorns as well, and ‘Marappasu’ (Wooden Cow). On one hand, the word ‘Mara Pasu’ means the cow made of wood is lifeless and, on the other, the cow, though being numbed, carries on with life. If you may ask why Janakiraman is so important to literature? It is because the author delved into the very common but misunderstood relationship between a man and a woman. Janakiraman in his novels, created many complex situations and presented all permutations and combinations to resolve the issues, yet peace eluded his characters. For all his inquisitive open mind, Janakiraman couldn’t transform the lives of his sisters due to his father’s influence on the family. But after his father’s death, he revolted against the system, especially, through his writings. As he once remarked: I gave due punishment to the society in which I was born and brought up by writing the novel Marappasu. (translated into English as ‘Wooden Cow’).

During the operation, STF sleuths arrested 14 cyber fraudsters from Jamtara and Bharatpur, including two accused who allegedly set up a fake Facebook profile of Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar and demanded money from people on his friend list. Ajay Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP), STF, told TOI, “We have arrested the mastermind who created a fake Facebook profile of DGP Uttarakhand. The preliminary investigation had revealed that the fraud was carried out from Bharatpur city of Rajasthan.” “The fraudsters had created a fake Facebook profile of DGP Ashok Kumar and sought Rs 5,000 from nine of his contacts by sending direct messages to them,” said Singh. The two cyber fraudsters who made the fake profile have been identified as Zahid and Irshaad, both residents of Bharatpur in Rajasthan.The SSP added that the initial questioning has revealed an organised nexus of cyber criminals in Bharatpur. The accused told the STF that local representatives and residents of the city give patronage and cover to these cyber fraudsters. Besides, investigation in more than half a dozen cyber fraud cases that occurred in Uttarakhand suggests the involvement of cybercriminals from Jamtara, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. While Jamtara district has been hogging the limelight for cybercrime activities for quite some time now, Bharatpur, Mathura and Mewat which form the tri-junction of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have lately emerged as the epicentres of several cyber frauds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-stf-raids-multiple-locations-in-jharkhand-rajasthan-arrests-14-cyber-frauds/articleshow/83901380.cms||Gaurav Talwar

While eight cases were detected in Calangute, one was detected in Candolim, said Candolim PHC health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth. “There was no spill-over to other houses in the neighbourhood due to stepped up surveillance by our malaria teams this year and three-tier supervision,” he said. After two cases had come to light in Calangute in May, Candolim primary health centre along with the Calangute panchayat had decided to leave nothing to chance and launched a door-to-door anti-larval drive to prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases which normally surface in the rainy season wherever there is stagnant water. These included identifying containers in which water could accumulate, anti-larval spraying, fogging and fever surveillance. Besides Calangute and Candolim, the anti-larval drive has also been carried out in the other villages which come under the Candolim primary health centre - Arpora, Saligao, Sangolda, Nerul and Reis Magos through the sub-health centres.

Travel by diesel cars has also become expensive in the city —it costs Rs 5 per km—as the fuel price has reached Rs 96.42. In comparison, driving a CNG car costs Rs 2.5 per km and around Re 1 for electric vehicle, the sources add. Similar scenarios across the country have led to popular automakers like Maruti and Hyundai now focusing on rolling out a large number of CNG cars this fiscal. The government, meanwhile, wants sales of electric vehicles to further boost after a 115% rise in 2020-21 and is coming out with a new Electric Vehicle Policy soon. While CNG costs Rs 49.4 per kg across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, every electric charging station gets subsidised tariff from the government at around Rs 6 per unit. Nilanjana Bhattacharya, a resident of Kasarvadavli in Thane, said people are frustrated with the rise in petrol and diesel prices. “Recently, I witnessed a huge rush of new CNG cars at the refuelling outlets,” he added. With more people preferring CNG variants now, the gap between CNG and diesel cars has also been reducing, a car dealer said. In 2020-21, Maharashtra saw sales of 10,363 CNG vehicles, compared to 11,785 diesel vehicles. However, when it comes to petrol, despite the huge costs involved, there were 1.43 lakh new petrol-driven vehicles registered in 2020-21. “Those owning fleets of aggregator cabs like Ola and Uber are now purchasing CNG-run sedans instead of diesel. Also, there is a demand for hybrid CNG (petrol-CNG) cars which save operational costs and are good for intra-city drive,” said S K Raut, a car dealer. As for electric vehicles, 885 e-vehicles were registered this year between January and March. While there was a lull in sales due to the second wave of Corona in April-May, the registrations picked up pace since the first week of June and a total 124 e-vehicles were registered in Mumbai and 876 across the state this month, a RTO official said. Milind Shinde, an IT professional, said he had spotted a few electric SUVs on the road with green number plates. “They look good, are cheaper to maintain and the overall running costs are very low as compared to petrol and diesel,” he said, adding that he planned to replace his petrol vehicle with an electric car sometime this year. The government, too, is promoting e-vehicles with its new policy under which it will install 1,500 new charging stations across MMR. “We will also give incentives to those purchasing new e-cars, e-autos or e-bikes besides waiver on tax,” an official said.  Meanwhile, petrol price hit a new high on Sunday at Parbhani where it is the costliest in Maharashtra at Rs 106.9 per litre. Amravati diesel rate was Rs 97.94 at the HP pumps -- just around Rs 2 short of a century.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/at-rs-6-5/km-petrol-car-drive-2-6-times-costlier-than-cng/articleshow/83907179.cms||Somit Sen
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Hours before engagement, Firozabad mandi trader shot dead||AGRA: Hours before his engagement ceremony, a vegetable trader, Pawan Kumar (25), was shot dead on Etah road under Sirsaganj police station in Firozabad district in the early hours of Sunday. While his shell-shocked family is yet to come to terms with his death, police said a CCTV camera in the spot caught two assailants attacking him. Pawan Kumar was attacked while on his way to his shop in Mandi Samiti at 4:30am. Police are trying to identify the assailants from the CCTV footage that shows Pawan being shot at close range by two bike-borne assailants. He is seen falling off his bike as the assailants speed away. A resident of Ramkuwan village, Pawan Kumar was the main breadwinner of his family. He was the oldest son with two younger unmarried sisters. “I was very happy as my son was going to get married. The entire family was preparing for his engagement on Saturday evening. Last night, I had told him not to go to work and look after arrangements for the engagement ceremony. But, as is his routine, he left home for the mandi at around 4am, promising to return by 8am. Then we received news that he is no more,” said Diwakar Singh, the deceased’s father who is a farmer. “My son had no enemies. I can't even guess who was after his life,” said his distraught father. Ashok Kumar, senior superintendent of police, said, “We have recovered crucial CCTV footage of the entire incident. Two bike-borne men came from behind and fired at Pawan, who was going to his shop on his bike at a slow pace. The bullet punctured his heart and he died on the way to the hospital. The assailants will be arrested very soon.” Pawan was taken to the district hospital by locals. There he was declared brought dead. Akhilesh N Singh, superintendent of police (rural), said, “Based on the complaint received from the father of the deceased, an FIR has been registered at Sirsaganj police station against two unidentified men under IPC section 302 (murder). The CCTV footage recovered are not clear, and the identity of the assailants is yet to be ascertained. However, we have received strong leads in the matter. For now, a close relative is our prime suspect. Soon, the culprits will be sent behind the bars.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/hours-before-engagement-mandi-trader-shot-dead-in-firozabad/articleshow/83901460.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Ludhiana||With O2 plants, paediatric care, Ludhiana putting infrastructure in place for third wave||LUDHIANA: The health authorities are trying to put in place required infrastructure in case the third wave of Covid hits the district. They are also focusing on paediatric care, as it was being said that the next wave may affect children more. District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said they were arranging adequate facilities before the probable third wave and they already have a system in place for sufficient beds (both for moderate L2 and severe L3 cases) and oxygen plants were being set up at various hospitals. “We had to close the L2 facility at Meritorious School as cases fell, but we can open it if there is a surge. We can have more than 200 beds there. Also, we can have 50 L2 beds at Jawaddi community health centre (CHC) and 100 L2 beds at Mother and Child Hospital (MCH), Vardhman. We can have 30 L2 beds at sub-divisional hospital (SDH) in Raikot and have sent a proposal for it, besides we can set up 30 beds at Samrala SDH, 30 L2 beds at Jagraon SDH, 50 at Covid care centre at Rara Sahib and 50 L2 beds at Khanna SDH,” said the health officer. He added that oxygen plants were coming up at many government hospitals of the district. Raikot SDM Himanshu Gupta, who is monitoring the setting up of oxygen plants in hospitals, said that two 1,000 LPM (litre per minute) plants were coming up at civil hospital and ESI hospital in Ludhiana, funds for which were being sent by the Central government and peripheral expenditure, including making of base of plant, DG set and electricity connection, was being done by the Punjab government from state disaster relief fund. He said four plants were being installed through donations: 250 LPM plant at Raikot SDH, 100 LPM at Vardhman MCH, 100 LPM at Samrala SDH and 500 LPM at a private hospital in Ludhiana. The private hospital plant would be funded by the CII. “We have also requested the state government for a plant at Covid care centre in Rara Sahib and Khanna SDH. Hopefully, the oxygen plant at Raikot SDH will be completed by July 15 and others are expected to be installed by July 31,” said the officer. “These plants use natural air as per the latest technology which is different from oxygen cylinders and liquid medical oxygen being used earlier,” he added. As there are apprehensions that children may be vulnerable in the third wave, required facilities are being set up at the civil hospital. “We have a 700 LPM oxygen plant as of now and a 1,000 LPM plant is coming up at the civil hospital. We also have 170 beds, of which 154 are L2 and the remaining L3. Of these, we have earmarked 24 beds in the isolation facility at the civil hospital and we have two beds with paediatric ventilators for severe patients. We are also upgrading facilities for children who come with multisystem inflammatory syndrome after four to six weeks of recovering from Covid and have made an eight-bed ICU for them at Mother and Child Hospital,” said Covid care in-charge at civil hospital Dr Hatinder Kaur. “During the second wave, we were not prepared, so there were many deaths. The authorities should ensure that before the probable third wave, there are adequate beds, trained staff and oxygen supply. They should especially check how many trained paediatricians are there, as children are being considered vulnerable in the next wave,” said Ludhiana IMA president Dr Saroj Aggarwal. Training for paediatric care An official at a private hospital and medical college said they were training healthcare workers, including doctors from government hospitals, to handle paediatric Covid patients ahead of the probable third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/with-o2-plants-paediatric-care-city-putting-infra-in-place-for-third-wave/articleshow/83901385.cms||Shariq Majeed

With the highest tests and falling positivity, the state health department guidelines say the local health department needs to maintain status quo. According to the state health department data, the district’s tests per million were 2,931 as on June 24 evening. The data shows that Ludhiana is at the top on the parameter in the state, Faridkot is second (2,673) and Jalandhar third (2,646). Moga has the lowest (702) tests per million. The district’s 2,931 tests per million on June 24 are less than June 15’s when the number was 3,191 on the seven-day average scale. The number increased from 1,201 on March 31 to 1,250 on April 9, fell to 1,193 on April 13, increased to 3,933 by May 18 and 3,950 on June 3 before reaching the present value. The data of June 24 shows that Ludhiana has the lowest average positivity rate (around 1.5%) in Punjab. SAS Nagar has the highest (around 7%), followed by Ferozepur (around 5.5%) and Bathinda (5). District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said they have been testing thousands of people on a daily basis and will continue to carry out a large number of tests. “It is important to test maximum number of people for Covid to keep the disease in check. Aggressive testing helps in detecting asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, thereby preventing the virus spread,” said former SMO Rajinder Gulati. District vs state Ludhiana had 2,931 tests per million on June 24 evening and Punjab 1,751. When to maintain status quo, when to test more The state health department guidelines say that in areas where tests per million (TPM) are high and positivity is low, the department needs to maintain status quo. In areas where TPM and positivity are high, the department needs to assess reasons for high positivity and develop interventions. In areas where TPM and positivity are low, the department must increase testing. And in areas where TPM is low and positivity is high, the department needs to increase testing on priority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/at-2931-district-tops-state-in-tests-per-million/articleshow/83901372.cms||Shariq Majeed

The scientists spotted the black-bellied coral snake (Sinomicrurus nigriventer) — a rare and threatened species found in altitudes between 2,500 and 6,000 feet — on the way to Bhadraj temple. According to scientists, this is an extremely rarely-found and venomous snake. A total of 107 species of this snake have been discovered around the world but only seven of them have so far been found in India. According to WII scientists, this is the first sighting of a live snake of this species in Uttarakhand. They added that a dead snake of this species was found in Nainital in 2019. “The Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) is bestowed with rich and endemic biodiversity. The occurrence of this species in Nainital and Mussoorie forest divisions indicates that the cool sub-tropical and temperate forests (3000-6000 feet) with dense grassy slopes are under-explored in terms of reptilian diversity. It is quite a significant finding,” said Abhijit Das, a scientist at the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India. Last year, scientists had found the species in the Solan district of Himachal Pradesh. “This snake is present in the 500-km stretch starting from Solan to Mussoorie and Nainital. Its geographical range has clearly extended,” added Das. The sighting of the snake has been extensively covered in a scientific paper ‘Black-bellied Coral Snake Sinomicrurus nigriventer: An extended distribution in the western Himalayas, India’ that was published in the ‘Journal of Threatened Taxa’ on June 26. The authors of the scientific paper are Sipu Kumar, Jignasu Dolia, Vartika Chaudhary, Amit Kumar and Abhijit Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rare-venomous-snake-found-alive-for-the-first-time-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/83901378.cms||Shivani Azad

Lieutenant governor (additional charge) Tamilisai Soundararajan administered the oath of office to the ministers in a simple ceremony in Raj Nivas adhering to Covid-19 protocols. The portfolios of the ministers have not been announced yet. This is the first time the saffron party is part of the government in the territory. The party had, until now, elected only one representative to the assembly, in 2001 when A M Krishnamoorthy was elected on a BJP ticket from the erstwhile Reddiarpalayam constituency. With the induction of Priyanga as a minister, the territory got a woman minister after a gap of 40 years. Late Congress leader Renuka Appadurai was the last woman minister. The ministry includes two dalit members and two vanniyar members. Interestingly, when the Tamil Nadu BJP leaders objected to referring to the Centre as ‘Union government’, the BJP MLAs in Puducherry did not object to saying ‘Indian Union’ while taking oath. Namassivayam took the oath first followed by Lakshminarayanan, Djeacoumar, Priyanga and Saravanan. Rangasamy, speaker of the legislative assembly Embalam R Selvam, MLAs from AINRC and BJP parties, Tamil Nadu BJP leader L Murugan and a host of others participated in the ceremony. The cabinet expansion was delayed after a tussle between the AINRC and the BJP on sharing ministerial berths besides holding the vital posts of speaker and deputy speaker of the assembly. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted greeting the newly inducted ministers. "Best wishes to all those who took oath as ministers in Puducherry today. May this team work with determination and fulfil the aspirations of the wonderful people of Puducherry," Modi tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/five-member-puducherry-cabinet-sworn-in-after-more-than-50-days/articleshow/83907561.cms||Bosco Dominique

With the injured animal’s gruesome photos with its skin peeling doing the rounds on social media, district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar visited its owner on Sunday. The cow had huge pink patches on its neck and back and streaks of peeling skin on its stomach. Aneesh Sekhar ordered that the animal be treated as an inpatient at the veterinary polyclinic in Tallakulam. Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, A Ravichandran said that the animal was brought to them eight days ago, a day after some corrosive chemical had been poured on it. As the owner had been reluctant to allow it to be treated as an inpatient, he had taken it back on the assurance that he would look after it well. The owner had claimed it was hot oil, but it looked like a chemical attack, he said. When the collector inspected the cow at Alwarpuram, its owner S Ayya Pandi said people often caused injuries to his cattle when they roamed on the streets of Madurai in the busy Goripalayam area. The collector warned him against allowing his animals to stray and ordered the veterinarians to take the animal and treat it as an inpatient. Dr Ravichandran said the animal will be discharged in three days. ``The healing skin tends to erupt at some places, and this was when the animal activist had spotted it and taken photos, and it went to the collector’s notice,’’ he said, adding that the owner had not kept his word and kept the animal in his yard. Meanwhile, animal welfare activist H Mayur, whose friend Samaya Kumaran had seen the animal first, has filed a complaint with Tallakulam police for inflicting cruelty on the animal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/collector-orders-treatment-for-cow-sprayed-with-chemical/articleshow/83903483.cms||---
---||Madurai||Scientists write to Chief minister Stalin to support neutrino project||MADURAI: A group of eminent scientists, including Nobel laureates, has written to chief minister M K Stalin to support the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) in Theni district in Tamil Nadu and provide the approval as early as possible so that this basic science research activity can bring laurels to this region. The signatories include Prof Arthur McDonald, Nobel Prize, Queens University, Canada, Prof Kajita, Nobel Prize, Kamioka Observatory, Japan, Prof Ashoke Sen (Padma Bhushan) besides Distinguished Visiting Researcher of Perimeter Inst in Canada G Baskaran and Professor of Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Retd) T R Govindarajan. They said the proposal for the Neutrino project was initiated two decades ago by the Indian High Energy physics Researchers and that the motivation was purely academic and not commercial. It is part of the Indian scientific community’s sincere ongoing attempt at a deeper understanding of Nature. India had a tradition of active research in neutrino physics, through the underground facility at Kolar Gold Fields (KGF), before it was closed, they said. The protests against it by a group of activists, claiming that it will affect the health of people, and the tunnel will affect dams, which are 30 to 50 kms away are unfounded. Some activist groups have been opposing this basic science research program by creating unwarranted, unknown fears among people, the scientists said. The INO project will bring back experimental neutrino research which was given up by the science community in the late eighties and will put India on the world map in basic science endeavours, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/scientists-write-to-cm-stalin-to-support-neutrino-project/articleshow/83903503.cms||---

A large number of people took part in the protests at Harveypatti near Thiruparankundram and Goriplayam junction in the city on Sunday. The protest was organized by All Muslim Political Parties and Outfits led by organiser Mohamed Abuthahir. The city police held talks with the protestors. As they refused to withdraw the road block protest police arrested them and released them later in the evening. Police sources said that 128 people were arrested in Thiruparankundram and 34 were arrested in Goripalayam. The protesters said that various court orders have confirmed their rights over the land where the shrine is situated. Every year they used to celebrate a festival after hoisting a flag in the dargah in March and said that the flag would be on the pole throughout the year. “Some Hindu outfits have now complained that the flag which used to be removed after the festival was not taken down this year.” An RDO conducted an inquiry recently following which the flag and pole was removed by the city police, the protestors said. They urged the state government to intervene and solve the issue. They also sought action against police and revenue officials for removing the flag. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/protests-held-over-removing-flag-from-shrine/articleshow/83903550.cms||---

In a statement issued on Sunday, the president of TNCCI, Dr N Jegatheesan, said that fuel is an indispensable part of life. On June 9, premium petrol was sold at Rs 100.01 per liter and regular petrol at Rs 97.57 and diesel at Rs 91.81 per liter. But on Sunday, the price of premium petrol was hiked by Rs 2.55 and it went up to Rs 102.65 and the increase of regular petrol was also hiked by Rs 2.56 that made it go up to Rs 100.13 per liter and diesel went up to Rs 94.11 Hike in fuel prices will directly and indirectly affect all the major sectors like transportation textiles, auto, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, trade and industry for manufacturing and transportation. These ups and downs push the prices of all essential, he stated. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-chamber-demands-rollback-of-fuel-price-hike/articleshow/83903560.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rising fuel price, transportation cost send veggie prices soaring, hit kitchen budget||KOLKATA: The diesel price on Sunday rose to Rs 91.8 a litre, setting fire to the kitchen budget. Most vegetable prices consequently shot up significantly compared to the middle of this month due to the ever-rising transportation costs and loss of crops due to inundation. Common vegetables, like brinjal, bitter gourd, coriander leaves, green chilli, ridged gourd and okra, sold for nearly double of what it was even a week ago. “There has been a significant drop in production because of widespread inundation in south Bengal, leaving a wider gap between demand and supply,” said Gour Ghosh, a member of Vegetable Growers’ Association. Ghosh said the standing crops are still rotting in the water-logged fields. The price gets multiplied during the trip. “The transport cost has risen tremendously. Moreover, vendors are bringing smaller amounts so they can sell these perishable items within a four-hour window,” said Kamal Dey, president, Bengal Vendors’ Association. In the last 15 days, the cost of transportation has nea-rly doubled. Additionally, since storm-water canals are still flowing above the normal level, pumping out water did not yield results, said Ghosh. Farming could not be resumed in vast swathes of land in Barasat, Bongaon, Hasnabad, Bhangor and Canning, where vegetables mainly grow. Now, Bengal is getting vegetables even from far off places, like Bangalore, Jharkhand, Hapur and Tamil Nadu. The bulk of vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower, drumstick, capsicum, beans and tomato, are coming from outside the state. “The prices of vegetables will cool off only when local vegetable production swings back into normalcy,” said Gopal Sonkar, a wholesaler at Sealdah market. “The situation is unlikely to change in one-and-a-half months — the minimum time for renewal of vegetable production in south Bengal. Till then, we have to deal with the yawning demand-supply gap,” said Dilip Mandal, a vegetable vendor at Gariahat market. “The rise in prices of essentials can majorly be attributed to costlier fuel. No doubt we have been reeling under natural calamities. We are assessing the extent of damage. But the carrying cost has risen manifold. It is being revised almost daily and movement has become costlier,” said state’s agri-adviser Pradeep Mazumdar. Farmers are making distress sales of their produce because they cannot afford such high transport costs. So, the commodity which is being sold dirt cheap at the rural market, becomes costlier after arrival in the city markets, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-fuel-price-transportation-cost-send-veggie-prices-soaring-hit-kitchen-budget/articleshow/83903548.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Inevitably, the final scene of the couple’s story was heralded by the sirens of police vans. The couple’s misadventure was played out on Sunday afternoon at a jewellery outlet on the Nikol-Naroda road. According to Krishnanagar police, Yogita Gohil and her husband Bharat Gohil began their heist protocol but immediately faced fierce resistance from the showroom’s owner Haresh Modi and his staff. The couple were held in confinement till the cops arrived. Police officers said that Yogita and Bharat run a tailoring shop in Nikol. They were reeling from money problems and planned the robbery after watching “some action films from the South”. The Gohils struck the showroom at around 1.15pm on Sunday, wearing masks and gloves. Bharat pointed a pistol at Modi and his staff. Bharat told Modi to follow his instructions while Yogita brandished a knife. The Gohils ordered Modi to hand over cash and jewellery. Then Bharat tried to tie Modi’s hands. But Modi began fighting and three showroom staffers joined the fray and overpowered the couple. Modi then confined the couple in the shop and called the police control room. After a while, a team of Krishnanagar police took the couple into their custody. Inspector Amarsinh Chauhan of Krishnanagar police said that the couple have a five-year-old child. He said the couple were hit by a financial crisis due to Covid-19, lockdown, and curfews. He said they decided to attempt a robbery, empowered by the adrenaline rush they experienced from South Indian action films. The couple have been booked for robbery. Krishnanagar police have also invoked the provisions of the Arms Act. Chauhan said it was yet to be determined how the couple got the weapon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rob-ne-bana-di-jodi-couples-heist-plan-foiled/articleshow/83903551.cms||---

The region now has a total 1,151 CAM cases, detected over the last three months. Health officials said they are seeing fewer new cases. “We were reporting an average of 120 new CAM cases every week during the previous two months. Now, however, the weekly increase has substantially fallen, along with the drop in Covid-19 cases,” a health official said. Of the 1,151 patients with CAM in the district, 543 are undergoing treatment, 467 have recovered completely and 141 have died. The invasive fungal infection mainly attacks the sinuses. Experts said Covid patients with diabetes and those who were given steroids during treatment need to be monitored after discharge from hospital. “Whether diabetic or not, raised blood sugar is the single most important factor in the development of this deadly disease. So, sugar control is of foremost importance,” said ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande. Covid-19 patients who needed high-flow oxygenation and drugs like Tocilizumab also need special attention while convalescing. “These patients should be closely monitored and should undergo diagnostic nasal endoscopy,” Yande said. Certain drugs such as Posaconazole and Itraconazole also have shown positive prophylactic value and early diagnosis remains vital to effective treatment. “Steroid drugs need to be judiciously used with expert advice and are to be avoided as far as possible in the first week of Covid disease with mild symptoms,” Yande said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-records-69-new-cases-of-fungal-infection/articleshow/83903553.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Pune||Maharashtra records 9% death rate in those with mucormycosis||PUNE: Maharashtra has recorded a 9% mortality rate among patients diagnosed with Covid-associated mucormycosis (CAM) over the last three months. The death rate is much below the 30-50% range that was seen in mucormycosis patients before the pandemic. From the total 7,359 CAM patients in Maharashtra till June 14, 653 have succumbed. Of the five worst-hit districts of the state, Pune has recorded a 12% mortality rate and is followed by Nashik (10%), Mumbai (9%), Nagpur (8%) and Aurangabad (7%). Experts attributed the state’s low mortality rate to swift efforts by doctors and smart use of available anti-mucormycosis drugs such as Posaconazole and Isovuconazole amid widespread shortages of key drugs like amphotericin B. But health activists said they fear a larger toll as many patients could not continue expensive hospital care and their deaths at home may have gone unreported. Medical experts also said it's still too early to calculate Covid-linked mucormycosis' death rate. Thane-based ENT surgeon and member of the state task force on Covid-associated mucormycosis, Ashesh Bhumkar, said, “Covid-linked mucormycosis is very different from mucormycosis from the pre-Covid era.” He said, “In post-Covid mucormycosis, the patient is immunocompetent and fights the fungus very hard. A number of patients are also younger and heal better. Besides, the diagnosis is made very early and treatment starts quickly.” He added that investigations such as MRI scans are now better, surgical treatment is optimal and control of glucose and other electrolytes has been fine-tuned. "All these factors are responsible for the low mortality rate in the current times," Bhumkar said. Pune-based ENT surgeon Rajeev Yande said, “The current death rate is far below the expected fatality rate of mucormycosis. This surprising statistical fact could be attributed to the swift and timely multi-disciplinary responses from the specialists — from surgically excising the affected tissue to administering anti-fungal drugs.” Yande said surgeons, enriched with experience, were able to surgically excise the disease, thereby making tissues responsive to drugs. “Steroid treatment being restricted only to indicated patients also could have contributed to the reduction in the death rate,” he said. Others agreed it’s still too early to comment on death OR recovery rates. “Mucormycosis kills slowly, mainly by intra-cranial spread. We are yet to see this in significant numbers,” said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi. Joshi said, “Quite a few patients died because of sepsis, long-Covid lung complications and ketoacidosis, a serious complication of diabetes. Strictly speaking, they are not due to mucormycosis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-records-9-death-rate-in-those-with-mucormycosis/articleshow/83903543.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The corporation has been carrying out vaccination in the four major urban primary health centres (UPHC) in Thideer Nagar, Ansari Nagar, K Pudur and Munichalai and other smaller UPHCs regularly. The number of doses and the vaccine availability changes every day. Camps are also being conducted for people aged above 45, vulnerable groups, those planning to visit foreign countries and people aged above 18 frequently. Activists, however, said that the only medium through which the vaccination information is being disseminated by the corporation is Twitter. The information is not regularly updated on the corporation’s website. Only a select group of people stand the chance of receiving the information through Twitter, a large section is being left out, they pointed out. V P Manikandan, a social activist, said, “A large number of people are accessing corporation website for various information. But vaccination information is not updated regularly there,” he said. He said that more people are now ready to get vaccinated compared to a few weeks ago as they have realized its importance. However, they are finding it difficult to get the information about the vaccination camps. He urged the civic body to take steps to reach out to the illiterate people and those from economically weaker background by reaching out through conventional methods. P Rajan, a resident of Narimedu, said that a vaccination camp for people aged above 45 was conducted last week in his area, but he was not aware of it. “I would have taken the jab along with my wife had I known about the camp,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/call-to-publicize-info-about-vax-camps-in-madurai-city/articleshow/83903595.cms||V Devanathan

The divisional commissioner’s dashboard showed on Sunday showed that of the 20,235 beds allocated for Covid-19 patients in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits, 15,923 beds Owing to the consistent drop in the covid cases in the past few weeks, the overall bed vacancy reserved for the Covid-19 patients has increased to over 75% in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). A couple of months ago, when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak, the bed vacancy had dipped to under 10% for isolation beds with and without oxygen, while ICU beds were completely occupied. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that they have managed the situation better in the past few weeks. “With over 85% beds vacant in PCMC limits, we are now working on bed preparations for a potential third wave. The jumbo units that we had initially planned in Bhosari and Sangvi areas now have been scrapped owing to strengthening of the medical infrastructure in the civic hospitals,” Patil said. A PMC official said many of the Covid-19 beds in small hospitals have been released for non-Covid treatment, while bigger hospitals have been given the relaxation from earlier 80% reservation of beds for Covid-19 to 50%. “All these hospitals have been asked to be ready to roll back to Covid treatment protocol, if needed,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/total-covid-bed-vacancy-in-region-touches-75/articleshow/83903587.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Pune||Owners of restaurants & bars put staff preparing to return on hold||Pune: A prominent city-based restaurant owner with outlets on Fergusson College Road and in Baner is aghast at the state government’s restrictions from Monday curtailing service hours till 4pm for dine-in. “Sixteen of my staff members have returned and more will be back. I spent a lot of money arranging for their tickets. The restrictions are tighter from Monday and I won’t need so many persons. Paying them all will be difficult. If I send them back they won’t return,” the owner told TOI. Saturday’s order has set back many restaurants and bars, and the staff struggling for work. “I was preparing to come when on Saturday my employer called to say that he was cancelling the ticket and will rebook it after July. I will think many times before coming to Pune even if fresh tickets are sent,” Madhu Kumar from Banka in Bihar said. On Saturday, Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association’s president Ganesh Shetty said many restaurants may shut down the dine-in services after the fresh restrictions. “Many have returned to work. The fresh restrictions are a setback and if they are sent back again, they will never come back. Maintaining good staff and chefs is a priority for any restaurant,” the association’s general secretary Kishor Satpotdar said. The owner of a popular restaurant in Kondhwa said, “Around 10 staffers have yet to return from West Bengal. Now with the restrictions back, I have told them to wait,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/owners-of-restaurants-bars-put-staff-preparing-to-return-on-hold/articleshow/83903597.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Dehradun||Heavy rains, less tourists push up Naini Lake’s water to over six feet||NAINITAL: From the water level nearing the zero mark in early May, the Naini Lake now flows well above six feet and six inches. In fact, the water level of Naini Lake, the only source of potable water for Nainital residents, rose by more than four feet in just the last ten days. Among the major causes behind the sharp rise in the water level of the lake are suppressed tourist activity in the wake of the pandemic and heavy rainfall in May. According to data available with the Naini Lake administration, the town has already recorded around 400 mm of rainfall in June. “This is the maximum rainfall received by the town in the last several years. On June 16, the water level was just around two feet seven inches. In the last ten days, we have witnessed a significant rise in the water level which has allayed fears that we may face water scarcity during tourist season,” said Naini Lake superintendent Ramesh Singh Gaira. Over the last several years, the water level in the lake during June used to drop below the zero mark. “The summers put a lot of stress on the lake as this is the peak tourist season. In 2017, the water level had fallen to negative six and a half feet. The water level was in negatives in 2016 and 2017 as well while in 2018, it was just 10 inches above the zero mark,” Gaira added. However, in 2020, the water level was over six feet and eight inches in the wake of Covid-induced lockdown. Meanwhile, an irrigation department official said that Nainital has already witnessed more than half of its annual rainfall in just six months and if this continues, the water level would reach around 12 feet by October. “Nainital generally receives 1,500-1,600 mm of rainfall annually. In just six months, we have already had 874 mm rainfall and if this continues, the water level in the lake will reach 11 or 13 feet soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/heavy-rains-less-tourists-push-up-naini-lakes-water-to-over-6-feet/articleshow/83901477.cms||Prashant Jha

He was abducted on Saturday morning as he could not repay the money to the lender. The police traced the accused persons through CCTV footages and later zeroed in on them using their cellphone location and ultimately nabbed five persons for abducting the builder. The builder, Prakash Prajapati, had some financial transactions with the main accused, Narendrasinh Rathod, 60, a resident of Bhayla village in Bavla taluka of Ahmedabad district, said a cop. Rathod gave Rs 5 crore to Prajapati which he did not return for a long time and Rathod and his son used to threaten Prajapati and his family members with dire consequences if the money is not returned, said the cop. On Saturday morning, when Prajapati went to feed biscuits to dogs near his house, he was abducted by Rathod’s two aides Vagha Bharwad, 42, and Raghu Bharwad, 43, both residents of Parnala village in Limbdi taluka of Surendranagar, said the cop. The duo took him to a house of Abdul Timbalia, 53, a resident of Ralol village in Limbdi, where Prajapati was kept under confinement and another accused Yunus Varaia, 37, from the same village, kept a watch on him. Crime branch cops who cracked the case, said that the accused made Prajapati talk with one of his friends and arrange Rs 1 crore immediately. Prajapati’s friend and Prajapati’s wife approached Chandkheda police and later the investigation was handed over to the crime branch which found Prajapati’s location at Ralol village. He was released by the abductors late on Saturday night. Rathod, Vagha, Raghu, Timbalia and Varaia were booked under the charges of abduction whereas three other accused, who helped Rathod in abduction, are still on the run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chandkheda-builder-released-abductors-held/articleshow/83903591.cms||---

The report would be submitted to the state and central governments, urging them to develop and promote them as the second wave is receding. Office-bearers of the club are banking on domestic tourism as international tourism will take more time to begin due to the restrictions in place. They said that Madurai is getting a good share of tourists visiting the state, but it is not translating into revenue as tourists spend less time here. For them Madurai means only Meenakshi Amman Temple, Thirumalai Nayak Palace and Gandhi Museum. They leave for places such as Ramanathapuram, Kodaikanal and Kanyakumari after visiting the well-known tourist spots. Madurai Travel Club president G Raveendran said that all stakeholders in the southern districts have been brought on board to prepare the report. Many unexplored places have been listed out. Some of the places were personally visited by teams to add authentic inputs. “In Madurai alone, there are many historical sites which need attention. For instance, Jain caves in Madurai are thousands of years old and are a treasure trove. Most of the people coming from north India do not know about such sites. People from places such as Rajasthan particularly would be greatly interested about the historical sites,” he said. The falls like Suruli in Theni and Courtallam in Tenkasi, pristine beaches in Tuticorin and Ramanathapuram and hill stations such as Meghamalai and Sirumalai in Theni and Dindigul districts should be prominently put in national tourist spots. He said that the report would be completed in a week or two. They would meet elected representatives and officials of state and central governments with the report to urge them to promote the places, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/travel-club-to-promote-lesser-known-tourist-spots-in-madurai-dist/articleshow/83903580.cms||V Devanathan

---||Delhi||Sub-City Of Lakes? Hope Floats In Dwarka||New Delhi: The recent creation of a seven-acre pond in Dwarka by Delhi government using treated water from Pappankalan sewage treatment plant (STP) may have paved the way for constructing four more waterbodies, which are planned to be completed in less than a year. Delhi Jal Board (DJB) would be using treated water to create two more waterbodies inside the Pappankalan STP in Sector 16, one inside the Dwarka water treatment plant and another inside the Najafgarh STP. All projects would utilise in situ measures, such as aeration, floating wetlands and ozonation to remove excess nutrients. Dwarka has seen several citizen-oriented efforts in the past few years to revive waterbodies, which has resulted in rejuvenation of ponds and lakes in sectors 5, 20, 23 and 24. The focus is now on two waterbodies in sectors 8 and 25. A DJB official said the waterbody in Sector 16, which was created in March, had resulted in recharging two million gallons of water daily and the groundwater level had increased by 0.5 metres. Measurement of the groundwater table 400 metres away from the lake also showed a recharge rate of 30 centimetres per day. Under the “City of Lakes” project, 155 more waterbodies would be created or revived. The first phase would finish in June. Phase-II would be completed by June 2022 and Phase-III by December 2022. An official said while there were two STPs at Pappankalan, they would be using the Phase-II STP as it was designed to remove nutrients. Locals who have revived waterbodies in Dwarka, meanwhile, have gone for a more traditional approach by diverting excess water from stormwater drains and increasing the catchment area nearby. Plants have been used to absorb excess nitrates and phosphates. Diwan Singh, an activist, worked with several locals and the group Sukh Dukh Ke Saathi to revive waterbodies in sectors 20 and 23 and, recently, Sector 24’s Dhool Siras. Singh said they were against using STP water, adding that the revived waterbodies would be able to sustain themselves throughout the year by natural means. “Dwarka has adequate stormwater drains. If they are simply cleared out and diverted to a depression, a waterbody can easily be revived or created,” he said. The group also worked on reviving a waterbody in Sector 5, which was now being maintained by Delhi Development Authority. Singh said two more waterbodies, in sectors 8 and 25, required attention and could be rejuvenated in the future. “The government can look at these. The one in Sector 8 has dried up completely. Efforts to create more waterbodies will help Dwarka and its groundwater table return to normal once again,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sub-city-of-lakes-hope-floats-in-dwarka/articleshow/83903703.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Majority of the calls were related to the availability of hospital beds. Nearly 8,000 beds were allocated via the helpline during the second wave of the pandemic.“The civic body will continue to operate the helpline in the days to come. It has provided timely help to many people during the pandemic,” the mayor Murlidhar Mohol said. As per the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) data, around 27,000 calls were pertaining to the information gathering about Covid. They included information about Covid Care Centres and home isolation. The remaining 8,000 calls were about the availability of beds. Information about oxygen beds, ventilators and ICUs was also sought. As per the civic administration, it had started the help centre with five lines, which were then increased to 10 after more calls started coming in. The number of lines were further increased to 15 in the peak period. On an average, 700 to 800 calls were received per day at the centre. The number then reduced to 200 as the number of positive cases reduced. Now, the helpline receives 50 calls on an average. According to the PMC officials, the civic body had decided to introduce the call recording feature at the call centres of Covid bed management. The decision was taken after many citizens raised complaints of not getting proper information about the availability of beds. A civic official said the Bombay high court too had raised questions on the functioning of the centres a few months. The court, while hearing the matter regarding call centres and other facilities of PMC, had directed one of the advocates to give a call on the Covid helpline and check the hospital beds’ availability. The staff member, who had answered, didn’t give the information properly, following which the civic body took action against her, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/helpline-receives-over-35k-calls-during-second-wave/articleshow/83903637.cms||---

The mobile vaccination programme was launched to cover residents of housing societies and care homes in urban areas. Vaishali Jadhav, assistant medical officer, PMC, said the programme (since launch on May 27) has reached out to more than 12,000 vaccine beneficiaries in Pune city limits. “We have deployed five vans to carry out the vaccinations. More are likely to be introduced,” she said. Each vaccination van, besides the driver, has a doctor, two nurses, a registration assistant and a social worker. Krunal Mehta, COO of Jivika Healthcare (the firm operating Vaccine-on-Wheels) said the number of beneficiaries covered in PMC limits is around 12,499. Another 4,950 people have been covered in Pimpri Chinchwad. “Over the next few days, we will have at least three more vans,” Mehta said. As for regular coverage in the region, CoWIN on Sunday showed 26,903 vaccinations in the district. Civic sites were closed in PMC areas. The civic body said for Monday, it will operate 192 vaccination centres; 58 of these sites will be reserved only for those booking via CoWIN. These slots will open for bookings at 8am on Monday. For the 45-plus , the PMC will operate 116 sites — for both first and second doses. PCMC chief Rajesh Patil said the civic body will now be focusing on its 45-plus population. Special attention will be given to residents of slums and low-income neighbourhoods. PCMC officials said 16 of their vaccination sites will be for the 18-44 group while 50 will be for the 45-plus. The PCMC is offering 90% of its jabs for walk-ins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vaccine-on-wheels-programme-covers-over-17000-within-a-month/articleshow/83903624.cms||Piyush Bhusari

A purported video of the incident went viral on social media on Sunday. Taking cognizance of the matter, Mathura chief medical officer Rachna Gupta has marked an inquiry into the matter and has assured strict action against the accused, if the allegations are found to be true. She has sought an explanation from the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), Kamlesh, and health worker Rajnikant in this matter. While Rajnikant was appointed at the health centre just three months ago, the ANM has been working there for the past two years. In a 35 second video, Rajnikant can be seen asking from the beneficiary Rs 400 — Rs 200 each for two vaccines that he administered. When the beneficiary says that this is unreasonable, he can be seen going inside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/govt-healthcare-worker-caught-on-camera-charging-rs-200-each-for-covid-jab/articleshow/83901554.cms||---
---||Surat||Surat: Addicts get extra high with premium charas oil massage||SURAT: Investigation into June 1 charas haul worth nearly Rs 24 lakh has led city cops to also probe the possible rampant use of hash oil for massage as a new way to get a high. Though use of this method is limited to some parts of the country, experts engaged in rehabilitation of drug addicts confirmed that it is slowly gaining popularity and mostly preferred by those who are addicted to concentrated forms of drugs for a long time and want to try some different ways for intoxication. Due to its limited availability and know-how, the oil massage is a high-priced service at present. “The massage costs anywhere between Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000 depending upon the time and quality of the product. People from different parts of the country and abroad visit HP for the massage,” sources close to the investigation told TOI. While cannabis oil, which contains cannabidiol (CBD), made from the extract of leaves, has legal medical uses, hash oil is illegal in the country. This not-so-known way of drug abuse was revealed by Nolaram Thakur of Himachal Pradesh who was arrested in connection with the 4.6 kg charas worth Rs 23.42 lakh on June 1. Thakur told investigators that there is a high demand for this massage among addicts who want to try different ways of intoxication. “Thakur told us that the knowledge of making the oil from charas and using it for massage is known to few people only. They make huge money in this,” a special operations group (SOG) official added. Project director of Parivartan Vyasan Mukti Kendra, Vinay Solanki said, “From some drug addicts coming from effluent families, we got to know about the massage for intoxication. They use different types of oils that include charas oil.” Akhil Desai, a senior lawyer representing law enforcement agencies, said, "Charas and hash oils are banned substances. This product is a resin of cannabis." Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner, said, “We are ensuring that no narcotics enter the city. We have launched an awareness campaign to prevent youth from getting trapped into dangerous addictions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/addicts-get-extra-high-with-premium-charas-oil-massage/articleshow/83901577.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The event also had the 11th World Diabetes Congress on the agenda involving over 4,000 doctors and experts from across the globe. Dr Banshi Saboo, a city-based diabetologist and the organizing secretary for the event, said that networking dinners are a major part of such international meetings. They were sorely missed by all. “We thus decided to host a gala dinner where all could participate. As the mode was virtual, we had a food delivery service send the meals to the participants across India. We also collaborated with a hotel brand for a uniform menu,” he said. “For international partners, we chose delivery services in their respective countries.” The delegates were also sent uniform glasses and a bottle of fruit beer. Foreigners got Indian wine. “Thus, at the designated time, all were present virtually, having the same meal with uniform glasses. We had also requested all to wear Indian attire if possible. Thus, the event became a memorable one,” said Dr Saboo. He added that all participants also got a virtual tour of Ahmedabad. City-based event organizers said that the pandemic has forced hosts to push the envelope. Many designed virtual sets with various lecture halls, whereas many experimented with mixed reality. Recently, an Ahmedabad-based hotel organized a virtual meet for all wedding planners across the city. “The virtual meet was held to promote the hotel as a venue for weddings and events,” said Jaydeep Mehta, founder of True Events. “Before the pandemic, such events were held as planned gatherings at the venue itself.” Mehta said that restrictions on the number of guests and apprehensions among people have made in-person gatherings impossible. “Recently, a virtual birthday party was organized similarly,” said Krunal Parekh, a wedding planner.

Mourning the demise of a young doctor, the Physicians’ Association of Aurangabad (PAA) said Shinde suffered a cardiac arrest at the end of the surgery. “Shinde was undergoing esophageal stricture surgery and was given general anaesthesia. The team of doctors tried to revive him after he suffered a cardiac arrest, but he could not be saved despite all possible efforts,” PAA president Dr Sanjay Patane said. The PAA said a post-mortem report could throw more light on exact cause of death of Dr Shinde. “Esophageal stricture surgery does not involve any major risk and, therefore, it is shocking to see Shinde losing his life. We are awaiting post mortem report to get a clear idea behind the medical condition that led to his death,” Patane said. Hailing from a family of doctors, Shinde is survived by a wife, who is a dentist, and two daughters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/32-year-old-physician-dies-while-undergoing-surgery-in-aurangabad/articleshow/83899549.cms||---
---||Goa||Incessant rain hampers farm activities across Goa||MARGAO: Incessant rains that lashed the state over the last few weeks have hampered agriculture activities of the prevailing kharif season. Sources in the agriculture department said that waterlogging of rice fields has prevented farmers from ploughing their tracts. “Also transplanting machines can’t be deployed as they often get stuck in the mud. This has resulted in a slowdown of activities,” a senior agriculture officer said. After the Tauktae cyclone on May 16, the state witnessed moderate to heavy rainfall intermittently, right during the time of the ploughing season. “Waterlogging of the fields has forced farmers in many places to skip the primary tillage and directly go in for rotoweeder (implement used to make the soil loose before transplanting),” a source in the agriculture department said. Former zilla panchayat chairperson Santan Rodrigues who has been practicing organic paddy cultivation in Curtorim pointed out that paddy seedlings of many farmers got washed away just when they were about to be transplanted owing to the heavy rains that resulted in waterlogging. “Silt accumulation and narrowing of water drainage structures also led to water logging of the fields. Water resources department should undertake timely desiltation of these drainage waterways to prevent losses to farmers,” Rodrigues said. Besides, the second wave of the Covid pandemic also largely added to the woes of the farmers. Sources said that tractors belonging to the agriculture department as also those of service providers, which are usually employed for ploughing the fields, were deployed for Covid duty. They were utilised for transporting medical oxygen cylinders when the state faced acute shortage of gas. They were relieved from Covid duties only during the first week of June. Besides, non-availability of trained machine operators and technicians also added to the problem. Sources explained that most of the operators and technicians of tractors and harvester machines hail from neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka and are brought to Goa only during the time of operations. “The Covid situation and the prevailing travel restrictions prevented these technicians from entering the state. Besides, some tractors that needed repairs couldn’t be put to use as spare parts couldn’t be purchased as shops were shut,” a source familiar with the agricultural practices in the state told TOI. Nevertheless, transplanting has begun at various places in south Goa over the last one week and notwithstanding initial hiccups, agriculture officials are hopeful of a bountiful yield this season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/incessant-rain-hampers-farm-activities-across-goa/articleshow/83905722.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Data of the state’s public health department (PHD) revealed 11 districts of Vidarbha received 2.42 lakh doses of Covishield while Pune district alone got 2,48,280 doses since resumption of inoculation for the 18-44 age group. The demand for vaccination increased with resumption of inoculation for 18-44 age group on June 23. On June 24, the state had supplied 1,75,500 doses of Covishield for the entire region whereas 1,73,970 doses for Pune district. Due to shortage of doses, 96% of centres were closed in the city on June 25. The region recovered second lot of 66,500 doses on Sunday and Pune district got 74,310 doses. Nagpur district received 24,000 doses of which 14,500 were delivered to the NMC for the city. NMC will resume vaccination at 122 centres on Monday but it is likely to run out of stock in the first half. A day ago, 28,012 people had taken the jab at NMC centres. Therefore, 14,500 doses are as good as 50% of day’s requirement. Inoculation will be affected on Tuesday in case fresh stock is not received on Monday. As per data of PHD, population of Pune district is estimated at 1.17 crore. Population of Vidarbha region is 2.55 crore. The region has registered 10.96 lakh Covid-19 positive cases and 20,173 deaths till June 26. Pune district’s cases are 10.5 lakh and fatalities- 16,551. Ex-CM and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis told TOI, “This is absolutely biased distribution and against Vidarbha. It should not exist atleast where lives of people are involved. I will ask the government why such discrimination is being done.” Guardian minister Nitin Raut said, “I have demanded 3.5 lakh doses per day for the district. We should at least get 3.5 lakh doses in a week. But the central government is not supplying sufficient number of doses,” he said. Raut said he has raised issue of more allocation to Pune district with officials of PHD and will take it up at state-level. Director of state health services Dr Archana Patil said, “Allocation of doses was as per population of districts in initial stage. Then, the system changed to caseload. Now, doses are allotted as per performance of last three days. There is no discrimination.” In government centres, 43,538 doses were given on June 26, 35,469 on June 24 and 40,239 on June 23, for a total of 1,19,246. Vaccination did not happen in 96% centres in the city on Friday for shortage of doses. Average of three days comes to 39,749. The district received 24,000 doses on Sunday. Gadchiroli district did not receive doses in last two lots despite vaccination has continued in this tribal-dominated district. In Pune district 35,18,557 people were vaccinated on June 26 and number of beneficiaries was 47,30,691 in the region. Thus, 29.95% of total population of Pune district has been vaccinated whereas 18.54% in the region. On Sunday, 153 took the jab at GMCH and 3,356 in nine private centres for a total of 3,509 in the city. National Cancer Institute at Jamtha became ninth private centre to start paid inoculation. Number of beneficiaries dropped to 4,050 in rural areas on Sunday. Thus, total vaccination was 7,559 in the district on Sunday as against record 45,839 a day ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vidarbha-population-double-pune-dist-equal-vax-for-both/articleshow/83903854.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Also, the AMC has embarked upon creating a digitized record of properties among other civic records using Geographic Information System (GIS) survey covering 170 sqkm area. The Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Limited (ASCDCL) has roped in two private agencies for these work. “The e-governance project involves deployment of an integrated municipal application for more than 30 departments and services complemented by a modern portal, a citizen app and payment gateways. It will also involve grievance redressal mechanism and witness modernisation of the local area network within AMC offices, including setting up of Citizen Facilitation Centres, at various zonal offices,” an official release said.  AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey said both the projects are targeted to get rolled out from the next financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/e-governance-to-soon-become-reality-at-amc/articleshow/83899553.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sting in ‘thick tail’: Mumbai's Covid-19 cases may not fall below 600 a day||MUMBAI: The slow tapering of the second Covid-19 wave in Mumbai and Maharashtra has doctors and officials worried. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of the state health department, told TOI, “We are close to the baseline of the second wave.” A senior Mantralaya official admitted there is widespread concern about the daily cases stagnating between 8,000 and 10,000. “Most states, which saw a severe second wave such as Delhi and Karnataka, report low detections now. Why not in Maharashtra?” he asked.   In Mumbai, too, senior doctors believe the local numbers won’t dip below 600 cases a day. “Even if they do, it would be for a few days in between,” said a BMC doctor. During the end of the first wave in December 2020-January, cases dropped to 300-plus on a couple of days before the second wave’s rise began in late February.   The reasons for the “thick tail”, according to experts, are not too clear. It could range from accurate reporting of Covid data to the size of the state to the density of the population. One of the theories discussed in Mantralaya is the different “peaking time” for different districts in Maharashtra. Districts in Vidarbha were the first to report a surge in the second wave in February before the wave spread to the other districts. “When cases in the first-hit districts reached a plateau, cases in others began to peak,” said a senior official. At present, he added, six districts seem to be in the midst of a peak. “Kolhapur, Sangli, Sindhudurg and Osmanabad account for 60% of the daily cases reported in Maharashtra now,” he added. The reasons for the “thick tail” in Mumbai could be a mix of more testing, better reporting and population density. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “It could be due to our huge population density or the floating population.” Statistics released by Western Railway show that 28 lakh people returned to Maharashtra, including 7.8 lakh to Mumbai, in the May-June period. A doctor from a government-run hospital provides a statistical answer based on the average number of tests conducted in Maharashtra daily. “We conduct roughly 2.5 lakh tests daily. Given our population size and failure of people to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour, one can presume that we will at least witness a 2% positivity daily. This works out to 5,000 cases on the best day which hasn’t yet come,” he said. The lowest daily caseload during the first wave was 1,842 on January 25, but the number of daily tests at that time was around a third of the present count.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sting-in-thick-tail-city-cases-may-not-fall-below-600-a-day/articleshow/83903741.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Ahmedabad||Arabian Sea temperature rises by 1.4°C in 2 decades||AHMEDABAD: The roar of the extremely severe cyclonic storm Tauktae that churned the Arabian sea at wind speeds of 220 kmph — the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in the state since the 1998 Kandla cyclone — still echoes in our ears. It was a warning sign for the state of what lies ahead. A report by an independent New Delhi based think tank, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) has warned that Saurashtra districts like Amreli, Gir Somnath, Junagadh, and Porbandar are especially vulnerable to intensified cyclones and storm surges, “which have increased threefold between 1970 and 2019.” The report adds, “These are worrying signs, given that Arabian Sea cyclones have battered India’s west coast at the rate of one per year since 2018, a frequency not seen in five decades.” Abinash Mohanty, programme lead at CEEW, says, “Estimates suggest that surface temperatures over the Arabian Sea have increased by 1.2-1.4°C in the last two decades, increasing the frequency of cyclonic events on the west coast. Tauktae is a grim reminder of India’s vulnerability to extreme climate events.” A report published in Nature (Asia) journal has mentioned how Nilofar in 2014, Chapala and Megh in 2015 , Vayu in 2019, Nisarga in 2020 and Tautkae this year have indicated a rapid rise in cyclone count in the Arabian Sea, which has been puzzling weather scientists. One of the reasons scientists say is that warming is seen not only in the top layers of the Arabian sea, but also in the deeper ocean layers. National Institute of Oceanography scientist, S Prasanna Kumar, claims in his study that the Arabian Sea has warmed at an overall rate of 10.1 millidegrees per year from 1960 to 2011. The rate of warming increased since the mid 1990s — from 7.7 millidegrees per year from pre-mid-1990s to 13.4 millidegrees per year post mid-1990s. An indication is that category 4 cyclones have begun appearing in the Arabian Sea only after 1995. The CEEW report also warns that as many as 29 districts in Gujarat are exposed to extreme climate events such as cyclones, floods and droughts. Droughts have increased ninefold in the state between 1970 and 2019. Ahmedabad, Bharuch, Jamnagar, Kheda, Rajkot, Surendranagar, and Vadodara are among the state’s drought hotspots. Further, extreme flood events in Gujarat have increased fourfold in the last 50 years. Major flood hotspots include Anand, Bharuch, Narmada, Sabarkantha, Surat, and Vadodara districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/arabian-sea-temp-rises-by-1-4c-in-2-decades/articleshow/83903724.cms||---

While BJP had announced it would boycott the meeting, the party’s senior Dalit functionary Motkupalli Narsimhulu attending the meeting. Many BJP figures who held a counter-meeting over the issue, objected to Narsimhulu’s attendance in KCR’s meeting. BJP was among several opposition parties who held counter meeting over Dalit empowerment in the state. This was the first all-party meet held by the chief minister in his second term. Senior BJP funtionary Vivek Venkataswai alleged that the chief minister’s interest in Dalit empowerment is false. “Why did he not give three acres of land? Why did he not appoint a Dalit chief minister as he promised? Only when he delivers on these promises can we trust him,” he said. Speaking after a meeting with leaders of BJP and other parties, BJP’s Swamy Goud said that the time had come for leaders across parties to converge. He said that TJS chief M Kodandaram will also be part of the next meet but the latter said he did not get any invitation for the meet on Sunday. Congress too was divided over the issue as CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka attended the meeting.

---||Surat||Surat’s leading businessman, educationist joins AAP||SURAT: City-based businessman and philanthropist Mahesh Savani joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in presence of Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday. Savani, a diamantaire who later ventured into real estate and is engaged in education too, said that he is not a businessman but someone who believes in doing social work. “Many people told me I can replicate the work I am doing in Surat across Gujarat if I join politics and get a platform,” Savani told reporters.  Savani, 50, said that he does not identify himself as a person of one community. “I am somebody who sits with people from all communities and those from lower strata of the society,” he said. Savani’s entry into AAP ahead of 2022 assembly elections is expected to bolster the party’s strength in Surat where it had won 27 seats in the municipal corporation elections this year/. In fact, earlier this month, Naresh Patel, president of Shree Khodaldham Trust, had also said that AAP has a chance in Gujarat. Of the 27 AAP councillors of Surat who were elected during this year’s civic polls are also from Saurashtra Patidar dominated areas. During the second wave, he had started several community Covid care centres in Surat and later in Saurashtra. Many AAP members had extended voluntary services at these centres in Surat during the second wave. “People warned me that if I join AAP, my business and family will be harassed. But I am not scared as I am doing social work,” he remarked. Referring to Congress and BJP as two buildings and AAP an empty plot, Savani said, “I could have chosen an 80-year-old building or a 22-year-old building with good elevation for my house but I chose an empty plot where a new foundation for Gujarat will be laid.” Savani, a Leuva Patel with roots in Bhavnagar’s Palitana taluka, is known for conducting mass weddings for fatherless girls from different communities. Savani was considered to be close to BJP. During these mass weddings, he has invited former Gujarat chief minister and current governor of Uttar Pradesh Anandiben Patel and Hindu political activist Sadhvi Ritambhara too. At one of these weddings in November 2014, a Guinness World Record was also created for most people sweeping the same floor which was hailed by local BJP leaders as a step forward in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan. During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there was a strong buzz that Savani had sought a ticket from BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surats-leading-bizman-educationist-joins-aap/articleshow/83901616.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Dissension roils Congress over A Revanth Reddy’s appointment||HYDERABAD: A day after the announcement of A Revanth Reddy as new Pradesh Congress Committee president, disagreements over the appointment continued to rock the party. Fellow contender and MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy on Sunday claimed that there was no recognition within the party for Congress activists and that it will soon become like TTDP in future. Speaking to reporters after returning from New Delhi, Venkat Reddy said he will not go to Gandhi Bhavan (Congress office in Hyderabad). “I came to know about the PCC (president) appointment after going to Delhi. It happened like the cash-for-vote (scam), the PCC post was sold. I will expose the evidence soon,” the MP said and added that he will be confined to his district and parliament segment. Venkat Reddy pointed out that his political future will be decided by his associates. “I will refrain from criticising Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Some TDP leaders (hinting at Revanth ) are trying to meet me but I am telling them not to me,” he said. Venkat Reddy was considered to be a strong candidate for the post of PCC chief along with Revanth Reddy. Sources close to Revanth Reddy said the new PCC president will try to take everyone on board and added that while some disturbances were expected, it is not fair to speak about them openly. “It is very inappropriate to criticise a decision taken by our leaders Sonia Gandhi and Manickam Tagore, an honest leader who presented the situation to the top brass,” a source close to Revanth Reddy said. Hitting back at Venkat Reddy’s claims, new TPCC working president Mahesh Goud said the MP had violated party’s disciplinary code. “He should withdraw his comments otherwise party will take action against him,” Goud said. Sources said that clippings of Venkat Reddy speaking against Revanth Reddy’s appointment have been sent to AICC top brass. Meanwhile, chairman of the party’s election steering committee, Marri Shashidhar Reddy stepped down from his post. While he did not quit the party, it is claimed that his resignation was in protest over the appointment of Revanth Reddy. However, senior party functionary Shabbir Ali, who is also said to be unhappy over the appointment, said that Revanth will speak to other leaders who were also unhappy over the appointment, including K Laxma Reddy who had resigned from the party on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dissension-roils-congress-over-revanths-appointment/articleshow/83904697.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

One such latest attempt is the trick to dress up the contraband in medical equipment boxes and parcel these to the desired location. Vadodara crime branch officials stumbled upon a few bootleggers who were couriering liquor to the state while they were in another state to investigate a criminal case. “We were investigating a heist and our team had gone to Chandigarh recently. It was during the investigations and questioning of a few persons that we learnt about bootleggers now using courier service to ferry illicit liquor to the state,” a crime branch official told TOI. Such liquor parcels are sent from Chandigarh to different cities in Gujarat. “The bootleggers label ‘medical equipment’ on the boxes filled with liquor bottles trying to hoodwink scrutiny and also ensuring these parcels are handled with care,” the official said, adding that amid the Covid crisis, a lot of medical equipment is transported from one place to other, and hence wouldn’t create any suspicion. “The bootleggers send some of their men to Chandigarh to take delivery of the liquor. They then courier it to Gujarat which is received here by their gang. The stock is then distributed to others,” the police said. “Bootleggers from Ahmedabad are using this trick and we have informed our counterparts there about the suspects,” the crime branch sleuth added. Also, the police will now keep an eye on the courier movements in the city and intercept or check the large consignments that may appear suspicious. Ahmedabad city crime branch officers said that they have not got any input that liquor bottles are smuggled into boxes meant for medicines for Covid-19 but they are vigilant on movement of couriers and other parcels in private buses. A city police officer said that they had on June 22 held a man from the Sola area of city with liquor bottles worth Rs 9 lakh and he had bought the alcohol in boxes of biscuits, snacks and clothes. A police officer said that accused Vinod Patel, 54, had brought the premium liquor bottles in a private bus in parcel boxes which he notified as relief for Corona patients.

The death rate is much below the 30-50% range that was seen in mucormycosis patients before the pandemic. From the total 7,359 CAM patients in Maharashtra till June 14,653 have succumbed. Of the five worst-hit districts of the state, Pune recorded a 12% mortality rate, Nashik (10%), Mumbai (9%), Nagpur (8%), and Aurangabad (7%). Experts attributed the state’s low mortality rate to swift efforts by doctors to surgically remove affected sinus tissues and smart use of available anti-mucormycosis drugs like Posaconazole and Isovuconazole, even as there were nationwide shortages of medicines like Amphotericin B. But healthcare activists said they fear a there was a larger toll, as many patients could not continue hospital treatment due to exorbitant costs and their deaths at home may have gone unreported. They also said it is still too early to calculate Covid-associated mucormycosis’ death rate. Only long-term follow-ups will determine how many recovered from the invasive fungal infection, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-records-mucormycosis-fatality-rate-of-9-over-3-mths/articleshow/83903790.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The minister was addressing a gathering of TRS activists as 200 other party activists from Ellanthakunta mandal of the Huzurabad assembly constituency joined the pink party in his presence. “Huzurabad constituency will now be relieved of Eatala,” Harish Rao added. He also alleged that Rajender had joined BJP only to protect his properties in the guise of self-respect. The minister said Telangana was prospering in all sectors under the leadership of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR).  “No other state in the country can boast of the welfare and development programmes being implemented in Telangana,” the minister said. “Apart from providing 24-hour uninterrupted power and effective implementation of Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima schemes without any recommendations is possible only in Telangana,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-joined-bjp-to-save-properties/articleshow/83904786.cms||---
---||Mumbai||25% of people getting jab daily in city are non-Mumbaikars||MUMBAI: At least 25% of the people who are getting vaccinated in the city everyday are not residents of Mumbai. So, despite administering nearly 51 lakh doses, BMC does not have an actual picture of how many Mumbaikars have taken the vaccine or how long it will take to cover its adult population. In an informal analysis, the civic body found that at certain centres, nearly a third of the doses are being administered to residents of Thane, Navi Mumbai, Dombivli, Karjat, Panvel, Palghar and Vasai-Virar. A cursory look at vaccination numbers shows Mumbai has vaccinated more than neighbouring areas. Thane district has administered only 24.22 lakh doses, less than half of Mumbai, while at Palghar it’s a little over 6 lakh. With 50.93 lakh doses administered till Saturday, Mumbai has covered 9.85 lakh people with both doses and 31.21 lakh with one. By these estimates, around 10% of the city’s estimated adult population of 93.48 lakh should be fully vaccinated, and roughly 32% partially. But there is no way to know the city’s real coverage, admitted Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, as many beneficiaries are residents of MMR. “We have estimated that we have to vaccinate at least 20% more if we wish to cover our entire population,” she added. A senior civic official said since CoWin is universal and does not provide a break-up of vaccinations based on residential addresses, it is not possible to find out the city’s real coverage. “We have no control over who gets vaccinated here as one can book a centre anywhere online,” said the official. “Many live in MMR but work in Mumbai, and demand vaccination here, which is not a completely illegitimate demand,” the official said. The official said the trend in vaccination is what has been the norm even for other aspects of healthcare. “Even in Covid treatment, upto 30% of ICU beds in city hospitals are normally occupied by MMR residents,” he said. Officials believe better availability of doses and well organised centres have been a draw for people from MMR. Although after May 1, when the Centre opened the drive for all above 18, many from the city traveled to adjoining rural districts and got vaccinated there. The higher concentration of private hospitals too gave it a leg up above the rest, said the civic official. Private hospitals have vaccinated over 12 lakh people since the beginning of May in Mumbai. It, however, does not matter how much individual cities and districts have vaccinated as the target is to vaccinate the entire population for it to make a dent on transmission, said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a technical advisor to the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/25-of-people-getting-jab-daily-in-city-are-non-mumbaikars/articleshow/83903828.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Amritsar||SAD leader smells mining scandal, Congress MLA for action against party black sheep||BATHINDA: Former MLA of Shiromani Akali Dal Sarup Chand Singla has levelled allegations of mining in the premises of now closed Bathinda thermal plant. He has alleged that the fly ash of the thermal plant and the sand is being mined illegally and is being used to lay interlocking tiles in various areas of Bathinda. Singla has termed it as a big scandal which needs to be unearthed. He claimed that when he tried to expose the misdeeds, a JCB driver tried to attack him on Sunday morning. Speaking to mediapersons at his residence, the SAD leader said soil adulteration is going in a big way in the material used in laying interlocking tiles in streets and all the soil material is being supplied from thermal plant premises. Singla said, “I did a sting operation in the morning and prepared a video on how fly ash and sand mining is going unabated using poclain and JCB machines.” He said a mafia is working at the thermal plant which has the patronage of finance minister Manpreet Badal’s relatives. He demanded a high-level inquiry into it and threatened to stage a half-naked sit-in at the chief minister’s residence if his demand is not met. Singla alleged that officials of Bathinda municipal corporation are also involved in the matter. He alleged that under the stewardship of the finance minister, the contract for dismantling of the thermal plant has been given at a very cheap rate. The leader said he would bring the matter to the notice of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. In a tweet over Sarup Singla’s video clip, Giddarbaha Congress MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring asked chief minister Amarinder Singh to take action against people who are behind all this who are pulling the Congress down. When contacted, Manpreet Badal’s close relative Jaijeet Johal refuted the allegations and said as elections are coming near, Singla is desperate to defame the FM. “We have not noticed any illegal activity and millions of tonnes of fly ash is stored there which cement factory Ambuja Cement used and cleaning it. The sand from the thermal plant is not being used in laying interlocking tiles. The contractors have shown the bills of sand.” Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu retweeted Warring's tweet for looking into sand mining issue at Bathinda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sad-leader-smells-mining-scandal-cong-mla-for-action-against-party-black-sheep/articleshow/83903803.cms||---

Faizan Raza, during an interview with a TV channel, had allegedly announced the reward for beheading the priest, Darshan Bharti. After the video went viral on social media, police took cognizance and registered an FIR under sections 153-A (provoking enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth etc.) and 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) of IPC against Raza at Izzatnagar police station. He was arrested on Saturday. Raza, in his statement, had claimed that he announced a reward as he was hurt after Bharti “made a statement that all the Muslims should be moved out of Uttarakhand.” Later, he released another statement on social media saying that he was “mentally unstable” when he made the controversial statement. Raza had also urged Uttarakhand’s chief minister to take action against Bharti for his “statement against the Muslims”. Reacting to the statement of Raza, Bharti shared a message on his social media account that he “cannot be sacred of religious fanatics and he will continue his campaign against them to save Hindu religion.” Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan said, “Raza had released a statement on social media in which he had announced a reward of Rs 1 crore for beheading a particular person. We have arrested him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/madrassa-manager-arrested-for-announcing-reward-for-beheading-uttarakhand-priest/articleshow/83901684.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

He was speaking at a webinar organised by the Old Goa-based ICAR-CCARI on ‘Balanced use of Fertilisers and Vermicomposting’ with the aim to raise the awareness among the farmers about the balanced use of the fertilisers and how to do vermicomposting. He also referred to the Vedas for the scientific agricultural practices for the sustainable agricultural development. Naik stressed upon the soil fertility related constraints of Goa and the need to correct it through scientific approaches. He urged the farmers to do soil testing and ensure a balanced use of fertilisers through soil test-based fertiliser application. The ‘Fertilizer Calculator Goa’ is a mobile application for farmers of the state and adjoining coastal region to assist in decision making of smarter and balanced use of fertilisers. The webinar was held in commemoration of India’s 75 years of Independence as Bharat Ka Amrut Mahotsav. Dr Parveen Kumar, director, ICAR – CCARI, Goa spoke of the importance of balanced use of the chemical fertilisers to improve the agricultural production, productivity and farmers’ income.

The accident took place at 4am on Delhi-Nainital highway, on the outskirts of Rampur city, police said. The bodies of businessman Manoj Jain (45) and his friends Rajendra Kumar (40), Sonu Singh and Deepak Kumar were pulled out from the SUV which had turned turtle in the drain. Station house officer (SHO) of Ganj police station, Krishna Avtaar, said, “Manoj Jain was the owner of a garment factory in Brahmpuri, East Delhi. He lived there too. The other three victims used to work with him and were friends too. They had left for Nainital late in the night and Rajendra was driving the SUV. He possibly fell asleep at the wheels at a turn and the SUV went into a drain.” The SHO said that all the victims could have died due to drowning as the drain was deep. “We completed the rescue operation within 30 minutes of the accident. But the drain was deep and all the victims were dead when the car was pulled out with the help of a crane.” Jain’s family members, including the son, reached Rampur by afternoon. “His son Prince Jain told us that the Nainital trip was planned suddenly. But he was expecting his father to return after a day,” the SHO added. The family members refused to speak with the media persons. Additional superintendent of police (ASP) Sansaar Singh told TOI, “The road where the accident happened is double-lane and is in a good shape. The driver lost balance of the steering wheel near a turn. The post-mortem report will confirm if this accident was a result of drunken driving.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/out-for-nainital-jaunt-delhi-bizman-3-friends-killed-in-road-accident-in-rampur/articleshow/83901726.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The count of ‘reconciled’ deaths has crossed 25,000 since the exercise was started on May 17. Maharashtra’s overall Covid fatality now stands at 1,21,286 while the cumulative tally of positive cases is 60,36,821. On Sunday, for the fourth day in a row, the state has added less than 10,000 cases. A total of 9,974 cases were detected, of which the highest (1,485) were reported from Kolhapur district followed by Sangli (1,205). It was almost double the number of fresh infections reported by bigger cities like Mumbai and Pune. Although marginal, daily detections in the state has shown an increase every day for the last three days. From 9,677 new cases on Friday, it increased to 9,812 on Saturday and 9,974 on Sunday. In terms of ‘new’ fatalities, the state has been reporting less than 200 deaths now daily. So much so that, of the 25,942 Covid deaths added by the state in June, 7,069 were current deaths while 18,873 were reconciled. Mumbai once again reported more than 700 (729) cases on Sunday after showing a marginal dip for the past two days — 693 on Friday and 648 on Saturday. The city for the past one month has reported an average of 700 cases daily, although a steady drop in fatalities has been seen. Mumbai’s cumulative tally has now reached 7,20,349 while deaths have touched 12,646. Additional municipal commissioner said the city’s daily positivity rate is hovering around 2% and testing has been enhanced. Kolhapur is not just contributing to cases but also deaths. Of the 143 deaths reported by the state on Sunday, 35 deaths were from Kolhapur. In comparison, Mumbai and Pune had reported 13 deaths each, while Nashik district had reported a dozen deaths. Other districts, like Ahmednagar, are adding nearly 400 cases but are reporting deaths in single digits. Dr Anil Mali, civic surgeon of Kolhapur, said that the cases are still being detected in big numbers from the peri-urban and rural areas of the state. About presence of variants that could be driving the surge, he said several samples have been sent for genome sequencing, but they haven’t been informed of any variants so far. “We are carrying out nearly 25,000 to 30,000 tests daily and seeing a positivity rate of around 9%. Since we are doing more tests, we could be picking up more cases,” he added. A total of 8,562 people were discharged from hospitals and home isolation, taking the count of discharges to 57,90,113.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/for-4th-day-in-a-row-maharashtra-cases-below-10000-but-kolhapur-remains-a-concern/articleshow/83908622.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Paediatric beds in more hospitals now as 3rd Covid wave looms||MUMBAI: Several peripheral hospitals that didn’t have designated Covid beds for paediatric patients in the first or second wave have now started creating them in anticipation of the third wave. The civic medical colleges have also started training community physicians in identifying and treating paediatric Covid since the past few weeks even as doctors have said that the fear of more children contracting the virus in the thrid wave is unsubstantiated. The count of paediatric beds will touch 1,500 once all facilities are operational, of which 1,300 are coming up in jumbos and 200 at medical colleges and peripheral hospitals. As per BMC plans, the count of paediatric beds in the medical colleges — KEM, Sion, Nair and RN Cooper — will go up to 82 from 34. The paediatric ICU beds for Covid will be increased to 27 from 22 at these colleges, while neonatal ICU beds will be pushed to 30 with an addition of 10 beds. “Paediatric Covid beds will account for almost 10 per cent of the city’s total Covid beds,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. The four upcoming jumbo facilities in the city will have 200-250 paediatric beds each, while Nesco in Goregaon is adding up to 400 beds, Kakani added. In peripheral hospitals, the number of Covid paediatric isolation beds will go up to 103 from the existing 18. Majority of these beds will be created at Ghatkopar’s Rajawadi, Babasaheb Ambedkar in Kandivli, Bandra Bhabha and Bhabha Kurla hospitals. Dr Vidya Thakur, medical superintendent of Rajawadi Hospital said that of the 70 paediatric beds in the hospital, 20 will now be earmarked for Covid positive children. There were no Covid beds for children till now, she added. Kakani said the BMC is also procuring medical equipment needed to treat children. Upto 5% of children have required hospitalisation as seen in the first and second waves, although the majority are those with comorbidities. Dr Mukesh Agarwal of Parel’s KEM Hospital said they too have started working on augmenting beds for children. “But it is important to understand that the fear of more children getting affected are unfounded. Since more adults were affected more children were affected too in the second wave. Their overall share in Covid infection has remained consistent at 10% of overall cases,” he said. He said paediatric admissions are concentrated more in the age group of 12-18 years. Besides infrastructure augmentation, the civic body has begun webinars as well as physical training of physicians. Two weeks ago, as many as 700 doctors had logged in for a webinar on understanding the signs and symptoms. In the seminar held by Sion Hospital, head of paediatrics Dr Radha Ghildiyal emphasised on five key parameters — temperature, pulse, respiration, oxygen saturation and urine output.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-paediatric-beds-in-more-hosps-now-as-3rd-covid-wave-looms/articleshow/83903914.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Addressing a rare all-party meeting, KCR said Dalits were oppressed and exploited section from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in the country, and governments across India must play a major role in stopping this. “Any negligence would ruin the future generations and the rulers will be responsible for it, so let us look after them,” he said. Announcing various measures, including a direct benefit transfer (DBT) for Dalits, KCR called for a combined action for their upliftment, in addition to existing funds allocated for SC development. A new scheme in the name of Chief Minister Dalit Empowerment Scheme (CMDES) will provide Rs 10 lakh for 100 families each in 119 assembly segments as self-support scheme. For the proposed scheme, following the DBT model in Rythu Bandhu for farmers, Rs 1,200 crore will be spent. “The government has decided to work religiously for Dalit empowerment like it did in irrigation and agriculture sectors. We will examine the possibility of providing reservation for Dalit youth in granting licenses for business management and self-supporting schemes,” he said. The government is also considering relaxation in income ceiling for eligibility in the scheme of oversees education scholarship for the Dalit students. “To empower the youth, art and culture forms should be utilised in the media,” KCR told officials. The chief minister also directed officials to conduct a census on agriculture land available with Dalit society in the state. There are 7.76 lakh SC farmers in the state owning 13,58,000 acres. “How much is remaining with them and how much is gone, should be calculated and resources of the land parcels also should be estimated. If needed entire administration should focus on this only for 15 days and report should be submitted,” he told officials. Agreeing to the suggestion of the leaders in the meeting, he also agreed to consider fixed and safe payment of salaries with Pay Revision facility for the safai workers. During the meeting, which lasted for more than 11 hours in Pragati Bhavan, the CM sought suggestions from all the political parties on the action needed to be taken to empower the Dalit community and instil confidence in them to progress.

---||India||Announce statehood of J&K in July parliament session, demands Azad||Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad, who was part of the J&K team that met the PM, said the Centre should announce restoration of statehood in the July session of Parliament as Covid-19 can delay the plan to hold polls. Azad told TOI, “GOI must reassure the people of J&K that their historical domiciliary rights and state services will be protected." At the meeting called by the PM with political parties of J&K, the government did not respond to the Congress's demand of domiciliary rights on land ownership and employment? Is it because of the shadow of Article 370?GOI must reassure the people of J&K that their historical domiciliary rights concerning land and state services will be protected. This provision has existed historically since 1925. It is a requirement keeping in view historical, geographical and economic status of the region. It is there in Uttarakhand, northeast, Himachal Pradesh. If these provisions can be there in other states, why not in J&K? It has nothing to do with other things. Also, it can be given before statehood or assembly elections. I raised five points on behalf of the Congress at the meeting. But the government did not respond to two points - domiciliary rights and rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits. The government has promised elections and statehood. In your view, how long can this process take?In 2018, J&K was a full-fledged state under governor's rule. There can still be a state with a governor, and delimitation can take place under the governor, while we await elections. Statehood has nothing to do with elections. What is the problem in giving it? The government of India should announce statehood in the coming July-August session of Parliament through a one-line bill. It should show magnanimity. It will be a great gesture on its part. What is driving this demand for immediate grant of statehood?At the Prime Minister's meeting, the government said elections will happen after delimitation. But this may take a lot of time as everything depends on the Covid-19 situation. If there is no third wave, it may take 5-6 months, but otherwise, we don't know. It is uncertain, it may take a long time. But if statehood is announced now, it will ease things. It will fulfil one of the big demands of the region and help in confidence building. You said the meeting has removed a lot of misunderstanding between the political parties of J&K and the Centre. But the government had lashed out at J&K parties earlier.This meeting took place after a long, long, long time. Now, we hope that such meetings will be convened every 3-4 months. A lot happened in the past because of mistrust and misunderstanding. Had such meetings been held quarterly, then we would have understood each other better and there would not have been so much confusion. Doing everything through the agencies or back channel or governor does not solve problems. Talk to the political leaders directly. I expect that GOI will call such meetings more often.. In the past too, there have been bickering between the Centre and states, besides J&K. But in the end, all parties come together in national interest, and forego, forgive and forget. That is what has happened here. It is a sign of multi-party democracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-kashmir-statehood-will-be-great-gesture-ghulam-nabi-azad/articleshow/83908250.cms||---

Protesters claims cops allegedly beat up an angadia firm employee for not wearing mask on Saturday afternoon. The call given by local chamber of commerce and industry was fully supported by traders and businessman of the town. Digvijaysinh Zala (44), a resident of Dhrol town, lodged a complaint against head constable Mahipat Solanki and constable Nilesh Bhimani under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) among others. According to sources, Zala was sitting at PM Angadia firm office at Hilal Complex when Solanki and Bhimani entered his office to send a parcel through the angadia firm. Both allegedly pulled up Zala for not wearing mask and later even thrashed him. They also took him to the police station where Zala was beaten up again. Zala received severe injuries near his eye and had to be treated in Rajkot after he was given primary treatment at Dhrol. After the news spread, Zala’s community members as well as businessmen and traders rushed to police station demanding strict actions against the two cops. Local traders too alleged that they are being harassed by cops regularly over maintenance of Covid-19 guidelines which they demanded be stopped immediately. A cross complaint was also lodged by head constable Solanki against Digvijaysinh Zala for obstructing public servant from discharging duty and also under sections of Epidemic Disease Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dhrol-shuts-down-protesting-police-excesses-over-mask-rule/articleshow/83901909.cms||---
---||Pune||MYRE raises funds on Magarpatta property||Pune: MYRE Capital, which calls itself a tech-based fractional ownership platform for commercial properties, has raised Rs 50 crore from its property at Magarpatta Cybercity, which it said was indicative of the safety of the commercial property market. The space measuring 46,800sqft was acquired by MYRE — a venture of architecture firm Morphogenesis — last December. The venture to offer fractional ownership to investors started in February. The property is currently occupied by a multinational software development company. The firm’s founder said there was interest in fractional ownership in commercial properties from all walks of life. Pune, according to recent reports, has one of the lowest vacancy rates in commercial properties, especially in the ones occupied by IT and IT-enabled services (ITeS). “Commercial properties have definitely been hit by the pandemic. However, office spaces occupied by IT and ITeS firms maintained low vacancy rates, and Pune has one of the rates. For IT and ITeS firms, rentals form only about 2-2.5% of their topline, and they are maintaining their spaces, because some day or the other, they will come back to their office spaces. And Magarapatta’s advantage is that it is an integrated township, where people can walk to work,” Aryaman Vir, founder and CEO of MYRE, said. He added that many have shown interest in investing in properties, such as top executives, accountants, doctors, among others. Their investment would be managed by its tech-based asset management platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/myre-raises-funds-on-magarpatta-property/articleshow/83903962.cms||---

Officials have warned travellers to compulsorily wear masks and follow all Covid norms while travelling to work and back home. For unauthorised travel in suburban trains in which commuters were caught with fake ID cards, a total of 3,000 cases were registered in which fines to the tune of Rs 15 lakh collected in the past one month, sources said. In case of ticketless travellers, 28,910 were caught in April, 32,907 passengers in May and 30,346 till June 24, said a CR spokesperson. The fines collected in April, May and June were Rs 1.04 crore, Rs 1.18 crore and Rs 1.09 crore respectively. At present, only healthcare, frontline workers and government employees are allowed to travel in Mumbai suburban locals. The passengers, who were found carrying fake ID cards, were caught between April 28 and June 24. The action was taken against them as they violated the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, a CR official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cr-fines-1500-mask-less-commuters-in-2-months/articleshow/83903973.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Keep emerging variants under watch, say experts||HYDERABAD: Health experts have called for a strong surveillance on at least four emerging variants of Covid-19 apart from the Delta plus (B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1), which has already been designated as a variant of concern (VOC). The emerging novel coronavirus variants that should be watched out for are B.1.617.3, a sibling of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), B.1.1.318, which has 14 mutations, and Lambda (C.37), which was designated as a variant under investigation on June 23. Kappa (B.1.617.1), another sibling of the Delta variant, too needs to be closely monitored, though it has thus far been less infectious than Delta or Delta plus. While B.1.617.3 and B.1.1.318 are already present in India, Lambda is yet to make its way into the country. However, it is spreading fast around the world and experts fear that opening of international air travel may bring a cocktail of new variants including Lambda into India. They also called for more genomic surveillance to identify and find solutions to emerging variants. The variant B.1.617.3, a sibling of the Delta variant, needs to be watched out. The double mutant (B.1.617), first identified in Maharashtra, gave rise to three variants – B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3. The WHO had named B.1.617.1 as Kappa and B.1.617.2 as Delta. It did not name the B.1.617.3 variant and it is now clubbed under Kappa group. As of June 22, India has reported 148 genome sequences of B.1.617.3 from total worldwide sequences of 161. As far as the Kappa variant is concerned, India has thus far reported 3,083 of 4,217 sequences from around the world. The variant B.1.1.318 contains the mutation E484K. According to GISAID data, India has reported two genome sequences of this emerging variant of 173 reported around the world. According to Dr Vighnesh Naidu Y, consultant physician, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, viruses tend to mutate as they multiply, and mutations are tiny errors in the original genetic makeup of the organism. “As these mutate, they change the ability of the virus to infect in terms of faster rate of transmission, increased virulence and their ability to evade our immune response,” he told TOI calling for scaling up genome sequencing of the virus and its emerging strains. The Public Health England (PHE) announced Lambda as a variant to be kept under watch as it was reported from several countries. Currently, no cases of Lambda have been detected in India, and increased genome sequencing may lead to its finding in the country. Warning that resumption of international air traffic may bring new variants like Lambda, senior geneticist Dr M Khaja said the PHE has noticed a combination of mutations in the Lambda variant. The GISAID data shows that 1,845 sequences of Lambda have been posted from across the world. None of them is from India. The PHE, in its June 25 report, warned that Lambda has potential of increased transmissibility and possible increased resistance to neutralising antibodies. Lambda has mutations in the spike protein including notable mutations like G75V, T76I, L452Q, F490S, D614G and T859N. The effectiveness of existing vaccines need to be tested against Lambda. Dr Vighnesh told TOI that continued genome sequencing of emerging variants will help in understanding the kind of symptoms they might present, the rapid spread or severity of the disease. Such studies will also help experts understand if the mutations have no consequence to humans. “The more we test the better we understand the prevailing strains and can put in place mechanisms to check the spread and strategies as to how to manage the sick,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/keep-emerging-variants-under-watch-say-experts/articleshow/83905940.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra visitors to Karnataka must have negative RT-PCR or one vaccine dose||KOLHAPUR: Amid marginal rise in Covid cases and cases of delta-plus variant being reported in the state, the Maharashtra residents visiting Karnataka have to carry negative RT-PCR report or at least take one dose of the vaccine. The decision has come into effect from Saturday. The Karnataka domicile travellers are getting randomly tested at the checkposts through rapid -antigen tests. M G Hiremath, the deputy commissioner of Belagavi district, visited the Kognoli checkpost on the border of Kolhapur and Belagavi. Hiremath told TOI, “Karnataka government has ordered the districts along Maharashtra-Karnataka border to keep an eye on entry of the visitors. I have asked the authorities to set screening and testing facility at the checkpost. We will screen Karnataka domiciled travellers and carry out rapid antigen tests of those with Covid symptoms. The reports will be sent to the administration of their respective village or town. For Maharashtra domiciled travellers, either RT-PCR negative report or one dose vaccination is compulsory. This applies to entry points along all border districts as per Karnataka government order.” Hiremath also said the rule applies to the Maharashtra residents travelling by state transport and private buses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/maha-visitors-to-ktaka-must-have-ve-rt-pcr-or-1-vax-dose/articleshow/83899827.cms||---

The company said, however, that high input prices were a cause for concern. Finolex reported a 16% year-on-year increase in its revenues for 2020-21 fiscal, standing at around Rs3,463 crore. Its YOY EBITDA and profits were also significantly up, with the former up by 122% to around Rs1,062 crore, and the latter jumping by around 125% to Rs 728 crore. “The March quarter of FY20 and the first quarter of FY21 were hit by the lockdown. We got good volumes across sectors in Q3, especially over Diwali and the New Year. Q4 was going well when the second wave hit,” Niraj Kedia, deputy CFO, told TOI. The company shares closed 1.4% higher, at Rs173.65, on BSE on Friday evening. Kedia said that the company’s plants, including the one near Pune, did not have to shut during the recent restrictions. Kedia said despite the company making its own PVC, the high prices for the commodity — up 60-80% in the past year — are worrisome. He said the lack of a nationwide lockdown was a ray of hope in FY22. “There are hints of uplift in some sectors, like construction. There has been less of that uplift in agricultural sector as shops have been closed and customers generally go to dealers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hints-of-uplift-in-market-says-finolex/articleshow/83903988.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Chandigarh||Long Covid could cause health crisis: PGI doctors||CHANDIGARH: In a review study recently published in the “International Journal of General Medicine” journal by PGI doctors, it has been inferred that due to long Covid there will be a health crisis as most unhealthy patients will be in hospital even after the pandemic. Moreover, there are no comprehensive studies where data of long Covid patients has been compiled to understand the pattern in the country. The study analysed risk factors of long Covid as old age, disease severity and those who were on ventilator and had a long stay in the hospital, deranged/abnormal blood profile, diabetes, hypertension , obesity etc. “There is no wide awareness of the long-Covid-19 case scenarios even among healthcare workers. Thus it becomes imperative to emphasise this emerging clinical entity and disseminate awareness,” said Dr Mandeep Garg, lead author from the department of radiodiagnosis and imaging, PGI. He said, “there should be a single point of contact for follow up and then depending upon the initial scrutiny of symptoms, the patients can be further referred to super speciality clinics.” During the first wave, ICMR decided to collate data from most tertiary care centres on long Covid. But the exercise could not persist as doctors believe patients lacked the will to come for post Covid follow up. The study mentioned that long-Covid-19 subjects need close follow-up for monitoring early, intermediate and late complications. The requirement of oxygen supplementation, palliative care, rehabilitation, counselling and other psycho-social needs should be assessed and addressed immediately. According to the WHO, almost 80% to 85% of Covid-19 infections are mild or asymptomatic and resolve completely like any other uncomplicated seasonal flu, 10% to 15% are severe illnesses requiring hospitalisation/oxygen supplementation and about 5% are critical illnesses requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. “Any illness after four weeks of Covid is taken as long Covid,” said Dr Mandeep. Generally, majority of patients show complete recovery within three to four weeks of Covid-19 infection, but few patients continue to experience its lingering effects and develop protracted illness/medical complications that can have lasting health problems. This is called Long-Covid-19 “The dedicated centre for follow up should be a one stop centre and should not be restricted to a specific duration. For instance, one cannot call a patient after a month or so, but as and when it is required for any patient, doctors must evaluate,” said Dr Mandeep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/long-covid-could-cause-health-crisis-pgi-docs/articleshow/83901872.cms||Shimona Kanwar

It was all filmed and a purported video of the "dowry act" has gone viral. In the video, a man can be seen bragging about the cash, keys of an SUV and other jewellery. While in the next shot, the bride can be seen weighed down and almost entirely covered in a gold necklace. According to locals, the dowry was worth more than a crore. In an "obscene" display of wealth, a wedding ceremony in UP's #Shamli showed off #Dowry - Rs 41 lakh in cash, bride… https://t.co/zoLTZumaP8— TOIWestUP (@TOIWestUP) 1624860133000The Muslim wedding took place in Shamli's Thanabhawan area recently. The bride, in her early 20s, belongs to a family of cloth merchants who work in Gujarat’s Surat. She is from Shamli while the groom, who is also a local, has a garment business in Karnataka. Police have launched a probe after scanning the wedding video clips. "Investigation has begun and the I-T department has also been roped in," Thanabhawan DSP Amit Saxena said on Sunday. Meanwhile, members of the community in Shamli and Muzaffarnagar districts have demanded strict action against such families for their "obscene display of wealth" at a time when "poor fathers are finding it difficult to marry off their daughters". Mohammad Khalid Qureshi, a prominent community member, said, "Such acts will only create a major hurdle for women whose families are not well-off." "Watching this, other young men in the community will also demand cash and cars in weddings. In fact, such weddings are becoming a trend now," the Khatauli resident added. Several such incidents are taking place and this filth in our society must stop, Shameem Qureshi, district president of Jamiatul Quresh, said. "We are going to call a panchayat soon. Those who encourage dowry will be dealt with appropriately," he added. Incidentally, this was the third such incident in the region in a week where a Muslim family had filmed the dowry and put it on social networking sites. Earlier, two purported video clips showing cash in lakhs being given to the groom were widely circulated. Wedding ceremonies in traditional Muslim families used to be a simple affair till a few years ago. It’s not anymore. Recently, the suicide by 23-year-old Ayesha Banu Makrani, who was allegedly harassed for dowry, in Gujarat, forced prominent clerics to give a boycott call of all such weddings.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: ‘Kids need exercise to beat post Covid complications’||CHANDIGARH: Children must be made to exercise to overcome multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MISC), a post covid complication in children, as those who are obese are at risk, say PGI doctors. Also, due to an increase in screen time attributed to online classes, children have been physically inactive and are gaining weight, observed doctors. “Those who are obese are at a greater risk for MISC. Also, as far as the third wave is concerned, the peak can be regulated with our behaviour. If we wear masks, observe social distancing and get vaccinated, the numbers can be less than any other wave,” said prof Meenu Singh, head of the department of pulmonology services, PGI. There have been some estimates from the studies in the US which found that the incidence of MISC in children was 0.1% of the Covid cases reported in them. “In Chandigarh, it has been estimated that during the second wave, between 42 and 252 children might be susceptible to MISC,” said a doctor at the institute. Even those who are asymptomatic must be watched for the same, PGI doctors said. Common clinical symptoms are fever for more than three days, elevated inflammatory markers, rash, conjunctivitis, gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, among others. PGI’s specialist underlined the need to watch post covid MISC in children carefully. “This is a year old syndrome and we are getting an increasing number of cases,” said Prof M Jayashree, in-charge of the pediatric emergency and paediatric intensive care unit, PGIMER. Though pediatricians feel there has been no increase in the number of cases of Covid cases in the second wave as compared to the first wave, the same is expected in the third wave. “But as the virus has mutated the transmission of infection has increased. This makes children vulnerable to Covid. Most of the children had mild to moderate virus,” said a PGI faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kids-need-exercise-to-beat-post-covid-complications/articleshow/83901921.cms||Shimona Kanwar

According to the criteria announced by chief minister M K Stalin on Saturday, Class X board examination marks will be given 50% weightage, class XI board exam 20% and internal assessment and practical exams in Class XII the remaining 30%. The minister said in Trichy on Sunday that the job for teachers has become easier as these marks are already available in the portal. “Teachers don’t have to visit schools to see the register to enter marks. Since both Class X and XI are board exams, the data is already available in the portal in Chennai,” he said. On reopening of schools with minimum number of students as Covid-19 cases have come down, he said parents are concerned about sending their children to school. An appropriate decision would be taken after consulting the health department and Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). Earlier in the day, he distributed Covid assistance of Rs 4,000 each to temple priests, bhattacharyars and pujaris, who have no monthly salary, at an event in Rockfort complex, which houses Thayumanavar and Ucchi Pillayar temple.

As per level 4 Covid restrictions, only essential shops are allowed to open till 4 pm on weekdays while there is complete lockdown on the weekend. Meanwhile, traders from Kolhapur city have decided to defy Desai’s order and are going to open non-essential shops from Monday. A decision in this regard was taken during the meeting of representatives of all trading associations of Kolhapur city was held at the office of Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries on Sunday afternoon. The traders were seen enraged by the state government’s changing of stand to decide the positivity rate. Earlier positivity rate was fixed irrespective of the kind of tests done — RT-PCR and rapid antigen test. Hoping that the positivity rate will come down if the tests are increased, the district administration increased antigen tests up to 30,000 per day. And it brought the test rate below 10% qualifying the district to be in level 3 of Covid restrictions under which the non-essential shops are allowed to open. Sanjay Shete, KCCI president, said, “By earlier criteria the district qualifies for level 3 restrictions. We have shops shut for the last three months and will not afford to keep it shut for one more day. Therefore, we have unanimously decided to defy the order and open shops at 7am on Monday.” The traders claimed that the administration assured them to bring down the positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy rate as per level 3 restrictions. Meanwhile, Kolhapur district on Sunday reported 1,637 fresh cases and 33 Covid deaths. A total of 1,350 Covid patients were discharged after recovering.Satara district recorded 977 fresh cases and 15 patients died due to Covid on Sunday. In Sangli district, 907 people tested positive and 17 patients succumbed to Covid on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/level-4-covid-restrictions-to-continue-in-kolhapur-district/articleshow/83899846.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Survey on to gather info on persons with disabilities||PANAJI: The Disability Rights Association of Goa has received survey responses from 100 persons with disability in the state. After finding that the state doesn’t have adequate information on persons with disabilities (PwD), the association decided to do a survey. An online survey is being circulated through local bodies and various groups to ascertain the number of PwDs and type and extend of disability, whether they have disability certificates, whether they are registered for the government’s Dayanand Social Security Scheme and whether they applied for the Unique Disability Identity Card (UDID) issued by the ministry of social justice and empowerment. The survey also covers the type of education received, , educational qualifications, employment status, type of employment, employment exchange registration status and whether they would like the association to take up any issues with the government. Association president Avelino de Sa told TOI that the government data on persons with disabilities is restricted to the 2011 census and puts the number of persons with disabilities in the state at around 33,000. “Ten years have passed and the number of disabilities have also increased from 7 to 21. The government doesn’t have detailed data so this survey was essential. Once we have the data, we can plan skill development programmes, jobs and try to get more facilities from the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/survey-on-to-gather-info-on-persons-with-disabilities/articleshow/83906002.cms||Lisa Monteiro

With petrol and diesel prices on a frequent rise for over a month now, transporters said that they would wear black armbands and would hold protests in front of the different RTO offices and collectorates across the state on Monday. “This is a token protest and transportation would not be stopped. However, as we come under the ambit of essential services, we cannot go on a strike suddenly and a month’s notice needs to be given. On Monday, the notice will be served to the local administration authorities demanding that the prices of fuel be reduced within a month or else from August, there would be an indefinite chakka jam, which means all transport vehicles would be stopped from plying across the country. We will be forced to take the step from August 1 if prices don’t come down,” Baba Shinde, the president of the Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna and the director of All India Motor Transport Congress in Maharashtra told TOI. In Pune, the prices of petrol and diesel saw a consecutive rise on Sunday with a litre of petrol costing Rs104.2 and a litre of diesel costing Rs94.59. “Going by the increase, we expect the price of one litre of diesel to touch Rs100 within a month. Similarly, the cost of a litre of petrol is also expected to touch Rs110 by July-end if the frequency of increase in its rate doesn’t stop,” a representative of a petrol station in the city told TOI. Ali Daruwala, the national spokesperson of the All India Petrol Dealers Association, had earlier said that diesel touching the Rs100-mark was inevitable. However, on Sunday, Daruwalla, giving an update, said, “In a recent selected meeting held between some ministers and the Prime Minister, it has been decided to slash taxes on fuel and provide relief.” Petrol prices crossed the Rs100-mark in Pune in the last week of May. For around two months now, the prices of both petrol and diesel were the highest ever in Pune and also in different parts of the state. “With certain relaxations such as restaurants allowing dine-ins, the transporters have also started to get more jobs now, compared to the previous scenario. Hence, they are in a position now to increase the transportation costs, which ultimately results in the prices of all types of commodities going up. However, we cannot keep on increasing the transportation costs as ultimately, it will hit the transporters in the longer run, as business is not the same as before. Reduction of value added tax in fuel is of utmost importance for lowering the prices. A chakka jam means that essentials will not get transported and it will cause more issues to both the transporters as well as the wholesalers, retailers, shops, restaurant and consumers,” Shinde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transporters-to-observe-black-day-as-fuel-prices-rise/articleshow/83904065.cms||Joy Sengupta

The places fall under ward number number 2 to 10 of the Karur municipality. He said officials will collect the petitions directly from people during the weekly Makkal Sabha meetings from next week onwards. The initiative was to ensure that officials from various departments reach out to the public to listen to their grievances and find solutions to them at the earliest. Saying that Makkal Sabha meetings will be organised every week in the district, the minister asked the officials to address the grievances instantly during the meetings or within 30 days from receiving the grievances. He also promised to open MLA offices in all the 43 wards of the Karur municipality. The offices will be operated as libraries and people can pay electricity bills there and apply for various government schemes such as the e-seva centres. It will also receive grievance petitions from people. It was part of a list of 100 promises to the people of his constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/senthil-balaji-conducts-makkal-sabha-in-karur-dist/articleshow/83901919.cms||---
---||Thane||After resource crunch, vax shortage in Kalyan-Dombivli||THANE: Kalyan-Dombivli trails other satellite centres outside Mumbai in immunization coverage despite a higher positivity rate compared to Navi Mumbai and Thane, according to official data. Activists blame administration inefficiency including inadequacy of centres, problems in booking slots and abruptly aborted vaccination drives. Experts said the problem needs tackling on priority because the majority of residents stay in dense and congested localities and travel frequently for work, making them vulnerable to the virus. Data shows the volume of fully immunized residents here is less compared to neighbouring cities. The percentage in the twin cities which have a combined population of over 19 lakh is a meagre 3% compared to Thane (5%) and Navi Mumbai (6.6%). The overall positivity rate here is high at 7%, adding to worries, say experts. Officials admitted that the twin cities were receiving inadequate supplies of vaccine, which forced them to abruptly halt immunization drives. Santosh Nimbalkar, who heads the civic vaccination wing said, “We asked for 10 lakh vaccines but we received less stock, due to which we were unable to vaccinate more citizens.” BJP MLA Ravindra Chavan said he has complained about unequal distribution of vials despite Kalyan-Dombivli’s high caseload of 1.35 lakh. “These suburbs are the second worst-affected areas in the metropolitan region after Mumbai and should have been accorded adequate stock,” he said. “Many vaccination centres in the suburbs are often shut due to the shortage. Even today, only two civic operated centres were operational. A majority of the population is working class and can’t make numerous trips to the centres. If the state wants to fight Covid-19, they should vaccinate more people in most affected areas,” said activist Shrinivas Ghanekar. Kalyan-Dombivli administration has been recognised for its handling of the pandemic despite scarce resources and understaffing in public medical facilities. Officials here roped in private doctors with the help of the IMA and activated a network of family physicians to watch over patients. Shiv Sena MP Dr Shrikant Shinde from the area blamed the central government for vaccine shortage. He said he was confident supply will be restored now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/after-resource-crunch-vax-shortage-in-kalyan-dombivli/articleshow/83904089.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Trichy||Call to hand over roads in Pachamalai to highways department for better upkeep||TRICHY: To tap the potential of Pachamalai hill station in Trichy district, local people and road safety enthusiasts have demanded that the poorly maintained roads owned and maintained by the forest department and local bodies in the hills be handed over to the state highways department. The forest department and rural local bodies maintain a portion of the roads in the hill station situated on the borders of Trichy and Salem districts. The delay in redeveloping and maintaining the roads is causing inconvenience and safety lapses besides hampering the socio-economic development of the region, local people said. Pachamalai hills near Thuraiyur can be accessed through two major gateways including Adivaaram Moolakkadu and Sobanapuram on the eastern and western sides of the hills. The 15-km stretch between Sobanapuram check post (forest) and Top Sengattupatti, a major link through which TNSTC buses reach Pachamalai, is in a bad shape for years. The road maintained by the forest department is peppered with potholes, making it difficult for the trucks reaching Pachamalai to procure tapioca. There are also local body roads interconnecting numerous hamlets and unexplored waterfalls in Thonur, Silaiyur and Koraiyar hill villages, said local people. “In other hill stations including Yercaud and Kollimalai, the state highways department is maintaining the roads. Better connectivity to the remote hamlets will encourage tourism, and the tribal people living there will capitalise on it,” N Saravanan, a Thuraiyur-based road safety activist, said. “There seems to be an administrative issue in transferring the Pachamalai roads from the forest department to the state highways,” S Stalin Kumar, Thuraiyur MLA, said. The state highways department said they have no issues in taking over while the forest department said that they have to examine official records to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/call-to-hand-over-roads-in-pachamalai-to-highways-dept-for-better-upkeep/articleshow/83901976.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Kolhapur||87 Covid deaths case: Doctors brother of main accused arrested in Sangli||KOLHAPUR: The Sangli police have arrested Madan Jadhav, neurosurgeon, and Basavaraj Kamble, a technician, in the case of the death of 87 Covid patients. Including these two, 10 people have so far been arrested in the case. Madan Jadhav is the brother of Mahesh Jadhav, the plastic surgeon who operated the Covid unit in his own hospital where 87 Covid patients had succumbed allegedly due to negligence. Mahesh Jadhav is currently in police custody. Now the local court has remanded his neurosurgeon brother also in custody. The health department of the Sangli-Miraj-Kupwad Municipal Corporation (SMKMC) had filed a complaint against Mahesh Jadhav. It was found that around 207 patients were admitted to the hospital in less than one and half months and of them, 87 died. The police, in their report, stated that the hospital lacked the basic equipment required for the treatment of Covid patients and eligible staff. Moreover, patients’ relatives have complained of overcharging. The police have also found that the main accused used to take commissions from laboratories, medical stores and even ambulances. Shashikant Chavan, a senior inspector of the Mahatma Gandhi Chowk police station, said, “We had earlier called the brother of the key accused for interrogation. We have found Madan Jadhav and Kamble’s involvement in forging documents. We will interrogate them further to figure out their actual role in the case.” Last Saturday, the main accused (Mahesh Jadhav), who runs the Apexcare Hospital, was arrested. The SMKMC health officials claim the hospital was given permission to run the Covid unit based o the documents submitted by Jadhav. It is unclear whether the neurosurgeon brother helped in forging the documents for seeking permission or to hide deaths. The police administration has sought closure of the clinics run by Mahesh Jadhav in other cities. The police claim the clinics may have ineligible staff. In the Covid unit here, he had hired homeopathy graduates as medical officers though only MBBS graduates are eligible for the job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/87-covid-deaths-case-doc-brother-of-main-accused-arrested-in-sangli/articleshow/83899889.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Panchkula residents write to Khattar seeking promised STPI||Panchkula: Residents of Panchkula wrote a letter to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, asking for establishment of an STPI (Software Technology Park of India) in Panchkula, which was announced by the Union minister of information and technology during his visit to Panchkula in 2016. In his letter to the Haryana CM, Subhash Papneja, general secretary, Resident Welfare Association Sector 16, stated that on February 27, 2016, during the launch of 105 e-services through common service centres, at Indradhanush Auditorium, Sector-5, Union minister of information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad announced that an STPI would be built in Panchkula. Papneja said local MLA Gian Chand Gupta thanked the Centre and state government for choosing Panchkula as the site for STPI, which would also provide employment opportunities. A site spread over 8,049 square metres in Sector 22 of Panchkula’s IT Park was purchased from Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) for about Rs 14.91 crore for the purpose. It was decided that this space would be given to the Noida-based STPI society to set up the centre. The land was to be leased for a token fee of a rupee for each of the 99 years. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between Haryana State Electronics Development Corporation Limited (Hartron) and the STPI. A decision to this effect was taken at a state cabinet meeting in 2018, where Haryana chief minister Mahohar Lal Khattar led the proceedings. The government said that Panchkula had the potential to attract information technology industry because of its proximity to technical institutions, universities and software parks of Chandigarh and Mohali. “Unfortunately, only the announcement and talks were made but no work on ground was done. The government must not announce such projects if they cannot fulfil them,” alleged Papneja. Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) is an autonomous society under the department of electronics and information technology of the ministry of communication and information technology. Its objective is to promote software exports. The STPI operates two central government schemes—Software Technology Park (STP) and Electronics Hardware Technology Park (EHTP)—and offers incubation and data communication facilities under one umbrella to the IT units to facilitate export-oriented activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panchkula-residents-write-to-khattar-seeking-promised-stpi/articleshow/83901951.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

---||Meerut||Bus conductor's kid, labourer's son, auto-driver's beti, Mann Ki Baat cameo for Olympic-bound stars||MUZAFFARNAGAR: When she was 14, Priyanka Goswami was fairly certain her life would centre on gymnastics. She’d take part in races at school, never too seriously, but always ended up winning. Around the same time, her father, a bus conductor, got suspended from his job. Things got tough at home, the race tracks offered a refuge and she switched gears. This year, Goswami, 25, broke the national record in race walking and is on her way to the Tokyo Olympics. On Sunday, PM Narendra Modi spoke of Priyanka’s as an exemplary life on ‘Mann ki Baat’. “The life of Priyanka Goswamiji … teaches a lot … As a child, Priyanka adored the bag that the medal winners were presented with. It was this fascination that made her participate in the race walking competition. Now, she is a big champion,” Modi said. The camera-friendly Priyanka, who has 15,000 followers on Instagram, was elated. “I’m thrilled to hear PM Modi mentioned me. I’ll do my best to win my country a medal,” she said. Her father, Madan Goswami, too, was overjoyed. “I’m very happy the PM spoke about her hard work. I’m confident my daughter will bring us a medal,” he told TOI. Priyanka, who has bagged over 20 national medals in 20-km race walking, is busy training at the Sports Authority of India’s Bengaluru national camp. She has participated in international events in Italy, Japan and Taiwan. After her national record-breaking win, by covering 20km in 1 hour 28 minutes and 45 seconds, at the 8th National Open and 4th International Race Walking Championships in Ranchi — 4 minutes and 56 seconds short of the international record — she is headed for the Tokyo Olympics in August. In a country with limited sports funding and bottlenecks at every stage, trajectories of many in the Tokyo contingent have been hurdle-ridden. Archers Pravin Jadhav, 25, and Deepika Kumari, 27, Modi said, have not had it easy. “Pravin hails from a village in Satara district of Maharashtra ... His parents run the family by working as labourers,” he said. “Deepika’s father drives an auto rickshaw and her mother is a nurse. Deepika is now the only female archer from India in the Tokyo Olympics. Our best wishes are with Deepika, once ranked world’s number one archer.” Deepika snapped up the gold in the women’s individual recurve, and as part of the women’s and mixed teams at the Archery World Cup in Paris on Sunday. Just as inspiring was Neha Goyal’s journey, and that of CA Bhavani Devi, 28. “Neha (25) is a member of the women’s hockey team going to Tokyo. Her mother and sisters manage family expenses by working in a cycle factory,” Modi said. “Bhavani, who hails from Chennai, is the first Indian fencer to qualify in the Olympics ... For Bhavani ji’s training to continue, her mother mortgaged her jewellery.” It has been an arduous march for them all. Priyanka’s father’s suspension was never revoked. “I urge PM Modi to help get my father’s job back,” she said. Her brother, 23, lost his job at a private company during the pandemic. She powers on. “I wake up at 4am, practise from 5.30am to 9.30am and then again from 4pm to 7pm,” she said, now on a break from her day job as a junior clerk with the Indian Railways."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bus-conductors-kid-labourers-son-auto-drivers-beti-mann-ki-baat-cameo-for-oly-bound-stars/articleshow/83902018.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Hyderabad||Three from Hyderabad held for links with Darbhanga blast||HYDERABAD: Telangana Counter Intelligence (CI) sleuths and National Investigation Agency (NIA) officials have detained three persons, including two siblings from Hyderabad in connection with the Darbhanga blast. On June 17, an explosion had occurred in a parcel (a consignment of clothes) at the Darbhanga railway station. Though no one was injured in the blast, police have now established that the consignment was booked at the Secunderabad railway station. Sources said the two brothers from Asif Nagar and a third suspect were on the watch for over a week. They allegedly had a role in booking the parcel at Secunderabad Railway Station. The parcel had explosives in a liquid form, filled in a bottle. The bottle was wrapped with garments and booked as a garment consignment. It was booked in the name of one Mohammed Sufiyan. However, the explosive-filled bottle in the parcel exploded at the Darbhanga railway station. Based on CCTV footage, which was analysed at the Secunderabad railway station, security officials — Bihar police, Telangana CI Cell sleuths, National Investigation Agency (NIA) officials — found that two persons had disembarked from a taxi. The intelligence sleuths have collected the Aadhaar card copy from Secunderabad station booking counter and the mobile phone number mentioned at the time of booking by the accused During investigation, police suspected the role of the two brothers from Asif Nagar. Five days ago, when a raid was conducted at their residence, only one of the two brothers was present. It is learnt that one of the brothers was planning to take a flight to New Delhi from Hyderabad, when security officials nabbed him. Senior Telangana police said that NIA and Bihar police were investigating the case. As of now, there is no clarity about the role of the two suspects, who and how the liquid explosives were prepared. When Telangana police were asked whether this alleged module has links with outlawed Indian Mujahideen (IM), they said that it was too early to comment. Already, two persons from Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh were arrested in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-from-city-held-for-links-with-darbhanga-blast/articleshow/83906045.cms||---

Trichy Corporation is stringent in collecting water charges, it should also show similar enthusiasm in supplying good quality water, the resdents said. Residents of Naicker Street, Sharma Colony and Kallupattara Street in E Pudur in ward number 40 of K Abishekapuram zone said that corporation water supplied to them is pale brown in colour. As the water was of substandard quality, the residents of the region have been using potable water supplied through pipes for domestic needs. They are also purchasing water cans from private dealers for Rs 35 to Rs 40 per can. “Already, the lockdown has hit us economically. Buying RO water cans is an additional burden to us now,” Ka Kumar, a resident of Naicker Street, said. While adjoining neighbourhoods such as Ramachandra Nagar and Anbu Nagar are getting good quality water, the residents of the three main streets claimed that they are unable to use the ‘brown water’. Potable water for the localities is being sourced from the Kollidam river bed. “There was a pipe burst near KK Nagar a few days ago, however we restored the water supply within a day. The large amount of dirt entering the water pipe was the reason for the change in colour. We will clean the overhead tank in E Pudur soon,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/residents-complain-of-poor-water-quality/articleshow/83902005.cms||Deepak Karthik

Rainfall activity is expected to pick up in July, IMD said. “No strong system was present in or around Maharashtra. Partially, the westerly winds have strengthened,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division at IMD Pune. He said that the formation of a low-pressure area is expected in early-July, which will help in the revival of the monsoon. As per the weather forecast, Konkan-Goa will get below-normal rainfall, while other areas will get normal or slightly above-normal rain. “Generally cloudy sky with light rain,” is the forecast for Pune till July 1. Konkan-Goa is likely to get widespread rainfall — 75 % of the region will get light to moderate rain. “Prevailing meteorological conditions, large-scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamic models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of the southwest monsoon into the remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab during next 6-7 days,” stated IMD’s all-India daily weather report. The regional weather report said strong winds with wind speed reaching 40-50kmph in the Arabian Sea are likely till July 1.

The new academic year began on June 15 and 50% of teachers from class I to IX and class XI had to be in schools and colleges to conduct online classes. For class X and XII teachers 100% attendance was mandatory. Teachers coming from distant areas like Thane, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Vasai-Virar, Palghar and Navi Mumbai could not take trains as they do not fall in the ‘essential services’ category. They had protested by travelling ticketless and paying fines. On June 17, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that teachers would be given special permission to board trains. But as the MMR continues to be in level 3, teachers could not travel by trains. All teachers from class I to IX and XI can now take online classes from home, while class X teachers can travel to work if their SSC result work is on. Schools have time till July 2 to upload marks on the state board’s website. Class XII teachers have also begun assessment work and will need to be in colleges. The marking process for class XII is still to be announced by the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-scraps-rule-for-50-attendance-for-mmr-teachers/articleshow/83904184.cms||---

A total of 100 kg of dragon fruit was recently exported to Dubai from their farms. Each of them sent 50kg consignments of the exotic fruit, which, because of the spikes and petals resembling a lotus, is also called “kamalam”. The export of the exotic fruit, which is currently cultivated in roughly 150 acres of Sangli’s drought-prone areas, has given fresh hope to local farmers. According to the agriculture officials, dragon fruit cultivation is gradually replacing grape and sugar cane cultivation in the arid parts of the district. Anandrao Pawar (78) was the first to grow the cactus species on the hilly terrain of the Kadegaon tehsil about six years ago. Tadsar is located around 500m above sea level. “I replaced my sugar cane crop with dragon fruit. Our farm is located at a high elevation. Six years ago, I got information on dragon fruit cultivation from a Satara-based farmer. The crop requires less water. I used organic fertilisers. Organic farming practices also helped us achieve the weight and taste targets. Fruits weighing more than 300gm each were selected for the export to Dubai.” Inspired by Pawar, Rajaram Deshmukh too decided to take up dragon fruit farming. He has one-and-a-half acres under dragon fruit cultivation and plans to expand the area to five acres by next year. Basavaraj Mastoli, Sangli district’s agriculture superintendent, said, “Over the past few years, dragon fruit cultivation in dry and arid areas has been increasing. It is being cultivated in places like Atpadi, Jath and now, Kadegaon. Many prefer the crop to water-intensive sugar cane and capital-intensive grape farming. Dragon fruit farming is also turning out to be profitable for farmers earlier growing non-cash crops like grains.” There are three main varieties of dragon fruit — white flesh with pink skin; red flesh with pink skin and; white flesh with yellow skin. The fruit is rich in fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/2-farmers-from-sangli-district-become-indias-first-pink-white-dragon-fruit-exporters-100kg-sent-to-dubai/articleshow/83899952.cms||---

They are also not going to all houses as it's not feasible,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, (DHS). UT. She said, “We can do over 15,000 doses per day. There is no shortage of vaccines. Community-based vaccination can start from the coming week. But people must come forward and get the jabs before there is a rise in the positivity rate.” UT administrator V P Singh Badnore during a recent review meeting had advised the DHS to administer doses at home for senior citizens who cannot come to vaccination centres, are bedridden or suffer from chronic illness. Panchkula and Mohali had started drive-through vaccination to provide access to most people. “We have all the sites functional throughout the week, including holidays. Also, more than 15 mobile vans which provide vaccination are available near resident welfare associations. In case more RWAs need our services, we can provide,” said Kang. The city has 6,31,338 people above the age of 18 years, according to electoral rolls. “These numbers can be covered easily in a month, if all the beneficiaries come for the shots,” said Kang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/not-door-to-door-jabs-at-common-house/articleshow/83902075.cms||Shimona Kanwar

One of them was a contestant on a popular TV reality show and two others are choreographers.”All the accused are in the 25-35 years age group. They had come to Igatpuri by private vehicles on June 25 and had planned to stay in the two villas till Sunday afternoon.Patil said based on the initial questioning of the group, a team of the rural police has picked up a Nigerian national from Mumbai for allegedly supplying the drugs. “All the memebrs of the group have been sent for their medical examination. We will be arresting them soon,” he added.Igatpuri is a well-known hill station in Nashik district and is located about 150km from Mumbai. It is frequented by tourists from places like Mumbai and Pune, especially during the weekends.According to Patil, the police had received information on some illegal activities at the two villas that are owned by a Mumbai-based person.“A team went to the two bungalows and found the entire group in an intoxicated state. We have recovered drugs from the two villas,” he said.According to the police, there have been such incidents in the past as well in Igatpuri. “Our police teams are always alert to prevent such activities. In view of the current pandemic situation, we have stepped up our vigil across the district to ensure that there is no unnecessary gathering of people,” a police official said.All those who have been detained, including the support staff at the two villas, would be produced before the court on Monday for their police custody.Late night parties and playing loud music have been common in Igatpuri in the past and following complaints from the villagers, the rural police have also conducted raids on several earlier occasions.“An offence has been registered against the people concerned and the case is being investigated under the guidance of senior officials,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/12-women-among-22-from-mumbai-held-for-consuming-drugs-in-igatpuri-villas/articleshow/83899982.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Goa||Safety concerns rise at Quepem as visitors throng Portuguese-era dam||QUEPEM: With visitors thronging to view the overflowing Portuguese-era dam on River Kushawati at Quepem, concerns are being raised regarding the safety aspect. “Authorities had constructed a railing only on one side, leaving the front portion of the dam open. If somebody falls from this place which is at a height of 7m, it will be difficult to rescue them due to the strong currents,” said local activist Andy Fernandes. The railing, which has since collapsed, extended for a distance of about 20m from the entrance of the dam up to the gate where the water is released into the Paroda irrigation canal, which then proceeds to Guirdolim/Macasana. The riverfront near the town is a tourist spot, however, rowdy elements are posing a threat to the safety of visitors as they indulge in binge drinking and create nuisance. Former Quepem municipality chairperson Raul Pereira told TOI that the railing was intentionally broken by visitors who were making nuisance near the dam after consuming alcohol. Since visitors are crowding at the dam to catch a glimpse of the overflowing dam, the area has been deemed unsafe for the public. The railing, which was constructed four years ago, lacks a deep foundation, and hence it collapsed within two years, said Fernandes. Another railing on both sides of a small three-metre width bridge near the gate of the dam also collapsed a few years back. Locals alleged that authorities have turned a blind eye to the safety of visitors. Due to the absence of the railing, people are afraid of travelling on this bridge as it is built at a height of around 10m. Tourists visiting the dam also face difficulties in manoeuvring their vehicles and avoid travelling on the bridge due to safety concerns. Authorities had beautified the dam area with interlocking pavers. However, the area is now strewn with beer bottles and cans. Local councillor Nandita Prabhudesai had dashed off a letter to the chairperson of Quepem Municipal Council soon after the municipal election requesting to erect a ‘no garbage dumping’ sign board at the dam site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/safety-concerns-rise-at-quepem-as-visitors-throng-portuguese-era-dam/articleshow/83906155.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Operation Red Rose: Liquor bottle cap racket busted||CHANDIGARH: The excise department, under "Operation Red Rose," busted a liquor bottle cap manufacturing racket. The owner of the Dera Bassi based factory allegedly involved in the manufacture of these caps has been nabbed. The caps were used for illicit liquor bottling. Naresh Dubey, joint excise commissioner, Punjab said that the excise department, along with police, has tightened the noose on the supply chain of key manufacturing constituents of illicit liquor, so that their supply is choked. He said they acted on a tip-off about the bottle cap manufacturing unit at Hansa Industrial Park, Barwala Road, Dera Bassi which operated in connivance with some notorious bottling plants to manufacture illicit liquor. The contraband was allegedly smuggled into Punjab. Inquiries suggested a nexus between the cap manufacturing unit at Hansa Industrial Park, Barwala road, Dera Bassi and some liquor bottling units in Chandigarh. The bottling units used to purchase the caps clandestinely. The unaccounted supply of caps was used to bottle illicit liquor, which was later supplied across the country, including Punjab. On the intervening night of June 24 and 25, 2021 a team from the excise commissionerate, Punjab and Mohali Police raided the premises of Sia Industry situated at Plot No 235, Hansa Industrial Park, Barwala Road, Dera Bassi, SAS Nagar. During a search, a major haul of liquor bottle caps was found. No supporting documents could be produced by the manufacturing unit, officials said. Approximately two lakh caps of Sancheti Packaging Pvt Limited, Chandigarh were recovered, for which no work order could be produced by factory owner Samritpal Singh. Record available on the premises showed that earlier also, the caps were sent to this bottling plant in an unaccounted manner. Later, these caps could be used for packaging illicit liquor. The record was also taken into custody for further probe. In addition to it, around 20,000 caps of Sir Shadi Lal Distillery, Mansurpur (UP) were also detected. During investigations, it was established through excise department of Uttar Pradesh that Sir Shadi Lal Distillery had not placed any order for these caps. A case was registered at Dera Bassi Police Station against the culprits under relevant sections of the Punjab Excise Act and the IPC. Factory owner Samritpal Singh was produced in court. His daylong police remand has been extended by two more days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/op-red-rose-liquor-bottle-cap-racket-busted/articleshow/83902119.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

---||Chandigarh||Para taekwondo athlete Aruna Tanwar aims for Tokyo glory||CHANDIGARH: Aruna Tanwar, India’s first taekwondo player to be awarded a wild card entry for the upcoming Tokyo Paralympics, competed as a normal athlete for eight years until 2017 when she was declared ineligible to feature in the normal category. Aruna took the rejection (for having three fingers in each hand and arms not fully formed) by her stride, and switched over to para category, where she is the current world number 4 in the women’s under-49 category. Aruna Tanwar with her father and brother in MohaliA five-time national champion, Aruna has consistently attained a podium finish in last four years at both Asian Para Taekwondo Championships and World Para Taekwondo Championships. “I started learning taekwondo at the age of eight and for next eight years I competed in the normal category. It was during 2017, when I was declared not eligible to compete at the international level due to deformity in my both hands, after which I shifted to Paralympics category,” Aruna, one of the 72 taekwondo players from 37 nations competing in the Paralympics, told TOI. Born to a factory driver and part-time farmer Naresh Kumar in Haryana’s Bhiwani district, Aruna is among the eight athletes given a bipartite commission invitation for Tokyo by World Taekwondo and International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The invitation came as a surprise for the youngster, who had missed the world and Asian qualifier in Jordan due to the travel ban because of the coronavirus pandemic. “I was dejected to have missed the qualifiers and my hopes of donning the India jersey were gradually fading away. I must thank the Para Taekwondo Association of India (PTAI), and the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) for their timely intervention,” said the 2019 World Para Taekwondo Championship bronze medallist. Martial arts for self defencePursuing her physical education undergraduate course at Chandigarh University, Mohali, Aruna is eyeing for a podium finish in Tokyo to inspire girls to take up martial arts, which, she feels, is a great self-defence tool. “Martial art is not only a sport. I consider it as a tool for women empowerment. We keep on listening to news about women harassment and rape attempts. I want every girl to learn martial arts and use it as a tool to defend themselves against the bad elements of the society,” she said. “I am working hard for a medal in Tokyo, hopefully my performance can inspire other para-athletes to work on their dreams and aim for success,” she added. Eyeing glory for well-wishersNaresh Kumar has overcome a lot of hardships to feed his three children, besides bearing Aruna’s training and competition costs. But he never allowed the financial burden hamper his daughter’s progress. “We’ve faced a lot of financial struggle but somehow I managed her expenses by selling jewellery or borrowing money. The qualification is only the first step of her long career, winning a medal in Tokyo is now the first target,” he said. “My parents supported me. They accompanied me in every national tournament. Both mother and father believed in me and whatever I've achieved till now is because of them. A medal in the Paralympics will make them proud,” Aruna quipped. The Tokyo Paralympics will run from August 24 to September 5. Taking note of Aruna’s achievements, Chandigarh University has introduced a special sports scholarship named after the famous international para-athlete and Arjuna Award recipient Ramesh Tikaram, also known as father of para-badminton. R Tikaram Sports Scholarship will be worth ₹1 crore for Paralympic players from 2021. In addition, 25 seats under sports category would be reserved for the para-athletes who would be eligible for academic scholarship up to 100% and get access to free hostel accommodation, special diet along with training allowances. “Aruna has become a role model for many, especially girls who are not given equal opportunity as boys by their parents to showcase their talent and get empowered. We want to encourage para-athletes and boost their talent,” said Dr R S Bawa, pro-chancellor Chandigarh University.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/para-taekwondo-athlete-aruna-aims-for-tokyo-glory/articleshow/83902213.cms||Tridib Baparnash

The theft came to light when one of the drugged employees woke up around 9am on Sunday. On finding the room bolted from outside and Akash, the suspect, missing, he called up Anoop Koley, the owner. Koley said he has seven craftsmen — five of whom — used to stay in the workshop on the third floor in the market. Akash, he said, was one of the oldest employees — working with him for the last two years. Such was the trust that Koley had even given him a motorcycle, one he used to escape. The four workers said Akash, who belongs to West Bengal, threw a birthday party in the night. “He offered some of us alcohol and the rest cold drinks. But he mixed something in our drinks. Once we fell unconscious, he locked us in a room. It was only in the morning once our boss came we realised what he did,” they said. While searching for his belongings, Koley found the damaged safe of gold and diamond ornaments in the washroom. Koley dialled police helpline 112. Charanjit Singh, DSP, central division, Ram Rattan, SHO, Sector 17 police station and other cops reached the crime site. A dog squad and forensic team gathered fingerprints and other evidence. Different police teams were dispatched to the possible hideouts of the accused in Delhi and his native place, the SHO said. Police said details were shared with Panchkula and Mohali police and the picture of the suspect circulated in the Tricity. A case under Sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) of the IPC was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bday-boy-spikes-drinks-empties-his-workplace-safe-of-rs-1cr-gold/articleshow/83902190.cms||Pawan Tiwari

The lockdown last year gave many the opportunity to adopt a pet as working from home provided them more time. To overcome loneliness and help with mental health, many people adopted puppies when they had to be away from the rest of their family and friends. Now that the puppies have grown into adults indoors, there is a high demand for dog trainers and behaviourists. “I adopted an American Pitbull puppy last year and it is well-behaved inside the house, but he isn’t used to being around people or other dogs. It is a great trouble to take him for his walks as he tends to get aggressive with other dogs and people. I had to seek help from a dog trainer to correct this behaviour before it could escalate into a dangerous or an unfortunate incident,” said a pet parent. City-based canine behaviourist and trainer Priti Chauhan pointed out how human actions during the pandemic — avoiding hugging or touching while greeting, refraining from socialising — has rubbed off on their pets. She said, “It has been difficult to de-sensitise the pandemic pups to traffic or other people due to restrictions brought on since they were young. I get several calls for such issues every day. A big problem for pet parents while hiring a dog trainer is that there is no standard qualification or certification for the profession. Namratha Rao from Delhi, who has been a practicing dog trainer for over seven years, said, “Before hiring a dog trainer, pet parents should ask questions like what methods do they use or what school of thought they believe in regarding training techniques, what courses they have done or certifications they have, and do some research on their work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dog-trainers-in-high-demand-for-pandemic-pups/articleshow/83904272.cms||---

The move has brought cheers to the workers, who were jobless for the past several weeks. The garment units, which had voluntarily shut operations before the enforcement of total lockdown owing to the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases, were allowed to function with 25% workforce from June 7 and 50% workers from June 21. However, there was a ban on full resumption of operations, as Tirupur continued to report high number of cases. Several associations representing the garment industry subsequently requested the state government to relax the norms for resumption of full-fledged production. The state government, in its recent order, relaxed the norms and allowed the export units and their subsidiaries to function with 100% workforce. Other industrial units have been allowed to operate with 33% workforce. After a gap of almost 45 days, the export-oriented units are going to function with 100% workers from Monday. The units have been asked to ensure that workers are wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/garment-units-to-operate-with-100-workforce/articleshow/83904284.cms||---

R Kanagaraj, 53, a farmer from Kullampalayam near Pongalur in Tirupur whose bank account was frozen because he defaulted on a loan died at a private hospital in Coimbatore on Friday. Working president of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association (non–political) N S P Vetri said that Kanagaraj had a bank account in the nationalised bank at Kethanur. But the account was frozen allegedly after Kanagaraj could not repay the loan of Rs 75,000 obtained by his father Rangasamy who died in 2017. Kanagaraj has signed as the guarantor in the loan application. Kanagaraj told the bank that he needed time to repay the loan since he was unable to mobilise the fund due to Covid-induced lockdown. Meanwhile, Kanagaraj who underwent a kidney transplant sometime back fell ill and was hospitalized. His wife and two daughters who were dependent on the two-acre farm land for a living were unable to generate money needed for the treatment. “The family and the relatives sought the bank to defreeze the account which was not heeded. On behalf of our association, we made multiple representations to the bank as well,” said Vetri. However, the account was not released. The farmers’ association members managed to pool in around Rs 3 lakh. “However, Kangaraj was dejected by the trouble he and his family had to undergo. Eventually he died,” Vetri said. The bank representatives have told the district administration that they have unfrozen the account after Kanagaraj’s family requested. They told the authorities that the loan was given 10 years back and even the interest was not paid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/deceased-farmers-family-demands-money-from-bank/articleshow/83904288.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: They don’t just stink, landfills to blame for dirty groundwater too||NEW DELHI: The groundwater near the city’s three landfill sites at Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla is highly contaminated with the level of total dissolved solid (TDS), chlorine and hardness being higher than the desired drinking water limit. Calcium and sulfate were also found to be higher than the desired limit. This was revealed in a report by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), which had collected samples from 4-5 locations near each landfill site in July last year. Experts said unsegregated waste at the landfill sites leaching into the soil was contaminating the groundwater. Priti Banthia Mahesh, chief programme coordinator of the NGO Toxics Link, said, “All types of waste are dumped at landfill sites. The unsegregated waste, including toxic materials, releases chemicals and it leaches into the soil and contaminates the groundwater.” “The Solid Waste Management Rules state that all sources of waste should be segregated at source. However, segregation at the household level is not happening and there is little option of separating it at a later stage. The presence of toxic materials at landfill sites will have an impact in and around the area,” added Mahesh. Shashank Shekhar, professor, department of geology, Delhi University, said, “These landfill sites are very old dumping grounds and were not scientifically designed. In due course, the leachate enters the groundwater and starts polluting it, which is occurring at all these sites.” Suggesting proper remedial measures to stop the pollution load from travelling to far off areas where groundwater was currently being extracted for drinking purposes, Shekhar said, “Some reports have shown that landfill sites are polluting the groundwater, but the time has come for us to look for remedial solutions on what should be done to prevent it.” The DPCC report states that the desired TDS limit for drinking water is 500 mg/l, but it was 5,280 mg/l at Bhalswa, the highest among all three landfill sites. The TDS level was recorded at 2,350 mg/l at Bhalswa Janta Colony and 3,330 mg/l at Bhalswa Dairy. The TDS limit was more than double the desired limit at three locations near Ghazipur landfill site, while the chlorine level was more than 1,500 mg/l at two sites. The level of chlorine was 1,625 mg/l near the Ghazipur entry gate against the desired limit of 250 mg/l. Similarly, the chlorine level was above 900 mg/l at three locations near Okhla landfill site. The report further stated that hardness through CaCO3 should not be more than 300 mg/l, but it was three times higher at Okhla.

---||Amritsar||SKM condemns ‘police action’ on protesting farmers, seeks withdrawal of cases||Bathinda: Preventing farmers from reaching Raj Bhawans and meeting the governors is a reflection of authoritarian and undemocratic regime in the Centre, which had called the promulgation of the Emergency, 46 years on the same day, as a black phase, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha said while condemning the police action against peaceful farmers at Chandigarh on Saturday. The morcha demanded withdrawal of the cases registered against protesting farmers, singers, actors and supporters. It is ironic that BJP leaders and state governments run by the party, who were criticising the Emergency imposed in 1975, were reflecting the same authoritarian and repressive attitude towards the protesting farmers and their agitation, the morcha said. The morcha termed the ‘Save Agriculture, Save Democracy’ day as successful as thousands of farmers stepped up protests all over the country in a peaceful manner. SKM appreciated the solidarity lent by trade and workers’ unions, women, youth and students’ organisations, Dalit and adivasi groups, traders, transporters, teachers and artists. It is objectionable that the entry points were closed by the administration that too after farmers had declared their intent to peacefully march till the Raj Bhavan, after which a small delegation would have gone to meet the governor to hand over a memorandum. There was absolutely no reason to have tried to prevent the farmers from going to the governor’s house. When farmers went ahead, cases were slapped against them, the SKM said. The SKM said Kisan Mazdoor Bhaichara Maha Sammelan would be held at Sunehra border on Monday. Farmers from Mewat are expected to join. The programme would strengthen the values of peace, communal harmony, brotherhood and justice, which will be like a warning to communal forces intent on disrupting the unity of the movement, it added. Box: Chomsky lauded SKM appreciated noted American linguist, philosopher and peace activist Prof Noam Chomsky for lauding the ongoing farmers’ struggle in India calling it as a beacon of hope in dark times. SKM stated that Chomsky has applauded the fact that the farmers are fighting not just for themselves, but for a functioning society that cares about the rights and welfare of all citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/skm-condemns-police-action-on-protesting-farmers-seeks-withdrawal-of-cases/articleshow/83906209.cms||---

---||Thane||Maharashtra: ‘Fruit sellers’ drill into finance company’s office in dead of night, 7 held||ULHASNAGAR: Seven robbers of a gang who were allegedly trying to break into the premises of a finance company in Ulhasnagar were arrested early on Sunday. The police said that they foiled the robbery attempt right in time and caught the seven red-handed. One of their accomplices managed to flee. Last week, the gang had taken a shop in Camp 4 locality on rent, beside the office of Muthoot Finance. The accused had told the shop owner that they would set up a fruit shop. Their plan was to break into the company premises with which the shop shares a wall, said sub-inspector Harshal Rajput of Vithalwadi police station. “The company extends loans against collaterals. So, the gang had set their eyes on jewellery and cash at the office. The office had valuables worth Rs 10 crore stashed inside,” said Rajput.

With no specific intelligence, the cops had been keeping vigil around finance companies around the locality, said senior police inspector K P Thorat. Around 11.30pm on Saturday, a police patrol team noticed some “unusual and frenetic” activity at the building where the office of Muthoot Finance is housed. “A few men were buzzing around at that hour. Also, a drone-like buzz was within earshot,” said sub-inspector Rajput. As the cops moved closer, they heard the sound of a drilling machine, said an official. Realising that those holed up inside could be quite a handful for the patrolling team, more reinforcements were sent for. The police team forced the gang to open the shutter. They found gas-cutting machines to jimmy lockers, screwdrivers, gas cylinders and a revolver. One of them escaped, said senior inspector Thorat. Those arrested have been indentified as Jahir Ahmed (30), Immamuddin Qasim Khan (57) both from Uttar Pradesh, Ram Singh (32 from Nepal and four from Jharkhand -- Rijaul Shaikh (35), Kalu Shaikh (55), Tapan Mandal (48) and Ajim Shaikh (28). Five of these were also involved in similar burglaries in Thane, Surat and Delhi, said another police officer.

The accused, identified as Chhotu Chaudhary, was nabbed from Bihar. Police said the syndicate cheated people all over the country during the second wave of Covid-19 cases by pretending to be suppliers of oxygen cylinders and concentrators.

---||Delhi||Delhi Metro’s Grey Line set to reach Haryana border||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro’s Grey Line (Dwarka-Najafgarh) is all set to reach the Delhi-Haryana border at Dhansa next month. The 4.3-km Dwarka-Najafgarh section of Grey Line, connecting the rural parts of Najafgarh with the rest of the city through the Metro network, had opened to the public in October 2019. However, a small section of the corridor, which would extend it to the Delhi-Haryana border, remained to be open. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot visited the upcoming station at Dhansa on Saturday for an inspection. “I am happy to inform that the work of Dhansa Stand Metro station at Najafgarh has been completed. Soon it will be opened to the public. Inspected the station with DMRC officials today. This metro station also has a covered parking facility for about 150 vehicles,” Gahlot tweeted post his visit. “We are making all efforts to try and open the Najafgarh-Dhansa section sometime later next month after complying with all statutory requirements,” said Anuj Dayal executive director (corporate communication), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The 5.4-km Grey Line was not part of the original Phase-III project of DMRC and was instead added much later. Inaugurated in October last year, the Dwarka to Najafgarh section, which has a 2.7-km elevated stretch and 1.5-km underground section, has three stations — the elevated Dwarka and Nangli stations and the underground Najafgarh station. The extension to Dhansa Bus Stand on Delhi-Haryana border was scheduled to open by December 2020 but due to the Covid-19 outbreak, work came to a halt and only resumed as part of the unlock guidelines. The 1.2-km stretch with one station was later slated to be completed by May 2021, but some work remained to be completed. According to sources, the final safety inspection of the section is likely to take place on July 10. The Najafgarh-Dhansa Bus Stand section will be an extension to the presently operational Dwarka-Najafgarh Grey Line corridor. For the construction of the underground corridor from Najafgarh to Dhansa, two methods were used. While 700 metres of tunnelling was done using the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), another 290 metres of underground work is being done completed by the cut-and-cover method. The heavy traffic on the stretch between Najafgarh and Dhansa stand was a major challenge faced by DMRC, while carrying out construction work. Grey Line, Delhi Metro’s smallest corridor, connects Najafgarh with the rest of the capital, thanks to the interchange facility with the Blue Line (Dwarka-Vaishali/Noida Electronic City) at Dwarka. There are three trains deployed on the corridor and total travel time on this section will be six minutes and 20 seconds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/metros-grey-line-set-to-reach-haryana-border/articleshow/83902292.cms||Sidharatha Roy

D Venkatesh, district forest officer, had earlier told TOI that ‘Baahubali’ was sighted on a foothill and their plan was to tranquilize the tusker when the animal reached the plains or crossed Kotagiri Road. He had made it clear that they wouldn’t start the operation until the tusker came out of the deep forest. Another forest officer said, “Mettupalayam town witnessed heavy rain in the evening, forcing us to end the wait for the tusker. Suddenly, the tusker ventured into the plains and crossed the Kotagiri Road around 6.30pm. We couldn’t do anything.” The forest department, which is ready with five teams and three kumkis, would resume the operation that is codenamed ‘MP20T1’on Monday. The tusker has been roaming around the Mettupalayam forest range for the past six months, often straying into human habitats and raiding farmlands. The forest department, hence, decided to dart the tusker with sedatives and fix radio collar to track its movements. The forest department’s frontline staff members have been monitoring the tusker for a week for the operation. The teams comprising five veterinary officers and forest department officials started the operation to radio collar the tusker around 6am on Sunday. They were ready with five guns to dart the tusker with sedatives. “We camped at Vedar Colony at Mettupalayam, while the frontline staff members entered the reserve forest to monitor the tusker’s movement closely. We were waiting for the tusker to come out of the deep forest for a chance to tranquilize the animal, but in vain,” said an officer involved in the operation. The three kumkis - Kaleem, Mariappan and Venkatesh - were stationed at the government timber depot at Mettupalayam. “They would be taken inside the forest after we tranquilize the tusker,” the officer said. The district forest officer said ‘Baahubali’ was a very sensitive tusker and no one had approached the animal, the health condition of which is good. He said after fixing the radio collar the tusker would be released into the forest. “The radio collar will send out a signal, helping us track its movement.” Venkatesh said the frontline staff members were monitoring the elephant. “A drone has also been deployed to monitor the elephant’s movement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/radio-collaring-bid-fails-as-baahubali-maintains-distance/articleshow/83904303.cms||A Subburaj

A lot can be drawn from the experience of the last one-and-a-half year as we now have a better understanding of the virus’s unpredictable nature. It is essential to look back and zero in on any scope of mistakes in future that we might have done during the first and second wave,” said one of the members of the committee. The newly formed advisory committee for the government is yet to meet and decide on the modalities of functioning and role specific to each member.  “We will be meeting this week and discussing the basic functioning of the committee, what information is required from which sources and the access to it etc,” said Dr Mahaboob Khan, superintendent Chest hospital, who is one of the members of the committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-forms-panel-to-prep-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/83904543.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Pune||Pune police record nine cases of FASTag fraud since March||PUNE: The Pune police have so far received nine complaints of cheating related to the FASTag system ever since the central government made its use mandatory on February 15. The cases have prompted the police to create a separate head to record them. No such cases were reported prior to March. “Of the nine cases, four FASTag users received messages stating that amounts between Rs250 and Rs500 were debited from their accounts but none of them had ventured out or passed through any toll plaza,” Bhagyshri Navatake, deputy commissioner of police (cyber crime), said. Navatake said, “In another five cases, people were duped of amounts between Rs1,000 to Rs5,000 by cybercrooks under the pretext of recharging their FASTag accounts.” However, Navatake added that the cases were declining owing to the awareness drives by banks and other agencies about procurement and use of FASTags. A cyber police officer said, “In cases where a user was charged despite not crossing any toll plaza, we suspect that their FASTag card details were misused. We are investigating the money trail. Many-a-times, people do not approach us, thinking the amount charged to them is negligible, but they should raise a complaint.” “In other cases, the suspects offered FASTags to the customers (on phone) by claiming to be representatives of banks or financial institutions. They lured customers under the pretext of cash back rewards. Trying to meet the February 15 deadline, many customers ordered FASTags from these ‘representatives’ and shared their bank details. After obtaining them, the suspects siphoned off money from their accounts,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nine-cases-of-fastag-fraud-since-march/articleshow/83904296.cms||Gitesh Shelke

We were waiting for the tusker to come out of the deep forest for a chance to tranquilize the animal, but in vain,” said an officer involved in the operation. The three kumkis - Kaleem, Mariappan and Venkatesh - were stationed at the government timber depot at Mettupalayam. “They would be taken inside the forest after we tranquilize the tusker,” the officer said. The district forest officer said ‘Baahubali’ was a very sensitive tusker and no one had approached the animal, the health condition of which is good. He said after fixing the radio collar the tusker would be released into the forest. “The radio collar will send out a signal, helping us track its movement.” Venkatesh said the frontline staff members were monitoring the elephant. “A drone has also been deployed to monitor the elephant’s movement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/radio-collaring-bid-fails-as-baahubali-maintains-distance/articleshow/83913438.cms||A Subburaj
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Petrol price hits century, throws life out of gear||COIMBATORE: D Iniyaraj, a 27-year-old engineer, who had been hiring cabs for his official work for the last five-and-a-half years, has started using a two-wheeler due to rising petrol price. On Sunday, petrol price touched Rs 100 in Coimbatore city and Rs 101.14 in Valparai. “When I started my career, petrol price was Rs 68 per litre and now, it has gone up to Rs 100 per litre. Until last month, I used to hire cabs to travel for my official work. But after the cab fare went up due to rising fuel price, I could not afford it with my travel allowance. So, I stopped hiring cabs and am now using my two-wheeler,” Iniyaraj told TOI. “I have been spending about 30% of salary on fuel.” Rising petrol price has also affected S Syed Ibrahim, a 35-year-old food delivery agent. On Sunday, he used a bicycle to deliver food to customers in Thudiylaur area. “Food delivery is my part-time job. I am an ayurvedic professional and regularly visits Kerala to treat patients. It has been 10 days since I joined the food delivery platform due to financial distress. As I have been using bicycle for delivery, I would be sent only to a maximum distance of 5.5km. I usually deliver food to 10 people a day.” Inspired by Ibrahim and due to the petrol price, other delivery agents have also ditched motorcycles for bicycles. “I want other people to start using bicycles as cycling offers a variety of health benefits,” he added. Vellalore-based Arun Kumar Unnikrishnan is planning to use his motorcycle more than his car. “Two years ago, I used to spend Rs 500 to Rs 600 a week on petrol. Now, I spend Rs 1,000. I have decided to use my car only for absolutely necessary situations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/petrol-price-hits-century-throws-life-out-of-gear/articleshow/83904292.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Hope springs as businesses get ready to reopen doors||COIMBATORE: After the state government granted permission to reopen all shops, including stationary, footwear, electrical, electronic and hardware from 9am to 7pm from Monday, the city is getting ready for a march towards normalcy. Permission has been granted to operate export and auxiliary units with full workforce and other industries with 33% workforce. On the first day, business is expected to be dull as most of the traders and industrialists would be busy with maintenance work because the premises would be reopened after two months. J James, district president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises (Tact), said that industrialists using machines like computer numeric control (CNC) machines would take at least one week to 10 days to repair them. “We have to shell out at least Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 to repair machines, apart from reinvesting in the business. Many industrialists, especially micro industry owners, would have exhausted most of their savings during the lockdown and will be in desperate need of fund,” he said. Industries would require support from banks to resume operations, said Codissia president M V Ramesh Babu. “At this crucial time, bankers should come forward to lend without looking at last year’s balance and transactions. If not, many industrialists would approach private companies and fall in their trap.” As many as 30% of cottage and micro industry owners might leave the field due to loss while others might pledge properties and jewellery to arrange money, said C Sivakumar, president of Coimbatore Tirupur Districts Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association (Cotma). “Due to lack of support from bankers, industrialists will approach private finance companies that levy 22 to 28% interest. Several of them have already taken loans from them and are struggling to pay dues,” he said. Industrialists are also worried about rising cost of raw materials, buyers not accepting price revision and vaccination for workers, said Babu. “While industrialists have been making transportation arrangements to bring back workers, many of the workers in other districts have decided to come on their own. We expect the government to allow us operate with full workforce from next week.” Shop owners and traders are expecting their business to pick up in another week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/hope-springs-as-businesses-get-ready-to-reopen-doors/articleshow/83904293.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Nashik||Nashik's case doubling rate increases to 1,848 days||NASHIK: There has been a massive improvement in doubling time of Covid-19 cases in Nashik district from 84 days in the first week of April to 1,848 days on June 26. Nashik district has so far had 3.93 lakh Covid-19 patients. Of them, 3.83 lakh have been cured. “The doubling time is one of the parameters to check the spread of the infection during the epidemic and higher the number, better it is for the society. But during the month of April the rate was too low,” nodal officer of civil hospital’s emergency operation cell Dr Anant Pawar said. Referring to the statistics, Pawar said the infection doubling time is currently recirded at 1,848 days which means that it would take these many days to double the number of new cases with the current rate to spread among the people. “While this is a good and encouraging news for the citizens and health and administration, the chances of people taking the infection lightly are also high. Hence, it is advisable that the people should not lower their guards against unpredictable virus,” he said. The doubling time in the beginning of June was 861 days. The officer, however, pointed out a huge gap between the doubling time in Nashik city and rural areas. In rural areas the doubling time was 1,113 days, while the rate at which patients were increasing in Nashik city, the doubling time for the city was 3,034 days. Pawar pointed out that the statistics clearly state there was higher infectivity in the rural areas as compared to city areas. Hence, efforts of testing, tracking, treating coupled with vaccination will have to be stressed upon so that the cases come down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-dists-case-doubling-rate-increases-to-1848-days/articleshow/83900263.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The accused has been identified as Vinay Sharma. According to additional commissioner (EOW) R K Singh, the company is also being investigated by the CBI in a Rs 1,528-crore fraud with a consortium of banks. “Another case of fraud worth Rs 555 crore with nine banks is also lodged with CBI with regards to another company where the accused is a director,” he said. The CID Himachal Pradesh has also registered two cases of excise duties worth around Rs 2,000 crore. Sharma was arrested after police received a complaint from Standard Chartered Bank alleging that Vinay Sharma and R K Sharma, both directors of Indian Technomac Ltd, had obtained credit facilities to the tune of Rs 30 crore, including letters of credit (LC) worth Rs 20 crore. Later on, they were invoked by the shell firms associated with the alleged company, the dues were not paid and the directors absconded after closing the business, the additional CP said. The investigation revealed that the LCs didn’t exist in the records of the registrar of companies and the vehicles shown used by these companies to transport material from Delhi to Ponta Sahib in HP were fake and either scooters, motorcycle or moped. RTO records show these vehicles were not registered with the authorities concerned. In another case, EOW has arrested two appraisers of a bank for allegedly certifying fake gold in connivance with loan seekers for hefty commissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eow-arrests-director-of-pvt-firm-in-a-multi-crore-bank-fraud-case/articleshow/83902319.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Police conduct lie-detector test on four men arrested on terror charges from Kargil||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell is learnt to have conducted a polygraph test on the four men arrested on terror charges from Kargil district in Ladakh. The polygraph test, also referred to as the lie-detector test, was performed after the suspects gave their consent. The results of the test, which is inadmissible as evidence in court, has not been disclosed by the cops. The lie-detector test is conducted as a tool for aiding an investigation. Sources said the suspects allegedly gave evasive answers when asked why their phones were switched off on the day of the blast outside the Israel embassy in the capital. They are also learnt to have given conflicting answers about their activities and whereabouts around that time, which led the cops to go for the polygraph. Police may further go for a brain mapping test depending on the clarity obtained from the polygraph tests, the source added. The investigation in the case is being conducted by a team led by special commissioner Neeraj Thakur in liaison with the Intelligence Bureau. The four men — Aiaz Hussain (28), Nazir Hussain (26), Zulfikar Ali Wazir (25) and Muzammil Hussain (25) — were arrested on charges of allegedly planning and attempting to execute terrorist activities in the capital and are the prime suspects in the case of a minor blast reported from near Israel embassy on January 29 this year. The men are residents of Thang village in Kargil district of Ladakh. While one of the accused, Aiaz, claims to be a former student of Ramjas College, another claims to be an IAS aspirant. They came to Delhi in November and left in March, it has been learnt and lived in Vijay Nagar area of the city, cops said. The four accused were produced before a magistrate and taken on ten days remand for questioning. Last week, NIA had announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh each for the identification of two suspects captured on CCTV cameras around the site of the blast. It is unclear if any of these four men were the ones caught on CCTV. When asked, a senior officer said: “The investigation is at initial stage, details will be shared in due course.” An envelope was recovered from the spot with “Israeli ambassador” written on the outside. On the inside, a paragraph suggesting the blast was in retaliation to the killing of an Iranian military leader. However, it was believed that it was a tactic to deflect attention from the real perpetrators and make it seem as the handiwork of Iranians. Sources had confirmed the use of ball bearings and the grey-colour powder found at the spot was identified as ammonium nitrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-conduct-lie-detector-test-on-4-men-from-kargil-brain-mapping-could-be-next/articleshow/83902331.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik administration warns against fake vaccine drives||NASHIK: Amid the incidents of fake vaccination drive in Mumbai and Kolkata, the Nashik district administration and Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) have appealed to the citizens to exercise caution before accepting any offer to get vaccinated. While on one hand there are cases where citizens are being lured to get vaccinated by offering a stay package from the hospitality industry, on the other hand, some people are reaching out to housing societies and promising them to get vaccinated from private hospitals. “Whether people accept the paid offer or not is their decision. Our concern is that people should not fall to the fake-vaccination trap and hence the office bearers of housing societies or trade and businesses must first verify the authenticity before getting the jab,” said Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector and the incident commander of vaccination in Nashik district. Citizens have to follow a simple checklist. This includes visiting the hospitals or the hotels that have put up the offer and verify their process. Also check with the NMC, which approves and creates user id for such drive and latitude and longitude coordinates have to be updated on CoWIN app The doctors have also cautioned the citizens on accepting vaccination from any private hospitals or clinics without verifying the offer and also asked the citizens to follow the thumb rule. “The thumb-rule is compulsory registration of beneficiary with Aadhaar number, followed by an OTP and a message. Post-vaccination, there is another message about completion of vaccination and before leaving the premises, the beneficiary gets a certificate. Anything missing in the chain means ‘fake’ vaccination’ as the CoWin app is robust,” said Dr Raj Nagarkar, the vice president of Hospital Owners’ Association of Nashik (HOAN). He appealed to the citizens to get vaccinated in their societies provided cold-chain can be maintained till the last five minutes before the vaccine is administered in well ventilated, hygienic room and ensure people wait for half an hour under observation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-admin-warns-against-fake-vax-drives/articleshow/83900223.cms||Abhilash Botekar

But actor Tanmay Dhanania had a rather pleasant experience at Mumbai airport recently when a CISF personnel asked him for tips on how to master the flute in his handbag. “In the past 10-15 years of my travelling abroad, I have been pulled aside about 12 times for random checks. That can’t be a coincidence. I’m a brown guy and an actor at that, I sometimes sport a beard, a moustache for a shoot,” said Dhanania, speaking to TOI. Which was why he expected a lengthy round of questioning when a CISF personnel picked up his flute case and asked “Yeh, aapka hai? Kuch baat karni hai (Does this flute belong to you? I want to speak to you)”. To his surprise, the questions were about practicing the flute. “He said he was learning to play it. He asked whether I had a YouTube channel where he could pick up the music lessons. This was a pleasant surprise,” Dhanania said. On the CISF personnel’s insistence, Dhanania played the instrument briefly and the few passengers around stopped to take in the scene. The minute it was over, the personnel appla-uded, much to Dhanania’s embarrassment. Though the personnel appeared keen to connect with Dhanania, he put his uniform first and did not exchange numbers. The two flautists parted ways. Later , Dhanania put out a thread on Twitter. At least for one moment, CISF guy and I could put aside the invisible wall and connect as two students of music, he tweeted. It went viral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/musical-connect-at-airport-flautist-cisf-man-exchange-notes/articleshow/83904319.cms||---
---||Delhi||How Delhi zoo inmates are beating the heat and boredom: Swings, ropes and more||NEW DELHI: From providing wooden balls to leopards to creating swings in the enclosures of bears, the authorities at National Zoological Park have taken many steps to keep animals active and engaged as part of the seasonal enrichment and summer drill. Monkeys have been given wooden rollers to remain occupied. And when they roll it, they get fruits. Ramesh Pandey, director, National Zoological Park, said, “The enrichment has been done to enhance the activity of animals and their comfort. Wooden balls have been given to the leopards and jaguars, while swings and ropes have been erected in the primates arena.” Wooden planks and platforms have been set up in the enclosures of carnivores, while thatched roofs have come up in the spaces of herbivores. To beat the heat, water pools have been created for the animals. Elephants are being given pressure pump baths, along with mud baths. Apart from adding new features in the enclosures of the animals, novel methods have been adopted to give them food. While meals are served directly, some food items are given in a different manner. For instance, bamboo feeders are being used to give nuts to monkeys. “We have made holes in bamboo sticks so that the monkeys can take out one nut at a time. The monkeys keep shaking the bamboo feeders to get nuts. This exercise keeps them active,” said Pandey. For bears, zoo staff hid a pot of honey by covering it with leaves. The animals found the honey by smelling it. Besides, food items like fruits were hanged in the arena so that the animals jumped to grab them. The zoo authorities have also updated the food menu considering the change in weather. “Cucumber, melons, seasonal fruits, pears, bananas, wood apple (bael), kheer and khichadi are being given to animals based on their need,” said a zoo official. The Delhi zoo has been closed to the public for over a year. It was briefly reopened in April, but after the second wave of Covid-19, it was shut down again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-zoo-inmates-are-beating-the-heat-and-boredom-swings-ropes-and-more/articleshow/83902342.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Most airlines putting out cheap fares for travel in August-October||MUMBAI: Conventionally, airfares cool in June and July. This year, fares are high as government hiked its lowest fare cap by around 15% for travel in June-July. Then the drop in Covid cases brought about a spike in demand for air travel, and what you have is the cheapest fare, say on the Mumbai-Delhi route, priced over Rs10,000. Even for travel late next month. But for August, the cheapest return fare on Mumbai-Delhi is Rs4,600. A similar fare drop can be seen across most domestic sectors. On sale or not, most airlines have put out cheap fares for travel in August-October to rake in much-needed forward booking revenue. Among routes on which fares dropped considerably from August, compared to June-July, are those from Mumbai to Kolkata, Srinagar, Chennai, Kochi, Varanasi and Lucknow. The cheapest return fare to fly from Mumbai to Srinagar is over Rs15,000 for the next five weeks, but for August, the fare starts at Rs8,300. Alliance Air, Vistara and SpiceJet offered monsoon sale schemes last week, though airfares for August-October are low across most airlines.  But if there is one reason to not book now, it’s uncertainty over the third Covid wave. Airlines have considered that. “In the monsoon sale, most airlines are offering one date change free depending on the sector and fare category, due to lockdown,” said Jay Bhatia, vice-president of Travel Agents’ Association of India. “It’s always easy to change bookings and obtain refunds when the ticket is booked through travel agents. Travellers are tired of staying home and are ready to holiday or commence business flights on completion of two shots of the vaccine,’’ he said. Another incentive is that airfares from August are not yet capped. “If fare capping comes in later, no additional fare will have to be paid by passengers,” said Bhatia..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-most-airlines-putting-out-cheap-fares-for-travel-in-august-oct/articleshow/83904336.cms||---

This has not only left the farmers restless, but has also added to the worry of the agriculture department and the district administration. “Each passing dry day in the month of June is only adding to the worry of the farmers. There have been literally no rainfall and hence only about 12 per cent of sowing has been completed till date,” district superintendent agriculture officer in-charge Vivek Sonawane said. According to the district administration Igatpuri taluka has received 129% of its 495 mm of rain for June, while Surgana and Peth have received 121% (270 mm) and 101% (293 mm rains) of rainfall respectively. While most rainfall has in the western areas that constitute hilly region of Sahyadris, the planes are yet to see any significant amount of showers. Six out of 15 talukas — Nashik, Dindori, Nandgaon, Kalwan, Deola and Yeola — have received less than 50% of their average June rainfall. The farmers are worried about the situation as the month of June is about to end. “We had rains in the month of May. The reports also showed that there will be rains in June, but that has not been the case. Many of us are yet to start sowing for kharif season. Each passing day is adding burden on our head,” Satyajeet Nimbole, a resident of Yeola taluka, said. The farmers have been advised to undertake sowing only after about 80 mm of rain, but barring six talukas none fit the bill. It should be noted that last year barring two talukas all 13 of them received more than 100% rain for the month till June 27, while for the remaining two talukas it was 80%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-farmers-tense-as-most-talukas-remain-dry/articleshow/83900302.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Police commissioner Deepak Pandey said he was issuing the orders to regulate flow of people into the market areas and the work would start from Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. The flow of people in market areas will be regulated by giving them free coupons with entry time on them and instructing people to leave the market within an hour of pay fine of Rs 500. Meanwhile, traders said there are many small lanes that lead to the markets and the police also need to keep an eye here as well. This system was also put in place in April this year during the peak of Covid-19. According to police, some markets in the city witness huge rush of customers. “At times, people spend time window shopping or taking a lot of time to decide if they want to purchase a particular product. This creates even more rush in the market, thereby increasing the risk of infection spread,” a police officer said. Pandey said district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal conducted a meeting of heads of various department on Thursday and took stock of the Covid-19 situation.

He had fled to Nepal but was nabbed last Thursday soon after he returned home. The seized ganja worth Rs 3.5 crore was meant to be smuggled to Surat but was brought to Mumbai at the last moment in February this year since the Surat receiver was arrested by the Gujarat police. ANC had arrested two — Akash Yadav (35), a tempo driver, and his alleged accomplice Dineshkumar Saroj alias Sonu (40) — and seized 1,800kg ganja from their vehicle near Vikhroli in February. The accused had smuggled the drug into the city from Odisha. But the alleged main buyer and supplier, Satpute, had fled the city, said police. The accused smuggle five tonne of ganja into the state every month, of which around 3.5 tonne is distributed in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane and Palghar alone. The seized ganja was hidden in a cavity made under the tempo which was then covered with coconuts. Both Yadav and Sonu were booked under the NDPS Act. There are three criminal cases against Yadav in Gujarat. The drug was sent from Odisha by one Laxmi Pradhan. After fleeing from Thane, Satpute went to Indore in Madhya Pradesh and then to Gorakhpur before finally landing in Nepal. A team led by DCP Dutta Nalawade and senior inspector Lata Sutar had been keeping tabs on Satpute. Police teams kept visiting Satpute’s Thane home and studied call data records of various mobile phones to track him. “Satpute owns a godown in Bhiwandi for this purpose. The gang would hire a tempo and a driver would take it out of the city. Later, another driver would take it to a district on Andhra Pradesh border where he would be asked to stay in a hotel while another driver would take the tempo to Odisha where they would collect the ganja, cover it with coconuts and bring it back to the hotel. The driver at the hotel would then take the tempo to Maharashtra,” a senior officer had said. When the driver reaches Mumbai, he would be replaced by another who would drive to Bhiwandi, added police. Driver Yadav would get Rs 25,000 per trip while Sonu got Rs 35,000 per month. The ganja would be bought for Rs 8,000 per kg and sold in Maharashtra for Rs 18,000 to Rs 20,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/1800kg-ganja-case-key-accused-held-after-4-mth-chase/articleshow/83904350.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Jaipur||Builders seek extension of stamp duty relief till March ’22||Jaipur: The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI) has written a letter to the finance department to extend relaxation on stamp duty till March 2022 which was announced by chief minister Ashok Gehlot in the 2021-22 Budget.On the demand of the developers, the CM had announced to reduce stamp duty on housing units in multi-storey buildings from 6% to 4% until June 30, 2021. The benefits were provided to buyers purchasing a flat worth up to Rs 50 lakh.Developers, however, claimed that the real estate industry failed to reap the benefit of relaxation as strict guidelines were imposed during the second wave.Rajasthan CREDAI chairman Gopal Prasad Gupta said, “Before the industry could have recovered from the first lockdown, the second wave disturbed the earnings of buyers and benefit was not derived. The developers also faced financial setbacks. We have requested the state government to extend the relaxation to motivate the buyers,”After the first lockdown, both consumers and real estate industry faced a setback as the stamp duty was increased to 6% from 5%. Also, with 1% registration fee and 30% other taxes, the total stamp duty had gone up to 8.8%.This year in February the relaxations were announced, the buyers were expecting financial benefits. However, the restrictions imposed during the second wave put a spoke in real estate industry’s wheel.“The consumers who planned buy a flat up to Rs 50 lakh were supposed to pay total 5.6% stamp duty, including other taxes till the given date. But not many could crack the deal due to second wave,” said Manoj Agarwal a real estate developer.A senior official at UDH said, “We would recommend to accept the proposal of the developers as industry is reeling under financial crises since long and needs a boost to revive.”The CREDAI has also demanded extension from the Rajasthan Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) for submitting quarterly progress reports (QRPS) of their registered projects.In the recent orders, the authority mentioned that the last date for submission of QRPs for all the earlier quarters and also for the quarters ending on March 31, 2021 has been extended to June 30, 2021 without any delay processing charges or penalty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/builders-seek-extension-of-stamp-duty-relief-till-march-22/articleshow/83904353.cms||---

Sorrowing Lies My Land, published in 1955 in the years preceding Liberation, is his most famous work as a novelist. Centred on attempts to free Goa, it ran into several editions, and was translated to Konkani, Marathi and Portuguese. As a journalist, he was founding co-editor of The Navhind Times, and first editor of Goa Today. He didn’t follow in the footsteps of his father, a doctor, but graduated in English literature from St Xavier’s College, Bombay (now Mumbai). Prior to Liberation, his writings had him arrested and sentenced to prison, following which he fled to Mumbai. His family said he’d be laid to rest at the Taleigao cemetery on Monday. The story of his marriage, too, is one of Goan legend. Refusing to enter into matrimony while Goa was under Portuguese rule, he vowed to do it only in an “independent and Liberated Goa, when he could breathe the free air”. In December 1961, the month Goa was liberated, he married Dr Jolly. Half a century later, he received the state’s highest civilian honour, the Gomant Vibhushan. “I won’t grow old,” he had once told his friends when they asked how he would cope in his old age in his new house in Dona Paula, which was built on various levels. Lambert’s close friend and successor at Goa Today, Vinayak Naik, said Mascarenhas continued visiting him in office right through his mid-90s. “He drove his own car till the age of 90, and even gave me a lift on one occasion,” he said. “He was a versatile, multifaceted personality — a very gutsy freedom fighter and very pioneering. Above all, he was full of joie-de-vivre,” Naik said of his friend. “He was a very good fiction writer. Only a creative person can write fiction,” Naik says. Lambert’s daughter Nayantara de Lima Leitao said that her father stuck to his principles. “He was never afraid to tell the political party of the time what he felt, and never cared for the repercussions. Politicians told us he was never scared, and they respected him for that,” she said. “He was allowed the freedom to say what he wanted to a certain degree. When he couldn’t, he left and started his own magazine, Goa Today. He was very proud of it and he could voice his opinion to Goans all over the world. Moreover, he was an adventurer at heart. He loved to travel and loved his family,” Nayantara said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lambert-mascarenhas-freedom-fighter-and-journalist-dies-at-106/articleshow/83904391.cms||Lisa Monteiro

As the government has opened the vaccination for spot registrations, I had come here today to get my second shot. I was told that there is no Covishield in stock, and only those due for the second shot of Covaxin can get the jabs,” he said. “Several like me who travelled here on Sunday morning had to go back. Why can’t there be a better communication on availability?” Ramani was not alone in the despair – it was second consecutive day for Ahmedabad where several vaccination centres either got shut down after a few jabs or had to put in the notices outside the premises to inform citizens that they had run out of the stock. Analysis of the daily vaccination figures reveals that Sunday’s vaccination was the lowest in at least past 30 days at 20,100. The launch of mega vaccination drive had seen 42,753 vaccines on June 23. In a matter of four days, the number got dipped more than 50%. A medical officer told TOI on condition of anonymity that the issue is persistent for the past one week, but it’s more acute for the past two days. “The primary chunk currently is from 18-44 years age group. Earlier, there was a registration system, and the authorities had the fair idea of turnout. But now due to walk-ins and stress on the mega drive, the demand and supply is not met,” said the medical officer. Sources close to the development said that Covishield supply is hit badly, and now a large bulk is of the citizens wishing to get the second shot. The situation got worse at Tagore Hall and at Kameshwar Hall in Naranpura that the city police teams had to be deployed. Sources at the spot said that the double issue of non-availability of vaccine and breaking of queues by some triggered the ruckus. The condition was not any different in the eastern city parts. The vaccine stock had run dry at Arbudanagar and Odhav UHCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jab-scarcity-only-chaos-cops-injected-into-scene/articleshow/83904497.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Each health centre to have 10 oxygen concentrators under MLA LAD fund||JAIPUR: Every Community Health Centre (CHC) in the state will have at least 10 oxygen concentrators along with power back-ups to deal with any medical emergency. Some of the CHCs located far away from the civil hospitals will have ICU facilities with Bipap machines and other medical equipment. The state has over 3,500 CHCs. These are some of the newly added eligible works in the revised guidelines of the MLA LAD fund. The aim is to utilise the entire fund on upgrading and strengthening healthcare for at least in the present financial year. This financial year, the state government has increased the allocation of funds from Rs 2 crore to Rs 5crore. It is estimated that Rs 600 crore will be utilised on improving healthcare. The health department has carried out an extensive survey of its existent health care system and identified areas in which improvement is required. They have submitted to the rural department which has finalised the draft and submitted it to chief minister Ashok Gehlot. “Every CHC, PHC and other healthcare centre has been evaluated on the footfall, projections in the coming years, facilities and location. Thereafter, a gap analysis has been done to list out how to strengthen the facilities,” said Siddhart Mahajan, secretary, health and family welfare department. The fund will also be allocated for installing oxygen plants at CHCs where footfall is much higher. “The detailed list of medical and other equipment have been provisioned in the list of MLA LAD funds. It will change the face of the healthcare system forever in the state,” said Mahajan. Several buildings which require repair and up-gradation will also be done with the funds. MLA LAD fund has been set up for land area development with a major focus on infrastructure, repair of roads, streets, water pipeline, electricity poles, community centres, health and relief work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/each-health-centre-to-have-10-o2-concentrators-under-mla-lad-fund/articleshow/83904344.cms||---

The pandemic has now killed close to four million people across the world. The Delta strain of the virus remains a concern and is now in 85 countries. Still, in much of Europe and the US curbs on daily life are easing as vaccination programmes bear fruit. The UK reported the fewest daily coronavirus cases in five days and the number of deaths fell by half, a potential sign that the recent surge in cases linked to the Delta variant may be nearing its peak. A total of 14,876 new cases were reported on Sunday, down from 18,270 on Saturday, with deaths declining to 11 from 23 on Saturday. The success of the country's vaccine campaign - more than 84% of adults have had at least one shot - has limited the impact of the latest outbreak with fewer people getting serious cases or requiring hospitalisation. Moscow, however, on Sunday recorded 144 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours. Russia as a whole has seen an explosion of new infections since mid-June driven by the Delta variant. The Delta variant is also feeding fresh outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Australia where authorities have brought back or extended restrictions. More than five million Sydney residents endured their first full day of a two-week lockdown on Sunday. Restaurants, bars and cafes were shuttered and stay-at-home orders were issued, leaving the city centre virtually deserted. More than 110 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Sydney since a driver for an international flight crew tested positive in mid-June for the Delta variant. Australia's northern city of Darwin also entered a separate snap 48-hour lockdown on Sunday after a handful of cases were linked to a coronavirus outbreak on a remote gold mine. New Zealand extended restrictions in the Wellington region for two days despite finding no evidence yet that an Australian tourist with Covid-19 spread the virus while visiting the city last weekend. Gathering limits and social distancing requirements will remain in place until at least midnight on June 29. Indonesia set a new daily infection record of more than 21,000 cases. Hospitals are flooded with patients in the capital Jakarta and other Covid-19 hotspots. Indonesia has moved to temporarily beef up restrictions on movement, but it has so far held off imposing strict lockdowns. Thailand will from Monday reimpose restrictions on restaurants, construction sites and gatherings in the capital Bangkok. In neighbouring Malaysia, the PM announced that a nationwide lockdown in place for about a month will continue, and he gave no date for the lifting of restrictions. Bangladesh said it would impose a new national lockdown from Monday, with offices shut for a week and only medical-related transport allowed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/delta-surge-shuts-down-asia-pacific/articleshow/83908300.cms||---

Till then, it will hold only virtual hearings. The HC on Thursday had said entry to court premises would be permitted only to persons who have completed 14 days after their second dose of Covid vaccination. Relaxation will be given only to those whose vaccination could not be done for medical reasons as per advisory of the central and state governments after scrutiny. The previous notification issued by the court said considering the constant decline in positive cases and after exhaustive discussion with medical experts, it is notified that while continuing with all preventive measures for effective control and containment of spread of Covid, regular hearing of cases in Rajasthan high court would commence from June 28 both by physical presence and video conferencing (hybrid mode).

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Farmers to sell organic produce||JAIPUR: The state agriculture department has recently launched a programme under which farmers of villages near here will sell fresh organic vegetables, fruits and grains to the residents. At an event organised at Rajasthan Agriculture Research Institute (RARI) titled ‘Organic Product Sales Promotion Site’ in Durgapura, agriculture minister Lal Chand Kataria said people are becoming aware about the advantage of purity in food products and their inclination towards organic products is increasing. Farmers are also turning to organic farming with modern technology and tradition. He said the centre had been started to increase the market access of organic growers and to provide authentic organic products to consumers easily. The farmers will initially bring and sell fresh organic produce here twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. Later, depending on the success of the programme, there is a plan to start such sales centres at the entrance of Pant Krishi Bhawan and major parks of the city. Agriculture department commissioner Omprakash said 12 stalls had been set up at the site where farmers will sell authentic organic products from 10am to 5pm on Mondays and Thursdays.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/farmers-to-sell-organic-produce/articleshow/83904383.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Hertiage mayor’s meeting with Dhabai raises eyebrows||JAIPUR: Mayor of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC), Heritage, Munesh Gurjar’s visit to the residence of JMC, Greater’s officiating mayor Sheel Dhabai has raised several eyebrows. Gurjar had visited Dhabai after she alleged that a man was tried to attack her on Saturday. Unlike before when suspended mayor Somya Gurjar and Munesh Gurjar were never seen together, this was the first time when both the mayors were seen empathetic to each other. A senior BJP councilor anonymously said, “It is evident that after the appointment of Dhabai, she has become indebted to the current government. Constantly thanking the ruling party, meeting the ministers of the Congress party and the arrival of Congress mayor Munesh Gurjar shows that closeness is growing there.” Recently, in a free vaccination drive organised at Gopalpura bypass, Dhabai was present along with Congress minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas. In most of the incidences, it has become clear that the bridge with the opposition has burnt. There have been many incidences of both mayors having tussle especially when while catching the illegal dairy owners, Somya Gurjar crossed over to Heritage territory. Both the mayors were at the loggerheads that time. A BJP leader said, “Things are in front of the party. We are just waiting for the right opportunity. It is understandable that because appointment is done by the state government she is thankful. Since, her appointment you can see all the files or plans that were stuck by the state government were approved. Every announcement made recently was originally plan of Somya Gurjar which is easily been approved the state government.” Sources also say that due to the age of Dhabai, she knows that this is the last term of her political career. Hence, she is doing whatever it takes to be in power. Although no one in the BJP came on record regarding this but if the judgement of the high court is in favour of Dhabai, we all know she is not going anywhere, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-h-mayors-meeting-with-dhabai-raises-eyebrows/articleshow/83904368.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Pilgao’s fallow khazan land set for revival as first-time farmers join hands||PANAJI: For the past 15-odd years, khazan lands in the village of Pilgao had been lying fallow after the kin of the farmers decided to opt for alternative careers. This was until community farming was introduced to the young generation of these agriculture families, following which they availed of the scheme. Forming the Hands to Help group, these community farmers have literally put their hands together to revive their land holdings. “Though they come from farming families, they are young generation of first-time farmers who will be starting their own journey. Most of their elders had left farming after saline water started entering the farmlands making it tough to cultivate crops,” said zonal agriculture office (ZAO) Nilima Gavas. Sunil Vaigankar, one of the community farmers from the newly-formed farmers’ group, said that it was after officers from the Bicholim ZAO approached them with the concept that they adopted the method. “Taking up this task individually can prove to be burdensome, but as a group, we can cultivate together and grow our own crops,” he said. The group now has a total of 34 members that have brought approximately 20.79 hectares of land under cultivation. A power tiller has been installed in the farm to revive the land and the process of ploughing is ongoing. They are currently prepping to sow paddy with the onset of the kharif season. “Since the lands are khazan, we are going to give them salt tolerant seed varieties of paddy free of cost for this venture, Gavas said. The farmers’ group was recently granted approval for the directorate of agriculture’s community farming scheme, wherein 90% of the project cost will be covered. With their project estimated to cost Rs 32.3 lakh, Rs 29 lakh will be covered under the subsidy. Following the paddy harvest later this year, the farming group has also resolved to grow vegetables in the rabi season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pilgaos-fallow-khazan-land-set-for-revival-as-first-time-farmers-join-hands/articleshow/83906436.cms||Nida Sayed

With exactly this in mind, a trio of Class IX students from Navy Children’s School, Dabolim, designed a digital quiz game to highlight India’s contribution to the field of science. What they did not expect is to win the first place at the recently concluded Toycathon 2021 where Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with the participants. Toycathon 2021 is an inter-ministerial initiative organised by the Union education ministry’s innovation cell with support from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and other Union ministries. As part of the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ Modi flagged off the nationwide Toycathon-2021 in January to conceptualise novel toys and games based on Indian civilisation, history, culture, mythology and ethos. “We began working around March. There were two prototypes. One was a website and the other was an app. We decided to go with the app, which had a scoring system and levels, while the website just required users to login and play,” said 14-year old Mayank Yadav, the team leader of the trio. Yadav, along with Krishang Joshi and Tanishq Bhatnagar, designed the game during the peak of the second Covid-19 wave in Goa, using calls to coordinate their efforts. The three of them, aided by their chemistry teacher Neera Singh, are self taught and plan to improve their app by making it visually attractive in the months to come. “I watched a lot of YouTube videos to learn how to build mobile applications,” said Joshi. “The game that we are making, is made for the age group of nine and above.” Their efforts paid off as they were declared as winners of Toycathon 2021 digital edition. “Everybody knows about Einstein and Newton, but very few have heard about Venkatesh Bapuji Ketkar, CV Raman, Aryabhata, Shushruta or Tessy Thomas,” said Yadav. Though the boys are still in school, they know that the app development industry is a big market and that as India grows, there will be a huge growth in the field of online games, interactive websites and social media that caters to the Indian audience. They hope to make a mark for themselves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trio-from-navy-school-at-dabolim-wins-toycathon-for-app-on-indian-scientists/articleshow/83904448.cms||Newton Sequeira

At the dedicated Covid Rajasthan University of Health Sciences (RUHS) hospital, a separate ICU for paediatric patients is coming up where doctors of JK Lon hospital will be deployed. “Children require different kind of facilities for treatment and for that purpose we are developing a separate ICU for paediatric Covid patients and some general beds in the hospital will also remain reserved for the children. We are getting ready to deal with the third wave of Covid. Since we have less than 100 Covid patients currently in our hospital, we have started repairing equipment, recruitment of staff and are expanding our ICU facilities by adding 100 more beds,” said Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent, RUHS hospital. Besides, out of 800 beds, child-specialty government-run JK Lon hospital will dedicate its 600 beds for Covid paediatric patients. “We have reserved 200 beds for super specialities such as paediatric cardiology, paediatric nephrology and also for paediatric surgery. Since such facilities are not available in other children’s hospitals, we have decided not to shift such patients and reserved 200 beds,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon hospital. He said that they will shift other non-Covid patients to government-run Gangauri hospital and Satellite hospital at Sethi Colony. “We will have additional beds in RUHS hospitals for Covid patients, and will shift non-Covid patients to Satellite hospital and Gangauri hospital,” said Dr Shukla, adding that they have 600 beds and out of those 300 are ICU beds, rest 300 will be converted into ICU beds, as the state government is providing more equipment to the hospital. “We have centralised oxygen supply to each bed and when required, will convert them into ICU beds in minutes,” said Dr Shukla. Sethi Colony’s Satellite Hospital has also strengthened its facilities to ensure that if non-Covid patients are shifted from JK Lon hospital, they will face no difficulty in accommodating them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/third-wave-separate-icu-facilities-for-covid-paediatric-patients-at-ruhs/articleshow/83904430.cms||---

Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) received Rs 1,921.11 crore, as its share from the petroleum cess received by Kerala, till March 31, 2020. As per the annual report of KIIFB (2019-20), the government provided Rs 3,651.74 crore from motor vehicle taxes and Rs 2,634.52 crore as grants to KIIFB in that period. As per KIIFB (amendment) Act, 2016, government has set apart 10% of motor vehicle tax in 2016-17, increasing it by 10% every year until it reaches 50% in the fifth year, for KIIFB. The cess levied on petrol and diesel is also given to KIIFB, before Dec 31 every year and paid on an escrow basis from state treasury to KIIFB accounts automatically. And Rs 8,207.07 crore was diverted to KIIFB by the government under these three heads till March 31, 2020, as per the audit report. KIIFB is authorized to avail term-loan from various banks up to Rs 5000 crore. Accordingly, term-loans availed by KIIFB as on March 31, 2020 is Rs 3,015 crore. It has received Rs 5,036.60 crore from various term-loans from banks, KSFE bonds, Masala Bonds and loan from Norka in the same period. At the same time, it has disbursed Rs 4,036.7 crore of the Rs 13,243.67 crore it received through petroleum cess, motor vehicle tax, grants, term-loans and Masala Bond, for various projects, in the same period. Till May this year, KIIFB has approved 903 projects with an outlay of Rs 63,224.42 crore. These projects comprise both physical and social infrastructure across a range of sectors including hospitals and health centres, schools and colleges, roads and bridges, water supply and sanitation, electricity and communication networks, industrial parks, cultural complexes etc. Of these, 488 projects worth Rs 21,309.68 crore were tendered and 27 projects, worth Rs 732 crore, and 160 project components worth Rs 560.29 crore have been commissioned. After approving many projects, KIIFB is in the process of trimming some non-starter projects from the list it has approved. In the case of KSRTC, fund crunch prompted KIIFB to go back on its original promise to fund the purchase of 1,000 buses, restricting itself to just 300. The audit report (2019-20) also mentions that the controversy regarding a CAG audit has only helped in bringing more clarity on the audit aspect of KIIFB. “The subject of audit of KIIFB by CAG has been in the news for some months in 2019. This has brought a great deal of clarity on the subject. What was emphasized by KIIFB was that an audit under Section 14(1) read with 14(2) and (3) in the CAG (Duties and Powers) Act, 1971 does endow CAG full and unrestricted powers to undertake a comprehensive audit of KIIFB,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fuel-price-hike-publics-loss-kiifbs-gain/articleshow/83915278.cms||KP Saikiran

Fresh from the worst period of the ongoing Covid pandemic, Amdavadis are cautious about the predicted third wave and the new Delta Plus variant. In such a scenario, a group of researchers have pointed at wastewater for the fairly accurate estimate of the spike in Covid cases. The researchers based in Ahmedabad claimed that the wastewater surveillance gave a spike ahead of the post-Diwali surge in 2020 with a window of about two weeks before the on-ground surge was recorded. The researchers also claimed that the proof-of-concept study also demonstrated that such method can work for any populous city like Ahmedabad. The study ‘Wastewater surveillance-based city zonation for effective COVID-19 pandemic preparedness powered by early warning: A perspectives of temporal variations in SARS-CoV-2-RNA in Ahmedabad, India’ is published in the latest edition of Elsevier journal Science of The Total Environment, and is authored by Prof Manish Kumar from IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), Madhvi Joshi from Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), along with researchers from GPCB and UNICEF. ‘We detected and quantified variation in SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater samples for three months (September to November) to understand the pandemic situation in Ahmedabad. Among the 116 samples analyzed in the study, 111 (95.7%) were found positive, comprising at least two positive RT-PCR results targeting SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab, S, and N gene,’ mentioned the findings of the study. The study showed spike in RNA concentration in Motera, Ranip, Paldi, Odhav and Vinzol in November compared to September and October figures and claimed that the epidemiological data from the sites (based on AMC data) matches with the surge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/spike-in-covid-concentration-was-found-in-motera-paldi-experts/articleshow/83904503.cms||Parth Shastri

According to Harmara police station, Shayar Meena was arrested with the mic of a ‘suspicious’ news channel and a press card. He was on the run for the past five months after he broke into an electronic shop at Rajawas bus stand and decamped with products including LED TV in January. Police said they also seized a luxury car from him which had big ‘press’ stickers pasted on the front of the windshield and rear. Many a times, he introduced himself as a senior journalist of the news channel and lived in an affluent neighborhood near Chomu. Police said the news channel appears to be dubious as little is known about it. “We had already arrested one accused identified as Rahul Kiradiya in the case. Shayar was on the run. Both the accused had cut through the shutter of the electronic shop and put stolen products onto a tempo-lorry. They sold the stolen products in the grey market,” said Harmara SHO Chaina Ram Bera. Jaipur police claimed that Meena was a skillful criminal adept at breaking into shops and other places. No gate or iron shutter was a deterrent to him. The officials claimed that the accused acted as a journalist by day and a criminal by night. He had been booked in different cases by 14 police stations in Sikar and Jaipur. “He used his status as a journalist to cover up his criminal enterprise and chose a posh locality as his residence so that no one could suspect that he was a thief,” said an official, adding that the accused had been actively involved in criminal activities since 2009. In Jaipur, he was booked by multiple police stations including VKI, Jobner, Kaladera, Chomu, Vaishali Nagar, Ashok Nagar. Such was his notoriety that Jaipur police had recently included him in their list of top-10 criminals sought by cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/citys-wanted-thief-who-posed-as-journalist-held/articleshow/83904421.cms||---

The duo, who became engineers in 2018 and are currently pursuing Masters in Renewable Energy Engineering & Management, have designed a community level solar-powered hydroponic fodder unit for rural areas. The model developed by Basak and Balchandani essentially uses soil-less technology to accelerate cultivation of green fodder. “A combination of passive solar cultivation, evaporative cooling and hydroponics (agriculture using water and nutrients) to grow 6-8kg of green fodder from 1kg seeds. This will lead to the improvement of the rural economy by reducing dependence on agriculture,” Basak said. It was news of farmer suicides that prompted them to take up the project. “Since farmers are dependent on agricultural income that depends on increasingly erratic weather patterns, they suffer losses. Our model aims to build resilience in the rural economy by diversifying their income,” explained Balchandani. What the two classmates intended to do was feed the green fodder grown using hydroponics instead of agricultural waste to improve their nourishment and increase milk productivity that can then be sold. To supplement income further, they propose use of the agri-waste to cultivate mushrooms that can be dried and stored for sale and production of exotic vegetables and herbs, fruits and flowers in greenhouses. Basak and Balchandani have set up a prototype at Teri (The Energy Research Institute). After completing the Masters, Basak intends to do a PhD on the project and set up a pilot study in a village near Canning that is among the places most vulnerable to climate change. “I want to do the study in a village with 200 cows, of which 100 will be given the green fodder diet and the rest continue on the agri-waste feed. This will help find out how much milk production improves. The aim is to start community level development with preference to widows of farmers who have committed suicide due to agriculture distress,” explained Basak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-boys-agri-model-wins-bronze-in-global-competition/articleshow/83902507.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Health teams are collecting samples for genome sequencing of those who have been diagnosed with Covid in different parts of the state. From Dausa, samples were taken from a patient admitted to the district hospital and sent to Jaipur for genome sequencing. “Two persons tested positive for Covid and samples of one has been sent to Jaipur for genome sequencing. The sample was collected on Saturday and the report is awaited,” said Dr CL Meena, principal medical officer, Dausa. Senior health authorities in Jaipur said only one Delta + variant case has been detected in the state so far. “No other person has been found infected with Delta + variant, but surveillance has been intensified,” said a senior health department official. In Bikaner, health authorities continued to camp in Bengla Nagar for the third consecutive day. “We continued our door-to-door survey in the area and collected samples for Covid tests,” said Dr BL Meena, in-charge of Covid, Bikaner. Since Delta+ variant has already been declared as a variant of concern (VOC) and it has increased transmissibility, health authorities are collecting samples from different parts of the state and sending the samples to SMS Medical College and also to a lab from a consortium of laboratories for whole genome sequencing. The state government has developed facilities of genome sequencing at SMS Hospital. Officials claimed that 90% of the samples at SMS Hospital’s genome sequencing have tested positive of Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/surveillance-for-delta-variant-intensifies-in-state/articleshow/83904442.cms||---

Doshi got discharged from a city-based private hospital after 57 days of treatment out of which 17 days were spent on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Doshi was brought to HCG Hospital ICU on April 26, when the city was experiencing peak of the pandemic. His vitals were weak and he was suffering from lack of oxygen (hypoxia). The team first tried to revive him through oxygen therapy, NRBM and non-invasive ventilator. But as nothing worked, he was eventually shifted on ECMO, which is considered to be the last resort. The hospital also credited Doshi’s family for permission to continue the treatment despite slim chances of his revival. Dr Harjeet Singh Dumra, head of critical care at the hospital, said that the case is both a medical success and an example of the patient’s willpower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/man-wins-57-day-war-on-virus/articleshow/83904489.cms||---

Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan directed the departments concerned to complete the installation of these plants by the end of July, while ensuring pressure and purity of the lifesaving gas. With this, the demand for medical oxygen supplies will be met at healthcare institutes in the state. Chairing a meeting to review the installation of PSA plants and allied works here, the chief secretary instructed officials to complete all pre-activities for the installation of plants by July 15, so work of installation and commissioning could be completed by July 25. She asked them to appoint nodal officers to oversee each subwork, including site preparation, DG set installation and gas-pipeline network. The chief secretary also asked them to create a WhatsApp group for each site with deputy commissioners, all nodal officers, executing agencies and hospital superintendents concerned as members for seamless operations and regular updates on the work progress. Principal secretary (water supply and sanitation) Jaspreet Talwar, who heads the state oxygen management group, apprised the chief secretary that Punjab has its own two PSA plants, having a capacity of 1,400 litres per minute (LPM), in Ludhiana and Jalandhar. While 42 plants have been allotted by the Centre mainly for medical colleges and district hospitals in the state, another 33 plants have been arranged by agencies/private bodies for the state. This will add to the state capacity of generating medical oxygen by more than 50 metric tonnes (MT) per day, she added. She said a mobile app for updating work status and photos on sites would be launched soon and the nodal officers will be trained and registered there. It was informed in the meeting that five PSA plants have already been installed and were under trial phase. The site preparation for another five plants was completed and it had been conveyed to the DRDO to move these plants to their destinations in Barnala, Hoshiarpur, Ferozepur, Kapurthala and Tarn Taran. The NHAI, the executing arm for site preparation of Centre-funded plants, was asked to complete the works allotted to it by July 10. NHAI regional officer R P Singh said all work related to site preparation for central plants would be completed by the given date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-to-get-75-psa-o2-plants-by-end-of-july/articleshow/83904459.cms||---

Chairing a meeting of the state’s Covid response group, Mahajan said two cases of Delta Plus variant had been reported in the state, one each from Patiala and Ludhiana, following which the situation demanded active surveillance, aggressive contact tracing and testing to contain its further spread. She said a proposal regarding the installation of whole genome sequencing machine at Government Medical College in Patiala was being taken up by the medical education and research department and Punjab Health Systems Corporation (PHSC). To save data-processing time at labs, she ordered to add barcodes to Covid samples for automated data fetching and ease in early facilitation of reports. Reviewing the state’s efforts to thwart the anticipated third wave of Covid, the chief secretary said a draft policy was being prepared to tackle any more possible waves. She said ICMR had approved dry swab testing in which sample collection in VTM and mRNA extraction iwa not required. The state is going to test this method on a trial basis on 1,000 samples. She stated that data regarding vaccination, disease outcome and whole genome sequencing had already been linked to Cova mobile app and other parameters will be linked soon. The chief secretary asked health authorities to closely monitor districts with a high positivity rate. District epidemiologists have been directed to identify pockets that are reporting higher numbers of cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-to-enhance-surveillance-to-contain-spread-of-delta-variant/articleshow/83904506.cms||---

A number of housing societies have taken up the initiative to deal with issues such as piling up of garbage, potholes which collect rainwater and pet excretion, which might help in combating the spread of such mosquito-borne diseases. “Just as the pandemic is coming under control, we need to be more careful about keeping other seasonal diseases such as dengue at bay. We are focusing on keeping the society premises clean and free of any pools of collected water or waste after a few of our residents were diagnosed with dengue last week,” said a management committee member of a housing society in Undri. “Not only in our society but throughout the locality there have been few cases of dengue. We have reached out to the civic authorities to help with the removal of accumulated rainwater and garbage. What we can do on the society premises is urge each resident to ensure cleanliness in and around their homes. We have also hired help to clean up the premises on a regular basis to prevent any breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In addition to these efforts, we are also encouraging residents to use effective insect repellents,” said the chairperson of a housing society in Kharadi. In some Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas, the rampant growth of water hyacinth is adding to the seasonal mosquito problem for the residents. “Every few months the PCMC workers come and clean up the water hyacinth, but during the monsoons this becomes a serious problem due to the wide spread of diseases such as dengue and malaria. Such health problems are aggravated in slums in the area. We have donated insect repellents, low smoke coils to slum dwellers,” said Sanjay Thorat, resident of Vishrantwadi. Ganesh Patil, a resident from Katraj, said, “The Katraj Lake is also infested with mosquito larvae and though it is an annual occurrence, this year everyone is a little more worried due to the pandemic. We have been having regular sanitisation done in our society thoroughly since the first wave. The management has also been stringent about pet owners picking up their pet’s poop and not leaving it on the premises for flies and mosquitoes to hover around it. Residents are also asked to dispose off their garbage more cautiously, as, when left open or untied in front of their homes, the stray dogs and cats scatter it looking for food, which causes an unhygienic mess that attracts flies and insects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mosquito-related-diseases-prompt-cleanliness-initiatives/articleshow/83904521.cms||---

Rohan Sheth, a final year IT student from Silver Oaks College of Engineering and Technology, Ahmedabad, has finalized his plans for New Jersey in US for a postgraduate in computer science. He has enrolled in a college . But his visa procedure is stuck and cannot be completed before August it seems. “To get my visa, I need my final semester mark-sheet. The exams will be held in July and the mark-sheet will come later. My plans depend on timely holding of the exams,” said Sheth. Maulin Joshi, who runs a consultancy firm said the delay in college exams due to Covid-19 is impacting the overseas plans of many students. “Especially those students whose academic performance depends on their final semester results are in a lot of stress. For students who wish to go overseas before the academic session starts in September, all the preparations including visa approvals should be in place by July 15,” said Joshi. Most of the universities in Gujarat have planned to conduct final year exams for undergraduate and postgraduate students from July 6 to July 15. It would take another 15-20 days for the results to be prepared and given to the students. Many students have received in-principle approval from overseas colleges and universities for further studies, but a final call is taken only after the final semester results are declared and mark-sheets produced. Mili Vakil, a student of integrated BA-LLB at GLS Law College, is looking at a stressful timeline between appearing for her final sixth semester exam slated on July 6 and getting her student visa for her master’s in law course from University of Birmingham, UK. Her course starts from September. Vakil says she has her fingers crossed to complete theexhaustive paperwork needed to start her foreign studies. “There is a long journey ahead which includes appearing for the exam in July, getting marksheet, receiving transcript, provisional degree certificate, other documents, and confirmation from the university for student visa,” said Vakil. Vakil’s friend Tanzim Surani who is also headed to the UK says she is hoping she can start her foreign studies in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/overseas-studies-mark-sheet-turbulence/articleshow/83904540.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Interestingly, the cooperative society has been given the permission to make its deposit scheme attractive to the public at a time when the government has substantially reduced the interest rates of fixed deposits and term deposits in state treasury as well as in Kerala state cooperative bank. The government had cut the interest rates on fixed deposits in cooperative societies by 0.5% across the board for various periods of deposits, when compared to the rates of last year. As per the circular issued by the registrar of cooperative societies on January 22, 2021, the current rates are 4.75% (down from 5.25%) for deposits between 15 and 45 days, 5.25% (from previous year’s 5.75%) for deposits between 46 and 90 days, 5.75% (from 6.25%) for deposits between 91 and 180 days, 6.75% (from 7.25%) for deposits between 181 and 365 days, 6.75% (from 7.25%) for deposits between one to two years and 6.50% (from 7%) for two years and above. Also, the interest rates for treasury deposits were reduced in the range from 1.10% to 2.10%. As per the order issued by the finance department on January 18 this year, the rates of interests on short-term deposits in the treasuries have been reduced and fixed at 5.40% (from previous year’s 6.50%) for deposits between 46 and 90 days, 5.90% (from 7.25%) for deposits between 91 and 180 days, 5.90% (from 8%) for deposits between 181 and 365 days and 6.40% (from 8.50%) for deposits between one to two years. However, in the latest order issued by the cooperative department on June 22, the government has given permission to ULCCS to continue accepting fixed deposits at one percent higher rate till March 31, 2022, so as to garner working capital for completing the various projects it has taken up. In its application to the joint registrar of cooperatives, the ULCCS had requested that it needs to find more funds as it has to complete various projects worth Rs 4,100 crore. It submitted that being a labour cooperative society, the ULCCS is facing difficulty in raising funds, and it is under these circumstances that the cooperative is seeking the permission to accept funds at a higher interest rate. The government had given a similar permission for ULCCS to accept deposits at a higher rate in 2020-21 as well, which had helped the body to garner an additional Rs 342.28 crore. As on March 31 this year, the ULCCS has a balance fixed deposit of Rs 1,370.85 crore, as per the government order. Being an “accredited agency for construction projects under the government”, ULCCS has been earning contracts of several government projects without going through a competitive open tender process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-allows-ulccs-to-accept-fd-at-high-interest-rates/articleshow/83915282.cms||KP Saikiran

Fatuha police station SHO Manoj Kumar Singh said the deceased were identified as Ayush Saurabh (20) and Sanskar (19), both residents of Mithapur under Jakkanpur police station area in Patna. He said altogether six youths, including the duo, had reached the highway on three bikes around 8am. “All of them were friends. They started a bike race with each other,” he said and added that Sanskar was riding one of the bikes and Ayush was riding pillion. “Sanskar lost control on the bike due to high speed and collided with the cemented median strip. Both of them died on the spot due to severe head injury,” he said. Singh said such was the impact that the helmet which Sanskar was wearing got smashed. He said the bike also belonged to Sanskar. “Ayush was not wearing any helmet. His father is a block panchayati raj officer,” Singh said. He said both the bodies were sent for postmortem at NMCH. He said the police are trying to ascertain if the youths possessed valid driving licence or not. The SHO said all the six had left home after lying to their parents that they were going to a water park in Fatuha, which is already closed due to the Covid-induced lockdown restrictions.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad getting just 27% of 85,000 vax doses required per day||AHMEDABAD: The city’s actual demand for vaccines is 85K doses a day. But its dose supply is merely 27% of the demand. The civic body has blamed this shortage for the sharp decline in vaccinations in the city. Also, many citizens who had already taken their first Covishield dose were told that the vaccinating centres had only Covaxin. This happened in Paldi, Thaltej, Naranpura, Baghe Firdaus, Vatva, Naroda, Vastral, and a few other areas. Apart from the shortage, another major reason given by civic officials is the high rate of Covid infections in the Ahmedabad population in April and May. The officials say this led many Amdavadis to delay their vaccination for six to eight weeks as mandated by the health authorities. On Sunday, as against the usual 282 vaccination centres that function, just 109 centres were operational. “Most vaccination centres had to be closed early and a ‘No Vaccine’ board hung outside them owing to the short supply of Covishield,” admits a senior AMC official. The AMC is using only 70% of the 35K-odd vaccines that are reaching it every day, thus allowing some vaccines to pile up to escalate the drive over the next three days. “Vaccinations will pick up over the next four days to 35K a day and then 55K a day,” the official said. “We were told that some of the stock has been diverted to other states where vaccinations are yet to pick up. It will take three days for the logistics to be smoothened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-getting-just-27-of-85k-vax-doses-required-per-day/articleshow/83904577.cms||---

A stretch of the pipeline passes through the eco-sensitive zone of the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary that is home to Asiatic lions and final approval from the state forest department and ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF&CC) has been pending for about two years, said sources close to the development. Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL), which is laying the 86-km evacuation pipeline is, however, hopeful that the project will be completed on time given that the Rs 4,300-crore LNG terminal is about one and a half years away from completion, said a company official. A bigger challenge for GSPL is that it is yet to get clearance from the petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (PNGRB) for laying the Rs 622 crore pipeline between Chhara and Lothpur, said a state government source. “The position of the PNGRB chairman has been vacant for quite some time as a result of which many such projects are stuck. GSPL had submitted its Capex plans to PNGRB one and half years ago. Without these clearances, bidding for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) work cannot be started,” said a source. Like any other infrastructure project, there is some resistance from a few local villagers to the proposed pipeline. But these issues can be addressed, a government official said. It is an intra-state pipeline which passes within eco-sensitive zone of Gir Wildlife Sanctuary for a length of 25.8km and at the nearest point is 4.8km from the boundary of the sanctuary in Gir-Somnath district. According to the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) guidelines, if a project is within 10km from any sanctuary, a no-objection certificate is required from the standing committee of the NBWL. A standing committee member said that the proposal is yet to come before the committee for clearance. “Lions have been spotted in and around Chhara and we will look into the project and how it has been planned,” the official said. According to the EIA notification of 14 September 2006, oil and gas pipelines passing through national parks, sanctuaries, coral reefs and ecologically sensitive areas require prior environmental clearance from MoEF&CC. The terminal project is being developed by HPCL Shapoorji Energy Private Limited (HSEPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL). HSEPL has submitted a wildlife conservation plan with focus on Asiatic lions which has been approved by the state forest department, said a forester aware of the developments. The state wildlife board recommended the project to the state government for consideration seven months ago, said a member of the board. GSPL had entrusted Secon Pvt Ltd with undertaking the environmental impact assessment (EIA) study and preparation of the environmental management plan (EMP) as well as risk assessment and disaster management plans for the proposed pipeline of about 86.61km with a 36-inch diameter having a capacity of 18 million standard cubic metres per day. The pipeline alignment is such that while crossing the ecologically sensitive areas, cutting of trees is minimized or avoided completely, sources in GSPL said. The central government, while planning to cut on oil imports, is shifting to a gas-based economy. With new infrastructure facilities coming up and the state pushing for cleaner fuel, Gujarat, considered a gas hub for over two decades now, is likely to consolidate its position further. GSPL, a Gujarat government undertaking company has been entrusted with erecting a gas grid network in Gujarat by connecting supply points/LNG sources to various demand centres. A public hearing for the environmental clearance was to be scheduled recently but has been postponed due to Cyclone Tauktae which hit parts of Gujarat in May with the Gir sanctuary and forest areas being severely hit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chhara-lng-project-pipeline-faces-challenge-in-lion-landscape/articleshow/83904578.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Kochi||Walkability: Crores spent, miles to go||KOCHI: Thousands of crores have been pumped in for the development and upkeep of city infrastructure under various schemes in the past one-and-a-half decades yet footpaths in various parts of the city remain in poor condition. People are having a tough time because of lack of maintenance and encroachment of the walkways. Take the case of the footpath along M G Road. “The tiles were removed from the footpath while cleaning the drain beneath it. But those who removed the tiles didn’t spare time or effort for replacing the tiles. So, there are pits across the footpath,” said Renjith Thampi, an activist who stands for proper civic amenities. “Dislocated slabs on the footpaths or uncovered drains acts as a death traps for the pedestrians. Many people have suffered injuries after falling into the drains through the holes. What is needed is a coordination among various agencies such as Kochi Corporation and Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KRML) for the renovation and maintenance of the roads and footpaths,” Thampi said. But the officials with Kochi Corporation said that the Metro agency which renovated the footpath a few years ago didn’t provide provisions for cleaning the drain under the footpath. “The workers deployed by the corporation’s contractors would remove the tiles and dig holes on the pavement so as to clear the silt inside the drain. Funds are allotted only for cleaning the drain. That is why the tiles are not replaced,” an official with the corporation said. Mayor M Anil Kumar said he would look into the issue without delay. “The corporation’s officials say that there are no manholes on the footpaths for cleaning the drains. At the same time, the KMRL officials claim they had given a demonstration to the corporation officials while the footpaths were being built on how to clean the drains,” Anil Kumar said. “We will convene an urgent meeting with various agencies such as KMRL and Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) to discuss the issue,” the mayor said. In some stretches, KSEB and BSNL have erected poles on the footpaths obstructing the way for the pedestrians. Though several overhead lines have been replaced with underground cables, the poles, which have no purpose to serve, remain on the footpath. “Private telecom companies and cable TV operators draw their cables from such poles. These cables hanging off the poles pose a threat to the pedestrians,” said K S Dileepkumar, president, Ernakulam Vikasana Samithi, an NGO. Encroachment by shopkeepers is also a major concern for pedestrians across the city. “The pedestrians will have to walk on the busy roads wherever there are shops on the pavements. This causes accidents,” Dileepkumar said. Sharing the concerns aired by him, Thampi said petty shops have started to appear on the recently renovated Abraham Madamackal Road as well. “Still, authorities have not taken any measures for evicting the shops lining up on the footpaths of the recently-renovated road,” Thampi said. Ironically, CSML has upgraded Abraham Madamackal Road into a model road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/walkability-crores-spent-miles-to-go/articleshow/83902628.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Big vax push can cut Covid cases by 85%’||AHMEDABAD: The third wave of Covid-19 may affect India between July 15 and October 13, with a peak in the daily number of cases expected in the first two weeks of September. These are the forecasts of a recent study conducted by a Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) professor along with two Nirma University alumni. The study titled ‘Pattern Recognition: Prediction of Covid third wave in India using time series forecasting with deep learning models’ has been submitted to Elsevier, a scientific journal. The study takes into consideration the vaccination numbers till the second week of June. “If the government’s plans of increasing the vaccination rates five-fold over the next few months are successful, the peak in the third wave will be about 25% of the peak Covid-19 cases in the second wave,” said Manan Shah, assistant professor, department of chemical engineering at PDEU, who was part of the research team. Shah added: “So, it could be somewhere around 1 lakh Covid-19 cases per day.” The study focuses on two likely scenarios of the third wave. The government’s mega vaccination drive that is currently underway is expected to make a big difference of about 85% as compared to the vaccination numbers a month ago. According to one model, the peak number of cases will reach more than 6 lakh per day in September if the vaccination rate remains what it was till mid-June, without any major changes in it. The second wave peaked at around 4.20 lakh daily cases in May. “As per our study, we have predicted a scenario where the number of daily Covid-19 cases will reach a peak of 6.36 lakh around September 25,” said Atharva Shah, an alumnus of Nirma University. “While the number of cases will peak in the first two weeks of September, they will be recorded around the last week of September.” Maharishi Gor, also an alumnus of Nirma University, is another co-author of the study. Using machine learning and AI techniques, the study proposes a deep learning architecture that can forecast the number of cases with vaccination data. “The dataset provided by Johns Hopkins University is taken and the proposed methodology is applied,” according to the research paper. “The model is trained on the US data and the Indian data is used as a test dataset. The model performs well on both the datasets with good forecasting accuracy and reasonable error metrics.” The paper adds: “The model captures the trend of the virus spread and is visualized graphically.” Covid-19 has led to infrastructure collapse in many countries such as India, the paper says. In the vulnerable cities, the paper says, the population density and unstructured layout have made the cases explode with over 29.3 million cases to date with most requiring medical attention. Two inputs were considered for the study — the number of new cases and the vaccination percentage. The US and India were chosen for the study as they were the two worst affected countries in the pandemic. The US was chosen as a training set while India was used as a test set and as a forecasting space. “As vaccination is speeding up across most of the developed countries, India is still at a 3.2% vaccination count as compared to the US which stands at 41%,” according to the paper. “Thus, it becomes important to predict the rise of cases to aid the government in understanding the allocation of resources and arrest the spread of this deadly virus.” The paper is currently under review at Elsevier for publication. “We hope it will be published soon,” said Shah of PDEU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/big-vax-push-can-cut-cases-by-85/articleshow/83904549.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No pre-arrest bail for kin of neta who ‘attacked’ Covid hospital nurse||MUMBAI: Rejecting the pre-arrest bail plea of the husband of a local BJP corporator accused of ramming his car into a new civic Covid Bytco hospital in Nashik and hurling a paver block at a nurse, the Bombay high court has agreed with prosecution that “such incidents should not be tolerated, otherwise wrong message would go in the society”. He is also accused of slapping and abusing the nurse and damaging a stretcher equipped to carry oxygen cylinders in May. BJP is in power in Nashik municipality. Justice Sarang Kotwal recently denied any protection against arrest to Rajendra Tajane, booked for rash and negligent act, assault to deter public servant from doing their duty, and also charged under the Epidemic Diseases Act. The court order said: “In these difficult times, medical staff have worked as Covid warriors and everyone should respect them.” Justice Kotwal said, “If there were some shortcomings in services or shortage of necessary medicines, the applicant [Tajane] should have taken recourse to lawful means to help people. But the manner in which the offence was committed, was definitely not acceptable.” Senior counsel Ashok Mundergi, who appeared for Tajane, submitted that he lost his father at the same hospital on April 23, three weeks earlier, and the day of the FIR (May 15) his relative had been turned away without treatment, triggering his act. He submitted that “considering his mental state, his act can be overlooked”. He also said that Tajane “regrets his acts and is willing to compensate the hospital”. “There was no particular motive. The offence was committed out of anger. He is not a hardened criminal,” Mundargi said, and submitted that custodial interrogation was not necessary. Additional public prosecutor Veera Shinde opposed his plea, saying the offence was not committed on the spur of the moment since sufficient time passed after his father’s demise. The high court said, “As rightly pointed out” by the prosecutor, Tajane had “sufficient time to get over his anger”. The high court order said, “The act committed by the applicant was deliberate and preplanned. He had carried [a] paver block...”. The high court also said that its observations were only for the pre-arrest bail order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-pre-arrest-bail-for-kin-of-neta-who-attacked-covid-hosp-nurse/articleshow/83904581.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Goa||Goa: Dumanem locals fear garbage plant lechate will wash into Agonda river||POINGUINIM: Locals have expressed fear over the leachate from the garbage treatment plant (GTP) at Dumanem in Canacona, possibly washing down into the paddy fields and water bodies below and contaminating them. In 2019, leachate from the GTP had drained during heavy rainfall into the rivulet, carrying the waste to the Agonda river. The paddy fields in the surrounding area too were contaminated by the leachate in 2019. The problem was also witnessed last monsoon and this may become a regular feature during heavy rainfall, locals said. There are residences located barely at a km’s distance from the dump and the authorities were alerted. Come monsoons, the odour reduces but the leachate produced from the mounds of untreated garbage at the treatment plant flows into a roadside drain on to the Dumanem rivulet, which then proceeds to the Agonda river and then finally to the Arabian sea, contaminating thereby all these water bodies, locals said. Chairperson of Canacona Municipal Council Mario Simon Rebello, said he is aware of the issue and the untreated dumps of garbage have been covered and tied with quality plastic sheets so that the problem doesn’t recur like in 2019. “People from Agonda and vicinity dump garbage anytime at the entrance of the GTP, which sometimes is lying there and gets washed through the drainage and is flushed into the Dumanem rivulet and later into the Agonda river. This issue is to be seriously addressed soon after rains and stop the illegal dumping at the entrance,” Rebello said. He said currently, no leachate is seen getting flushed into water bodies as the dumps are securely covered by plastics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dumanem-locals-fear-garbage-plant-lechate-will-wash-into-agonda-river/articleshow/83906498.cms||---

---||Kochi||Dept objected to issuing title deeds in forest land||Idukki: The forest department has raised an objection to the revenue department issuing title deeds in tribal settlement areas of Idukki. The revenue department is issuing title deeds under 1964 rule in tribal settlements where record of rights under Tribal Act 2006 was issued. In June, the revenue department issued an order to issue title deeds in tribal settlement areas of Peringassery, Malainji, Uppukunnu, Poomala, Meathotty and other settlements under Karimannoor taluk office. But the forest department has claimed that the areas are fully under the Thodupuzha reserve forest and now it is being converted into title deed lands without the consent of the central government. Environment activist Hareesh Vasudevan said that the areas are under reserve forest area and the revenue department has no right to issue title deeds. He had sent a notice to the forest department questioning the move. In his reply, the CCF high range circle Georgi P Mathachen stated that the decision was without consent from the forest department and they have informed their objections to Idukki district collector and other higher officials. Mathachen told TOI, “The areas where title deeds are being issued are under forest area and forest right certificates have already been distributed to tribal farmers. When the revenue department issued an order over issuing title deeds in these areas we raised our objections to our higher officials. I had sent a letter to Idukki district collector and tahsildar about the issue but we didn’t get any response.” “We have already completed our proceedings over the issue. Further actions have to be taken by higher-level officials,” he added. Karimannoor land assessment (LA) tahsildar Jose K Jose told TOI that the title deeds issued in these areas under special order were issued by the government. “The revenue department distributed over 800 title deeds in these areas and land owners have already paid the land tax for them. Title deeds were issued to lands outside the forest department ‘Janda’. Before issuing title deeds, the forest department had not raised any objection over its distribution,” said Jose. “Tribal farmers lived in these areas for over 100 years and haven’t got any benefits. The revenue department had received many memorandums and finally the government decided to issue title deeds to the tribal community. We issued title deeds for lands with over 100 years of settlement. The Peringassery area has shops, schools and other establishments which are over 70 years old,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dept-objected-to-issuing-title-deeds-in-forest-land/articleshow/83900631.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Experts divided over Delta Plus threat to kids||NAGPUR: While some city doctors believe the new variant — Delta Plus — poses a bigger threat to unvaccinated or uninfected population, another set of medical practitioners feels the variant of concern may not be equally harmful for kids. Yet, there is nothing wrong in keeping the healthcare system prepared, they say. Well-known physician and paediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari said he doesn’t see the Delta Plus variant as a serious concern. “We need to be prepared which even otherwise is useful for us, but we shouldn’t panic thinking about possible third wave or new variants. There is nothing to suggest the latest variant would affect those below 18 years. Mutations are known for mild severity. Most pathogens become less severe as they mutate,” he said. When pointed out that a double mutant was behind the second wave, Dr Deopujari said, “The Delta variant or double mutant was an exception. It is not going to be like this every time.” Paediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charade says Delta Plus has properties to affect lungs and bypass vaccine immunity. “But at the moment, no trend suggests the risk has increased. Whether the third wave would be triggered by it or not is also not clear. Our concerns remain the same as for as Delta variant is concerned. But we never know when it will take form of a pandemic,” he said. Dr Charade added that looking at Nagpur district scenario, already 60 to 70% population has been exposed to the virus in some or the other way. Over 4.76 lakh have already been infected, while over 30 lakh have been tested, many of them being close contacts. “There will be some immunity. Luckily, Covid hasn’t been much of a threat to kids so far and we hope it stays so,” said Dr Charade. Differing with these views, critical care specialist Dr Shishir Shrivastav said the new variant Delta Plus will be able to affect children due to its mutated genomic sequence. “In fact, lack of vaccine trial approvals causing the delay in children’s immunization is a global concern. Nobody knows how many mutations will take place before total immunization happens. Till then, Covid-appropriate behaviour is the key of safety,” he said. A GMCH paediatrician said many aspects of the new variant are yet to be answered. “I can’t say whether we need to be worried or stay relaxed. We are prepared for the third wave. As of now, can’t answer question if kids will be involved,” the doctor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/experts-divided-over-delta-plus-threat-to-kids/articleshow/83904628.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: CPM suspends Sajesh from party||KOZHIKODE: Moving ahead with the decision to distance itself from persons having links with quotation gangs and smuggling rackets, CPM, on Sunday, suspended party member C Sajesh – who allegedly gave his car to Arjun Ayanki, a suspect in the gold smuggling case connected with Ramanattukara gold heist bid – pending inquiry. Meanwhile, police took into custody the car (reportedly used by Arjun) that was found parked on a hillock near Pariyaram Ayurveda Medical College in Kannur. The number plate of the car was removed. The vehicle was shifted to Pariyaram police station. Police had been on the lookout for the car that was spotted three days ago near Azheekkal port but it was moved before it could be taken into custody. The decision to suspend Sajesh from Moyyaram branch committee membership was taken by Kannur district committee. Sajesh, who was Chembilod area secretary of DYFI, was expelled by the youth organization on Saturday. CPM Kannur district secretariat, which met on Saturday, and the district committee meeting on Sunday decided to send out a strong message that the party won’t tolerate if any of its cadres have links with persons connected to quotation and smuggling gangs. Party units will maintain vigil to see if any members have links with persons connected with the gangs. CPM Kannur district committee said in an official release that a probe found that the vehicle used by the quotation gang belonged to Sajesh. “It helped the quotation gang and tarnished the reputation of the party. So it has been decided to suspend Sajesh from CPM pending inquiry,” it stated. The party was forced to publicly disown persons connected with such gangs after names of some CPM and DYFI activists came up in connection with Karipur gold smuggling bid, including Arjun, who is a former DYFI activist and a cyber-warrior for the party. CPM leader M V Jayarajan had said two days ago that ‘quotations’ were being given to rob gold from the team that collects smuggled gold from carriers and the activities of these persons were a social evil. Customs suspect that Arjun reached Karipur airport on June 21 and had allegedly told Mohammed Shafeeq, the carrier who was nabbed by Customs with 2.3kg gold, that he would wait outside the airport. Another gang from Cherpulassery had reached the airport to rob the smuggled gold and police suspect that the road accident which killed five persons belonging to Cherpulassery gang had taken place when they were returning after pursuing the car of Arjun believing that he was taking the gold from the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/cpm-suspends-sajesh-from-party/articleshow/83909389.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Parents of LGBTQIA+ members warm to gender-neutral pronouns||Would you like to speak to them?” asks Renu Sharma over the phone, referring to her 21-year-old daughter, Ria. She knows it sounds awkward to the outsider this use of a plural pronoun for a singular person but the mother, who deliberately started referring to Ria as “my child” instead of “my daughter” in public, apart from shedding the pronouns ‘she’ and ‘her’ few years back, knows how reaffirming the use of ‘th-ey’ and ‘them’ can be for Ria. “They liberate me from wrong pronouns I had to fit into,” says Ria, a young activist-cum-educator who identifies as a “gender-fluid lesbian”, and who uses the gender-neutral title ‘Mx’, instead of the previously stifling ‘Ms’ before the name. As a “vocally androgynous” short-haired person living not only in a world full of hostile ladies’ compartments and dismissive women’s loos, but also in a body that seems to “rebel against the soul” by menstruating every month, as if to remind “you are a woman”, the airy pronouns “restore my sense of identity”, says Ria. This Pride Month, the international spotlight shone brightly on the need to make language more inclusive. A video-conferencing platform recently rolled out a new pronoun feature that enables users to “better express gender”, while a photo-sharing app allowed users to share up to four pronouns on their profile from options including ‘she’, ‘he’ and the gender-neutral ‘ze’, ‘ve’ among many others. Conversation around this new roomy lexicon in which ‘they/them’ are not alienating but welcoming terms has yet to gather steam in India given that LGBTQIA+ members are still groping for familial acceptance, if not coping with lockdown-induced return to closeted lives. A handful of parents, though, seem to be quietly reconfiguring their gendered vocabulary to ensure a long overdue cultural auto-correct. Padma Iyer, mother of ‘gender-fluid’ LGBTQIA+ activist Harish Iyer, who now uses the pronouns ‘he/she’, makes it a point to introduce herself in group settings and panel discussions as: “Padma Iyer, she/her”. “It’s a conversation starter,” says Iyer, the co-founder of Sweekar, a support group for parents of LGBTQIA+ members which discusses concerns ranging from “how to come out to the extended family” to “mental health resources for trans kids” online. Among them is Sheila Deshmukh (name changed), a former banker and expert in gender diversity who refers to her teenaged son as ‘they/them’. When Deshmukh recently updated her professional profile with preferred pronouns ‘she/her’, inquisitive friends and colleagues asked why. “Because that’s the right thing to do,” Deshmukh told them. “In matters of social justice, change has to happen at the subliminal level,” says Deshmukh, who explained her son’s sexual orientation to her mother using stories from Hindu mythology and who welcomes the recent spate of tasteful LGBTQIA ads on OTT platforms. “These conversations should be part of everyday existence,” says Deshmukh, who follows LGBTQIA Hollywood actors on social media in search of “benchmarks” and has honest chats with her high-achieving, sensitive son on everything from pop culture’s LGBTQIA stereotypes to how marriage may not be the path to happiness for everyone. “The world comes later,” she says, adding that her son must not feel uncomfortable at home. But home, let alone language, remains an uncomfortable place for those who returned to their families during lockdown after losing jobs and did not come out to them for fear of having nowhere to go in case of backlash. If Ria got “crisis messages” from a few who were not accepted, Aruna Desai of Sweekar recalls many kids who sent messages on the support group’s social media page confessing that watching the group’s awareness-building live discussions kept them from self-harm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parents-of-lgbtqia-members-warm-to-gender-neutral-pronouns/articleshow/83904611.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Hyderabad||India needs a mental health vaccination as well||A cocktail of emotions while dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, including extreme fear, panic, grief, guilt, loss of loved ones, uncertainty about livelihood, are all leading to countless health issues. Prof K. Sekar, head, Centre for Psycho-Social Support in Disaster Management at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) spoke to Bappa Majumdar about various mental and behavioural issues that people may face and how to address them. Since the first Covid-19 wave, how many people have reached out to NIMHANS for help? We have handled some 4.5 lakh calls related to Covid trauma and 54,000 people have sought secondary level help. From single parent to children and sons to one in isolation, the pandemic hasn’t spared anyone. To address such issues, we have started a special clinic. It’s important to note that not just a pandemic vaccination, we need to give a mental health vaccination in the country as well. The first 14 days for a covid-19 patient is most distressing period. illness. How does one cope in that period? During this time, it is important for a person to follow instructions provided by the physician, but he/she also needs to engage in other activities. Apart from a feasible routine schedule, proper diet and adequate sleep are very essential. Mild breathing exercises, reading books, listening to music, connecting with family and friends over video and audio calls helps a lot. Scared of spreading the virus, many lock themselves for longer durations. What impact does it have on mental health and what is your advice? People should not lock themselves in, out of fear. Such intense fear of spreading the infection along with frequent cleaning of surfaces and objects can lead to mental health distress. The best solution to reduce such fear is to just follow the general guidelines provided by the ministry of health and family welfare about home isolation and recovery and keep the mind busy in activities. Can guilt for not being able to be with someone who died or inability to perform last rituals have a long-term impact on mental health? The biggest problem is the lack of societal support due to the contagiousness of the disease. The pandemic has disrupted the social fabric, the families have to bear with the loss of their loved ones in isolation. Complicated grief may lead to sleep disturbances, inability to focus at work, hopelessness and in few individuals, a wish to join the deceased. It is important to support each other during these tough times. Virtually connect to your friends/families who have lost their loved ones. Share about the times you have spent with them and importantly make them express their feelings and memories of the deceased. The local community may conduct virtual condolences meetings to share the trauma and loss. A few individuals, based on the severity of the grief reaction, may benefit from specific counselling like cognitive behavioural therapy. There are cases of Covid recovered patients waking up in the middle of the night, sweating and worrying about complications? We have never seen people fearing a disease like they do in case of Covid-19, as soon as they test positive. They fear about how the disease will progress and its outcome, they fear about catching secondary infections, they are worried about the rehabilitation of their lungs in case they develop pneumonia. They are worried about the other housemates’ health and other logistic difficulties. First, one may ask the treating doctor about the recovery process, the time it might take, and precautions one must take during that time. A discussion with people who have already recovered from Covid-19 may also help one understand the after-effects of the disease and the process of recovery. Thousands of kids have become orphans. What can the immediate family or friends do to safeguard their lives? It is a delicate situation to deal with. Here immediate relatives and friends of the family should come forward to support the child. Government financial and social support measures will play a vital role too. An age-appropriate conversation with the child about the situation is the important first step. It is essential to state the facts to the child (No lies, no half-truths) and equally important in making the child convey his/her emotions. Clarify the changes in the family system, who will look after the child now and how this may help the child. Such openness and clarity may improve the child’s trust with the process. We may also recommend helping the children express their pent-up feelings through drawing, painting, music, etc. Most importantly helping these children return to their routine activities, play and studies is very important for their mental and emotional health. Consult a professional when the child’s emotional reactions are persistent, overwhelming and distressing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/india-needs-a-mental-health-vaccination-as-well/articleshow/83904649.cms||Bappa Majumdar

Gohil said in his complaint with Shahpur police that he had bought the car from Bjarangsingh Rajpurohit and Farukh Pappu in December 2020. The two accused had bought the car from another buyer from Paldi and they did not change the owner’s name in RTO. Gohil said that he had given Rs 1.92 lakh for the car to Rajpurohit and Pappu and they told him that they will change the owner’s name and provide him a duplicate key which they were supposed to take from the original buyer. On June 6, Gohil had gone to Sabarmati railway station to pick up some relatives. After returning home he parked the car in the parking area of his flat. After a while, he found the car was missing. On checking CCTV footage he found that Rajpurohit and Pappu had fled with his car. Gohil said that Rajpurohit again sought Rs 1.92 lakh to return the car and ultimately he approached police and filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/middlemen-flee-with-car-after-selling-it-to-shahpur-man/articleshow/83904643.cms||---

During a media interaction, Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable said that the probe panel constituted by NU had confirmed transactions from the students’ accounts into the teacher’s. When asked whether NU would lodge a police complaint against the teacher, vice-chancellor Subhash Chaudhari replied in the negative, stating that the students should do it ideally, as they were fleeced. “We would table the report of the probe panel headed by commerce faculty dean Sanjay Kavishwar and Management Council member Urmila Dabir before BOEE for further action,” he said. He, however, disclosed that the teacher under the scanner wasn’t found to be on the rolls of Kirsan Mission’s College of Management. The teacher is working at another college, named Shankarlal Agrawal, in the same city. “We’ve now sought an explanation from the college on whether that teacher works there and his report card,” he said. Sable added that NU had decided to reconduct Kirsan College’s students’ internal exams too, as manipulations in the papers were confirmed. “We will not let students suffer any type of academic loss. Our inquiry is still underway, but students not involved in the bribery allegations would be saved.” Earlier, NU decided to hold re-exam of theory papers for Kirsan College students, following confirmation of manipulation in the MBA exam by the probe panel members. NU officials, however told TOI that the administration was under pressure to save Kirsan College management, as it was attached to one of the three ruling partners in the MVA government. They added that many well-known academics from the NU circles are the members of the college’s board of governors. The first complaint in this regard was lodged by former Management Council member Mahendra Nimbarte, who sent the audio clip to the BOEE director, claiming that many students had deposited the amount in the teacher concerned’s account. Nimbarte stressed that NU should have acted against the college management and disaffiliated it for such serious offences. “Students told me that such acts were common in their college. After my complaint, the teachers warned all students against revealing anything to the NU probe panel members, and threatened to ruin their careers by failing them in all subjects,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/students-transferred-money-to-teachers-account-to-clear-mba-papers-nu/articleshow/83904601.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Kochi||Move to provide minimum support price for 13 minor forest produce||KOCHI: The forest department is planning to propose minimum support price (MSP) for 13 minor forest produce (MFP) with Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (Trifed). The move is to ensure that tribespeople get minimum amount for the products they collect from forests. Currently, MSP is given only to honey, asparagus roots and lemongrass broom. Though the Union government had announced MSP for 50 minor forest products, only these three products get the benefit of it. The 13 products include tender mango, frankincense, bamboo rice, black dammer, white dammer, strobilanthus and wild turmeric. Currently, Trifed gives MSP of Rs 225 for honey. However, the forest department collects it from tribespeople for Rs 400-500 per kg. “We are using the central government fund as revolving fund as the department has fund from the state government to give MSP for tribespeople. We sell honey and two other products through Vanasree shops after value addition,” said a forest department official. Meanwhile, tribal people said that they need financial assistance from the government to start various works under self-employment schemes. “Since the Scheduled tribes and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (recognition of Forest Rights) Act came into force, it allowed tribespeople to sell their products to private parties outside the forest after tribal leaders fixing the amount for each product. We sell honey for private parties for Rs 500 per kg and Rs 75-90 for Koova and merchants collect it directly from us,” said tribal leader V K Geetha of Vazhachal. Under Van Dhan Vikas Yojana scheme, the department is planning to collect MFPs, value add it and sell it through its outlets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/move-to-provide-msp-for-13-minor-forest-produce/articleshow/83900651.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Workplace proximity: Techies prefer homes in Kokapet||Hyderabad: Referred to as an ‘extension’ of the Financial District -- roughly six kms away – Kokapet is fast becoming the preferred housing destination for Hyderabad’s IT crowd. Given this demand, multiple big-ticket developers are seen flooding the locality with residential projects, with some even planning large-scale commercial ventures. Leading the way are construction majors like Rajapushpa Properties, My Home Constructions, Salarpuria Sattva Group, Prestige Group among others. “For those working in Financial District, it’s only a 10-minute drive from Kokapet. The roads here are at least 100to 120 feet wide and the area isn’t too far from the best schools and hospitals in the city. That’s what is driving buyers to this location,” said P Sreenivas Reddy, executive director of Rajapushpa that has already completed five projects in Kokapet. About 95% of the firm’s clientele, Reddy shared, comprise IT professionals. “With several IT offices planned in the area, soon it’ll be walk-to-work for many,” he added. Also betting big on Kokapet is Bengaluru-based Salarpuria Group that picked up 25 acres in Kokapet, a little over two years ago. The plan: to build a commercial-cum-residential venture. “The location, because of its connectivity to the ORR and IT Hub, is a winner. It’s great for homes and corporate offices,” said Mahesh Khaitan, director of the firmpointing out the area’s only disadvantage – social infrastructure. Yet, that’s unlikely to deter Kokapet’s growth feel industry experts. “There are a lot of housing projects – particularly high-end apartments and villas — coming up in the Kokapet-Narsingi belt. The prices are also at least Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 cheaper than Financial District. This growth is certain to give an impetus to high-street retail and other social infrastructure,” said Sandip Patnaik, managing director and head of JLL (for Telangana and AP), irrespective of the steep rise in land values. Pegged at Rs 14 crore to Rs 18 crore per acre until 2016-17, land prices in Kokapet have not shot to Rs 25 crore to Rs 35 crore, depending on land use (residential or commercial), location, road width etc. While many landowners, industry insiders say, are even quoting upwards of Rs 40 to 45 crore per acre, there haven’t been any transactions at the price so far. “The last commercial deal was sealed at Rs 31 crore per acre about a year or so ago. The government auction too is expected to hover in this price range,” said a developer familiar with Kokapet’s projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/workplace-proximity-techies-prefer-homes-in-kokapet/articleshow/83904652.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

He barely earns enough to meet the expenses of his family, which includes his wife, son and parents. Similar is the case of Pritesh Shah, 41, who bought a school van just eight months before the pandemic hit and lockdown was imposed. With schools closed for over 15 months, he has put up a `panipuri’ stall to earn a living. Bhadresh Pawar, 47, has been running a vada-pav stall from his school van, as schools have been shut for almost a year and a half. He says he is able to earn just enough to sustain his family. Like Gohel, Shah and Pawar, there are around 7,500 school van owners in Ahmedabad, who have been compelled to explore other means of livelihood, as offline education in schools has been suspended since March last year. While some have sold off their vans to repay instalments, others have taken up alternative means of livelihoods like selling vegetables, snacks, pan stalls and the like. “I used to earn around Rs 30,000 a month before the lockdown, but for the past nine months, I have been delivering goods in my school van,” said Ravi Gohel, who says that the new work gets him just about half of the amount he used to earn earlier. Shehzad Bhishti, 26, who also delivers goods which have been ordered online in his school van, said he is earning much less than what he earned earlier. Bhadresh Pawar said, “I have been operating school vans for the past 20 years. This is an unprecedented situation, but I have to do something else to earn a living.” Ramesh Kalal, a school van owner, has been selling vegetables. Ashok Punjabi, president, Gujarat Auto Drivers’ Action Committee said that despite making several representations, the state government has not announced any financial assistance package for school van owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/with-schools-shut-van-owners-desperately-look-for-other-jobs/articleshow/83904686.cms||---
---||Kochi||Pathways were constructed unscientifically||Kochi: Footpaths in the city are being constructed in an unscientific manner. The authorities don’t consider the facts like the width of the road while constructing the footpaths and this causes various inconveniences. Agencies like CSML, Kochi corporation and PWD renovated the footpaths of many roads in the city recently. Footpaths have been constructed on either side of even narrow roads. “The CSML constructed footpaths on many of the narrow roads in Fort Kochi. This has reduced the width of the roads. The agencies which renovate roads should construct footpaths only on one side of the narrow roads,” said former mayor K J Sohan. Similarly, the Press Club Road in the city has been relayed recently. “Footpaths with up to 10-feet width have been constructed on either side. This has caused traffic bottlenecks on the road. There are schools beside the road where more than 3,000 students study. Once the schools are reopened, the issue of traffic snarls would worsen,” said CICC Jayachandran, a public figure. “As per Indian Road Congress (IRC) standards, the width of the running lane, the area which is totally dedicated to vehicular movement, should be at least three metres. At the same time, the IRC doesn’t specify the width of the footpath. Footpaths or pavements should be designed considering the width of the road,” said Upendranarayanan, road safety expert. Footpaths are being constructed without considering various facts like availability of land. The CSML started the work on the walkway along Hospital Road connecting Boat Jetty and Maharaja’s College Ground Metro station in September 2018. The CSML earmarked Rs 9 crore for the project. But the agency couldn’t complete at least 50% of the work. Unavailability of land is said to be the major hurdle for completing the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pathways-were-constructed-unscientifically/articleshow/83902661.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

---||Kolkata||Days after Kolkata fake vaccination camps, panic attack remains main ‘health worry’||KOLKATA: Two of five persons who attended the fake vaccination camps in Kasba, City College and Sonarpur are suffering from panic attacks or other related psychological problems days after they were injected, say doctors who have attended to them in the past three days. While some have complained of feeling feverish, others have said they felt a pain in the upper arm where they had been jabbed. But Kolkata Municipal Corporation doctors, who assessed the recipients on Friday, and senior physicians, who were sent to attend a camp organized by the state health department on Saturday, found no physiological problem and concluded that most were experiencing psychological issues out of fear when they learnt that something other than a vaccine had been injected into their body. Swapna Barui, a homemaker and a resident of Rajdanga Main Road, complained that she has been suffering from a persisting pain and numbness in her left arm since the day she was jabbed eight days ago. Jhantu Das, a trader at Kasba New Market, also said he was feverish ever since he had received the vaccine. “Though more than five days have passed since, the feverish feeling still persists,” he insisted It is likely that the discomfort being experienced by the recipients were largely psychological, according to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “It’s normal for these people to suffer from anxiety for they don’t know what has been injected. It could cause insomnia and tension that can lead to a feeling of being sick. Some may also experience pain on their arms which could again be psychological,” said Panja. Consultant Arindam Biswas agreed but added that the recipients need to be screened for long-term effects. “It has been reported that they were given Amikacin that may have an impact on kidneys. So, in case anyone complains of discomfort even several weeks or months later, the creatinine level must be checked,” said Biswas. Panja, however, felt that a single dose of Amikacin was unlikely to cause any damage. Somik Roy, a final-year political science student at City College who received the shot at the camp held by Debanjan Deb in the college, complained of nagging pain for six days. Doctors from KMC who checked Barui, Das and Roy said they prescribed medicines to soothe the nerves as most of them were suffering from panic attacks. A medical team that checked victims in Kasba and City College on Saturday said that out of 257 people who attended the camp, 102 people complained of minor symptoms and most of them were triggered by anxiety. KMC doctors had come to a similar conclusion a day earlier. “I examined over 70 recipients who had attended the fake vaccination camp at Kasba. A majority are suffering from panic attacks,” said Borough-XII medical officer Debasish Barui. According to a civic body doctor, the reactions or the side effects of whatever was administered can be known later when a forensic report is made public. “We are now talking about possible side effects of an antibiotic. Let’s wait for the forensic report,” the KMC health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/days-after-fake-vax-camps-panic-attack-remains-main-health-worry/articleshow/83902663.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Mumbai||Two Sangli farmers become India’s first pink-white dragon fruit exporters||KOLHAPUR: Two farmers from Sangli district — Anandrao Pawar (78) of Tadsar village and Rajaram Deshmukh of neighbouring Vangi village — have become the first to export dragon fruits of the pink-white variety (pink skin and white flesh) from India. A total of 100kg of dragon fruit was recently exported to Dubai from their farms. Each of them sent 50kg consignments of the exotic fruit, which, because of spikes and petals resembling a lotus, is also called ‘kamalam’. Export of the exotic fruit, which is cultivated in roughly 150 acres of Sangli’s drought-prone areas, has given fresh hope to local farmers. Agriculture officials said dragon fruit cultivation is gradually replacing grape and sugarcane in arid parts of the district. Pawar was the first to grow the cactus species on the hilly terrain of Kadegaon tehsil about six years ago. Tadsar is around 500m above sea level. “I replaced my sugarcane crop with dragon fruit,” he said. Six years ago, I got information on dragon fruit cultivation from a Satara farmer. The crop requires less water. Organic farming helped us achieve weight and taste targets. Fruits weighing more than 300gm each were selected for export to Dubai.” Inspired by Pawar, Deshmukh too decided to take up dragon fruit farming. He has one-and-a-half acres under dragon fruit cultivation and plans to expand to five acres by next year. Basavaraj Mastoli, Sangli district’s agriculture superintendent, said, “Over the past few years, dragon fruit cultivation in dry and arid areas has been increasing in places like Atpadi, Jath and now, Kadegaon. Many prefer the crop to water-intensive sugarcane and capital-intensive grape farming. Dragon fruit farming is also turning out to be profitable for farmers earlier growing non-cash crops like grains.” There are three main varieties of the fruit — white flesh with pink skin, red flesh with pink skin and white flesh with yellow skin. It is rich in fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-2-sangli-farmers-become-indias-first-pink-white-dragon-fruit-exporters/articleshow/83904677.cms||Abhijeet Patil

---||Hyderabad||Kokapet ‘tested’ ground for land auctions, says Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority||HYDERABAD: Its proximity to the IT corridor, Hyderabad international airport and Outer Ring Road (ORR) coupled with fully developed infrastructure facilities, has turned Kokapet into a much sought-after location for investors. Even the Telangana government has chosen Kokapet for its land auctions as it is home to huge chunks of government land. Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) officials say Kokapet is ‘tested’ ground for auctions with the government raking in Rs 1,680 crore from the Golden Mile Project land auctions held in 2006. However,the HMDA could not get the entire amount then due to some legal tussle over 634 acres of land. The land parcel now stands in the clear. While some firms bid Rs 14.5 crore per acre 15 years ago, the HMDA and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) is hopeful of getting double the minimum amount for the 64 acres land that has been put up for sale in Kokapet. “Being a green-field project, the Neopolis, Kokapet, where the auctions are being held, is going to be the most advanced and well-developed townships perhaps in the country with the best of infrastructure amenities. Planning has been done futuristically,” said Arvind Kumar, principal secretary, municipal administration and urban development department. Explaining the advantages, HMDA officials said Kokapet has been witnessing rapid growth for the past decade as it is just about five km from financial district and seven km from Gachibowli. It's well connected to other parts of the city too through the ORR and the airport is only a 30 to 35-minute drive. It is also close to various educational and health care institutions. The government is also proposing metro connectivity, TSIIC officials said. Further, they point out how surrounding areas have also developed and have become real estate hubs with massive housing investments coming in the areas like Mokila, Kollur and Tellapur, which are now being touted as greenfield residential areas. “Kokapet auction is the last chance to get hold of prime land near the financial district before the market moves further west to the Kollur area. Apart from this, Kokapet is also a destination for high-end commercial and residential markets. Financial district infrastructure and unlimited FSI makes Kokapet attractive backed by employment potential,” said GV Rao, president of the Telangana Developers Association. Officials analyse the growth of Kokapet in two phases. One between 2005 and 2014 and another post 2014 after thecreation of Telangana. “Between 2005 and 2014, government had allotted land to prominent corporate firms, which resulted as an organic extension of Madhapur and turned it into an established real estate market. After ,2014 there has been saturation of land in both Hitec-City and Financial District and spillover demand is towards the south-west region. Now, regional and national level developers have taken up projects ( residential and commercial)in Kokapet,” a senior official of HMDA’s estate wing said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kokapet-tested-ground-for-land-auctions-says-hmda/articleshow/83904682.cms||Koride Mahesh

Deb had opened this account at least a couple of years ago and the 14 persons he had employed were paid through this account. According to Special Investigation Team, Deb paid Rs 23,000-40,000 to them per month, not once delaying their monthly wages. The sleuths found that the accused had even set up an office of FinCorp in Kasba, at the same address from where Deb operated his NGO, Urban Development Planning. “Deb passed off FinCorp as a government entity,” said police. The SIT unearthed the account while looking for the money trail and how he financed his activities. Three accounts had been detected till Saturday in which one had negative balance and the other Rs 70,000. “We realized he had been moving money. Till Sunday afternoon, we have found eight different accounts that he operated. There are several transactions in each of these accounts,” said an officer. Cops have found letterheads of offices operated from Nabanna and Bidyut Bhawan from his office. Police said Deb hired Indrajit Shaw (46), a co-accused in City College case, as the head clerk and paid Rs 23,500 as salary via bank transfer. “He told us that first six months will be probationary period. He told me that he will make my job permanent in either KMC or FinCorp if I give him Rs 2.5 lakh.

The court, however, refused to grant them bail and sent them to jail. She also briefly protested at the bus in which the villagers were brought to the court. Calling the arrest illegal, Amba said that villagers were peacefully agitating at Triveni Sainik Company, the main outsourcing company hired by the NTPC, for mining work. She said, “Workers were agitating since Saturday morning demanding fulfilment of their various demands, including payment of bonus. These workers had served notice to the company three months ago but finding no alternative they sat on a dharna and prevented other workers of the village from joining duty. They were agitating by following Covid-19 protocols.” Police said cases under various sections were lodged at Barkagaon police station for violations of Covid-19 rules. The MLA said that she will take up this matter with the chief minister. Deputy commissioner Aditya Kumar Anand said that the workers were arrested only after they pelted stones at police personnel. The DC said the magistrate along with police reached the spot and told the agitators that their grievances will be looked into by the company. “We also assured them to leave the place as we will take up the matter with the company. But they didn’t listen and pelted stones,” he said. He added that officials also met Barkagaon MLA on Sunday and assured her of conducting a proper inquiry. “The agitation affected the coal mining operations of NTPC,” he said. In another incident, around 50 villagers of Daihar and other hamlets gheraoed the residence of Congress MLA of Barhi, Umashankar Akela, at Chouparan on Sunday and locked the gate demanding fulfilment of his promise of providing land to landless farmers. SDPO Barhi Nazir Akhtar said they rushed to the MLA’s residence along with other officials to unlock the gate. The deputy commissioner said that the villagers were demanding the plots which were notified under the forest act as forest land. “As per the law, no forest land can be given to any villager or farmer for farming. If they apply for other plots other than those in forest area, we will consider.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/amba-protests-in-support-of-agitators-held-for-pelting-stones-at-policemen/articleshow/83904191.cms||Abhijit Sen

However, it was not known how many truckers from the state shuttle between India and Bangladesh. The department’s order came a day after the Union ministry of external affairs directed all the states that share borders with Bangladesh to take up vaccination of the truckers on priority. Talking to TOI, officer on special duty to state health department Siddharth Tripathy said: “We have issued a directive to all districts so that those involved in movement to Bangladesh for trade purposes could be identified and vaccinated at the earliest.” In its order, issued on June 17 to the states, the MEA said the decision has been taken to ensure uninterrupted bilateral trade between the two neighbouring countries. The MEA also informed that the Bangladesh government has taken initiative to vaccinate Bangladeshi truckers, helpers and labourers engaged in transportation of goods across the border. “In order to ensure vaccination of all such people engaged in trade, we have directed the district authorities to check such trucks that have permits to travel to Bangladesh and drivers and other staff should be vaccinated so that the risk of spread of virus could be eliminated at the earliest. as per our information Bangladesh authorities have started the same,” Tripathy said. The move comes even as the state government is yet to come out with a concrete plan for vaccinating people who are engaged in the transport business in Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bdesh-bound-truckers-to-receive-jabs-on-priority/articleshow/83904105.cms||Gaurav Pandey

All the accused, who had gathered at Sayajibaug in the morning, were not wearing face masks and were allegedly planning to initiate an anti-vaccine campaign, said cops. The accused have formed groups named ‘Awaken Gujarat Movement’ and ‘Awaken Vadodarians’. “In January this year, they distributed pamphlets against Covid vaccine. We had got information that they were planning to do the same again on Sunday following which we reached the spot and arrested them,” said V B Aal, Sayajigunj police inspector. The police said that despite Covid rules requiring mandatory face masks in public place, all the accused were not wearing face masks and hadn’t maintained social distancing too. The cops have booked them under the Disaster Management Act and criminal conspiracy. The accused have been identified as Narendra Parmar, Chandrakant Mistry, Vishal Vishal Ferwani, Keval Pathadiya, Jagvinder Singh, Irfan Patel, Avni Gajjar and Bhumika Gajjar. “Four them are engineers while the women are all homemakers.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: ‘Will deploy spl police officers in villages to curb trafficking’||RANCHI: The state government is planning to deploy women SPOs (special police officers) at the village and panchayat levels to curb human trafficking in Jharkhand, chief minister Hemant Soren said on Sunday. Hemant made the statement while addressing a virtual seminar on Covid orphans and ways to protect them, which was organised by Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority (Jhalsa). He said, “The state government is serious about addressing the issues of trafficking and it is committed to the proper rehabilitation of Covid orphans.” He added that they are working on a plan to rehabilitate Covid orphans in their areas of residence by identifying local people, such as widows/widowers, who can take care of them. “As per our initial plan, we are planning to hand over such kids to widows/widowers, who reside in the same village as the orphan, with one child and can take care of another. As an encouragement, government will provide them with certain incentives, besides some welfare measures to the orphan. Proper monitoring and tracking of such cases also need to be kept in place,” Soren said, adding that he has directed the women, child development and social security department to work out a plan in this regard. Jharkhand high court’s chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan, Jhalsa’s executive chairman and Justice Aparesh Kumar, among others, were also present at the occasion. Jhalsa, which is running Project Sishu to rehabilitate Covid orphans, along with help from the district administrations, has so far identified around 400 Covid orphans since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of those, 208 have been given help under the project, Justice Kumar said, adding that they are planning to help more kids through different welfare schemes. Justice Ranjan said that Project Sishu is a giant step towards the rehabilitation of children orphaned by the pandemic. “I urge everyone to maintain a humane and a humble approach while providing benefits to such kids. They have a right to live a life of dignity and achieve their dreams,” he added. Meanwhile, speaking on the issue of trafficking in Jharkhand, Sanjay Mishra, who is the secretary of an NGO named Bal Kalyan Sangh, said that roughly 1 lakh to 1.25 lakh children, mostly girls below the age of 18, are trafficked every year from Jharkhand under the garb of giving jobs. “The pandemic is leading to a surge in trafficking,” he said. He opined that the biggest hurdle in Jharkhand is a lack of a comprehensive approach to the problem. He said, “Till date, Jharkhand doesn’t have an action plan to fight trafficking despite the state being a hotbed for it. We pat our backs every time we rescue a child from being trafficked but seldom is there a proper mechanism to monitor him/her, leaving such people prone to trafficking once again.” Last week, around two dozen kids were rescued from Ranchi following several raids. Of them, two raids were conducted at Ranchi airport. The Ranchi child welfare committee’s chairperson, Rupa Verma, said that the airport is now emerging as the new transit point for trafficking in the pandemic. “Owing to curbs at the railway stations and alert ChildLine wings, traffickers are now taking help of aerial routes. This is the area where the state government has to immediately look into. We are going to write to the government to set up ChildLine units, along the lines of the ones that exist at railway stations,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/will-deploy-spl-police-officers-in-villages-to-curb-trafficking/articleshow/83904249.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Purulia: Photojournalist, son attacked outside home with rods, knives||RANCHI: A group of 20 unidentified men attempted life bids on TOI photojournalist Mahadeo Sen and his son Rajesh Kumar Sen, who is a staff photographer with the news agency, UNI, outside their home at Purulia Road on Saturday evening. The father-son duo was beaten up with rods and canes. The assailants even attacked them with daggers in an attempt to wound them fatally. The assailants left two motorcycles, bearing registration numbers JH01 DK 8786 and JH01 CZ 9066 at the crime scene and fled when they were chased by Sen’s neighbours. The bikes were registered in the names one Taufiq Akhtar and Mohammad Sharique Khan. Records with the district transport office showed that both are residents of Azad Basti. The victims filed a complaint against a person, identified as the son of a Kantatoli resident named Numan, and other unknown persons, with the Lalpur police station around 10 pm on Saturday based on which an FIR has been registered. Police have seized the two bikes and are yet to make any arrests in connection with the crime till the filing of this report on Sunday evening. Talking to TOI about the incident, SSP (Ranchi) S K Jha said, “We have intensified patrolling in the area and police are examining the video footage of the incident as captured in a CCTV camera. A police team from Lalpur police station is investigating the matter and we will be able to nab the culprits soon.” Rajesh, who was badly injured in the attack, received head injuries and was to get a CT scan done. Recounting the incident, Rajesh said, “Around 20 men came in front of our house at around 7 pm and attacked us. Before the incident, they were scolded by our neighbours for rash driving near our gates and creating ruckus in the area. I can identify them, if police hold a parade of the accused.” Meanwhile, the political adviser to chief minister Hemant Soren, Abhishek Kumar alias Pintu, called up Mahadeo and assured to quick action in the matter. “I will speak to senior officials and ask them to arrest the perpetrators immediately,” Sen quoted Pintu as saying. Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth also visited the family and expressed his concern over lawlessness and the police inefficiency in controlling crimes in the capital city. “The state is under weekend lockdown and people are supposed to stay inside their homes. Even after that if police isn’t able to track such a crowd of goons, then it is a big question mark on their efficiency,” Seth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/photojournalist-son-attacked-outside-home-with-rods-knives/articleshow/83903781.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Testing centres asked to send samples to ILS||RANCHI: Eight RT-PCR testing facilities of Jharkhand have been asked to send 300 samples of Covid-19 patients to Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar every month for genome sequencing. The directive was issued by state health secretary Arun Kumar Singh, days after genome sequencing of 364 samples collected between January and March this year showed the prevalence of five different Covid variants in Jharkhand. The secretary also pulled up the management of these testing facilities for failing to send the adequate numbers of samples to the laboratory regularly. The facilities include Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, the TB sanatorium in Itki, Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur and the state-run medical colleges in Dhanbad, Jamshedpur, Dumka, Palamu and Hazaribag. “Earlier, genome sequencing was limited to passengers arriving from overseas and their contact in the community through 5% (of the total) RT-PCR tests. Now, under a revised guideline issued by the Union government, each sentinel site must mandatorily send 15 samples to a regional genome sequencing laboratory once every fortnight,” Singh wrote in his letter. The samples which will be sent must have a CT value of 25 or less. The genome sequencing results of the samples collected earlier had shown the prevalence of Delta, Alpha, Kappa and several other variants. However, Jharkhand is wary of the possibility of another surge in infections in the coming weeks caused by the new Delta plus variant, which has been detected recently in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Kerala. “It is being seen that the Delta plus variant has recently increased its transmissibility, has stronger binding of cells with the receptors of the lungs and causes potential reduction in the monoclonal antibody response. A regular genome sequencing exercise with adequate representation of samples is the only way to detect the presence of such a variant,” a senior official in the state health department said. The previous genome sequencing of samples collected from Jharkhand had shown the highest prevalence of the delta variant (55%). The variant had been detected in India in October last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/testing-centres-asked-to-send-samples-to-ils/articleshow/83902758.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the Tata Main Hospital (TMH) here for nearly a week, the latest victim, a 13-year-old girl, was also suffering from jaundice. She succumbed to the viral disease on Saturday. The girl had visited the hospital for treatment of jaundice but subsequently tested positive for Covid-19. A resident of Golmuri, the girl had no travel history. Earlier, in April, a child had died after contracting the contagious disease. The additional chief medical officer, (ACMO), Sahir Pall, said that so far, 1,932 children under 14 years were infected with Covid-19 in the state. Nearly 1,200 of them are boys and the rest are girls. Pall added, “Both sample testing and vaccination are being conducted to check the Covid graph.” With 43,518 cases, the urban circle comprising the three urban municipal areas of Jamshedpur, Mango and Jugsalai reported a high number of Covid cases in the past 13 months. The secretary of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Jamshedpur Chapter, Mrityunjay Singh, has advised residents to strictly comply with the Covid-appropriate behaviour to delay the onset of the potential third wave in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/13-year-old-girl-dies-of-covid-in-jamshedpur/articleshow/83902660.cms||---

---||Goa||Goans brace themselves as fuel prices near Rs 100-mark||PANAJI: As fuel prices continue to soar across the country, petrol remains just Rs 4 away from the century mark while diesel stands at Rs 93.98 per litre in Goa. Fuel station operators say that consumption of fuel has dropped across the state with retail sales standing at around 60-70% of pre-Covid levels. While consumers complain about the surge in fuel prices and brace themselves for fuel to touch the Rs 100 mark, fuel station operators say they see no change in consumer behaviour when it comes to fuel consumption. Since the pandemic hit India in mid-March last year, fuel prices have shot up by 25% and with revenues declining, the state and the Centre have hiked taxes on fuel. Value-added tax (VAT) and other central and state taxes account for a whopping 67% of the pump price of petrol and 61% of the retail price for diesel. “People have a habit to fill fuel based on a round figure amount and not quantity of fuel. Customers come with a preset round figure which they continue to do so,” said partner at Gauri petrol pump, Porvorim, Padma Kamat. Fuel pump owners along the North Goa coastal belt, which cater predominantly to tourists and tourist taxis, have seen a sharp decline in consumption, which they say is unlikely to recover before tourism resumes in the state. Meanwhile, in the hinterland, fuel stations have remained largely unaffected as their customers continue to fill up despite the hike in prices. Kamat said that the dynamics of fuel consumption may have changed, but the price factor does not seem to deter people from filling up. “Even if fuel prices increase, the customer continue to buy fuel. By default, consumption decreases because the per litre price has increased. The customer may complain about the rate, but they have no option,” said the manager of a fuel station in Panaji. Petrol prices have already crossed the Rs 100-a-litre mark in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. While fuel prices in Goa were significantly lower than other states a few years ago, that difference has been eroded ever since the Pramod Sawant government hiked VAT on fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-brace-themselves-as-fuel-prices-near-rs-100-mark/articleshow/83904869.cms||Newton Sequeira

The latest inspection was carried out in the city after 24 patients died due to oxygen leakage at a Nashik hospital in April this year. There are more than 600 hospitals in the city, which is known as medical hub of central India. Of these, the department has so far inspected about 255 hospitals. This means, approximately half the hospitals inspected by the fire department were found unsafe. A senior fire department official told TOI that inspection of all hospitals is not over yet. “So far, we have inspected 255 hospitals only,” he said. As per the department, any hospital in the city must obtain a certificate of completion after receiving a no-objection certificate. Hospitals, which do not comply with firefighting measures, are issued a show cause notice under Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006. Those hospitals not taking the necessary firefighting measures are declared unsafe. Of the 255 hospitals inspected, 184 had obtained first no-objection certificate and 70 had taken the final NOC. However, only 40 hospitals complied with the firefighting rules. During the inspection, the department found lapses in 138 hospitals and notices have been served to the owners of these buildings. They have been asked to have mandatory firefighting equipment in place at the earliest. Even after this, only 39 of the 255 hospitals have complied with the firefighting measures suggested by the department. After the hospitals failed to comply with the notice, the department asked occupants of 101 buildings to evacuate. Simultaneously, the department informed MSEDCL and NMC’s water works department to disconnect power and water supply to 32 hospital buildings. City police help too was sought in two cases for vacating unsafe buildings. Similarly, complaints have been filed against owners of three hospitals for ignoring firefighting measures. The inspection also revealed that 63 hospitals were functioning without getting their structural maps sanctioned. The fire department has also provided a list of such hospitals to the town planning department for further action. It was also found that only 37 hospitals had got fire audits conducted at their respective establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/138-hospital-buildings-in-city-unsafe-fire-dept-audit/articleshow/83904862.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The authority is aiming to generate approximately Rs1,904 crore revenue through monetization of these land parcels. One of these 16 sites currently offered for bidding include commercial exploitation of railway land at Amravati railway station from where the RLDA plans to generate Rs25 crore. The other sites include redevelopment of Lucknow railway station, Ramgarh Tal Colony (Gorakhpur), land parcels at Gomti Nagar (Lucknow), Moula Ali Flyover (Secunderabad), Boulevard Road Colony (Delhi) and land at Salt Golah (Howrah). “The land parcels are strategically located in important cities across India and hold potential for residential and commercial development. RLDA will lease out these lands to prospective developers who will be mandated to develop these sites in line with local bye-laws,” said Ved Parkash Dudeja, vice-chairman, RLDA. Dudeja added, “These sites offer tremendous growth opportunities for investors and developers. Once completed, these sites will lead to economic development, employment generation and boost real estate prospects of the respective regions.” Taking the catastrophic effect of the pandemic in its stride, RLDA is targeting Rs2,000 crore revenue for the Indian Railways in 2021-22. This will be a jump from Rs352 crore in the previous year, said Dudeja. The Rail Land Development Authority is a statutory authority under the ministry of railways responsible for the development of railway land for commercial use. It has four key mandates as a part of its development plan — leasing of commercial sites, colony redevelopment, station redevelopment and multi-functional complexes. Indian Railways has approximately 43,000 hectare vacant land across India. The RLDA is currently handling 84 commercial (greenfield) sites and 84 railway colony redevelopment projects across the country for leasing and eligible developers for each will be selected through an open bidding process. The RLDA is also mandated with the redevelopment of railway stations and is currently working on 60 railway stations in a phased manner while its subsidiary, Indian Railway Stations Development (IRSDC) has taken up another 63 stations pan India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rlda-eyes-rs25cr-from-leasing-out-amt-rly-land/articleshow/83904893.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Sardesai said the Centre is yet to disburse the Rs 300 crore meant for Goa to celebrate the 60th Liberation Day. In response to an RTI application, the department for information and publicity has informed GFP that the Rs 300 crore have not been received till date. “If a consultant can get funds from the Centre, why not simply appoint the consultant as the chief minister,” said Sardesai. Sardesai was speaking after chairing a meeting with his party functionaries to discuss the budget assembly session, which was cut short on March 30. Sardesai said that the government plans to cut short the assembly session to three days instead of holding it for 10 days as decided by the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) in March. In March, a BAC meeting was conducted and the assembly session was cut short by over two weeks and the House was adjourned till July 19. “We also have learnt from very reliable sources that it will be for three days only. We strongly object to this totally undemocratic attitude,” Sardesai said. GFP also alleged that the government plans to hand over the Fort Aguada Jail to Drishti Marine for a period of 15 years. GFP said that Drishti Marine is being favoured because of the close ties that Drishti’s promoters share with BJP. “A huge sum of Rs 25 crore has just been spent by the RDA to renovate this heritage monument. We demand immediate action and an independent investigation into this heritage-gate scam,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/its-ridiculous-that-govt-cannot-obtain-funds-from-centre/articleshow/83905012.cms||---

She had taken over the reigns from the erstwhile divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar. Having moved into the hot seat at a crucial juncture when the second wave is almost ebbing and preparations for the subsequent one is under way, Verma had also said that she held a meeting of the different welfare committees to set priorities. “The work of the social welfare and other related developmental works at the grassroots level too needs to move at a brisk pace,” she said. Human rights activist Anand Chandrani, founder president of the Sarathi Trust, said the government has already created a national portal in which members from the transgender community can get themselves registered. “The social justice and welfare department issues an identification card for the transgender community after they register themselves on the national portal by virtue of which they can get benefits of several government schemes,” said Chandrani, adding, there is a need to create awareness for this portal. “The transgender community finds it difficult to register on this portal,” he said. “If an officer of the rank of divisional commissioner is taking a keen interest in the issues of the transgender and other marginalized communities, then it would definitely augur well for them,’ said Chandrani. He also said that the district collector has also helped them organize a camp for the Adhaar card and other documents later in the week for the transgender and other communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/registration-of-transgenders-a-priority-div-comm/articleshow/83904953.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Metro’s convenient e-bikes attracting commuters||NAGPUR: Electric bikes, a pilot experiment kickstarted by MahaMetro around eight months back, is catching people’s interest, with a revenue of Rs 2.26 lakh being generated from it till date. After signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with private firm KHS Associates, MahaMetro launched the environment-friendly vehicles in the city in November last year. According to officials, a total of 638 rides have been completed on e-scooters, with over a 1,000 people downloading the mobile application. As per the MoU, the e-bike operator has provided bikes at different locations for commuters. “The bike comes under the category of non-motorized transport and thus users don’t need the mandatory licence,” said officials. Usage of e-bikes is completely app-based – citizens have to download the app and upload details of their Aadhar card and electricity bill. “The application has different fare systems on hourly as well as weekly basis. The average cost is Rs 1 per minute. Once the booking is confirmed through the application, commuters can directly go to the e-scooter hub and unlock the vehicle by scanning a code from their mobile phones,” officials said. At present, there are two e-bikes each at the airport, Ajni, Khapri, Sitabuldi, Lokmanya Nagar, Wadi, W building (Mihan), Manish Nagar, CRPF and other hubs. In all, 22 e-scooters are available in the city. “We got a great response from the airport station where tourists staying in hotels as well as citizens have been booking e-bikes for hours and even a week. The bikes are also in much demand at CRPF, Sitabuldi and some other stations,” said officials. TOI has learnt that the city is expected to get more e-scooters at Jhansi Rani Square, Wasudev Nagar, Chhatrapati Square and other areas. “We are also looking forward to starting e-bikes hubs in areas where the demand is more, especially near offices,” an official told TOI. The cost of one e-bike is around Rs 72,000. “Right now, MahaMetro is focusing on bringing last-mile connectivity to riders at affordable prices rather than commercial profits. We are very happy with the response and hope that the usage will increase when restrictions start opening up,” the official added. In a release on Saturday, MahaMetro stated that it is now cheaper to travel by Metro instead of a two-wheeler. “Metro is charging only Rs 10 for travelling over 10 kilometres. We appeal to the citizens to use Maha Card, the common mobility card, in greater numbers. You don’t need to carry cash for buying tickets as you can use this card. It is available at Metro stations and can be charged there or via online mode. In case of any confusion, contact the Maha Metro staff at stations,” said MahaMetro managing director Brijesh Dixit. To encourage citizens to use the card, MahaMetro is providing a discount of 10% on every ride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/metros-convenient-e-bikes-attracting-commuters/articleshow/83905093.cms||Manka Behl

The rare public comment on Kim's health come after foreign analysts noted in June that the leader, who is believed to be 37, appeared to have lost a lot of weight. "Seeing respected general secretary (Kim) looking emaciated breaks our people's heart so much," the man said in an interview aired by state broadcaster KRT on Friday. "Everyone is saying that their tears welled up," he said. In the clip people were seen watching a big screen showing a concert attended by Kim after a meeting of Workers' Party of Korea. The broadcast did not give details on what had led to the weight loss.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-koreans-worried-about-emaciated-kim-state-media/articleshow/83908373.cms||---
---||World||Death toll in Florida condo collapse climbs to 9, with 150 still missing||SURFSIDE: The official death toll from the partial collapse of a high-rise condominium complex near Miami rose to nine on Sunday, with more than 150 people still missing, as rescue teams picked through the rubble for a fourth day without detecting further signs of life. What caused nearly half the 12-story, 156-unit building to cave in the early hours of Thursday as residents slept has yet to be determined, but a 2018 engineer's inspection report found major structural deterioration in the parking garage beneath the 40-year-old tower. Officials in Surfside, the shore town near Miami where the building stood along the beach, said hope remained that rescuers would yet discover survivors in air pockets that may have formed in the pancaked debris. Even so, Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said on Sunday that crews had yet to find such voids in the rubble or signs of anyone alive since early in the tragedy, when faint sounds were detected. "It's an extremely difficult situation," Cominsky said. "Our rescue teams are nonstop, doing all that we can, searching every area, every bit of hope, to see if we can find a live victim." Two large cranes and two backhoes on Sunday joined in the debris-removal efforts that had previously been conducted essentially by hand by teams also using rescue dogs, sonar, drones and infrared scanners as they gingerly tunneled through the ruins. Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said six to eight squads of rescuers were working on the multi-story pile of shattered concrete and twisted metal laying next to the portion of the Champlain Towers South condo that remained standing. "Hundreds of team members are on standby to rotate as we need a fresh start," Levine Cava said at a briefing in which she announced the death toll had risen to nine, with the number of individuals still unaccounted for standing at 152. The mayor later said those figures would remain "extremely fluid." The teams included experts sent by Israel and Mexico to assist in the search. An American flag atop one crane rippled in the stiff ocean breeze. Given the scores of those still missing, the disaster may end up to be one of the deadliest non-deliberate structural failures in US history. By comparison, 98 people perished when the roof of the Knickerbocker Theatre in Washington, D.C., gave way from the weight of snow during a silent movie screening in January 1922. Two interior walkways collapsed into the lobby of the Hyatt Regency hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, during a dance party in July 1981, killing 114 individuals. A smoldering fire beneath the rubble that hindered the work of rescuers had abated by Sunday morning, officials said. The mayor said a trench was burrowed through the rubble to separate the areas of smoking debris from the rest of the wreckage. Weekend thunderstorms also hampered search efforts. "Our luck, at least with respect to the weather and the fires, has seemed to turn now. We just need to see a few more miracles each day, and we need to start pulling people out of that rubble and reunite them with the families," Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett told a Sunday evening briefing. Some relatives of those missing have provided DNA samples to officials, and family members were permitted to pay a private visit to the site by special arrangement on Sunday, Levine Cava said. Referring to the families, Governor Ron DeSantis told Miami television station WPLG-TV: "You realize you’re going to potentially have terrible news, but you just don’t have it. You’re kind of waiting. And they just want answers." Police released the names of four victims who ranged in age from 54 to 83 - a couple married for 58 years, a volunteer Little League baseball coach and the mother of a 15-year-old boy who was pulled alive from the rubble shortly after the collapse. Photographs of the missing were posted on a nearby fence, along with flowers and messages. "The Lord is My Refuge" read one handmade sign. "Surfside God is with you" said another. Surfside officials have released documents including the engineer's report from 2018, which cited major structural damage beneath the building's pool deck and "concrete deterioration" in the underground parking garage. The report was produced for the Champlain Towers South condominium board in preparation for a major repair project set for this year. Gregg Schlesinger, a lawyer and former general contractor who specializes in construction-failure cases, said it was clear that the deficiencies identified in the 2018 report were the main cause of the disaster. Donna DiMaggio Berger, a lawyer who works with the condo association, said the issues outlined in the 2018 report were typical for older buildings in the area and did not alarm board members, all of whom lived in the tower with their families. The report estimated it would cost $9.1 million to make the recommended repairs. Work had started on replacing the roof, but the pandemic slowed the project, she said. Satellite data from the 1990s showed the building was sinking 1 to 3 millimeters per year, while surrounding buildings were stable, according to Florida International University professor Shimon Wdowinski. Schlesinger said investigations and the inevitable lawsuits would eventually reveal the cause of the collapse. "But we do know one thing: there was a structural failure," he said. "We know another thing: The structural failure should not have occurred."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-building-collapse-toll-rises-to-9/articleshow/83908381.cms||---

A city-based NGO is planning to set up 100 percolating wells including the first one on the Rajesh Tower Road. The Rajesh Tower Road gets waterlogged even after short spells of rain. Also, it takes a long time for water to drain off. Despite several efforts, the issue has remained unresolved so far. Bhavesh Lodaya from Pagdand said that in 2019 the NGO had made six percolating wells with funding from corporate houses and also from own funds. He added that this year, it will make the first well using its own funds. Percolating wells costs between Rs 2.5lakh to Rs 3.25lakh. The organisation has sought a list of areas prone to waterlogging from Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). It will try to resolve the issue with percolating wells in these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/waterlogging-woes-may-end-thanks-to-ngos-efforts/articleshow/83901440.cms||---

Pointing out that the hearing has been proposed to be held at an open ground in the middle of the monsoon season, Fernandes said that “the fear of the predicted third wave of pandemic will discourage attendance at this important public hearing”. Stating that this plan will affect the lives and livelihoods of Goans, Fernandes demanded that the hearing should be held at village level so that every affected person has an opportunity to be heard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/postpone-czmp-public-hearing-aap/articleshow/83905492.cms||---

Till Thursday, the Food Corporation of India and other agencies procured 432.6 lakh tonnes. Officials said as some states like Bihar will continue procurement till July 15, the actual procurement of wheat will cross the revised target. During last year, the total procurement was 390 lakh tonnes. During the current procurement around 49 lakh farmers have benefitted with an MSP value of nearly Rs 85,400 crore transferred directly to farmer's accounts. Meanwhile, food ministry sources said the FCI also used Railways to transport wheat directly from mandis to create more space for procured grains. In peak procurement period, nearly 16 lakh tonnes of wheat was transported by rail from mandis in Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. These stocks were transported in 620 rakes. The official said the transport of wheat from mandis also helped to reduce the glut in mandis and to ensure smooth procurement operations. Every month, on an average the FCI transports the procured wheat and rice in approximately 1,050 rakes to deficit states for distribution under National Food Security Act and other welfare programmes. These movements are from storage points of FCI or state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wheat-purchase-all-set-to-cross-revised-target-of-433-5l-tonnes/articleshow/83908413.cms||---
---||Goa||Former Cabral confidant to join Congress today||MARGAO: In the midst of chaos in Congress over moves of granting a ticket to independent Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar, politics in Curchorem too is on the cusp of an upheaval. Former chairperson and current councillor of Curchorem Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) Balkrishna Hodarkar is scheduled to join Congress on Monday. The move is perceived to be a setback to BJP as Hodarkar was a strong supporter of the saffron party and a long-time confidant of Curchorem MLA and power minister Nilesh Cabral. Sources said the decision to induct Hodarkar into the Congress fold were finalised at the meeting he held with All India Congress Committee secretary in-charge of Goa desk Dinesh Gundu Rao during his latest visit to the state. Though Hodarkar confirmed that he would be joining Congress at an informal programme on Monday, he refused to comment if he has been assured of a party ticket. Hodarkar’s political aspirations were fuelled after he parted ways with Cabral during the elections for the post of chairperson of CCMC which had led to some fast-paced dramatic developments in the civic body. Minutes after Hodarkar was declared elected as chairperson on April 1, nine Cabral-backed councillors had moved a no-confidence motion which was, however, rejected by the director of municipal administration (DMA) on technical grounds. Subsequently, they moved another no-confidence motion which was also rejected on April 9, also on procedural grounds. The same day, they moved another no-confidence motion, this time, however, signed by six councillors, which ultimately resulted in Hodarkar’s ouster on April 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-cabral-confidant-to-join-congress-today/articleshow/83905567.cms||---

"It is sad for all of us that the country has lost this karmayogi, Covid has snatched him away from us. There are countless people who have never been discussed. Our tribute to every such person would be that we follow the Covid protocol fully, get our vaccinations done," Modi said in his monthly radio broadcast 'Mann ki Baat'. He disclosed how Mohapatra, who was secretary in the department for promotion of industry and internal trade, insisted on participating in meetings via video conferences although he had been advised against it. "Guruprasad ji was diagnosed with corona, he was admitted in hospital and yet at the same time, was performing his official duties too. He toiled day and night to increase the oxygen producing capacity of the country and to ensure that oxygen reached far flung areas. On the one hand, the affairs of the court, the pressure of the media, he kept fighting on many fronts simultaneously and did not stop working during his illness. He kept on making arrangements to deliver oxygen to the people regardless of himself being on the hospital bed," the PM said. "The tribute by PM Modi to Guruprasad Mohapatra has instilled a sense of motivation and reinforced commitment among all public servants dedicated to the cause of public service and nation building across the country," the Central IAS Association said in a statement. Mohapatra's contribution in stepping up oxygen production and putting in place a distribution network, along with some of his colleagues who had also tested positive, has been widely acknowledged. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, who was the Gujarat cadre officer's boss, said the PM's words of encouragement will inspire public servants to continue their work selflessly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-salutes-mohapatra-calls-him-karmayogi/articleshow/83908425.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: ‘Covid drug deaths’ turn out to be murder, 3 die of poisoning in Erode||ERODE: What was initially thought to be a case of people paying with their lives for turning to a quack for a Covid remedy has turned out to be murder most foul in Erode. On Saturday, four of a family took ill after taking ‘naattu marundhu’ (native medicine) and one of the women died. Two more women died on Sunday, but by then the police suspected murder. Late on Sunday they arrested two men for poisoning the family from whom one of them had borrowed ₹15 lakh. Police said R Kalyanasundaram, 43, of Keezhvani village near Gobichettipalayam, had borrowed ₹ 15 lakh from Karuppana Gounder of Karungoundanvalasu village near Chennimalai a few months ago. He hadn’t been paying the interest for the last three months, so Gounder and his daughter Deepa, 30, asked Kalyanasundaram to return the money with interest. Irked by this, Kalyanasundaram decided to do away with Gounder and his family, police said. Kalyanasundaram roped in Pothis Kumar alias Sabari, 19, and got him to go to Gounder’s house on Saturday pretending to be a health department volunteer. ‘Accused made use of pandemic situation to plan the murders’Sabari told them he wanted to screen them for Covid and used a temperature gun and a pulse oxymeter to check the temperature and oxygen saturation of Gounder, his wife Mallika, 55, Deepa and their house help Kuppammal, 65. Sabari then gave each of them a tablet, saying it was a preventive against the virus and insisted they eat it in his presence. Erode district superintendent of police V Sasimohan said the tablets were a powerful insecticide, used in coconut plantations, coated in coffee powder and the four swooned within minutes. It was Kalyanasundaram himself, who was waiting near the house, who alerted police and helped neighbours take the four to hospital. Mallika died on way to the hospital. Kuppammal was referred to the Salem government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital while Karuppanna Gounder and his daughter Deepa were taken to a private hospital in Coimbatore for further treatment. “Kuppammal died early on Sunday and Deepa died a few hours later,” the SP said, adding that Karuppanna Gounder is in a critical condition. The SP formed four special investigation teams. The discrepancies in Kalyanasundaram’s statements led the police to focus on him, investigators said. The Chennimalai police arrested the duo on Sunday night. The Erode SP said, “The accused planned very cunningly to murder the victims utilising the Covid-19 pandemic situation.” The Chennimalai police produced the duo before the judicial magistrate of Perundurai sub-court on Sunday night and lodged them at the Gobichettipalayam sub-jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-covid-drug-deaths-turn-out-to-be-murder-3-die-of-poisoning-in-erode/articleshow/83911493.cms||Senthil Kumaran

---||Kolkata||West Bengal Bar Council urges CJI to remove Calcutta high court’s acting CJ||KOLKATA: The Bar Council of West Bengal has written to the Chief Justice of India, seeking the immediate removal of Calcutta High Court Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, in order to retain the “majesty and sanctity” of the country’s oldest chartered court. “We, members of the West Bengal Bar Association, are compelled to write this instant letter under urgent and dire circumstances,” Bar Council of West Bengal chairman Ashok Kumar Deb wrote to CJI N V Ramana, calling for Justice Bindal’s removal, referring to multiple instances, which have given rise to a “perception that he is an unfair, partial and biased judge and whose continuance at the Hon’ble High Court interferes with fair and impartial dispensation of justice”. Deb, a lawyer, is also a six-time MLA from Budge Budge, five times as a Trinamool Congress candidate. The 26-member body, which enrolls all state advocates, also has a Trinamool Rajya Sabha MP and a KMC board of administrators member, among its members. “All we seek is fairness and neutrality. We understand this is unprecedented (in Bengal) but we could not be mute spectators anymore,” Deb told TOI. In the letter dated June 25, citing the manner in which the Narada case was dealt with, Deb claimed Bindal’s conduct indicated that he “did not have any regard for judicial propriety and has committed a mockery of the judicial conscience”. On May 24, Justice Arindam Sinha had written a letter, in which he took serious exception to the manner in which the Narada bail matter was handled by the division bench. Deb’s letter refers this, too. The Narada case matter is currently being heard by a five-judge bench headed by Justice Bindal. “The fact that the five-judge bench headed by Justice Bindal has allowed repeated requests by CBI to file its affidavits, but has declined the request made by Mamata Banerjee [chief minister] and Moloy Ghatak [law minister] to file affidavits and contest the matter where serious allegations have been made against them is a clear sign of Justice Bindal’s apparent bias,” Deb’s letter mentions. Hearing an appeal by Banerjee and Ghatak, the Supreme Court on Friday had asked Calcutta HC to accept fresh applications from them and hear their pleas on June 29 in the Narada case, setting aside the Calcutta HC’s June 9 order refusing their affidavits. Deb also referred to the case that CM Banerjee had filed before the HC, challenging the victory of Suvendu Adhikari in the assembly elections from Nandigram. The matter had initially been filed and mentioned before the single bench headed by Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharya but Justice Bindal later assigned the matter to Justice Kausik Chanda “while being completely and fully aware of Justice Chanda’s long-standing association with BJP”, the letter mentions. “The Chief Justice, being the master of the roster, is expected to exercise the highest standard of judicial propriety. However, the acts and conduct of Justice Bindal prove otherwise. It is a matter of serious concern that a formal application was made before Justice Bindal for reassignment of the matter to a court other than Justice Chanda’s. However, no steps have been taken at Justice Bindal’s end. More surprisingly, the matter continues to be listed before Hon’ble Justice Chanda.” “We beseech your Lordship to take immediate steps for removal of Justice Rajesh Bindal as a judge of Calcutta High Court so that the majesty and sanctity of the high court is upheld and to ensure peoples’ confidence in the judiciary does not fall to pieces. Unless urgent steps are taken for the removal of Justice Rajesh Bindal, we will be mute spectators to the continuous travesty of justice at the hands of a prejudiced, biased and skewed judge and justice will be denied to the unguarded citizens of this great nation,” the letter adds. The letter also drew sharp responses. Senior advocate and CPM Rajya Sabha MP Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said: “The chairman being the author of this letter should have known the jurisdiction of the office he is adorning. He has no authority to write such an obnoxious letter to demean the practising lawyers of the state. His letter amounts to interference with the administration of justice,” adding. “I would request the Chief Justice of India to initiate a suo motu contempt proceeding against the author of that letter.” “As a statutory body for advocates, we remain within our rights to seek fair and neutral dispension of justice,” Deb responded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-bar-council-urges-cji-to-remove-cal-hcs-acting-cj/articleshow/83905574.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

At present, the police has 12 dogs conditioned to track, sniff narcotic substances and find explosives. Goa police has written to the Intelligence Integrated Training Academy (IITA) in Telangana to check if they have trained canines, and when the next training is scheduled for canines. Speaking to TOI, Anti-Narcotic Cell (ANC) superintendent of police Mahesh Gaonkar said that they have received department approval to add four sniffer dogs to the Goa police dog squad. He also said that two canines are utilised to sniff the narcotics. “We have decided to get Labradors and train them,” Gaonkar said, adding that already one Labrador and German Shepherd each are used for narcotic investigations. Goa police will be getting additional canines after a gap of over two years. In February 2019, six dogs - Romeo, Sandy, Dolly, Happy, Denny and Daisy had joined the police force. Gaonkar said that the department gets the dogs at the age of three and then they are sent for training for almost eight months. He also said that the handlers of these dogs are also sent for training along with the sniffer canines. The officer said that once sniffer canines join the department, they would be taken to railway stations, bus stands and airport to sniff parcels and cargo. “If the canines give us signal that there is something suspicious, we open the parcel and cargo to verify its contents,” the ANC chief said. He also said that at present they take two canines across the state to sniff narcotic substances. In the first half of 2021, Goa police seized over Rs 2 crore of narcotic substances and confiscated nearly 100 kg of drugs. Police arrested 55 persons, including seven foreign nationals, for illegal possession of narcotic substances. Out of 55 narcotic raids, 30 cases are booked by north Goa police, which is the highest compared among south Goa police, ANC and crime branch. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had given the police a free hand to break the chain of drugs trade in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-more-sniffer-dogs-to-help-goa-police-tackle-drug-menace/articleshow/83905654.cms||Murari Shetye

Cops arrested Raju Rathwa and seven others after the woman filed a complaint on June 23. Three others are yet to be arrested. According to the police, the complainant’s son and Rathwa’s daughter were in a relationship and had eloped a few days ago. “The duo even got married and sent in their marriage certificates to their families. On June 22, Rathwa learnt that his daughter and the boy had come to the complainant’s house in Chhota Udepur for a visit,” said the police. “Rathwa reached the complainant’s home along with 10 other members of his family and soon the heated arguments turned into a ruckus. The complainant said that she got injured after being attacked by Rathwa and others. Our team also reached the spot and took the complainant to the hospital,” said J K Patel, police inspector, Chhota Udepur police station. A complaint of assault and rioting was registered against Rathwa and 10 others on June 23. “The complainant didn’t say anything about the sexual assault on the day the FIR was registered. She approached the police again on Saturday and alleged that Rathwa had committed unnatural sex with her. We sent her for medical tests and added IPC section 377 to the FIR,” Patel told TOI. Families of Rathwa and the complainant are engaged in farming. “We are also searching for the girl and the boy who had eloped to get married. They both are adults so their marriage is legal,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-alleges-unnatural-sex-after-assault-over-dispute/articleshow/83901370.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Pause on off-site vaccination camps; new rules to be discussed in meeting today||KOLKATA: The state government has put on hold, from Monday, “off-site and outdoor vaccination” camps, with perhaps a few exceptions. The move comes four days after vaccines administered at a Kasba camp were found to be fake, leading to the arrest of the organizers. From Monday, only vaccination centres inside hospitals (both private and government-run) and clinics run by KMC will be operational. Some off-site centres at malls may be allowed to function, but there would be better clarity to this after a meeting on Monday that health officials have called with private hospitals on the inoculation drive and the SOP. On Saturday, an extensive SOP — on setting up outreach vaccination centres by private hospitals — was framed. Also on Saturday, the CMOH North 24 Parganas had asked all private hospitals to put on hold all off-site vaccination centres until further notice, ahead of the SOP. Private hospitals said they received instructions to stop all off-site vaccination camps from Monday from Joly Choudhury, joint secretary, SUDA (state urban development authority), who is the nodal official for the vaccination drive. This caused a last-minute rush at hospitals to inform organisations they had tied up with for off-site camps from Monday. RN Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences had to shift one of its off-site camps into the hospital on Sunday itself after the SOP came out from the health department. “Every Sunday, we conduct an off-site camp for the underprivileged, and we had to shift the site to the hospital vaccination centre, where around 500 got the jab. Luckily, we had only one off-site camp scheduled for Monday, and we have informed our partner about the cancellation,” said R Venkatesh regional director (East), Narayan Health. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has put three camps on hold for Monday — one in the city and two in Behrampore. “We have been holding about 12 off-site camps daily regularly,” said Medica Group of Hospital chairman Alok Roy. While private hospitals said this was a good step to ensure an flawless drive, they feared the drive would lose pace in the next few days. Peerless CEO Sudipto Mitra said: “Camps lost credibility after the Kasba fiasco. People are scared, sceptical and we need time to win their trust. Having said that, I must add that we need off-site vaccination camps to reach more people to hasten the drive.” Woodlands Hospital said it would hold only off-site drives for which they had received prior permission. “We have been obtaining approval letters from the authorities for each off-site vaccination centre right from day one. So, there should be no issue with our drive tomorrow,” said Rupali Basu, MD, Woodlands. The move comes as a dampener for those who had been eyeing to get inoculated at relatively sparsely crowded off-site camps, rather than jostle for their dose in crowded KMC clinics, government hospitals or even private hospitals. Over the last few months, thousands of elderly citizens — believed to be more vulnerable to Covid — have been able to receive the vaccine at their residential complexes or camps close to their homes. There are many more waiting for their second dose, who might have to join long queues if off-site camps are not revived. Several private hospitals have been holding camps at shopping malls, which now stand deferred. Several private hospitals had earlier deferred their off-site camps after the health department altered the method of seeking permission for them and made them more stringent in the wake of the Kasba fiasco. While previously, all private vaccination centres had to fill in a form and submit it to the health department, which created a page on the Co-Win portal for the particular camp, an additional clearance letter would now be needed, it was announced. Also, more details of the camp and each vaccination centre were sought in the application forms. The health department said it would take 48 hours from the time of application to issue the final clearance.

According to ATS, bank accounts of a Gujarat-based businessman were used for the transactions. Inspector general of police, ATS, GK Goswamy said, “Transactions to the tune of crores of rupees have been made from the UK into the accounts of a businessman in Gujarat, who is under our scanner. We are verifying the accounts.” Another officer privy to the investigation said the transfer of Rs 2 crore was done from the UK without following the guidelines and the account of a trust/society was used to make private transactions, which was illegal. “Evidences show violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), which is being probed. ED is also looking into it,” the officer said. ATS officials said they were tracing the details of transactions from the Middle East countries to the accounts of Umar Gautam and Jahangir Qasmi. The agency also claimed to have come across more conversions carried out by the duo in Ghaziabad district. Meanwhile, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has issued a notice to the Fatehpur district administration, seeking information about the allegations made by a teacher of a private school that Umar Gautam visited the campus and ask students to study Urdu and Arabic. The teacher claimed that Umar used to put pressure on Hindu students to convert to Islam and when she protested, she was sacked by the school authorities. SP, Fatehpur, Satpal told TOI that the district magistrate has constituted a fourmember committee to conduct an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tracked-rs-2-crore-funds-to-uk-in-conversions-racket-up-ats/articleshow/83908446.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The district’s test positivity rate (TPR) also continued well below 1%. Still, in view of the Delta-plus variant threat, various restrictions will come into effect in the district from Monday. As per data of district civil surgeon, there were no fatalities due to novel coronavirus in city, rural and also from other districts on Sunday. Earlier, this had happened for the first time after 384 days on June 20 and second time on June 25. Previously, it happened on July 6, 2020, which was before the peak of the first wave. The district had faced first wave peak in August and September last year. On Sunday, 22 persons were found positive from 8,538 tests for a TPR of 0.26%. Weekly TPR as per RT-PCR tests is being considered for relaxations and restrictions. The district’s weekly TPR from June 19 to 25 as per RT-PCR tests was 0.8%. The state government had allowed total normalcy if weekly TPR was below 5%. Couple of days ago, the government had revised guidelines and asked all districts to follow restrictions of Level-3 if the weekly TPR is below 10%. Therefore, coaching classes will shut from Monday. Timings of essential, non-essential shops, private offices, gyms etc will be reduced from existing 8pm to 4pm. Restaurants and bars will have to close at 4pm as against presently allowed 11pm deadline. Attendance in marriage ceremonies and funeral will go down along with other restrictions.

---||India||Pakistan-backed TRF terrorist among two held with IEDs in Jammu||JAMMU: A terrorist of the Pakistan-backed outfit TRF and a resident suspected to have been tasked with planting a bomb in a public place were arrested in Jammu’s Narwal on Sunday with improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Officials said there was no immediate link between the twin arrests within hours of each other and the drone breach at the IAF base in Jammu airport that led to two low-intensity IED blasts before dawn. The special operations group of J&K police nabbed the TRF terrorist, identified as Zahoor Ahmad Rather, with 5kg IED, arms and some ammunition near a prominent mall on the outskirts of Jammu town. He had been based in Samba district for some time and was traced on the basis of inputs from Anantnag police. “Zahoor, who operates under two aliases – Sahil and Khalid – is being questioned to ascertain if other contacts have managed to sneak into Jammu and who are their logistics providers in the region,” the police said. Zahoor had received arms training in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 2004 and infiltrated into India along with five other foreign terrorists. He surrendered in 2006, only to be sucked back into terrorism last year through the TRF, an official said. The day’s second arrest in the Narwal area happened after a resident of Jammu division was spotted moving around in a manner that aroused the suspicion of a police team on duty there. “He was found in possession of around 4kg of explosives stashed into an improvised device,” an officer said. “It seems the suspect was part of a plan to carry out a major strike.” DGP Dilbag Singh lauded Jammu police for “successfully foiling possible terror attacks”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-backed-trf-terrorist-among-two-held-with-ieds-in-jammu/articleshow/83908464.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The police had been avoiding registering offences, even after NMC’s Dhantoli zone Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) slapped Rs30,000 fine on the pub management for violation of Covid restrictions. A video of the place showed the premises teeming with customers, including many without masks, and also not maintaining social distancing. NMC team too has confirmed the violations in their findings. Even though the state government has invoked the Epidemic diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act, and CP Amitesh Kumar has enforced section 144 CrPC, Imambada police were unsure about registering offence, citing NMC action as sufficient. CP Amitesh Kumar said the police were in two minds as registering offence against the pub owner after NMC action would tantamount to ‘double jeopardy’ (taking action twice for same offence). “I have instructed zonal DCP to follow up the action now with sealing procedures,” he said. A case was registered at Imambada police station at 10.50pm against pub owner Pawan Nirban for violation of Covid norms. Earlier in the evening, NMC and Imambada police had jointly raided the place at 9.20p, but cops waited to initiate action until senior officials prompted them. Legal expert Shreerang Bhandarkar said NMC’s penalty is for breach of Covid norms and SOPs, which NMC has implemented for such places (pubs and others). This action by the local civic authority can be categorized as ‘civil liability’. “Police action is the enforcement of criminal liability, which is different from civil liability. There is no question of double jeopardy,” said Bhandarkar. In the past, Zonal DCP Vinita, during joint raids with NDS teams, had ensured premises were sealed and offences were registered against a number of pub owners, eateries, hotels, hookah parlours and such outlets in West Nagpur for Covid violations. Even Zonal DCP Neelotpal had raided Pankaj Kadiwala’s shop at Jaripatka, registered offences and also ensured the premises were sealed by NDS in simultaneous action for violation of Covid restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wary-cops-book-pub-owner-after-nmcs-rs30k-fine/articleshow/83904010.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||Dowry video brings I-T department sniffing||MUZAFFARNAGAR: In an “obscene” display of wealth, a wedding ceremony in Uttar Pradesh showed off dowry — Rs 41 lakh in cash, bride with knee-length gold necklace, silver and other valuables — drawing not just the attention of the I-T department and police, but also the local community’s ire. It was all filmed and a purported video of the “dowry act” has gone viral. In the video, a man can be seen bragging about cash, keys of an SUV and other jewellery. In the next shot, the bride can be seen weighed down and almost entirely covered in a gold necklace. According to locals, the dowry was worth more than Rs 1 crore. The Muslim wedding took place in Shamli’s Thanabhawan area recently. The bride, in her early 20s, belongs to a family of cloth merchants who work in Gujarat’s Surat. The groom, who is also a local, has a garment business in Karnataka. Police have launched a probe after scanning the video clips. “Investigation has begun and the I-T department has also been roped in,” Thanabhawan DSP Amit Saxena said on Sunday. Meanwhile, members of the community in Shamli and Muzaffarnagar districts have demanded strict action against such families for their “obscene display of wealth” at a time when “poor fathers are finding it difficult to marry off their daughters”. Mohammad Khalid Qureshi, a prominent community member, said, “Such acts will only create a major hurdle for women whose families are not well-off.” “Several such incidents are taking place and this filth in our society must stop,” Shameem Qureshi, district president of Jamiatul Quresh, said. “We are going to call a panchayat soon. Those who encourage dowry will be dealt with appropriately,” he added. This was the third such incident in the region in a week where a Muslim family had filmed the dowry and put the video on social media. Earlier, two purported video clips showing cash in lakhs being given to the groom were widely circulated. Wedding ceremonies in traditional Muslim families used to be a simple affair till a few years ago. Recently, the suicide by 23-yearold Ayesha Banu Makrani, who was allegedly harassed for dowry, forced prominent clerics to announce a boycott of all such weddings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dowry-video-brings-i-t-department-sniffing/articleshow/83908487.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Chandigarh||Rich Haryana's poor tradition||CHANDIGARH: On all parameters like income per capita, GDP per capita and GDP per capita growth, Haryana invariably ranks in the top three. The small state (21st areawise) punches above its weight in fields of sports and defence too by producing more Olympians, sportspersons and soldiers than any other state. Thus one can be forgiven for looking at its swanky parts and assuming that the whole of Haryana had moved forward as a society. In reality, it is still tied to the age-old custom of denying adults the freedom to choose their life partners. The ‘honour killing’ incident where young Vinay Dahiya was killed and his teenage wife Kiran was critically injured, is just the most recent example where parents or family members of couples, who dare to go against social norms, become their killers. Young adults are eliminated for a false sense of “honour” by their families just to avoid losing face in the community. No wonder, the state has often earned the ignominy of a podium finish in the figures for crimes against women. The legal system seems to offer no deterrence. As per an affidavit submitted by Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava before the Punjab and Haryana high court in December last year, around 13 cases related to ‘honour killing’ were pending in various districts of the state at that time. According to Professor Manjit Singh, sociologist and retired academician from Chandigarh-based Panjab University, all agrarian societies generally have very strong familial and kinship relations, which they call ‘izzat’ or ‘honour’ and such things overshadow individual’s rights. “They have tribal instincts and they commit such acts thinking that their entire culture and communitarian code of conduct would collapse if they do not stop the ‘menace,’ that the ‘evil’ would spread in their family and many others may follow such path of breaking the norms,” he added, explaining the reasons for families committing such killings. In April 2016, a Rohtak court had observed that such violence was seen as “a way of ensuring compliance and preventing rebellion” in the local society. “In these traditional male-dominated societies, women are dependent first on their father and then on their husband, whom they are expected to obey. Women are viewed as property and not as individuals with their own agency. As such, they must submit to male authority figures in the family. Failure to do so can result in extreme violence as punishment,” observed Rohtak additional session judge Narinder Kaur, convicting the accused guilty in an ‘honour killing’ case. Here are some well-known cases reflecting the madness that takes over families in the name of ‘honour’: Same gotra, same village | On Thursday night, Vinay and Kiran Dahiya, from Gopalpura village in Sonipat, were shot by the girl’s relatives for marrying in the same ‘gotra’ in August 2020. The couple was living in fear under severe threat from the girl’s family for the past around one year. Even their plea before the high court did not save them as Sonipat police did not provide any security. Different caste | On January 2, 2021, 23-year-old Neeraj was murdered allegedly by his brother-in-law and his accomplice in Panipat. The ‘crime’ Neeraj had committed was to fall in love with Komal. Belonging to different castes, they got married in November 2020. Killed in anticipation | On December 30, 2020, a young man keen on getting married to his girlfriend against the wishes of the two families was shot dead. The girl’s uncle and another relative were arrested in this case. Abduction and murder | On September 11, 2020, a Sirsa court awarded life imprisonment to seven persons from Darbi village. They had killed Amandeep Kaur, 23, for eloping with her neighbour Manmeet in August 2014. For a few days, the couple stayed at a safe house of the Sirsa police before moving in with Manmeet’s parents at Darbi. Soon, Amandeep’s relatives forcefully took her away and killed her. Beaten and burned On April 12, 2018, a Sonipat court had sentenced to life imprisonment to a couple and three other family members for killing their minor daughter in 2016 for eloping with a boy she was in love with. In July 2016, Sweety, 17, a native of Matand village in Sonipat district was set on fire after being thrown inside a cow dung storage structure. Same gotra, same village | On August 10, 2016, a Rohtak court awarded life imprisonment to a couple and their son from Gharnawati village for killing their daughter and her lover. Dharmender and Nidhi were brutally murdered on September 18, 2013, by the girl’s father for having an affair in the same gotra and same village. Dharmender’s body was thrown in front of his house whereas Nidhi’s body was being cremated when police reached the cremation ground. Cops side with killers | In June 2012, 23-year-old Navin from Jind was allegedly killed by his lover Seema’s father Dharambir Singh. On April 5, 2014, the high court had ordered CBI to probe the case after finding “serious loopholes and contradictions in the investigation” done by Jind police and state crime bureau. Court officer targeted | One Ved Pal of Kaithal district of Haryana, who had married Sonia in May 2011, was later lynched by relatives of the couple. In this case, the warrant officer of the high court was also injured by the relatives of the girl’s family, when he went for the couple’s protection. Hunted at high court | In February 2010, a couple from Jind Reena and Anil Kumar, who married against khap norms, were chased and thrashed by their relatives in the high court premises. At that time Reena was pregnant and was given protection by the chief justice on her mercy appeal. The couple remained in police lines in Panchkula for a long time and even delivered their first baby under heavy police protection. Cops defy court, abandon couple | In the Infamous Manoj-Babli case that had hit international headlines, the couple had married in a temple at Chandigarh in April 2007 and procured the protection orders from the Punjab and Haryana high court. Later, the couple was dragged out in June 2007 from a crowded bus and murdered. The policemen, provided by HC orders, abandoned the couple. Khap norms supreme The gotra system in Haryana prohibits a couple from getting married if they, their mothers or their grandmothers belong to the same gotra. Some khaps have eased some restrictions and announced “no objection” if grandmothers of the couple belong to the same gotra. The condition that the couple’s and even their mothers’ gotra should not match still holds. Marrying in the same gotra is considered a sin in the state. Even Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on January 10, 2020, had made a statement that marriage between people of the same ‘gotra’ (clan) should not be solemnised. “It has even been proved scientifically that same-gotra marriages should not happen. It is believed that relationships between men and women of the same gotra are of brother and sister. If we follow this, it would have an impact on the society,” Khattar had said while speaking at a conference on the topic of ‘Safety of Women and Children’ at Panchkula. Cells in every police district On February 23, 2015, Justice K Kannan, while hearing an ‘honour killing’ case from Sirsa district of Haryana, had ordered for setting up of a separate cell in every police district for receiving complaints from couples expressing fear of physical annihilation from parents, relatives and khaps. It was ordered that police shall make no attempt to compel adult couples to return to their parents if they fear physical harm. The police must keep an army of “friends of people” from amongst progressive minded people in every village or group of villages, where ‘honour killings’ have been rampant, to provide emotional support and counselling. They shall be sounded by the police, when complaints are received, to play a tempering role to diffuse tension in the village. New law needed: Commission In its 242nd report submitted on August 22, 2012, the Law Commission had examined if the ‘honour killings’ must be dealt with differently in the manner of court trials. The commission had suggested a new legal framework through a law for ‘Prevention of Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances (in the name of honour and tradition). However, the recommendations have not so far been implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rich-states-poor-tradition/articleshow/83905968.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Goa||Goa: Fearing nuisance, Sattari locals block roads to waterfalls||VALPOI: As with every monsoon season this year too Sattari villagers have to face the nuisance of picnickers at waterfalls situated at different villages of Sattari. Despite the ongoing pandemic the influx of picnickers has only increased at these pristine spots. Locals feel unsafe as picnickers drink and create nuisance in the villages and worse still leave behind their waste at these beautiful spots. Villagers of Saleli Sattari and Brahamakarmali Sattari have begun to step up and block roads and paths leading to waterfalls in their villages. Banners have also been put up to keep away visitors and branches, twigs, stones have been put across the path by locals. Locals also worry that the constant barrage of urban visitors and their trail of waste will ruin Sattari’s waterfalls for nature lovers. The taluka has many waterfalls, the most popular being Saleli, Keri, Morle, Copardem, Pali, Charavane, Hivre, Nanoda, Sirguli, Bambar, Brahmakarmali, Shelpe and Chorla Ghat. All of these waterfalls are seasonal and spring to life only during the monsoon. Most are located within the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. The panch of Nagargao village panchayat Parag Khadilkar told TOI that picnickers create nuisance at Brahamakarmali village. “These tourists don’t even wear proper clothes and come in our village to take bath at the waterfall. This is disgusting, they even drink alcohol excessively and behave badly in an intoxicated condition,” Khalidkar said. He blamed revellers for dumping garbage and plastic all over the forest area. He also said that forest officials take such behavior leniently and don’t visit or patrol these spots as these spots fall in the wildlife sanctuary. “Police also rarely come to these waterfalls,” Khalidkar said adding that strict action should be taken against such picnickers. He also said that the Sattari deputy collector Rajesh Ajgaonkar had issued an order banning visits by tourists to waterfalls during pandemic but with no officials following-up on the order, picnickers have a free hand at these locations and end up creating unnecessary ruckus and disturbance. A villager from Saleli-Sattari, Tukaram Gawas told TOI that the villagers of Saleli have blocked the road leading to the waterfalls but inspite of such measures there were picnickers in the village on Sunday. As residents of this village we took the matter into our hands and sent back all those who had arrived for a picnic at the waterfalls,” Gawas said.. Villagers said that trekkers and picnickers even break alcohol bottles near the waterfalls and leave this behind, making a general nuisance. “We have to deal with drunken brawls and eve-teasing which is so scary at times,” they said. Locals have complained about such acts to authorities but they say they haven’t seen any action taken. Villagers have demanded that officials deploy policemen at these spots during the weekends to control the crowd as well as to keep a check on activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fearing-nuisance-sattari-locals-block-roads-to-waterfalls/articleshow/83904063.cms||Afaq Khan
---||Amritsar||Aussie Sikh group draws flak for suggesting changes in kirpan specifications||Amritsar: The 10-member New South Wales ( NSW ) Gurudwara Working Group has kicked off a furore over alteration of specifications of the kirpan, one of the five symbols of Sikh faith, and how it should be worn. Reacting to the working group’s recommendations, principal advisor to Sikh Federation, UK, Dabinderjit Singh told TOI on Saturday that it was the working group that negotiated proposed guidelines with the NSW department of education on the issue of kirpan. He claimed that the working group said on record that the proposed guidelines were arrived at after wider consultations with the Sikh community and religious organisations in Australia and other countries, including Akal Takht jathedar. “This is hugely misleading as what has been negotiated is unacceptable and it is impossible for any amritdhari (baptised ) Sikh or respectable Sikh organisation, let alone the jathedar, to agree to such restrictions on the kirpan,” said Dabinderjit. NSW education minister Sarah Mitchell issued orders of imposing the ban on wearing of kirpan in all schools after a 14-year-old baptised Sikh student of Glenwood High School, Sydney, NSW, stabbed a 16-year-old male student with kirpan twice in his stomach on May 6. The Australian Sikh community objected to this and asked the NSW government to rescind the orders. To find an amicable solution, a 10-member NSW gurdwara working group was constituted to offer suggestions to the NSW government on kirpan. A draft proposal was formed, which was uploaded online. According to this, the kirpan worn by Sikh students should have a blunt blade and be secured so that it cannot be used. It was also suggested that it be secured by a chain soldered closed at the links to restrict the blade from being removed. The new policy read that the kirpan should also be concealed from view and must be removed and safely stored, or secured against the body when undertaking physical activity such as sport. As the new policy was uploaded, Sikhs around the world questioned whether the ASA or the working group had any authority to alter specifications of the kirpan and how it should be worn. When contacted, chairperson of the Australian Sikh Association (ASA) Ravinderjit Singh said that the 10-member working group comprised members from across Australia and had five baptised Sikhs. He said the group had sent the draft proposal to the Akal Takht secretariat but they didn’t receive any reply so far. “We understand the jathedar has not responded to these proposals and the NSW Gurdwara working group is misusing his name to justify their naïve approach,” alleged Narinderjit Singh, general secretary of the Sikh Federation, UK adding that the jathedar has had plenty of time to study the matter and should come out to clarify that such restrictions on the kirpan were total unacceptable. He said the worldwide sangat was furious with those who were trying to compromise the kirpan. Despite repeated attempts, neither the jathedar nor his personal assistant Jaspal Singh answered the phone to comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/aussie-sikh-group-draws-flak-for-suggesting-changes-in-kirpan-specifications/articleshow/83906022.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chennai||Top stays in Chennai cheaper than other metros||CHENNAI: Low demand due to the pandemic has left room tariff in star hotels in the city lower than that in other cities. Industry sources said this is going to be an advantage at a time when travel or staycations may resume as the state government has relaxed restrictions. Top-rated stays range from Rs 2,800 to Rs 7,400 a night in the city, with a majority of the hotels charging a maximum Rs 3,500. “Tariff is low in Chennai as commercial operations are low now. Rooms were added in OMR area banking on corporate customers. That business is not there now. The average room rate (ARR) which used to be Rs 4,000 is now in the range of Rs 2,600 to Rs 3,000,” said a manager of a star hotel. The city is set to get an advantage while attracting domestic tourists in the initial days of resumption of travel, say industry sources. People may opt for weekend stays too as work from home continues. “Hotels are expecting a boom when more relaxations are introduced because people who worked from home may have saved more as they couldn’t travel or eat out. It is this clientele that will help hotels bounce back,” said an official from another hotel. Stakeholders in the hospitality sector said star hotels will continue to have tariff at least 15% less than the pre-Covid times till signs of normalcy returns. Sandeep Bhatnagar, senior general manager of Ramada Plaza Chennai said most hotels in the city reached pre-Covid occupancy in February, before the second wave hit. “We are bullish of revival in a couple of months as restrictions are lifted across the country,” he said. South India Hotels and Restaurants Association (SIHRA) honorary secretary and deputy managing director of GRT Hotels and Resorts, T Nataarajan said complete revival and normalcy is expected by the end of this year. “Room tariff in Chennai are low now because the rooms are mostly offered to health workers on Covid-19 duty. The tariff will go up when the demand from the corporate sector shoots up,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/top-stays-in-chennai-cheaper-than-other-metros/articleshow/83908491.cms||---

---||Gurgaon||‘Forcible conversion’ of Sikhs girls: Akal Takht demands anti-conversion law in J&K||Ambala: Following two cases of alleged abduction and forcible conversion of Sikh girls in Srinagar on Saturday, the Akal Takht and leaders of the Sikh community on Sunday demanded implementation of an anti-conversion law in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), similar to the ones implemented in states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP). Sources said a 62-year-old man, who was already married, allegedly performed ‘nikah’ (marriage) with a Sikh girl, 18, after abducting her at gunpoint from Rainawari area of Srinagar. Girl’s parents claimed she was mentally unsound. The family of the girl claimed that their daughter had gone missing on Monday and the J&K police had assured them that the girl would returned within 36 hours. On Saturday, the girl was brought to the Srinagar high court along with the family of the old man. By the evening, it was learnt that the court declared the marriage valid and handed the custody of girl over to the family of old man. The parents of the Sikh girl alleged that they were not allowed to enter the court room and their voice was not heard. The Sikh community in Srinagar on Saturday night held a strong protest outside the judicial court complex in Srinagar, demanding custody of the girl. Finally, the parents were reportedly allowed to meet the girl at 10.30 pm. Sources in Kashmir said the second Sikh girl belonged to Mehjoor Nagar of Srinagar, who allegedly went missing after attending a function of her Muslim friend. Sources claimed that the girl was forcibly married to a boy attending the same function. Some Sikh leaders from Kashmir reported the matter to Sikh bodies, including Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC). On Sunday morning, DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa led a Sikh delegation to Kashmir and held a gathering with the Sikh community in Kashmir. Accompanied by about 200 Sikhs, Sirsa led a protest through the roads of Srinagar, while demanding action against the culprits who allegedly got the young girl married to the elderly man. Demanding anti-conversion law from Government of India, Sirsa tweeted, “The local Sikh community of Jammu and Kashmir urges @AmitShah Ji to get a strong law implemented in Jammu & Kashmir (Just like Uttar Pradesh & Madhya Pradesh) mandating permission of parents in inter-religion marriages to stop these forced ‘nikahs’ of Sikh minority girls.” SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal tweeted, “Shocked to learn that our Sikh daughter was kidnapped & forcibly married to an elderly man of a different community in Srinagar.” Later in the day, the Sikh delegation along with representatives of local Singh Sabhas led by Sirsa held a meeting with J&K Lt Gov Manoj Sinha. Talking to TOI, Sirsa said, “In the meeting, Lt Gov Manoj Sinha assured the community that the girls will be handed back to the family. The officials have assured constituting a minority commission. The Lt Gov also said that he will not make a false commitment that the laws adopted in UP and MP will be implemented in J&K, but will implement a law that stops the forcible conversion.” Officiating jathedar of Akal Takht Sahib Giani Harpreet Singh also wrote a letter to Lt Gov Sinha, demanding an anti-conversion law in J&K to stop forcible conversion of the Sikh girls. In his letter, Giani Harpreet Singh said, “I would like to apprise you about the repeated incidents of kidnapping of Sikh girls in Jammu and Kashmir and their forceful religion conversion and marrying them with Muslim men. Recently, a Sikh girl has been kidnapped on gunpoint and forcefully converted into Muslim religion and married to an old man. In the last month, 4 Sikhs have been kidnapped and forcefully converted. There is a strong outrage among Sikh Community worldwide on such repeated incidents."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/forcible-conversion-of-sikhs-girls-akal-takht-demands-anti-conversion-law-in-jk/articleshow/83906046.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Industries take up vaccination drive, workers line up for jab||PANAJI: Industrial units have started free vaccination drives for daily wage industrial workers at Cuncolim and Verna industrial estates with a similar drive set to commence at Kundaim industrial estate from Wednesday. Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) has seen a huge demand for vaccines among the workers and said that similar vaccination drives will continue in the days to come.  While the state government supplied vaccines through the Balli primary health centre for workers employed at the Cuncolim Industrial estate, Verna Industrial estate directly procured the Covishield vaccine from Serum Institute India. VIA has started vaccinating daily wage workers and employees through a tie-up with Mother Care Hospital, Margao. “These industrial workers could not afford to lose a day’s wages by attending vaccination drives held at the panchayat level. We got a very good response from the workers, there is no vaccine hesitancy,” said GSIA president Damodar Kochkar.  He said that around 500 workers were vaccinated at Verna while over to 1300 workers were vaccinated at Cuncolim, with nearly 793 workers taking the jab on Sunday.  Besides vaccinating industrial workers, Verna Industries Association has also donated 1200 vaccine doses to the primary health centres for free vaccination in the surrounding villages. Since the vaccines were procured privately, VIA paid Rs 630 per dose, much higher than the cost that the state and Centre pays per dose.  Kochkar said that the vaccination drive in the industrial estates was possible due to the personal intervention of chief minister Pramod Sawant and the health department.  GSIA had requested the chief minister to hold vaccination drives at all the industrial estates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/industries-take-up-vax-drive-workers-line-up-for-jab/articleshow/83904194.cms||---
---||India||Suppression must end to make PM’s meet credible: Mehbooba Mufti||NEW DELHI: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday said the dialogue process initiated by PM Narendra Modi with J&K’s mainstream leadership can gain credibility by ending what she called an “era of oppression and suppression” in the UT and understanding that a dissenting voice is not a criminal act. “Give people the right to breathe and the rest will follow later,” Mufti said, as she termed the PM’s meeting with a 14-member delegation from J&K here last week as a way forward to end the “sufferings” of people in the erstwhile state. Mehbooba, who was part of the delegation, made it clear that the onus was on the Centre to make the dialogue process credible. “When I say allow people to breathe, I mean that today any dissenting note from any side has to cool his or her heels in the prison,” she said. When the PM says he wants to eradicate ‘dil ki doori’, such kind of suppression has to come to an end immediately, she said. “First and foremost, the era of suppression and oppression has to come to an end and the government has to understand that a dissenting voice is not a criminal act. The entire state of J&K, and I will refer to it only as a state, has become a jail,” she said. Mehbooba , who was the last CM of the erstwhile state of J&K before abrogation of its special status on August 5, 2019, emphasised that among other measures required as confidence building measures were providing relief to the tourism and trading community of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions. She also reiterated that she would not contest polls if J&K remained a UT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suppression-must-end-to-make-pms-meet-credible-mehbooba-mufti/articleshow/83908498.cms||---

According to Lahaul-Spiti SP Manav Verma, Suneel Kumar (40) was returning from Ladakh along with his wife, two children and a driver. “He died at the Army hospital at Sarchu. The primary reason of his death is altitude sickness,” he said. Verma said many tourists do not follow the acclimatisation protocol, which is necessary to avoid altitude sickness and can prove fatal if avoided. “Tourists should gain altitude slowly, taking small halts for better acclimatisation. A proper rest and hydration are also required. Some people take it lightly and gain altitude without breaking the journey and without acclimatisation, which results in altitude sickness,” he said. On June 22, Lahaul-Spiti deputy commissioner Pankaj Rai had announced setting up of oxygen banks across the district, which can be used in case of mountain sickness. One such oxygen bank is proposed to be set up at Sarchu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/mp-tourist-at-sarchu-dies-of-altitude-sickness/articleshow/83906157.cms||---

On Sunday, 91 people across Tamil Nadu died of the viral infection, taking the cumulative toll to 32,290. The state reported 5,127 new cases with 21 districts reported fresh cases in two digits. However, all seven districts in western TN reported 100 or more fresh infections. Coimbatore topped the chart with 649 new cases. Chennai (308 new cases) and its neighbouring districts continued to report a decline in daily cases. But panic set in among residents in Chennai's suburbs as 33 children of a private home in Uthiramerur tested positive. Though they were all in stable condition, the Kancheepuram district administration plans to shift them to the local government hospital. After one patient from the district recently tested positive for the Delta-plus variant, the Union health ministry asked local authorities to take up containment measures. State health secretary J Radhakrishnan wrote to all districts to intensify containment measures, track people who were in contact with Delta variant cases, and increase vaccine coverage. Finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan on Sunday told reporters that the government was planning to procure kits that can detect the Delta-plus variant. At present, the state sends samples to a lab in Bengaluru. A total of 89,402 people received the vaccine on Sunday. The state has so far administered the vaccine to 1.41 crore people. With daily recoveries (7,159) outpacing the infection rate once again, the number of active cases continued to decline. As many as 42,801 patients are undergoing treatment at health centres and homes at the moment. Consequently, bed vacancy at Covid health centres has increased to 1.38 lakh. It was around 54,000 the same day last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-daily-covid-deaths-below-100-mark/articleshow/83908520.cms||---

At a function to felicitate staff of the Curchorem community health centre (CHC), Rane said the renovated Curchorem CHC will be inaugurated by September. “People from South Goa will no longer have to travel to GMC for treatment of cardiac ailments once the facility is started at the South Goa district hospital. I have already spoken to the CM in this regard, and the facility will be opened soon. We are considering launching it before the opening of the district hospital,” Rane said. The South Goa district hospital is yet to be officially inaugurated as the new building was hurriedly turned into a Covid hospital when the first wave of the pandemic hit the state. Rane further said the Curchorem CHC will also have a dialysis facility so that patients needn’t travel to Margao or Panaji for the purpose. Stating that incidents of stroke and aneurysm were on the rise, Rane said the state plans to hire a aneurysm specialist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-south-hosp-to-have-cardiac-facility-health-min/articleshow/83904294.cms||---

A division bench comprising Justice Avneesh Jhingan and Justice Rajesh Bhardwaj of the HC issued the notice after taking cognisance of a petition filed by Bharti Airtel Limited. In its plea, the company has sought directions to quash the notice dated June 8. The HC has been informed that on December 19, 2017, the petitioner filed its Form GSTR-1, showing supply of Rs 29,88,00,000 in respect of invoice No. 1. The Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN) challan was generated by the petitioner evidencing credit of amount to the account of the government and to the electronic cash ledger maintained by the petitioner. The excise and taxation officer (ETO)-cum-proper officer/assessing authority Gurugram issued a notice to the company informing about a mismatch between Form GSTR-1 and Form GSTR-3B for the month of December 2018. On December 22, 2020, the company filed a reply explaining the alleged mismatch. The ETO-cum-proper officer, state tax, Haryana State GST Intelligence Unit, Sector-34, Gurugram, issued summons to the petitioner company, seeking documents for the alleged liability to pay interest on account of late payment of tax for December 2018 and to appeal before the authority. On June 4, the company sent a mail, requesting the summoning authority for adjournment from personal appearance scheduled on June 4 on account of restrictions imposed in view of Covid-19 pandemic. The company later sent a letter to the officer concerned, explaining the circumstances leading to mismatch in Form GSTR-1 and Form GSTR-3B and the rationale as to why the levy of interest is not warranted. Thereafter, notice was issued by the ETO-cum-proper officer, state tax, Haryana State GST Intelligence Unit, Sector-34, Gurugram, initiating recovery proceedings under Section 79 of the CGST Act and directing the petitioner company to deposit Rs 5,77,62,543 within seven days of the receipt of the said notice. On June 12, summons were issued by the GST authorities concerned, seeking details of documents/information in the nature of list of bank accounts, list of debtors, details of receivables and to appear before them on June 15. Aggrieved from this, the company approached the HC seeking directions to quash the June 8 order on the grounds that the notice has been issued by GST authorities, Gurugram, while exceeding their jurisdiction. Further directions have also been sought to declare that the retrospective amendment effected to Rule 61 (5) of the CGST Rules and Rule 61 (5) of the HGST Rules, 2017 cannot unsettle vested rights created in favour of the petitioner company against imposition of interest as on the date of payment of tax---January 17, 2019. The matter has been fixed for July 5 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/notice-to-haryana-on-airtels-plea-against-recovery-proceedings/articleshow/83906264.cms||---

Tobacco and drug addictions have gone down due to restrictions on movements, but the habit of sticking to some or the other kind of screen has grown multifold in all age groups, doctors who specialize in psychiatry and human behaviour have observed. They say that screen addiction needs to be tackled ahead of the total unlocking, otherwise it will be the biggest obstacle in bringing life back to normal. Senior psychiatrist Dr Sudhir Bhave said, “From here onwards, start curtailing the use of mobile phone as an entertainment device. Use it as a communication devise, that too for work. Otherwise you will find it difficult to cope with your normal routine as and when it comes back.” The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Nagpur chapter, along with the Psychiatric Society, Nagpur, on Sunday organized an online event on ‘de-addiction’. This time, the typical addictions of liquor or drugs were discussed less, as doctors focused on the addiction to screens — be it television, smartphones, laptops, tablets or video games. Experts at the event said that increased screen addiction is akin to a silent pandemic and people from almost every age group need to learn how to tackle it. Padma Shri Dr Abhay Bang, who has been instrumental in de-addiction campaigns, was the chief guest. Dr Bhave spoke on the current scenario of addiction, while Dr Kartik Rao spoke on management and prevention. Talks were followed by a panel discussion on ‘screen-related addictions’, in which leading doctors from the city participated. Doctors said that schools will restart now, and kids will again have to attend online classes. So, it becomes the responsibility of parents to manage their screen time in such a way that they should not become addicted to screens. Instead of giving kids mobile phones for studies, said Dr Shrikant Nimbhorkar, “Make it a point to give them laptops or desktop computers. This will limit the duration of non-academic viewing. Also, ask them to sit in the drawing room and keep an eye while the child attends school.” Doctors advised parents to limit their own screen time to set an example in front of kids. Panellists also discussed important subjects like cyber bullying, addiction to online shopping and cyber crime, to which screen-addicted users can fall prey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/screen-addiction-a-silent-pandemic-doctors/articleshow/83904347.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

She tweeted a pointed riposte to rumours on a probable alliance with AIMIM, calling it “false, misguided and factually wrong” even as the Hyderabad-based party plans to contest 100 seats, essentially in Muslimdominated areas of UP in the polls next year. Mayawati also announced that party general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra would be the national coordinator of the party media cell.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-ties-with-owaisi-bsp-to-go-alone-in-up/articleshow/83908545.cms||Pankaj Shah

It is yet to disburse the salaries and wages since April to nearly 25-odd staff including labourers. The council has 26 staff including 12 field staff. Councilor Rumaldo Fernandes said the labourers and contract workers are the worst hit. Chairperson Sweta Tari cited shortage of funds for non-payment of wages. “We are trying to settle their wages as early as possible. I had a meeting with the director of municipal administration (DMA) on Friday and briefed him about the problem. The director assured us of settling the issue on a priority basis,” said Tari. The council which comes under ‘C’ category needs around Rs 12 lakh per month to clear staff salaries excluding the payout to engineer, accountant and chief officer. With funding sources being restricted to house tax, garbage tax, trade tax and rent from municipal shops, the ‘c’ category municipalities are unable to pay their workers, a municipality officer said. Sources told TOI that the income from house tax has dropped since last two years as almost 40 per cent of the households declined to pay due to ‘unacceptable’ increase. Meusie Baretto, a resident from the town, said that she was paying Rs 39 as house tax for her old house since many decades. “But suddenly the council increased the amount in 2020 from Rs 39 to Rs 2,270.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sanguem-civic-body-staff-yet-to-get-salary-for-april/articleshow/83904382.cms||---

Covid has a known tendency of increased clotting of the blood. This has also led to heart attacks due to clots blocking blood supply. Some clots are also blocking blood supply to the limbs, leading to cases of gangrene. Once the blood supply is cut off, the limbs begin decaying, leading to gangrene in medical terms. If reported late, the limb has to be amputated, said doctors. TOI had also reported of arterial blocks leading to vision loss. Normally, gangrene happens after injuries, when blood supply to an organ gets cut off. With Covid, it is happening in patients who have recovered from infections too. Doctors who have treated cases say in worst cases amputation is the last resort, but a number of patients have been treated with procedures like angioplasty too. Dr Shoeb Nadeem, who is attached to Alexis Hospital, said he carried out two amputations. The patients were from out of Nagpur. At the same time, angioplasty has helped save the limbs of other patients. Like it happens with patients of heart ailment, a stent is used to restore the blood flow in the artery, which is otherwise blocked due to the clot, he said. Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Sanjeev Chaudhary said apart from gangrene, post Covid clots are leading to avascular necrosis of the femoral head. This affects the blood supply to the ball of the hip joint, hampering movement and also causing tremendous pain. Patients have to undergo hip replacement. “Generally, the disease was attributed to alcoholism, use of steroids and sickle cell disease. However, now blood clotting caused due to Covid is also seen as one of the reasons. Hip replacement is the remedy in such cases,” said Chaudhary, who also confirmed having come across such cases. The disease is also being found in women, in whom generally alcoholism can be ruled out, he said. Patients recovered from Covid should regularly check clotting tendencies through tests like D-Dimer and other diagnostics for coagulation profile, he said Former dean of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Dr Sajal Mitra said post Covid gangrene is a known fact. “There have been some cases but it’s certainly not at an alarming rate,” he said. Dr Avinash Gawande, medical superintendent of GMCH, too confirmed the incidence. “Two of the patients I know have developed gangrene. One of them had to undergo amputation and the other suffered dry gangrene in his finger. Such cases have been reported in government hospitals too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-blood-clots-causing-gangrene-in-limbs-amputation-needed-in-worst-cases/articleshow/83904418.cms||Shishir Arya

GSIA, along with 170 MSME associations across the country, have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing concern over the “volatile situation” which can cause “permanent damage” to the MSME sector. MSME bodies have informed the Centre that in spite of a drop in demand due to state-level lockdowns, prices of raw materials, particularly steel, pig iron, aluminium, copper and cement are on the upswing. The industry bodies suspect that a cartel has been created by steel manufacturers, which include both private and public sector units. The 170 MSME associations have come together under the umbrella of the All India Council of Association of MSMEs (AICA) and have written to Modi seeking his intervention. Copies of the letter have also been given to finance and corporate affairs minister Nirmala Sitharaman, MSME minister Nitin Gadkari, minister for steel Dharmendra Pradhan and others. “GSIA is joining hands with all other MSME associations across India requesting the government of India to intervene in this situation of price increase of basic raw materials,” GSIA president Damodar Kochkar said. GSIA said all steel companies need to meet the monthly requirements of the MSME sector. Another step suggested, that could provide relief to MSMEs, is the import of all steel materials with a nominal import duty being levied. Kochkar said that the Centre should control the price of raw materials for a specific period of time and also that it needs to provide additional funds through a scheme to meet the working capital requirements of MSMEs. “MSMEs are not able to execute orders taken at a much lower price. They face the uncertainty of getting black-listed by PSUs and large corporates if they don’t honour contracts,” said the joint representation sent to the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/raw-material-prices-affecting-biz-centre-must-intervene-msmes/articleshow/83904429.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Paediatricians are seeing increasing cases of children aged between 8-12 years who have gained excess weight during lockdown, and are now suffering from hormonal imbalance. Paediatric endocrinologist Dr Hari Mangtani said, “There are two aspects of growth — psychological and physical. We have had a lot of discussion on the psychological aspect of growth during Covid-19 phase. On the other hand, majority of parents believe that their kids are growing well physically as they are under supervision all the time. This overconfidence proved wrong.” Dr Mangtani added, “While staying at home without regular physical activity, many kids have become obese. This has resulted in hormonal imbalance in their crucial growth years.” According to him, girls particularly undergo ill-effects of this hormonal imbalance in the long term. “Boys may develop insulin resistance syndrome while girls suffer from PCOD and other ailments,” he said. Endocrinologist Dr Himanshu Patil said that hormonal imbalance is also resulting into obesity. “Excess secretion of thyroid results in obesity. Children can hardly express it, but they are under tremendous stress due to the disturbed lifestyle. They need playgrounds, activities, friends for complete growth,” he said. Dr Patil said that children in the 8-10 years age group gaining excessive weight need to be looked after carefully. “If a child is gaining excessive weight despite cycling, running, yoga, exercise and good food habits, endocrinologist should be consulted,” he added. It is important that parents eliminate the possibility of hormonal imbalance in kids by bringing this issue to their paediatrician’s attention, or speak to a growth specialist. “We do have treatment options available and ideally, children should get the treatment early so that they can catch up with their peers. But bringing life back to normalcy is the most important factor,” said Dr Mangtani. According to paediatrician Dr Sanjeev Joshi, teenagers who see major hormonal changes should get vaccinated and be allowed to lead normal life. “Paediatric vaccine trials are going on in full swing. Vaccine for kids is going to be the key for moving towards normalcy. Growing together, being with friends is the most important part of social and physical development of kids. We must bring it back to them,” said Dr Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-normal-affecting-kids-hormonal-health-doctors/articleshow/83904487.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Opinion divided over CET for state board junior colleges||NAGPUR: The optional common entrance test (CET) for admission to state board affiliated junior colleges has evoked mixed reactions from academics. The CET is being held because SSC (Std X) theory exams were cancelled this year due to Covid pandemic. So, to have a benchmark for admissions, the optional CET plan was devised. Some academics in Nagpur feel that having a CET serves no purpose because of the supply-demand matrix prevalent in the region. A senior principal, who did not wish to be identified, said, “The purpose of having a CET is to choose the best available candidates for a limited number of seats. But in Nagpur, we have a huge number of seats vacant at the junior college level. In city alone, we have an average of 18,000 seats vacant, so there is no need for a CET.” While the CET is optional, a few academics feel there will be pressure on them to go with CET. The principal said, “Let’s my school students apply for admission in a college and have really good marks. But that college may feel that the marks have not been appropriately given hence would want students to take a CET. I just feel this will unnecessarily add to the administrative and logistics burden.” TOI spoke to a few more academics, but they too did not wish to speak on record, fearing it may ruffle feathers with both the education department and their peers. A principal from a city junior college said, “I think CET is rather a good way. At least this way we can have a benchmark for students. Surely, everyone is guaranteed admission in junior college because of demand-supply situation, but then there is a race to get admitted in a government-aided section of college as fees are very less. If not, then the student joins the same college and same course but pays higher fee as he/she will fall in unaided seat pool.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/opinion-divided-over-cet-for-state-board-junior-colleges/articleshow/83904552.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said the militias were using the facilities to launch unmanned aerial vehicle attacks against US troops in Iraq. Kirby said the US military targeted three operational and weapons storage facilities — two in Syria and one in Iraq. He described the airstrikes as “defensive,” saying they were launched in response to an “ongoing series of attacks by Iran-backed groups targeting US interests in Iraq.” “The United States took necessary, appropriate, and deliberate action designed to limit the risk of escalation — but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message,” Kirby said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-airstrikes-target-iran-backed-militias-in-syria-iraq/articleshow/83908574.cms||---

Counsel for the organization argued that night duty allowance was part of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations and had not been discontinued over the several decades since 1970s. The notice also termed the decision of the board as violative of Article 14 of the Constitution and discriminatory in nature. It also underlined the fact that due to non-payment of night allowance, the employees were suffering. Demanding removal of the basic pay ceiling, the notice claimed that the board was denying the legally entitled benefits to the staffers who are performing their duties even after the allowance has been withdrawn. The notice also pointed out to the board that it was the decision of the tribunal in 1972 to pay the railway staffers night allowance irrespective of the pay limits or any other classifications, but the same was discontinued last year. Even when the issue was referred to a committee to decide on allowances in 2017, the panel had decided in the favour of the railway employees and asked the Seventh Pay Commission to keep the structure of the night allowance unchanged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/notice-to-rly-board-from-ticket-checking-staff/articleshow/83904579.cms||Soumitra Bose

Environment department has received a proposal from TERI to prepare the EPR Policy on nomination basis, a senior officer said. As per the proposal, the department is not liable to make any payment to TERI, after the EPR policy drafted by TERI is accepted and notified, 1.5% of the amount collected from enforcing EPR is to be paid to the institute for three years, the senior officer said. Apart from drafting the policy, the research institute will collect data, both qualitative and quantitative, on solid waste, particularly plastic waste, from different places. It will also define producer, types of wastes and waste generation, prepare a report on plastic waste generation and current situation and status of implementation of PWM Rules, 2016, (as amended in 2018) and present case studies on the best practices to phase out single use plastics and allied products. Other activities include identifying gaps in waste management in different parts of Goa, carrying out a need analysis, preparing SOPs and training kits for different stakeholders and producers. While preparing the EPR policy, it will consider sustainable and integrated solid waste management and prepare a plan for phasing out of plastics and allied products (single-use and packaging) from Goa. The senior officer said that TERI will also organise a webinar or workshop with stakeholders to provide an overview of the project and to discuss issues on EPR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-moves-closer-to-implement-ban-on-single-use-plastic/articleshow/83904719.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: New drug carrier to reduce toxicity of cancer medicines||VADODARA: There is more relief in store for cancer patients. After developing a novel drug carrier that reduces side-effects of anti-cancer drugs, MS University researchers have bagged another patent for developing another carrier that will reduce the local toxicity of anti-cancer medicines. On the lines of the earlier drug carrier for which they had received the first patent, this drug carrier too will ensure sustained release of the drug which in turn will limit frequent doses. Dr Arpita Desai and her PhD student Priyanka Mathur have been granted Indian product patent for development of chiral drug carrier generated from a synthetic compound. The earlier drug carrier was prepared from a compound that is present in turmeric. “This chiral carrier is expected to have enhanced penetration in the cancerous cell,” said Desai, adding that the carrier is studied for binding with cis-platin, a versatile anticancer drug. Cis-platin is used in treatment of breast cancer, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma, brain tumors and neuroblastoma. “The chiral complex of anti-cancer drug cis-platin—oxaliplatin is known to have better potency than cis-platin analogous and also has lesser side effects. This prompted us to design the chiral corand which can bind cis-platin and its analogues,” she said. The drug carrier has also been studied to bind other anticancer drugs like 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, flutamide among others. The carrier can target the drug to the cancerous tissues. Cancerous cells in the human body have high number of folate receptors. The researchers have developed the drug carrier by attaching folic acid molecules that bind (or get attached) with the folate receptors of the cancerous cells. This makes the anticancer drug effective. “The medicine will be released more to the cancerous cells rather than normal cells. This will reduce the harmful effect of drug on normal cells,” she explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/new-drug-carrier-to-reduce-toxicity-of-cancer-medicines/articleshow/83901419.cms||Prashant Rupera

Rajib, who has not been to the BJP office since the results, is yet to respond to the letter. His posts on social media were critical of the party’s opposition to Trinamool Congress and chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Rajib had clarified his position about imposition of President’s rule in Bengal and said any such decision would not go down well with the people. He even skipped the post-poll meeting of state BJP leaders on June 9, citing personal reasons. Two weeks back, Rajib was seen with Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh at the latter’s home. While Rajib claimed he was still with BJP and visited Ghosh as a courtesy call, the ‘Maa Mati Manush’ sticker on his car raised questions about his political allegiance. He even removed BJP’s lotus symbol from his social media profiles. “He has been invited this time too. Let us see how he responds,” said a Bengal BJP leader. Rajib has sent a letter to BJP’s state organizational secretary Amitava Chakraborty regarding violence on party workers at Domjur, Howrah. A Trinamool leader said: “No decision has so far been taken on Banerjee’s return to the party fold. Seems it will take some time. Meanwhile, he is ready to decide on his political future.” Bengal BJP vice-president Raju Banerjee said: “The state committee will discuss issues such as post-poll violence and preparations for civic and panchayat polls. Apart from state committee members, there would be some invitee guests.” Leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari has been invited as a special speaker. He is likely to speak about the violence over the past one month. “He has been specially invited although no one other than state committee members normally speak at the karyakarini meeting. This time we have called him as an invitee speaker,” a Bengal BJP leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rajib-called-to-bjp-state-panel-meet-tomorrow/articleshow/83904816.cms||Rohit Khanna

So, when he came out of jail recently, after some help from his Muslim friends, Tara Chand took on the name Tahir. He had begun sporting a beard too. On Sunday, after protests from a group of right wing men who accused him of converting to Islam under pressure, Tara Chand shaved off his beard. “I go to both temple and mosque. What is the harm in that? God cannot be two, it’s only one. How does it matter which method we choose?” he asked, still shaken from the backlash he faced from the Hindu group in Mau Khas village of Kithore, Meerut. Chand was released on May 19 last month. His first few days were peaceful, till someone tipped-off the village strongmen. With no member in the family left to stand by him, it was a lone battle for Chand, who finally shaved his beard last week. “I was in jail for 42 months. No one from my family turned up to help me. Usman and his friends helped me and arranged for the funds to fight my case. I spent a lot of time with Usman and others and began offering namaz with them. I also grew a beard like them. But I never got converted,” he said. Jail administration, too, denied any conversion on its premises. Circle officer (CO) of Kithore area, Brijesh Singh, said, “He has not converted legally and denies adopting any other religion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-grows-beard-forced-to-shave-off-after-protests/articleshow/83908597.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||India||Visit to clinics out, now kit to test male fertility in privacy||Men won’t need to leave home and dodge glances at the clinic now for a ‘sperm test’. The biggest challenge in dealing with men’s sexual health, which involves semen analysis, is the very “public” nature of an otherwise private activity — sperm sample collection. But a DIY kit, launched this month by a Bengaluru-based reproductive health and sexual wellness company, promises to break that barrier. Home collection had, so far, been a problem because sperm cells die within minutes of ejaculation, their motility going down 60% within 30 minutes of leaving the body. But this kit keeps the sperm sample safe for up to nine hours after ejaculation. The medium that does so was developed after a decade of research by Dr SS Vasan, cofounder and chief medical officer of Janani, the firm that came up with the kit. </div><br/>“Infertility, whether male or female, is still taboo in India. Men don’t want to come forward to get tested. But semen test is the only biomarker for male reproductive health,” said Nilay Mehrotra, 28, founder of Janani, which will launch the kit in Mumbai within two weeks and expand to other cities after. <br/>A kit like Janani’s, which costs Rs 1,200, could help. “A home kit would encourage men to get tested for male infertility, which makes up 40% if all infertility cases in India …,” said Dr Bharati Dhorepatil, consultant infertility expert, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nova" styleObj="[object Object]" class="" data-ga="within_article-topic_link|topic_Nova" frmappuse="1">Nova</a> IVF Fertility, Pune. “We see that most men think that being able to have intercourse means they are fertile. This is not true.” <br/>Mehrotra found the same. When he tried speaking to men about reproductive health for market research, they shied away. “Men don’t discuss sexual health. If they talk about it with other men, they get mocked,” said Mehrotra. “Men are not ready to believe something may be wrong with their reproductive health. They ask for proof. Even if they believe something is wrong, they are just too shy to come forward and get tested. This made us realise a product like ours was needed … By our calculations, andrology diagnostics in India is a US$3.5-billion market, but largely untapped.” <br/></div><div class="zB_L9"

In an interview, Yadav also said his party has decided to celebrate “Dalit messiah” Ram Vilas Paswan’s birth anniversary to honour his contribution to the state. With Chirag having already gone public with his disappointment with the BJP’s silence over his feud with his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras for control of LJP, Tejashwi Yadav alleged the BJP has “disposed of ” and “abandoned” most of its old allies after coming to power and gaining maximum from them. The RJD leader said his party has always stood by Ram Vilas Paswan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/join-fight-against-golwalkar-ideas-rjd-tells-chirag-paswan/articleshow/83908612.cms||---
---||India||Lower bid price for roads worries govt||NEW DELHI: The recent trend of highway contractors quoting 20-25% less than the bid price in many projects has become a new concern for government agencies and there is a fear whether players quoting such low price would complete works. The issue even came up at the parliamentary standing committee meeting last week where the members asked the highway ministry and NHAI to find if anything is going wrong. Sources said some of the MPs in the panel had flagged whether the government estimates for projects were inflated or fly-by-night players were flooding the bidding process. Officials said in some cases more than two dozen players are bidding for each project and that’s unusual. “One reason is that the government has relaxed the bidding norms to increase the basket of eligible bidders and even the provision of additional bank guarantee or performance security for those quoting abnormally low prices for works has been done away with. Another reason for more bids could also be because there is less work in other sectors,” said an official. The relaxation for performance security was made under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme of the government in November last year. “Now it’s emerging as a concern. But the decision has to be taken by the finance ministry,” said another official. However, NHAI chairman S S Sandhu said after awarding projects NHAI will not compromise on quality and pace of project delivery. “We have made the monthly video recording of work using drones mandatory for all new contracts and that will be a game changer. Neither can the contractor nor our own officials influence the ground reality. Everyone in the chain will be held accountable for their acts and performance,” Sandhu told TOI. He added the highways authority has also undertaken strict monitoring of quality works. “We have taken action against highway builders and consultants where they have been found responsible for poor quality work. Every entity concerned about its reputation will do a good job,” Sandhu said. The NHAI has started deputing independent teams from its headquarters to carry out frequent quality checks of works at sites for projects which private players have bagged, quoting “abnormally low bids”. It has put in place a system for random quality checks, once in every 2-3 months, during the construction period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lower-bid-price-for-roads-worries-govt/articleshow/83908630.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||States adopt novel ways to weed out fake ration cards||NEW DELHI: Different state governments are taking innovative measures to weed out fake or duplicate ration cards and extend benefits to the deserving. While Jharkhand has started deleting ration cards automatically by linking this to birth and death records, four other states have started convergence of different social welfare benefits that the poor get to identify the right beneficiary .A food ministry official said Jharkhand is implementing its intervention across states and that’s one of the best mechanisms to weed out beneficiaries who are no more. They said UP, Himachal, Rajasthan and Andhra are using the convergence method to find out those who have been left out of the National Food Security Act coverage. “Since NFSA beneficiaries are economically weaker, they get covered under different social welfare schemes. Once you put all data at one place, you can easily make out who all are eligible under NFSA. If this convergence of benefits is done using the unique identities like Aadhaar number, the unqualified beneficiaries can also be detected,” said an official. So far the state governments have weeded out nearly 4.4 crore bogus ration cards in the past eight years. Early this month, the food ministry had asked the state governments to launch a “special drive” to identify nearly 1.97 crore poor, particularly from the most vulnerable groups, who can get ration cards to avail subsidised foodgrain every month under NFSA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/states-adopt-novel-ways-to-weed-out-fake-ration-cards/articleshow/83908635.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||Rural areas with 65% of population got only 51% of vaccine doses in May, June||Rural areas got only 51% of vaccine doses between May 1 and June 23 though they account for 65% of the population, shows data presented by the government to the Supreme Court and census projections of the current population. Interestingly, the skew is more pronounced in the poor and less urbanised states with a significant rural population as compared to richer states with relatively higher urbanisation. For instance, in Odisha, 81% of the population is in rural areas share but only 54% of the vaccination during this nearly two months period was in the villages. This translates into a gap of 27 percentage points between the rural area’s population share and share in vaccination, the highest gap among large states. Similarly, in Madhya Pradesh, which has the second largest mismatch in rural area’s share in population and vaccination, 71% of the state’s rural population were allocated only 45% share in vaccination during this period, a 26 percentage points. Other states that have also registered a significant gap in rural area’s share in population and vaccination are Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Telangana (see graphic). For all of them, the gap between rural area’s share in population and vaccination was 20 percentage points or more. Among 21 large states and the national capital, there are 13 that have more than 60% of their population living in rural areas. Except for Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jammu & Kashmir, the other ten have more than a 10 percentage point gap in rural area’s share in population and vaccination. For these three states, the gap is less than 10. The data shows that this gap is lower in more industrialised richer states. For instance, the gap is less than 10 for Maharashtra and Gujarat, where the rural population is just slightly higher than the proportion of people living in urban areas. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala, which have a higher share of urban areas in their population, the rural areas have been allocated more vaccines than their ratio in the population. For instance, in Kerala the share of rural areas is 28% in population and 73% in vaccination. One possible explanation of this skew could be the lack of availability of health care facilities in the rural areas of poor states and this indicates that 100% vaccine coverage may not be entirely dependent on vaccine supplies alone, which the government has claimed will be ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rural-areas-with-65-of-population-got-only-51-of-vaccine-doses-in-may-june/articleshow/83908659.cms||Atul Thakur
---||Kolkata||Kolkata vaccine scam scanner on key civic officials||KOLKATA: The Special Investigation Team probing the fake vaccine scam has trained its lens on a section of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) officials for their alleged involvement with scam accused Debanjan Deb. The civic body is also looking into how Deb, who went around claiming to be a KMC joint commissioner, used KMC banners, insignia and even holograms and the role that some civic employees may have had in helping him carry out the charade. Apart from KMC fake banners, holograms, letterheads, logos and leaflets, investigators have also unearthed a huge number of stamps of various departments like I&CA, PWD and West Bengal State Election Commission. The SIT is trying to find out how Deb had “direct access” to KMC documents that he later faked. “His proximity to some KMC officials, civic contractors and policemen is being probed. He used these contacts to further his plans to cheat traders, institutional heads and even his own relatives and friends,” said an officer. Sleuths said Deb had perfected the art of photoshopping using the exact font and language used in correspondences by KMC. The cops had found old files that appear to be from the buildings department but will need to check if they are genuine. They have also recovered KMC tenders issued between the middle of last year and May this year. Deb also faked the signature of a KMC official. This helped the conman to open a bank account in the name of KMC. What the civic top brass is puzzled about is how did the conman manage to use the official’s forged signature to open the account when it had been mandated that the signature of the KMC controller of municipal finance and accounts (CMFA) was imperative to open any bank account. On June 22, when a fake camp at Kasba hit the headlines, a senior KMC official was stripped of two major departments. It is not known if the development was mere coincidence or a fallout of the scam. The cops said the accused had created fake email accounts with domain names similar to KMC including deputy manager@kmcgov.org. “He used to create these accounts using Google g suite,” said an officer. Investigators said Deb wrote letters to various government agencies in official language and would put receipt stamps on those letters to convince people. KMC is itself probing the role of some health officials. “Despite having information about the camp, a senior health official didn’t keep his seniors in the loop,” said a KMC source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vaccine-scam-scanner-on-key-civic-officials/articleshow/83902648.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He said the data of phase two and three trial of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on two to 18 years age group is expected by September. The vaccine can be available for children in India around that time, he said. “If the Pfizer vaccine gets approval before that, it can also be an option for children,” he said. Underscoring that there has been a major loss in studies in the last one-and-half years on account of the pandemic, the AIIMS chief said, “Schools have to be reopened and vaccination can play an important role in that”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jabs-for-kids-will-help-reopen-schools-aiims-chief-guleria/articleshow/83908688.cms||---

Out of them, 19 or 13% succumbed to the infection. In contrast, the first wave had a mortality rate of 0.3% as only one out of 359 pregnant women admitted lost her life. Dr Sushma Shah, head of gynaecology department at SVP Hospital, said the second wave was marked by more infectivity and greater lung complications. “It was brutal for pregnant women. Most suffered from irreversible lung damage, sepsis, myocarditis and kidney complications,” she said. The trend was also witnessed in other cities — at New Civil Hospital and SMIMER in Surat, the fatality rate of pregnant women with positivity was 2.8% (nine deaths out of 312 cases), which rose to 23% as 19 out of 84 women succumbed to the pandemic. Dr Sarla Bhatia cited the new Covid variant and late hospitalisation as primary reasons. Dr Ashish Gokhale, head of gynaecology and obstetrics department at the SSG Hospital, said although vaccination is not recommended for pregnant women, women who are planning for conception or taking infertility treatment should go for vaccines without hesitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mortality-rate-of-guj-pregnant-women-rose-to-13-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83908712.cms||Radha Sharma

While she even lost vision of her left eye due to the black fungus, she can take relief at the fact that her face did not get disfigured after surgery. In majority of MM cases involving optics, eyeballs of patients are removed. But a ENT surgeon at GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri has started adopting a technique through which patients do not have to carry such permanent scars on their face. The recent surge of MM has witnessed lot of patients losing their vision and other body parts. “Till date, we have operated three such patients including two females and one male through orbital clearance of fungus with eyeball preservation,” said Dr Hiren Soni, ENT surgeon at GMERS Hospital, Gotri. “But using the nasal endoscopic approach, we breach the orbital shield and without putting any external scar, we remove the entire disease,” said Soni, who has used this approach for the first time in Vadodara and probably in the entire state. “After removing the disease with endoscopic approach and preserving the muscles which are good and the eyeballs which are not involved, we can make sure that we fight the disease as well as give a better cosmetic outcome,” he said, adding that only fungal debris and necrotic (dead) parts are removed while the eyeball is preserved. “After exenteration (removal of the eyeball) which is the standard treatment, the patient has a permanent scar. In contrast, with endoscopic orbital clearance, there is no such scar. In fact, a layman would not be able to recognise difference between the two eyes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/woman-loses-vision-to-black-fungus-face-saved/articleshow/83901505.cms||---

Deb, a lawyer, is also a sixtime MLA from Budge Budge, five times as a Trinamool Congress candidate. The 26-member body, which enrols all state advocates, also has a TMC Rajya Sabha MP and a KMC board of administrators member, among its members. “All we seek is fairness and neutrality. We understand this is unprecedented (in Bengal) but we could not be mute spectators anymore,” Deb told TOI. In June 25 letter, citing the manner in which the Narada case was dealt with, Deb claimed Bindal’s conduct indicated that he “did not have any regard for judicial propriety and has committed a mockery of the judicial conscience”. On May 24, Justice Arindam Sinha had written a letter, in which he took serious exception to the manner in which the Narada bail matter was handled by the division bench. Deb’s letter also refers to this. The Narada case matter is currently being heard by a five-judge bench headed by Justice Bindal. “The fact that the fivejudge bench headed by Justice Bindal has allowed repeated requests by CBI to file its affidavits, but has declined the request made by Mamata Banerjee (chief minister) and Moloy Ghatak (law minister) to file affidavits and contest the matter where serious allegations have been made against them is a clear sign of Justice Bindal’s apparent bias,” Deb’s letter mentions. Hearing an appeal by Banerjee and Ghatak, the Supreme Court on Friday had asked Calcutta HC to accept fresh applications from them and hear their pleas on June 29 in the Narada case, setting aside the Calcutta HC’s June 9 order refusing their affidavits. Deb also referred to the case that the CM had filed before the HC, challenging victory of Suvendu Adhikari in the assembly polls from Nandigram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bengal-bar-council-seeks-acting-cjs-ouster/articleshow/83908746.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

The five backlog deaths are those which occurred during April and May but remained uncounted because the hospitals did not update them on the state health department’s Covid portal. With this, the count of such deaths has mounted to 111. On Saturday, the number of new cases had dropped to 11, the lowest in 112 days, and no death was reported. As many as 13 more patients recovered on Sunday. The number of active cases was 267. Meanwhile, black fungus infection or mucormycosis also claimed the lives of two patients, including a city resident. Both the patients — a 55-year-old man from Bareilly and 60-year-old from Lucknow — were under treatment at KGMU. Three more mucormycosis patients were admitted to KGMU, while three others were discharged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-five-more-backlog-deaths-virus-kills-1-grips-23-more-in-a-day/articleshow/83908749.cms||---

In a social media post tagging PM Modi, Bose claimed his family had handed over Netaji’s memorabilia to the government for it to be kept at Red Fort and not to be “shifted around”. “Netaji’s cap, uniform, sword have been removed and even the Historian who spent sleepless night to make it, has no clue about it. Plz look into this….Bose family had handed over #Netaji's historic cap to Hon’ble PM-Shri @narendramodi ji to be kept at #RedFort Museum ¬ to be shifted around. Request Narendra Modiji to instruct placing cap in its original place,” he said, with a ‘NetajisCapMissing’ hashtag. Even as the allegations caused a flutter among history aficionados, Culture ministry clarified that allegations about artefacts related to Netaji going “missing” were “completely untrue”. “Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s cap and sword are completely safe. Twenty four items related to Netaji were given on loan by ASI to Victoria Memorial Kolkata. These were given as a part of Netaji’s 125th birth centenary celebrations. They will be brought back soon,” Union culture and tourism minister Prahlad Patel clarified on Twitter. Additionally, Culture ministry said, “These artefacts were loaned from Red Fort Museum by ASI to Victoria Memorial after following a proper procedure in which a formal MoU was signed between the two organisations. The MoU is valid for 6 months and further extendable by a year. These artefacts were sent to Kolkata with proper escort and insurance.” Government officials also said loaning and borrowing of antiquities and exhibits is a regular exercise between museums and ASI would inspect all loaned objects during the loan period. Kapil Kumar, senior fellow at Teen Murti and the historian engaged by the government to set up the Netaji museum at Red Fort, however, blamed the bureaucracy at culture ministry for “mismanaging” the museums and artefacts. Speaking to TOI over phone, Kumar said, “Yes, there is a procedure to give things on loan, but when things are removed from showcases, a note is left there, as per worldwide practise, saying items have been temporarily removed. This has not been done. Secondly, why were the PMO and minister not informed about the removal of these objects. Also, the alleged six month loan period to VMH expired on June 23 and with the Red Fort Museums now open, visitors are now coming in to find empty displays.” Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior ministry official said, “All Netaji artefacts on display at Victoria Memorial are in keeping with Netaji’s stature and have been accorded full security. It is a beautiful exhibition. Artefacts loaned by ASI will return to their designated spot at the Red Fort Museum by July 16.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/netaji-cap-missing-from-museum-says-kin-is-now-online/articleshow/83908751.cms||Swati Mathur
---||Business||E-commerce norms on global lines: Government||NEW DELHI: The government has drawn upon the evolving global architecture while drafting the proposed e-commerce rules, and said the plan is based on the need to enhance the enforcement powers to catch up with the EU and countries like the US, Australia, Japan and Singapore, which have strict regulations to rein in errant players. In December 2020, for instance, the European Commission proposed a digital regulation package consisting of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which seek to put curbs on large platforms or “gatekeepers”. Similarly, in the US, apart from existing federal antitrust laws that discourage anti-competitive behaviour by companies, legislations have been proposed to rein in alleged monopolistic behaviour of big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, government sources said (see graphic). The consumer affairs department’s move also follows concerns within the government that the actions of e-tailers were not in sync with the regulatory prescription, an issue on which the domestic traders lobby has been vocal about, sources told TOI. “The government wants to put in place a structure to govern the e-commerce industry in India because currently there is none,” said Naveen Malpani, who leads the FMCG proactive at Grant Thornton Bharat. “It wants to create a level playing field and push the concept of Atmanirbhar Bharat. One of the new draft rules, for instance, requires an e-commerce company to also show made-in-India products alongside foreign ones to consumers.” The revised Indian Consumer Protection (E-commerce Rules), 2020 launched on June 21 include several proposals from banning “flash sales” that benefit only preferred sellers to holding an online marketplace responsible for the actions of a seller on its platform. Apart from a host of compliance requirements, the proposals also require e-commerce players to ensure that none of their related parties and associated enterprises are enlisted as sellers for sale to consumers directly. “If the draft rules are formalised, they will have a big impact on companies such as Walmart-backed Flipkart and Amazon because they may have indirect stakes in some of the sellers on their platforms,” said Malpani. A senior executive at a large e-tailer, however, told TOI that the rules should consider the Indian context. “We license out our private label brands to other sellers and guide them with consumer insights,” he said. “In several cases, goods have to be imported because India does not have the manufacturing capability of such products at that cost. If the government wants to push made-in-India products, why doesn’t it open up multibrand retail with the condition that only made-in-India products can be sold.” Industry experts said the government needs to tread with caution before formalising the rules. “Inventory model for e-commerce is allowed in other countries, while it is forbidden in India. Flash sales are not banned elsewhere in the world,” said Arvind Singhal, founder of retail consultancy, Technopak. “One has to understand that the Indian market is unique and so the rules have to be tailored accordingly rather than copy pasted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-commerce-norms-on-global-lines-govt/articleshow/83908764.cms||---
---||Business||Has bankruptcy law failed homebuyers?||NEW DELHI: Four years ago, Kanupriya was among the 20,000 homebuyers in Jaypee Infratech’s project in Noida who was hoping that an early resolution will help her take possession of the apartment she had booked in 2012. She is still waiting as the resolution process – monitored directly by the Supreme Court – seems to have entered the final leg. Jaypee may be the most high-profile case where the hunt for a resolution applicant continues but there are several other real estate projects across the country where homebuyers continue to face uncertainty. Five years after the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was notified, only eight resolution plans for real estate sector have been approved although some 205 cases had been admitted until March 2021, Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India data showed. That translates into a success rate of under 4%, making it the worst-performing sector, barring computer and related activity (see chart). This is despite the stakes being much higher. Unlike other sectors, where it is banks and operational creditors such as suppliers who drag companies to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), in realty there is the additional challenge of protecting the interests of homebuyers, who invest their life-time savings. No wonder, this is the only area where even the government made an exception in bumping up homebuyers from the category of operational creditors to financial creditors — giving them an equal say in deciding the new resolution applicant. “Unlike in other sectors, there are more complexities in real estate. It’s not just IBC, which usually has institutional creditors and suppliers. RERA, which means protecting buyers who may have a bank loan, is another case in point. Moreover, the rules keep evolving, which makes it difficult to comply with newer guidelines when a developer looks to take over a project. Basically, these regulations and guidelines are still work in progress and need to evolve further. That said, they are still major upgrades over the previous lack of regulation and redressal mechanisms,” said Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO at Anarock Capital. For banks, the primary focus of the resolution exercise is to minimise the hit that they have to take on their loans and maximise the gains. In contrast, homebuyers want a more stable company to take over the company even if it means that lenders have to take a haircut. What has complicated matters is a fall in real estate prices, making the project unviable for resolution applicants. “Projects normally won’t be commercially viable if the cost of construction is more than receivables and financial creditors consist of financial institutions and homebuyers. In many cases, funds have been diverted and the corporate debtor (company) doesn’t have sufficient money to construct the units. In such cases, projects are in a limbo. Besides, the market doesn’t have adequate liquidity to support real estate cases,” says Chandra Prakash, a resolution professional dealing with three real estate projects. There are other complications when land is owned by more than one entity and it needs to be combined. “In such cases, project insolvency laws should be applicable whereas in IBC we don’t have project or group insolvency (provisions),” Prakash added. The problems with resolution have resulted in suggestions for a review of provisions. Former Oriental Bank of Commerce CMD Mukesh Kumar Jain suggests a hybrid model for real estate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/has-bankruptcy-law-failed-homebuyers/articleshow/83908777.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab’s 2-week death ratio touches 6.23%, monthly highest ever at 5.29%||CHANDIGARH: Even a month after Covid-19 cases started to decline following the second wave of infection attaining its peak in mid-May, Punjab’s case fatality rate is still on an alarming climb. The case fatality rate has picked up pace in the last two weeks by scaling to 6.23% — six patients dying out of 100 — while Punjab’s death ratio or the proportion of people infected with the virus dying in June has touched 5.29% — five deaths out of 100. Both are at an all-time high. Though the number of daily deaths has fallen in the state, it is not in proportion to the drop in case tally. This is a cause of worry for the government. From June 1 to 26, 1,429 of 26,979 people infected with the virus died, pushing the deaths per million population to 533 against the national average of 294. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the virus has claimed 15,979 lives in the state. Health department’s data reveals that the highest daily case fatality rate of 7.05% of the period was recorded on June 21, when 24 out of 340 persons infected with the virus lost their lives. Comorbidity, late reporting key reasons for high death rate, says nodal officerThe fatality rate was 6.68% on June16, 5.91% on June 15, 5.72% on June 12, 5.24% on June 14 and 5.23% on June 24. Barring two days, the daily fatality rate was recorded above 4% during the 26-day period. In the last seven days, 176 deaths were reported of — 18 from Jalandhar, 19 from Ferozepur, 15 from Sangrur, 11 from Mansa and 10 from Tarn Taran. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar maintained that there has been a drastic drop in fresh cases but the drop in the number of deaths has not been in the same proportion. He added that the reasons behind Covid fatality during the second wave and first wave remain the same. Comorbidity plus people reporting late to hospitals remain the key reasons for the high death rate, he said. The government is trying to spread awareness among people to seek treatment even if they experience mild symptoms. Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president of Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (Sipher), held irrational self-medication, including taking steroids for Covid symptoms, as another possible reason for high death rate in the state. “Selfmedication leads to delayed access to healthcare, which can prove fatal,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjabs-4-week-death-ratio-touches-6-23-monthly-highest-ever-at-5-29/articleshow/83908790.cms||Vinod Kumar

---||Business||Haryana government pays IL&FS Rs 1,925 crore metro project dues||MUMBAI: IL&FS has recovered Rs 1,925 crore from Haryana Shehari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), the state’s urban planning agency, as interim termination payment in the Gurgaon Metro Project case. This payment follows the Supreme Court’s March 26, 2021 order that ruled in favour of IL&FS in the metro case. IL&FS’s subsidiaries Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon (RMGL) and Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon South (RMGSL) had developed the projects. The Supreme Court order bodes well for IL&FS in its recovery attempt from state governments that have been holding payments after the group went bankrupt. For instance, IL&FS has around Rs 500-crore claims on the government of Jharkhand as annuity on the road projects. The SC order said that the money must be deposited in an escrow account and appropriation would be subject to further orders of the NCLAT or any other competent legal authority. The benefit of the payment will flow to the lenders to the project. Andhra Bank (now a part of Union Bank) was the lead bank in RMGL, along with Punjab National Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of India and Dena Bank (now a part of Bank of Baroda). Canara Bank is the lead bank in RMGSL, along with Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank (now part of Union Bank of India), Punjab & Sind Bank, Central Bank of India and IIFC (UK). “This ruling will set a precedence for other projects wherein infrastructure companies, including IL&FS, are seeking payment of their legitimate duescontracts with various state governments,” the company spokesperson said. The Rs 1,925-crore recovery forms part of the Rs 61,000-crore recovery estimated by the Uday Kotak-led board of IL&FS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/haryana-govt-pays-ilfs-1-9k-cr-metro-project-dues/articleshow/83908816.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||50% of Bengaluru’s eligible population has got at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine||BENGALURU: While the spotlight is on the more virulent variants of the SARS-Cov2 virus, Bengaluru is racing past other Indian cities in attempting to mitigate the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 infections through vaccination: The total number of vaccine doses administered in the tech-capital is all set to touch the 60-lakh mark. Vaccine doses administered as on Sunday, 6pm   Cities Vaccinated (including 1st and 2nd dose)   Delhi 73.39 lakh   Bengaluru (BBMP+Bengaluru Urban) 58.77 lakh   Mumbai 53.04 lakh   Ahmedabad 35.23 lakh   Kolkata 31.09 lakh   Chennai 29.43 lakh   Jaipur 27.14 lakh   Hyderabad 23.22 lakh   Source: Co-WIN dashboardData from the Co-Win dashboard on Sunday evening revealed that the Bengaluru Urban district (including Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike-BBMP) had administered 58.8 lakh doses (49.9 lakh first doses and 8.9 lakh second doses). The targeted eligible population for vaccination in Bengaluru is 99 lakh and, of this, more than half of the adults have already received at least one dose of the vaccine. While Bengaluru lagged behind Delhi (where all its 11 districts had administered 73.39 lakh doses), it has performed better than other cities including Mumbai (53 lakh doses) and Ahmedabad (35 lakh doses). Coming at a time when vaccine hesitancy and supply are still major challenges across the country, Bengaluru’s turnaround is attributed to pro-active government officials and enterprising private healthcare sector. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, who has been aggressively pushing and monitoring the inoculation drives, told The Times of India: “If more people are vaccinated it will act as a bulwark against further spread of the virus in future. Increasing vaccination coverage would reduce pressure on the overwhelmed medical infrastructure. We need to act fast instead of waiting for another wave to strike.” But how did Bengaluru, which saw complaints of vaccine shortage and long queues, inoculate so many people compared to other cities? Gupta attributed it to a combination of factors. “Citizens’ interest in vaccine coupled with their capacity to pay for the same, the presence of major private healthcare service providers who also bought stocks on their own, willingness on the part of corporates and industries to pay for vaccination for their staff, support from apartment associations, an alliance of private donors and philanthropists to help vaccination among the marginalized sections and hard-working healthcare personnel have ensured that vaccination coverage is maximum,” he said.. Though there were disruptions in vaccine supplies between April 20 and May 20, the supply side was streamlined and the BBMP set a target to vaccinate 25 lakh persons over 30 days. “We followed it up by making a rainbow coalition of all the stakeholders. We set up special camps near workplaces and apartment complexes to ensure maximum coverage,” Gupta added. The civic agency also roped in community and religious leaders to dispel myths about vaccination. Another IAS officer who has played a key role in pushing the city’s vaccination numbers is Bengaluru Urban district deputy commissioner J Manjunath. The district, excluding BBMP areas, with a target population of around 8 lakh, has already administered 6.31 lakh first doses and one lakh second doses. “Apart from one city municipal council and six town municipal councils, the district comprises 93 gram panchayats spread over 1,038 villages. It was a challenge to convince people to get vaccinated, but we were persistent. In fact, we started sending vehicles to the semi-urban areas to bring priority groups including disabled persons to the vaccination sites. This apart, camps were opened in all industrial areas including Electronics City, Bommasandra, Jigani and Peenya,” Manjunath said. Bengaluru’s vaccination pace has also increased optimism among health experts fearing the third wave. Epidemiologist Dr Giridhara R Babu said: “It is a sense of relief. By reducing the gap between vaccinated and those not-vaccinated, we can prevent fatalities and reduce severity in the next wave. We need to focus on vaccinating the urban poor, vulnerable sections and temporary dwellers and this can be achieved with micro-planning.” At the policy-level, deputy chief minister C N Ashwath Narayan ensured that the vaccination centres are shifted out of the government health facilities and special camps are operated by the urban primary health centres (UPHCs). In fact, some of the UPHCs have administered more than 20k vaccines each so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/50-of-bengalurus-eligible-population-has-got-at-least-one-dose/articleshow/83908827.cms||Rakesh Prakash
---||Bengaluru||School fees row: Parents demand permanent regulatory committee in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The row over school fees rumbled on, with a parents’ association in Bengaluru demanding that the government form a permanent fee regulation committee just as it has done for engineering courses. The parents’ association pointed out that several states such as Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan have formed such committees headed by retired judges. For example, in Tamil Nadu, every school submits an audit of its expenses to the committee, which comprises schools’ education directors. It is headed by a retired judge. The committee then fixes fees for three years, based on details provided. Parents can also approach the committee to lodge complaints. In 2016, the Rajasthan government introduced a rule mandating a 10-member committee comprising five parents, three teachers, the principal and a member from the management for every school. The committee decides the fee, depending on expenditure. The government has no role to play. In Maharashtra, fees are regulated through Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011. Schools can hike fees to a maximum 15% once in two years. At least 25% of parents can appeal against a hike approved by the PTA executive committee before a divisional regulatory committee. Sources say schools in these states are charging fees under various heads and the systems are not foolproof. However, educationists and parents in Karnataka argue that the progress made by these states is worth emulating. “The advantage is that there is someone to crosscheck. This has not been happening in Karnataka for years,” said Chidananda PE, member, Voice of Parents. “While other states have taken control of the situation, Karnataka is allowing schools to dictate terms and to loot parents.” Yogananda, member, Karnataka Private School Parents Association’s Coordination Committee, said: “We urge the government to form such a committee so that clashes do not occur in future. Schools do not disclose the fees. There’s no break-up of tuition fees and other fees. There’s no transparency. We get complaints every day from fellow parents on how their children are not allowed to attend classes because they haven’t paid fees.” Niranjanaradhya VP, senior fellow, Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, believes a committee to decide fees is the “only solution available” to break what he called was a deadlock between managements and parents. “It provides a more transparent and justiciable mechanism to resolve the complex issue. Many states have already done that, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan among others,” he said. However, private schools’ association say such a committee will infringe on the rights of private schools. D Shashi Kumar, secretary, Association of Primary and Secondary Schools of Karnataka, said the policy of having a fee fixation committee has already been challenged in courts in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. State plans panelMeanwhile, in an interlocutory application, the state government told the high court that it proposes to constitute a committee chaired by a retired high court judge to resolve the issue vis-a-vis the academic year 2021-22. In the IA, filed in response to petitions challenging last year’s 30% fee cut, the government claimed that the committee would be recommendatory in nature and will consider views of parents, managements and other stakeholders. "Government cannot interfere and fix fees in private schools. It infringes on our rights. Parents are not owners of schools to fix fees. There have been various Supreme Court orders which protect the rights of private educational institutions. The Karnataka government can fix fees for engineering colleges because there’s a government quota in private colleges," said D Shashi Kumar secretary, association of primary and secondary schools of Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/school-fees-row-parents-demand-permanent-regulatory-committee-in-bengaluru/articleshow/83908854.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka government mulls special vaccine drive to jab parents of kids under 10 years||BENGALURU: The state government is planning to launch a special drive to inoculate parents of small children (under 10 years) in the wake of reports that a possible third wave of Covid-19 infection could impact those below 18 years of the age the most. Authorities said the government could declare parents of small children as a priority group for the purpose. Plans are afoot to even inoculate children in select categories. “We plan to identify parents of children below 10 years and vaccinate them on priority,” K Sudhakar, health minister, said. “We will identify children with comorbidities and a decision will be taken to vaccinate depending on approvals.” The comment comes in the wake of the Centre’s submission in the Supreme Court on Saturday, stating pharmaceutical company Zydus Cadila has concluded clinical trials of its vaccine on children between 12 and 18 years age and that doses will soon be commercially available. Dr S Ravi, nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, said Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for children above two years is expected to be ready for use in September. Sudhakar said the government is taking all possible precautions to blunt a surge and is planning to set up 80-bed paediatrics wards in all district hospitals besides ensuring routine health checks for children. But experts said fears of children being exclusively vulnerable are unfounded. They say there is no scientific evidence to prove there will be a third wave. “The fact that those below 18 years have not yet been vaccinated is the only argument to say children will be more vulnerable,” said Dr S Vijaya, retired IISc professor and virologist. “There is no scientific basis to say children alone are vulnerable. In fact, this age group is the least vulnerable as most who were infected during the first and second wave were asymptomatic.” Experts also sought to dispel fears that the vaccine would not work against virus variants such as Delta Plus and Kappa and that there would be breakthrough (infection even after two doses) infections. “Vaccines will work against all variants as they were prepared to neutralise the founder variant that originally came from Wuhan,” said virologist Dr T Jacob John. “Subsequent variants are all of the same lineage. As for breakthrough infections, rare cases could occur as the vaccine protects against severe disease but not against infection.” Dr John suggested a booster dose to protect against such reinfection. Raghav Varadarajan, an IISc professor who is in the process of producing a vaccine for Covid-19, said: “Antibodies generated by existing vaccines show a reduction in neutralisation against variants like Delta and likely Delta Plus as well. However, existing evidence suggests that vaccination protects against severe disease. Recent data from the US indicates that a vast majority of current deaths are among unvaccinated people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-government-mulls-special-vaccine-drive-to-jab-parents-of-kids-under-10-years/articleshow/83908858.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

A better comparison with Accenture will be possible when their April-June quarter numbers come out. “As we think about attrition, now it’s ticked up to pre-Covid levels in a hot market although not the highest we’ve ever seen,” chief executive Julie Sweet said in a post earnings conference call with analysts last week. Sweet explained that attrition had gone up due to a sustained demand for services from clients who are looking to transform their business. “The dynamics in the market we are seeing are not only recovery from the lower spending pattern at the onset of the pandemic, but a more sustained growth in demand as companies race to modernise and accelerate their digital initiatives with compressed transformation,” she said. Accenture added 32,000 people in the last quarter, taking its headcount to 569,000 as of May 31. It awarded 117,000 promotions year-to-date, including almost 1,200 promotions to managing directors. The company said it has vaccinated 50,000 of its employees, their families and contractors in India till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/accenture-attrition-up-on-high-demand/articleshow/83908915.cms||Avik Das

Just as the 110-room property was beginning to get a foothold on Varca Beach, the pandemic struck. “The owner (of this property) could not reopen it after lockdown. The monthly electricity bill alone was in lakhs and he decided to shut shop permanently,” Lords’ senior VP (operations) Rishi Puri told TOI. This and suspension of operations by Hyatt Regency Mumbai are not isolated cases. Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) says 40% of hotels and restaurants have closed permanently. Industry tracker STR’s data shows 270 branded hotels (20,000 rooms) have temporarily stopped operations in India. “The number of establishments shutting down would have gone up by another 10-20% due to the second wave. Most don’t have working capital and loans from risk-averse banks are hard to come by,” FHRAI’s Pradeep Shetty said. Industry ‘survivors’ are pinning their hopes on the revival in travel seen after the waning of the second Covid wave and praying there is no third wave. Vacation-starved Indians have started driving to nearby leisure destinations. Big chains like Tata group’s Taj, Oberoi and ITC Hotels also have their fingers crossed as they had depleted significant reserves to survive the pandemic and need to replenish the same for future shocks. Taj parent Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) reported a loss of Rs 720 crore in FY21 with revenue falling 62% to Rs1,740 crore. India currently has1.4 lakh branded and over 26 lakh unbranded hotel rooms, according to hospitality consulting service Hotelivate, which puts the combined debt of the sector at Rs 50,000 crore. Contractual breaches will increasingly lead to disputes between property owners and operators (brand that has lent its name to the property). Hotelivate estimates the total revenue typically generated by India’s branded and organised sector is about Rs 37,000 crore and the loss of revenue last year could be between Rs11,000 and 30,000 crore. In such a situation, several asset owners and investors under financial stress will look for exit or reducing debt that will accelerate M&As (mergers & acquisitions), says Mandeep Lamba, real estate services company HVS Anarock’s president (south Asia). Job losses and pay cuts have hit this industry badly. “25-33% people employed in the sector have lost jobs and some could have been laid off permanently,” said a hotelier. Pre-Covid India used to attract about a crore foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) annually. “During 2020, FTAs numbered about 27 lakh compared to almost1.1 crore in 2019,” according to IHCL’s FY21 annual report. FHRAI said, since April 2021 revenue hasn’t crossed 8-10% of April 2019 level. Hotel tariffs take a long time to climb up after black swan events. “Covid has pushed back hospitality by four years in terms of occupancy and five years in terms of tariffs,” said Hotelivate founderchairman Manav Thadani. Given the long recovery period, it remains to be seen which all hotels will survive. Hotels run in properties owned by diversified groups with favourable debt-equity ratios will emerge from this perfect storm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/distressed-hotels-pin-hopes-on-travel-revival/articleshow/83908922.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Blind teacher takes learning to kids’ doorstep||VADODARA: Hetalkumar Kothari can’t see, but he has set up an example for others to look up to. Most teachers are grappling with the challenges that come along with the online mode of teaching. While majority of those working in the rural areas, where the internet hasn’t reached till now or smart phones are not owned by many, complain about visiting remote localities to conduct physical classes. But Kothari, a blind 50-year-old government primary teacher, handles both — online and physical classes — with aplomb. He even travels to students’ homes in faraway villages to spread the light of knowledge in these dark pandemic times. Kothari lost his eyesight in an accident in a chemical unit in 1995. He used to work as a chemist at a unit in Ankleshwar, but blindness forced him to let go of the job. But Kothari did not let go of hope and tried his hand at new things like physiotherapy. He even treated patients for some time before he got the job as a government primary teacher. Kothari was posted in Khangela village school in Dahod in 1999 and has been working there since then. The village is located on the Gujarat-Madhya Pradesh border. He teaches standard three students there. When schools shut down due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Kothari along with his other colleagues started online classes as well as ‘falia shikshan’ where teachers went to clusters of hamlets and taught students living there. The biggest challenge for Kothari was to reach these hamlets as they are located on mounds or in remote areas. “I got the help of a colleague who used to take me to the ‘falias’ and drop me back. Smart phones have also made things very easy for us. I extensively use new applications that run on voice commands to teach,” he said. Kothari said that villagers have also been helpful. “They arrange for small things we need. They also ensure that students gather in time for my class,” he said. According to Kothari, limited access to smartphones is one of the biggest problems faced by the tribal students. “Very few from the tribal areas have smartphones. Those who own a smartphone are the ones who travel for work. So in these areas, it’s much better if you reach out to students at their homes and opt for a face-to-face method of teaching,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/blind-teacher-takes-learning-to-kids-doorstep/articleshow/83901536.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Bengaluru||Ayurvedic medicine popular in Andhra Pradesh now at Hampi||An ayurvedic concoction from Andhra Pradesh, widely believed to prevent Covid-19 infections, has made its way to Karnataka. The medicine, approved by the government of Andhra Pradesh, is being distributed by Govindananda Saraswati Swamiji, pontiff of Swarna Hampi in Vijayanagar district. Huge queues form every day to receive the medicine – a small ball which, when consumed, is said to clean the lungs, remove toxicity in the body and activate the liver. The medicine, simply called Borige Anandayya’s ayurvedic formula, is being distributed to about 6,000 people. The pontiff revealed he also has herbal eyedrops which helps increase blood oxygen levels, but this is only for people with low oxygen saturation levels. However, he admitted he has not sought permission from the district administration or the Karnataka health department to distribute the medicine. “Borige Anandayya’s ayurvedic formula is very famous in Andhra Pradesh and permitted by the AP government and the AP high court, especially for those suffering Covid-19,” Govindananda Saraswati said. “This ayurvedic medicine was recently approved by the ministry of Ayush. This medicine will help people so there is no need to get permission from the health department.” The pontiff claimed the medicine for 6,000 people costs Rs 5 lakh, but since it was given to him free, he is distributing it free. “Many patients have recovered after they took this ayurvedic medicine. There are no side effects,” he said. Dr Janardhan, DHO, Ballari, said he was unaware that the medicine is being distributed. “No one has sought permission in this regard. I will tell the taluk health officer, Hospet, to initiate appropriate action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ayurvedic-medicine-popular-in-andhra-pradesh-now-at-hampi/articleshow/83908921.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

---||Bhopal||Missing for 20 months, Madhya Pradesh man returns from Pakistan||BHOPAL: Almost 20 months after he went missing and mysteriously surfaced in Pakistan, Barilal alias Darilal returned to his home in Damoh district of Madhya Pradesh on Friday. A resident of Pati Shishpur village, Barilal was arrested at Bahawalpur in Pakistan on November 14, 2019, for unlawful entry. Damoh SP D R Tenivaar told TOI that he was handed over to Indian forces by Pakistan at Attari Border. While mystery shrouds his entry into Pakistan, all Barilal remembers is that he had boarded a train for a company, which had hired him as a labourer. Responding to mediapersons, Barilal said he was beaten up by Pakistani officials a couple of times but that he was fed well. “I find no difference here and there,” he said. Repeated incidents like this have raised suspicion of a cross-border organ trafficking ring that may be preying on poor and mentally challenged people. Barilal is the sixth ‘mentally ill’ resident of Madhya Pradesh to end up in Pakistan, say officials. According to a missing person’s report filed by his family in a remote village of Damoh district in 2017, Bari was battling mental problems. Barilal’s kin found he was in Pak in ’19Barilal’s escapade across the border seems uncannily similar to those of Jitendra Arjunwar of Seoni, Raju Laxman of Khandwa, Budhram Marko of Dindori, Anil Kumar Saket of Rewa and Sunil Uikey of Balaghat. Raju and Anil are still in Pakistan jails. Like Raju’s relatives, Bari’s family too was desperately looking for him until they got a shocker from local police in 2019 — that he was in Pakistan police custody. By that time the frequency of MP’s missing persons ending up in Pakistan had already left intelligence agencies baffled. Barilal had been in their custody for two years before his arrest was recorded on November 14, said an officer who did not want to be named. His house is located at Shirpur Patti in Nohta police station area, around 40km from Damoh town. He was 28 when he went missing and was last seen in his village on February 15, 2017. His brother Pawan Singh filed a police complaint on March 4, 2017, where he cited Bari Lal’s mental problems. Pakistan authorities announced the arrest of Bari Lal and Telangana native Prashant Vaindam on November 18, 2019 saying they were apprehended in Bahawalpur’s Chiolistan area in Sindh Province for trespass. MEA sources, however, told TOI that the Pakistani foreign ministry was officially informed about the possibility of these two Indians having inadvertently crossed over several months ago. -Bari Lal’s case was being followed since December 2018, when reports were received that he may have crossed into Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/missing-for-20-months-madhya-pradesh-man-returns-from-pakistan/articleshow/83908966.cms||P Naveen
---||Ahmedabad||Mortality rate of Gujarat pregnant women rose to 13% in 2nd wave||AHMEDABAD: At SVP Hospital in Ahmedabad - one of the major Covid-19 hospitals of the city - 148 pregnant women with Covid-19 infection were admitted during the second wave. Out of the total, 19 or 13% of the patients succumbed to the infection. To put the figure in perspective, the first wave had a mortality rate of 0.3% as only one out of 359 admitted pregnant women lost life in the pandemic. The second wave in Gujarat during April-May in general recorded 10 times deaths compared to the first wave - against 396 deaths from November 15 to December 15 last year, this year April 15 to May 15 recorded 4,044 deaths. But in 2020, the experts had witnessed deaths involving pregnant women few and far - the trend which got reversed across Gujarat. Dr Sushma Shah, head of gynaecology department at SVP Hospital, said that the second wave was marked by more infectivity and greater lung complications. "It was brutal for pregnant women. Most deceased mothers-to-be suffered from irreversible lung damage, sepsis, myocarditis and kidney complications," she said. The trend was also witnessed in other cities - at New Civil Hospital and SMIMER in Surat, the fatality rate of pregnant women with Covid-19 positivity was 2.8% (nine deaths out of 312 cases), which rose sharply to 23% as 19 out of 84 women succumbed to the pandemic. Speedy inoculation can reduce mortalityThe death rate was higher in the second wave as most patients were hospitalized when severity was high and needed oxygen and ventilator support," said Dr Ashwin Vachhani, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at SMIMER Hospital. Dr Sarla Bhatia of New Civil Hospital cited the new Covid variant and late hospitalization as primary reasons. At SSG Hospital in Vadodara, two out of 124 pregnant women had succumbed to Covid-19 in the first wave, giving a mortality rate of 0.8% which rose to 6% with death of 11 out of 189 expecting mothers this year. “Most women battled Covid-induced pneumonia which escalated to respiratory failure, the main cause of death," said Dr Ashish Gokhale, head of gynaecology and obstetrics department at the SSG Hospital. Dr Gokhale added that although vaccination is not recommended for pregnant women, women who are planning for conception or taking infertility treatment should go for vaccines without hesitation. Dr Jignesh Deliwala, president of Ahmedabad Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society, said that the union health department has recently given green signal for vaccination of pregnant women. “Gynaecologists are also encouraging women who wish to get pregnant to get vaccinated beforehand to give themselves some protection.” (Inputs from Jay Pachhigar in Surat and Prashant Rupera in Vadodara)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covids-second-wave-proves-lethal-for-pregnant-women/articleshow/83909016.cms||Radha Sharma

---||Gurgaon||As property dues mount in Covid, Gurugram civic body stares at shortage of funds||GURUGRAM: With property tax arrears climbing to around Rs 932 crore, coupled with a slow recovery of the current year’s demand of Rs 235 crore, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram is not only struggling to generate revenue but also staring at a funds crunch. In terms of property tax dues, Zone 2 (Udyog Vihar and Palam Vihar) tops the list with Rs 276 crore pending, followed by Zone 4 (Sohna Road and Gold Course extension road) with Rs 275 crore, Zone 3 (Cybercity and Golf Course Road) with Rs 221 crore and Zone 1 (Old Gurugram) with Rs 159 crore. Around 48,000 properties have dues in Zone 2, 47,111 properties in Zone 1, 40,000 in Zone 3 and 47,000 in Zone 4. According to officials of the taxation wing, the department has been able to mop up only Rs 18 crore this year so far — which is less than 10% of the demand. Of all the zones, the maximum demand of Rs 102 crore is due from Zone 3 this year. Of that, only Rs 2 crore has been recovered so far. A senior official said that there are more than 3,600 properties where the property tax dues are more than Rs 5 lakh each and recovery from them is a major challenge. “While Zone 2 has 1,171 properties with dues of more than Rs 5 lakh, there are 970, 953 and 539 such properties in Zone 4, 3 and 1, respectively. The civic body has issued around 1,336 notices to these properties for recovery of dues to the tune of over Rs 140 crore,” said an official. Last year, TOI had reported that lockdown has caused a major dent in MCG’s revenues as it had not been able to generate even 1% of its projected amount for the first quarter of the fiscal. Meanwhile, the officials blamed the pandemic for the poor recovery and the pressure on the civic body’s coffers. In a meeting held last week, the officials were directed to prepare a plan of action to expedite the recovery of dues in order to improve the financial health of the corporation. MCG officials, however, called it a temporary revenue loss and said that the dues will be recovered in the next few months. The corporation has taken a few steps to recover these dues. It initiated action against the defaulters and warned them of disconnecting sewerage and water connections if the dues are not settled within 15 days of getting the notice. Further, in order to ensure higher compliance with regard to recovery of property tax dues, the former civic body chief had directed the tehsil officials not to allow any property registration unless the applicant has a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the corporation with regards to the payment of property taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/as-property-dues-mount-in-covid-mcg-stares-at-shortage-of-funds/articleshow/83903169.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

However, it has further eased down the restriction norms. The government, while extending the lockdown by another week, issues a fresh set of guidelines. It has allowed universities across the state to open for research scholars, practical classes in laboratories and remedial classes for students. The government has been easing the restriction norms from May 24 in phases and the relaxations will continue as permitted in the earlier orders. Meanwhile, the cinema halls and multiplexes in the city are still awaiting government guidelines to reopen as they have been closed down since March this year. Sanjay Barjatya, regional head of Miraj Cinema said, “We were hoping that some relaxation would be given to us this time so that we could resume operations. During the current lockdown, we were the first ones to shut but are still not allowed to reopen. Other entities are being allowed to conduct their businesses. Other state governments have announced relaxations to operate cinemas with 50% occupancy.” The cinema operators hope new guidelines will be issued soon as big movies such as Bell Bottom, Radhe Shyam, Gangubai Kathiawadi, Jayeshbhai Jordaar and Sooryavanshi are lined up releases. “If we are allowed to open, it would provide some relief to the industry. Moreover, the vaccination drive is already underway and we are ensuring that every staff member is being vaccinated with at least one dose,” Gagan Deep, duty manager at PVR (Gurgaon). Notably, Anganwadi centres and creches under the women and child development will remain closed till July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/lockdown-on-till-july-5-but-varsities-can-open-for-some/articleshow/83903238.cms||Akanksha Gupta

---||Bhopal||Covid curve flattens, but high death rate remains concern in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Covid-19 cases are steadily going down in the state barring minor fluctuations. However, the number of deaths have not gone down in the same proportion as the number of new cases detected. In past week, though there is an overall decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases reported daily, there were certain days like June 21, when a few more cases were reported compared to June 20, then again on June 23, 84 new Covid-19 cases were reported compared to 65 cases reported a day before on June 24. However, number of deaths that are being reported have more or less remained the same close to 20 deaths a day throughout the week. If the data of past one month and trends are monitored, then also on May 26, a total of 2,182 new Covid-19 cases were reported, it has however reduced to 46 on June 26. Thus seen statistically, there has been reduction of more than 50 times in the number of new cases reported daily in past one month, though this has come down slowly throughout the month. But when deaths are considered, a total of 72 deaths were reported on May 26 and has reduced to 25. Thus statistically, it has reduced by three times in the same period when number of new cases reported daily have reduced by almost 50 times. On Sunday, 21 deaths were reported in the state. With these, death toll due to Covid-19 in Madhya Pradesh has reached 8,917. Experts say that these trends also reflects the importance of maintaining appropriate Covid-19 behaviour — wearing masks, maintaining social distance and ensuring hand hygiene — as though it is a good thing that cases are coming down, but letting guards down can easily welcome any other spike or peak. One explanation for less improvement in number of deaths could be the fact that since the number of active cases have come down below 1000, probably majority of those who were infected earlier have recovered, however large number of active patients now includes those with high-comorbidity, leading to casualties, though this is only a probability, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-curve-flattens-but-high-death-rate-remains-concern-in-madhya-pradesh/articleshow/83909180.cms||Amarjeet Singh
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Clean-up done over 2 years, Sikanderpur lake set to open||GURUGRAM: The GMDA has almost finished its work to revive Sikanderpur waterbody, nearly two years after the project was launched. The area has been cleared of encroachments and it will take a few months before the place is opened for the public, officials have said. Subhash Yadav, district forest officer, GMDA, said major part of the work, including cleaning the waterbody and removal of encroachments around it, is over. “Plantation work has also been completed and a walkway is being made for public use,” he added. The waterbody is a part of the Aravali water channel and since it is a creek, the exact measurement is not available, Yadav said. The project was launched by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in 2019 and the work had been assigned to a city-based NGO, iamGurugram.  The project is funded under CSR initiatives of several private organisations. Latika Thakural from iamGurugram said initially that their major challenge was to stop the flow of sewage waste from illegal dwellings at Sikanderpur village into the waterbody. “We started the work by cleaning the water,” Thakural said, adding that they have created several small ponds in the area to arrest water. One such waterbody has been created near Shiv Nadar School, she said. Sikanderpur waterbody will be fed by storm water collected from nearby residential areas, including DLF Phase1 and parts of Golf Course Road. “A pipeline is being laid to connect the waterbody with the nearest waste treatment plant so that it does not dry up,” Thakural said. The area will be open to the public only in the next few months. “The walkway around Sikanderpur waterbody needs more work and parts of the boundary wall have to be constructed,” Yadav said. While the initial project cost was pegged at around Rs 15 crore, Thakural said the work is likely to get completed for less than that amount. The revival of the Sikanderpur waterbody and another one at Wazirabad were launched as model restoration projects in 2019. “The restoration work at Wazirabad is almost halfway through,” Yadav said. Earlier, TOI had reported that GMDA will develop Sikanderpur and Wazirabad waterbodies as models for the revival and restoration of other waterbodies. A survey by GMDA had revealed that Gurugram has 644 waterbodies, and of those only one is under the authority. Seven are under Haryana State Industry and 10 are under HSVP. It was found that 55 waterbodies are MCG, 310 under gram panchayats and 173 are owned by private parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/clean-up-done-over-2-years-sikanderpur-lake-set-to-open/articleshow/83904738.cms||Shubhra Pant

Billiards and Snooker Players Association of India (BSPAI) said at a virtual interaction on Saturday that the national federation should have proper representation of players. “We have been engaging with the federation since the revival in the early part of the year. The BSPAI has taken up the issue of reinstatement of affiliation by BSFI with the sports ministry and the minister. They have said they will look into the matter,” said Chawla. “After the revival of the players association, we thought how we could work together amicably with the BSFI and take the sport to greater heights. We have extended our hand of friendship. However, the BSFI is coming up with its own formula of how the players should be represented,” he said. Former national snooker champion Yasin Merchant, vice-president of the BSPAI, said they always wanted to work in tandem with BSFI and want to nominate the right people. The BPSAI, in a release, said among its demands were reinstatement of the association's affiliation immediately with two representatives being invited to the management committee/EC meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/need-to-reinstate-billiards-and-snooker-players-association-of-india-affiliation-says-kamal-chawala/articleshow/83909240.cms||---

District collector Mrunmai Joshi, also the authority chairman, said, “In the investigations, it was found that the virus had spread from one person from Kannadi and those who came into his contact were also affected. There were also many Covid-19 deaths and more patients in the area. The virus spread to neighbouring Parali and Pirayiri grama panchayats. So Kannadi grama panchayat will be fully closed for a week from Monday and its borders will be shut.” The station house officer and panchayat officials were directed to strictly implement the total lockdown restrictions. In addition to that, more Covid-19 screening will be conducted in Kannadi by health and panchayat authorities, she added. Shops selling fruit, meat, fish and other essential items are allowed to open from 9am to 2pm only. The borders will be closed and movement of people and vehicles restricted, and there will be only one entry and one exit point in the panchayat, she said. The Delta variants were found in the samples collected from two women, both 50 years old, from Parali and Pudupariyaram grama panchayats earlier. They were hospitalized for Covid-19 infection in April-May months but recovered from the disease, and so have others who were in their contact lists. The collector said that the samples of the two women tested at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Institute of Genomics and Integrated Biology in New Delhi confirmed the Delta-plus variants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/strict-curbs-in-pkds-kannadi-panchayat/articleshow/83909203.cms||---

A master plan will be prepared to avoid traffic snarls at Vyttila Junction for the next 20 years. Temporary measures will be taken for addressing the traffic bottleneck in Vyttila. The officials with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), national highway wing of PWD and traffic wing should conduct a joint inspection to find out the temporary solutions, the minister instructed. A study will be conducted for analyzing the traffic flow and based on it, a scientific design for the junction improvement will be prepared. If the land is to be acquired for the purpose, steps will be taken for that immediately. A report submitted by the PWD national highway wing will also be considered while designing the new development plan. Steps will be taken for speeding up the widening of Thammanam-Pulleppady Raod. The widening work along the stretch, where the land has already taken over, will be completed soon. The land has already been acquired along the Karanakkodam bridge-Kathrikkadavu Junction stretch. Measures for acquiring land along Katthrikkadavu Junction to Padma Junction and Thammanam Junction to national highway bypass stretches will also be taken. The minister asked officials to conduct meetings to review the progress of land acquisition once a month. The state government has decided to provide funds for the project from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). Once the road widening completed, it will help streamline the traffic through the city. The road will also provide easy connectivity to the city and Infopark.
