On any given day, the place was buzzing with street food lovers and on weekends, you’d be lucky if you didn’t have to wait several minutes just to get your order in. But the pandemic changed that and the market turned into a deserted spot, like many other places in the city. Earlier this year, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s crackdown on illegal street hawkers and vendors also saw several food carts shut shop there, further robbing the market of its sheen. However, as the city unlocks gradually after the second wave, the Sector 56 market is also limping back to normalcy. As the lockdown was lifted in Gurgaon earlier this month, the once-bustling market reopened. And pretty soon, the place was once again abuzz with foodies, albeit with COVID protocols in place. A worker at one of the food carts in the market says, “We had started our cart again the last weekend post lockdown and the response has been pretty good. We are maintaining all hygiene and safety standards and trying to ensure social distancing for the customers as well.” ‘Once the footfall increases, we need to take measures to ensure social distancing’With an increase in footfall at the market over the weekend, some concerns about the lack of social distancing were raised. “Once the lockdown was lifted, people started coming here in droves. It’s not ideal because social distancing goes for a toss. Even though it’s good for our business, it is a little concerning,” says a food cart owner. Manoj, a vendor, adds, “Right now, it’s manageable because the crowd is less. People have just started coming here after the lockdown but once the footfall increases, we may have to take some measures to ensure social distancing. We don’t want any untoward incident happening here when the business starts picking up again.” Missed the vibe of Sector 56 market for months: FoodiesThe market has been the most popular street food place in Millennium City over the last few years since the food trucks near Leisure Valley Park closed. Rajit Ahuja, a Sector 54 resident, who visited the market recently, tells us, “The vibe of Sector 56 is different. We had been missing it for months. First, the pandemic and then the MCG crackdown had robbed the market of its sheen. But this weekend, it felt that it was returning.” In its current form, the market is only a shell of what it was in its heyday, but for Gurgaon’s food connoisseurs, even that is enough. “It is better that there are fewer carts as compared to earlier because that means fewer people and less crowding. But what I saw there gives me hope that the market will be back to normal again very soon,” adds Namrata, who recently visited the market with her family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaons-sector-56-street-food-market-limping-back-to-normalcy-after-lockdown/articleshow/83870526.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

Therefore, it should not be generalised,” he told TOI. Guleria said the report submitted to the apex court was an interim one. “It is not the final report. We have another meeting in two to three days. Based on the deliberations, a final report will be submitted by next week,” he said. In the backdrop of the war of words between BJP functionaries and the AAP government in Delhi on the issue, Dr Guleria explained that oxygen requirement was a dynamic process and the requirement is bound to change from day to day and time to time, depending on how the pandemic behaves. The AIIMS director said the audit committee used a government-approved formula to calculate the need for oxygen in Delhi, considering the number of ICU and routine beds that are there at a given time and the demand that was being made. Follow TOI's Covid live blog for latest updates“There was certainly a discrepancy in the demand made by certain hospitals vis-a-vis their need. We will deliberate further on this at the next meeting and discuss ways to make optimum use of the critical supply to avert any crisis in future,” said Dr Guleria. The interim report has suggested that Delhi government exaggerated the oxygen requirement in the city by more than four times during the April 25-May 10 peak period of the second Covid wave. It has observed that the supply of excess oxygen to the capital could have affected supply to12 states which had high caseloads. “There was a gross discrepancy (about four times). The actual oxygen consumption claimed by the Delhi government (1,140MT) was about four times higher than the calculated consumption as per the formula based on bed capacity (289 MT),” the interim report of the audit sub-group said. Besides Guleria, the SC-appointed panel had four other members: B S Bhalla, Delhi government's principal home secretary (home); Dr Sandeep Budhiraja of Max Healthcare; Subodh Yadav, joint secretary in the Jal Shakti ministry; and Sanjay Kumar Singh, controller of explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation. Both Bhalla and Budhiraja have questioned the conclusions made in the interim report. Bhalla said a reading of the interim report made it “painfully apparent” that the sub-group, instead of focusing on its actual task, deviated from the terms of order of the Supreme Court dated May 6 to recommend the quantity of LMO liquid medical oxygen to be allocated to Delhi. The manner in which the proceedings of the sub-group were conducted, he said, suggested that the purpose of the proceedings was to satisfy a “preconceived and predetermined conclusion and narrative to recommend a lower quantity of LMO to Delhi”. It was also aimed at further creating an impression that the assessment by the GNCTD before the high court and Supreme Court was “exaggerated or not genuine”, Bhalla added. Budhiraja said in his comments that a decision was taken in the first meeting itself to get actual details of oxygen consumption from all the hospitals of NCT of Delhi. “After repeated corrections (as hospital medical superintendents used a different format), the total calculation of oxygen consumption (based on actual consumption data of 214 hospitals) came to around 490 MT. This did not take into account oxygen cylinder refilling and non-Covid requirements of hospitals,” said Budhiraja. He also brought to the notice of the sub-group that he did not attend the May 18 meeting. He said he gave prior information to the group on WhatsApp that minutes of the previous meeting (held on May 15) should be circulated before the next meeting was scheduled. The AIIMS director said that both Bhalla and Budhiraja will be joining the next meeting and a final report will include their suggestions/recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-generalise-to-say-delhi-sought-4x-o2-needed-aiims-chief-guleria/articleshow/83873645.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The government had banned weddings in public places, banquet halls and hotels during the peak of the second wave. It had allowed weddings only in courts or at home with a cap of 20 people. Around two months after the second wave hit the capital, infecting around 28,359 people on a single day on April 20, cases have seen a drastic decline. The positivity rate has fallen to 0.12%, one of the lowest since the pandemic broke out in the capital. Delhi has permitted various economic activities in a phased manner since May 31 after reviewing the impact of the lockdown on the Covid-19 management. At present, the activities that are allowed include manufacturing and construction work with conditions, bars with 50% seating capacity from 12 noon to 10pm; public parks, gardens, golf clubs, outdoor yoga activities, shops, malls, markets and shopping complexes from 10am to 8pm; restaurants with 50% seating capacity from 8am to 10pm; liquor shops, private offices with maximum 50% staff from 9am to 5pm. Government offices and emergency services and movement of individuals for funeral-related gatherings for up to 20 people are also allowed. Autos, erickshaws, cabs, taxis, gramin seva can carry two passengers, maxi cabs five and RTVs11. Educational institutions, cinemas and theatres, banquet halls (except for weddings), spas, auditoriums/ assembly halls, business-tobusiness exhibitions, swimming pools, stadia and sports complexes and amusement parks are still closed. Delhi Disaster Management Authority concluded that despite significant improvement, caution and care need to be maintained for effective Covid-19 management. It has extended the lockdown till 5am on July 5, during which all prohibited activities are banned. DDMA has asked authorities to supervise the functioning of markets, market complexes, malls, restaurants and bars. All stakeholders like market associations have been asked to ensure strict compliance with Covid-19 protocols. The government has permitted one weekly market a day per zone (with maximum 50% vendors); transportation by Delhi Metro is capped at 50% of the seating capacity of a coach and no standing passenger is allowed. There are caps on the sitting capacity in public transport as well. DDMA clarified that owners of banquet/marriage halls and hotels would be responsible for ensuring strict compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour. “In case, any violation is found, strict penal/criminal action shall be taken against the owner of the premises as well as against the individual and the premises shall be sealed,” the order stated. Owners of gyms and yoga institutes will have to ensure Covidappropriate behaviour. There is no restriction on inter/intra-state movement of people and goods and no separate permission, or an e-pass, will be required for such movements. No activities will be allowed in containment zones. Chirag Sethi of Delhi Gym Association said the order came as a relief for 5,500 gym owners and 1 lakh people dependent on them for their livelihood. “We will adhere to all SOPs,” Sethi said. Since the lean marriage season is on, operators of banquet halls are happy about 50% operations for now. They say if the situation remains under control, the next marriage season won’t be affected. Kapil Nagpal, president of community welfare and banquet association (west zone), said, “If the number remains low till October, the government should allow full occupancy. We are grateful that 50% occupancy has been allowed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gyms-yoga-centres-in-delhi-allowed-to-reopen-at-50-capacity-from-monday/articleshow/83881364.cms||Alok K N Mishra

The Centre, in its submissions, said, "ADB has also proposed a new Technical Assistance (TA) concept for promoting disaster risk transfer, including insurance in India. ADB through its TA is looking forward to developing disaster risk financing solutions for Indian states." "In this regard, a meeting was also held on April 5 between ADB and NDMA. During the meeting, ADB proposed a hybrid insurance solution - combination of parametric insurance and indemnity insurance - and requested for a joint meeting between NDMA, Department of Financial Services (DFS) and the ministry of home affairs (MHA)," it said. The meeting was scheduled for April 12, but was postponed because of the severity of the second wave of the pandemic. However, the Centre said it would be difficult for it to grant ex gratia from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) or for the states from SDRF as "ex gratia payment under SDRF/NDRF is available to persons who have died on account of 12 notified disasters and other local natural disasters which are notified by the state governments. However, Covid-19 has not been recommended by the XVth Finance Commission for financing of relief measures from State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF)/NDRMF, which includes ex gratia payment". To a query from a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah about correcting death certificates to reflect the cause of demise as Covid, the Centre said, "The Registrar General of India will be asked to examine the matter in consultation with all the stakeholders for taking appropriate action in the matter." The SC had also asked the Centre to collate statistics from states which are paying ex gratia to kin of Covid victims and from which source. The Centre provided data for 36 states and UTs and said only 10 states are providing ex gratia ranging from Rs 50 lakh (by Assam) and Rs 50,000 (Delhi and Meghalaya). But the ex gratia amounts are not released from SDRF, it said. Others who are providing ex gratia are Andhra Pradesh (Rs 10 lakh to orphaned children, Rs 5 lakh in case of death of one parent), Bihar (Rs 4 lakh), Haryana (Rs 2 lakh only to BPL families), Karnataka (Rs 1 lakh).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/insurance-backed-ex-gratia-for-covid-victims-likely-govt/articleshow/83881843.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The Centre said that India has an 18+ population between 93 crore and 94 crore requiring 186-188 crore jabs. The Centre said the 51.6 crore jabs (Covishield, 38.6 crore; Covaxin, 11 crore and Sputnik V, two crore) were procured at a cost of Rs 5,803 crore. It said the government has arranged for 135 crore more doses — Covishield (50 crore), Covaxin (40 crore), Bio E (30 crore), Zydus Cadila (5 crore) and Sputnik V (10 crore). The Centre said the vaccination could be completed earlier as many vaccines are at advanced stages of trial and could get user certificates from the concerned authorities. “The vaccination drive would get a boost if the government of India succeeds in its attempts to procure vaccines available outside India like vaccines of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna etc. It is submitted that for the purpose of procurement of these vaccines from abroad, efforts are ongoing at the level of the highest political executive in the country and also at the highest diplomatic level,” it said. On vaccination of those below 18 years, a concern raised by a bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud that the third wave could affect the children the most, the Centre said, “as of now, the firms manufacturing vaccines in India have only been given ‘emergency use authorisation’ for vaccinating people of 18 years and above”. “…the clinical trial cohort during Phase 1, 2 and 3 didn’t cover children below 18. On May 12, the DGCI has permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct clinical trials on the healthy volunteers between 2 years to 18 years of age for Covaxin and the enrolment process for this trial has also begun.” “If a person having no access to either internet or digital device/s or does not wish to self-register wants to be vaccinated, he can visit nearest vaccination centre where the health worker of the centre would register him and he would be vaccinated,” it said. “It is submitted that, at the cost of repetition, online registration and prior selfregistration and booking of appointment on CoWin is not mandatory to avail vaccination services,” it added. On vaccination in tribal areas, the Centre said the coverage, as per data available on CoWin as on June 23, vaccination per million population in tribal coverage is better than national average; 97 out of 176 tribal districts are performing better than all-India vaccination coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-135cr-more-doses-by-year-end-to-vaccinate-all/articleshow/83883034.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of the state government's public health department, said they were still gathering information of patients, who are spread across the state, but preliminary information indicates most were not vaccinated. Three patients were under 18, and not eligible for vaccination. The state government has decided to step up vaccination in these five districts in the coming days. N Ramaswami, commissioner of state national health mission, said areas where the Delta-plus variant was found were being monitored closely. Delta-Plus or AY.1 variant was detected in nine Covid-positive samples from Ratnagiri, seven from Jalgaon, two from Mumbai and one each from Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg districts. On Friday, the state declared that one of the patients from Ratnagiri, an 80-year-old woman with severe anxiety disorder, died June 13. She was admitted to a Covid care centre on June 1 but doctors transferred her to the civil hospital as she needed specialised psychiatric drugs and care. "She was aggressive and difficult to manage even though we started her on psychiatric drugs,"' said Ratnagiri civil surgeon Dr Sanghamitra Phule. The state is awaiting results of other samples sent to Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology in Delhi for genetic sequencing. The health department is trying to understand how these 21 could have got infected with the Delta-plus virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/none-of-maharashtras-21-delta-plus-infected-were-vaccinated/articleshow/83883383.cms||---

Late on Friday, ED arrested Deshmukh's private secretary Sanjeev Palande and his personal assistant Kundan Shinde (as reported in some editions) and a special court remanded them to ED custody till July 1. The ED, in its remand application seeking their custody, stated Palande and Shinde had played an active role in money laundering. Palande had coordinated with Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil for allegedly illegally collecting money from the orchestra bar owners in Mumbai, and the amount was handed over to Shinde. In his statement to the ED, Waze said he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 to February 2021 (during the period, the government relaxed the Covid lockdown condition allowing bars to operate), and handed over the money to Shinde in two instalments. The remand application has mentioned diversion of funds collected from "orchestra bar owners" by Waze into the account of Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, through a Delhi-based hawala operator. Anil Deshmukh is the president of the trust and his two sons, Salil and Hrishikesh, are trustees. The ED recorded the statement of prominent bar owners of the city who had allegedly collected money from other bar owners known to them for the smooth functioning of their business. They stated that in December, 60 orchestra bar owners paid Rs 40 lakh to Waze as "good luck" money and then between January and February all the bar owners had collectively contributed Rs 4.3 crore for Waze who then handed all the collection to Deshmukh's staff. Waze had told the bar owners the collected money will go to 'Number 1" and the crime branch and social service branch of Mumbai police, said the remand plea. Delhi-based book entry operators, Jain brothers (Surendra and Virendra), told ED officials that Hrishikesh, through his associate, had approached them requesting an arrangement to take cash and transfer the amount to his trust through regular banking transactions as donations, said the remand application. It stated the cash from bar owners in Mumbai was transferred to the Jain brothers through a hawala channel. The ED had summoned Anil Deshmukh for his statement on Saturday, but he did not turn up, seeking time to appear for his further statement. Deshmukh wrote a letter to the ED showing his inability to present himself for questioning and said, "I am sanguine to expose the falsity, hollowness and lack of substance in the allegation levelled against me." It is learnt the ED may summon Deshmukh for questioning again next week. It had recorded his partial statement at his residence in Worli on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/deshmukh-son-routed-rs-4-7cr-to-educational-trust-as-donation-enforcement-directorate/articleshow/83883580.cms||Vijay V Singh

The plan, as it stands now, is to formally announce the decision to create four new integrated commands on Independence Day this year. The integrated maritime theatre command (IMTC), integrated air defence command (IADC) and two integrated land theatre commands (for the borders with Pakistan and China) will then be "raised and operationalised" over a two-year period by August 15, 2023, top sources told on Saturday. "A separate command for Jammu & Kashmir, which will include counter-terrorism operations, is also under consideration. The final modalities are being worked out. The government fully backs the creation of the integrated commands," said a source. As per the plan being spearheaded by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, the "commencement of the raising" of the new commands will begin after August 15 this year. These "raisings" will be overseen by serving commanders-in-chief (senior Lt-Generals, Vice Admirals and Air Marshals), in addition to their existing responsibilities. With the raisings to be completed by August 15 next year, the "commencement of operationalisation" of the new commands will then follow with the appointments of the actual theatre commanders. "The operationalisation will be completed by August 15, 2023. The theatre commanders will report directly to the chiefs of staff committee (CoSC), which is chaired by the CDS and includes the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs," he added. India currently has only two unified commands, the Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command to handle the country's nuclear arsenal, which were set up in 2001 and 2003 after the Kargil conflict with Pakistan. With India having as many as 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which have little synergy in planning and operations as well as disjointed command-and-control structures, the need for joint commands and an integrated land-sea-air war-fighting machinery has been felt for a long time. The IAF, however, has resisted the move, stressing it would be operationally unwise to divide the country's "limited air assets" (just 30 fighter squadrons, six mid-air refuellers, three AWACS, two AEW&C aircraft etc) among different theatre commands. Moreover, the IAF contends that it can swiftly move its forces from one front to another across the country in less than 48 hours. A high-level committee chaired by the CDS, and including the vice-chiefs of Army, Navy and IAF, chief of integrated defence staff and representatives from defence, home and finance ministries, has already met in a bid to resolve such internal differences within the armed forces as well as consult external stakeholders. "Theatre commands will become a reality, one way or the other. They will be based fundamentally on a particular domain, with the assets and tri-service integration required in that domain. The CoSC will decide on the reallocation of forces among different theatres as and when required, depending on the contingency," said a senior officer. "These turf wars cannot continue forever. Even in the US, the Goldwater-Nichols Act had to be ultimately thrust down the military's throat to streamline integration and the chain of command, which was being stymied by inter-Service rivalry," he added. The commander-in-chief of the proposed IMTC, for instance, will have full operational control over the Western and Eastern Naval Fleets, maritime strike fighter jets of IAF, two amphibious infantry brigades of the Army and Coast Guard for integrated planning and execution of operations, as reported by TOI earlier.

At least six long-distance trains originating from Patna Junction, Danapur and Patliputra Junction are being escorted by them on a regular basis,” he said. The ‘Meri Saheli’ teams have come to the rescue of many women passengers. For instance, Meena Bano (28) from Madhubani district was travelling along with her husband, Firoz, by the Lokmanya Tilak Mumbai-Raxaul special passenger train recently. She had developed labour pain during journey and was de-boarded at Patna Junction around 10.30pm. “The Meri Saheli team acted swiftly and arranged safe delivery of a girl child on the platform number 1 itself without wasting precious little time,” the DRM said. He added even during the pick of Covid-19 pandemic, the Meri Saheli teams coordinated with women passengers at personal level. “The RPF’s Meri Saheli team members get in touch with women travelling by long-distance trains. Their details are forwarded to Meri Saheli teams at Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Tundla and New Delhi,” the DRM said, adding it is the responsibility of Meri Saheli teams to inform their counterparts at Patna Junction, Danapur and Patliputra to take care of these women passengers. This facility is available in all long-distance trains on Mumbai, Secunderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Howrah and Jaipur routes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/meri-saheli-teams-make-women-passengers-feel-safe/articleshow/83878043.cms||Kumod Verma

The Airport Authority of India (Prayagraj region) has been permitted by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to start the cargo flights from the Civil Enclave of Prayagraj located at Bamrauli. A proposal for starting cargo flight connectivity between Prayagraj and other cities in the country was sent to BCAS in November, last year. After getting the green signal from the security bureau, the freight air service could now start following which entrepreneurs and traders will be able to order or ship goods from different parts of the country. Active involvement of UP minister for civil aviation, Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’ is worth mentioning in terms of Prayagraj’s Civil Enclave to be able to start cargo services. “Now that we can start cargo flights from Sangam city, the facility would be of immense benefit for providing new markets, both nationally and internationally, to the products of the region very much on the lines of Varanasi, wherein veggies and fruits of Kashi have found new markets in the western countries as well,” says the minister. Regional director of AAI (Prayagraj) Anchal Prakash said, “After the approval from the security bureau, the cargo flights would now be introduced from Prayagraj too. However, the timing of these cargo flights, from arrival-departure and loading-unloading, would be kept separated from the passenger aircraft”. Recently, the Prayagraj civil enclave was surveyed by the station manager (terminal) of Varanasi airport so that a cargo aircraft facility can be introduced here too. The station manager was satisfied with the amenities following which the letter has been sent to BCAS for their approval. The airport authority also plans to build a separate terminal at Prayagraj’s civil enclave to start a regular cargo carrier. The terminal would have all the facilities needed for handling cargo facility including a warehouse, entry-exit, parking etc. to keep and handle goods coming and going from the city. The entrepreneurs of Prayagraj have been demanding to start cargo carriers for years. Vinay Aggarwal, president of Eastern UP Chamber of Commerce and Industries, said that they have been demanding for starting cargo facility from Prayagraj which would help in the overall economic growth of the city and its traders, be it in the business of various goods or the guava farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/civil-enclave-to-soon-have-cargo-aircraft-facility/articleshow/83878681.cms||---

The case is being investigated by CID under the monitoring of Patna high court. It had submitted a status report in the high court during hearing of the matter on Friday when ADG Vinay Kumar had informed the court that the three senior officers have been quizzed. However, CID remained at the receiving end of the court for ‘treating softly’ a sub-inspector (SI), Brajesh Kumar Singh. The SI was incharge of Vasudevpur police outpost at that time. He is accused in two of the cases registered in connection with the case, including one for boy’s murder. It was ADG (CID) Kumar, who orally apprised the bench of Justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad that Singh, Dhillon and Meena have been quizzed. However, CID had to face the court’s wrath which orally observed why favourable treatment was being given to the SI. The CID had submitted before the court on Friday the SI’s replies were mostly evasive and that he was not cooperating with the investigation. Meanwhile, the ADG has also apprised the court that three pistols of the state police personnel and a rifle of CISF personnel were seized from the spot and sent for forensic analysis. The court will next hear the matter on August 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/have-quizzed-2-former-sps-in-firing-case/articleshow/83878123.cms||Debashish Karmakar

It will also beautify the university,” the VC told this reporter and added that the University Grants Commission (UGC) also laid emphasis on making campuses green. Gupta has conceptualized the concept of ‘Har Parisar, Hara Parisar’ and urged the TMBU students to conduct tree plantation drives in their respective institutions. It is inspired by the UGC’s ‘One Student, One Tree’ campaign. “We are asking everyone to plant saplings in their colleges as well as houses and adopt one tree. Our aim is to improve lives and make the surroundings cleaner and greener,” the VC said. She added, “We are also raising awareness about groundwater preservation, recycling of wastes, and the hazardous impact of pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tmbu-vc-for-enhancing-green-cover-in-colleges/articleshow/83878096.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The incident occurred when Yadav was returning home in an SUV from a cremation with some of his friends. Police said Yadav was president of students’ wing of RJD’s Dumraon block. Buxar SP Neeraj Kumar Singh said Yadav’s family members have lodged an FIR against five unknown assailants in connection with the incident. “Family members had initially told police that Yadav had met an accident. They took him to sadar hospital from where he was referred to Varanasi. He died on the way to Varanasi after which the family members brought the body back and alleged that he was shot dead,” the SP said. He added raids were being conducted at several places to arrest those involved in the killing. “Yadav had received one bullet injury in head,” he said. Meanwhile, Dumraon SDPO Krishna Kumar Singh said Yadav had gone to attend the cremation of his close friend’s grandmother and was returning home when he was shot. “The deceased woman was mother-in-law of Simri block’s Sahiyar panchayat mukhiya Archana Devi,” he said. He said police have found a bike which had collided with the SUV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-functionary-shot-dead-in-buxar/articleshow/83878322.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Varanasi||BJP’s Sadhna Singh elected ZP chief unopposed in Gorakhpur||Revised with important addition (2nd para) Gorakhpur: Sadhna Singh, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and daughter-in-law of late UP chief minister Veer Bahadur Singh, was elected chairman of Gorakhpur zila panchayat unopposed on Saturday. “Sadhna Singh will be declared chairman of Gorakhpur zila panchayat on June 29, if she does not take her nomination back,” ADM (finance/revenue),” Rajesh Kumar Singh told TOI on Saturday. The Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate was not able to fill the nomination form following a clash between BJP and SP supporters at the gate of the collectorate. In the melee, the SP candidate was not able to enter the premises to fill the nomination paper. Sadhna Singh reached the collectorate and entered the nomination room at 11.45am and completed four sets of nomination papers by 3 pm. The SP had earlier declared Alok Gupta of ward number 46 as the candidate, but changed the decision at the last moment and declared the name of Jitendra Yadav of Badhalganj ward number 47. “I have come here for the development of all the areas of the district and will work for it,” Sadhna Singh said after her election. “This is murder of democracy, BJP supporters didn’t allow us to enter the collectorate and that too in the presence of police and administrative officials. The BJP supporters thrashed zila panchayat member Paras Yadav and our candidate was not able to even fill nomination paper,” said SP district president Ram Nagina Sahni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bjps-sadhna-singh-elected-zp-chief-unopposed-in-gorakhpur/articleshow/83878736.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kochi: Parade Ground paints a picture of neglect||KOCHI: Parade Ground is not just a playground, rather history remains buried in the ground that is more than four-and-a-half centuries old. But, the unfortunate thing is that the authorities are not wise enough to understand the value of the Parade Ground. There have not been any efforts on the part of the authorities to protect the Parade Ground. Even when they do some renovation work, their only focus is on the immediate goals. “It is a ground, probably the only one in the county, where the flags of all the colonials who ruled India flew. When India became independent, Union Jack was lowered and the Tricolour was hoisted,” said K J Sohan, former mayor. During the Fifa U-17 World Cup held in Kochi in 2017, Parade Ground had been selected as one of the practice grounds. The central portion of the Parade Ground was fenced and made into a practice ground. Now the fenced area has cut the remaining parts into four. “They increased the height of the surface of the ground inside the fence by two-and-a-half feet to use it as the practice ground for the Fifa U-17 World Cup. They also constructed a drainage system inside the football ground. This caused waterlogging in the surrounding areas,” Sohan said. “The most unfortunate thing is that they locked the fenced area after the Fifa U-17. Hundreds of youths who had been using the ground lost the opportunity to use it, a privilege they enjoyed until then,” he said. A report by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) states that the unscientific works in Parade Ground held in 2017 have triggered waterlogging in nearby areas like the St Francis Church, which is a protected monument. According to Rufus D’Souza, who had captained Kerala and Tamil Nadu hockey’s teams and the latter’s football team, authorities should take immediate steps to open the Parade Ground for budding talents to practice. D’Souza had imparted training football and hockey aspirants for 50 years till March 2020, when the lockdown was announced in the country. He used to give training for children in two batches. The first till 7.30am and the next from 4pm to 6pm. “Britishers gave utmost importance for the standard of the ground while they made it. They imported the grass for the turf from Australia in 1940 using a yacht and it took almost a year to complete the work,” D’Souza said. The grass here was of particular nature that it won’t grow above a fixed height. It would dry up in summer only to regrow during the monsoon. During the renovation work in 2017, the grass was replaced with a new one. D’Souza recalled the incidents where famous players from across the globe played in Parade Ground. “England’s Tommy Walker came here in 1950, and his shots were so powerful that he broke six wooden crossbars in various matches. England captain Billy Wright also played here once,” he said. In the past two or three years, petty shops have started to line up in the portion of the Parade Ground that is out of the fenced area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/parade-ground-paints-a-picture-of-neglect/articleshow/83878895.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The minister told this newspaper that the education department has worked out a phase-wise programme to reopen the educational institutions. “In the first phase, the universities and colleges will be allowed to resume offline classes after July 6 with all Covid safety protocols. Secondary (classes IX and X) and higher secondary (classes XI and XII) schools as well as coaching institutes will reopen in the second phase. Middle and primary schools (classes I to VIII), on the other hand, will reopen in the third phase,” Choudhary said. He added learning gap was a matter of concern and the government was planning to reopen the educational institutions keeping safety aspect in mind for the larger interests of the students. The minister said on-campus classes would be conducted with 50% capacity on alternate days only with the consent of parents. “Mode of learning should be both online and offline to give flexibility to students,” Choudhary said, adding the educational institutions, both private and government, will have to follow the standard operating procedures earlier released by the department for the safety of students and staff. “Wearing face masks, use of hand sanitiser and maintenance of social distancing will be mandatory in schools, colleges and coaching institutes. The educational institutions are expected to make necessary arrangements to resume physical classes. The entire campus will have to be sanitised on a regular basis for the containment of the virus. Students may have to attend classes on alternate days. Staggered timings will have to be maintained for entry and exit too,” he said. The minister said schools would also act as vaccination centres and the department has asked officers at district and block levels to ensure that teachers make people aware about the importance of getting vaccinated. Educational institutions in the state have remained closed in the state since April 19 following second wave of Covid pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-edu-centres-to-reopen-in-phases-after-july-6-minister/articleshow/83878374.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Overnight showers leave many localities in Patna waterlogged||PATNA: Heavy showers, which lashed parts of Patna and adjoining areas on late Friday night, exposed the tall claims of monsoon preparedness by the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited. The city, which received an average rainfall of 145.4mm in the last 24 hours, witnessed several waterlogged roads and streets on Saturday morning. Rainwater got accumulated outside deputy chief minister (CM) Renu Devi’s residence in Patna. Similar was the situation on the premises of the Vidhan Sabha, which is only a few steps away from the deputy CM’s house. Waterlogging in areas like Patliputra Colony, Kankarbagh, Rajendra Nagar, Airport Road, Patel Nagar, S K Puri, Khagaul, Gola Road and Phulwarisharif also led to traffic congestion in the morning. Although rainwater was drained out from many localities later, the residents of Shastri Nagar and Patliputra Colony waded through ankle to knee-deep water till evening. PMC officials claimed that the reason behind the prolonged waterlogging in these two areas was yet to be known, but 50 workers had been roped in to get rid of the problem. PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma told this newspaper that water had successfully receded from most areas within a few hours after the rain stopped. “We are trying our best to resolve the problem in Patliputra Colony by checking all the outfalls with the help of a map. We have also asked our workers to see if the 100 drains in the locality have any blockage.” He added, “As far as Shastri Nagar is concerned, the drains leading to Rajbanshi Nagar were damaged due to some new constructions in the area. We will, therefore, construct a new drainage pipe soon.” Meanwhile, the residents of Patliputra and Shastri Nagar had a tough time stepping out of their houses for the daily chores. Vikesh Kumar, a resident of New Patliputra Colony, rued, “Rainwater has entered my house. It is unhygienic and dirty. I do not know what to do.” Ashish Kumar Sanjay, who lives in Gardanibagh, said he was scared to go out not only because of waterlogging, but also the dug-up and pothole-ridden roads. A resident of Patel Nagar, Neha Singh, complained, “Heavy rainfall has made a mess of the entire area. It is disgusting.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/overnight-showers-leave-many-localities-in-patna-waterlogged/articleshow/83878221.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Lightning kills 6 as rain pounds Bihar||PATNA: At least six people were killed in lightning strikes as Patna and several other districts in the state received moderate to heavy thundershowers in the last 24 hours. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the state would continue to witness enhanced rainfall till July 2. While the ongoing spell of fairly widespread rainfall is likely to continue till June 28, a fresh spell of enhanced rainfall would pick up from June 30 and intensify on July 1 and 2, it said. Lightning claimed lives of two people each in Muzaffarpur and Sheikhpura and one each in Lakhisarai and Sitamarhi. Weathermen have cautioned people to remain alert as lightning is expected in the state over the next couple of days as well. The IMD has issued a yellow warning for thundershowers with lightning in Bihar on June 27, 28 and 29 and orange warning for June 30. Patna received 146mm of rainfall in 24 hours (8.30am on Friday to 8.30am on Saturday), the highest in a day in the month of June since the last 24 years. The city had received 205mm rainfall on June 30, 1997. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said the heavy rainfall and intense lightning in the state capital and neighbouring areas on Friday night was unprecedented. Deliberating on the reasons behind the thundery weather, the official said, “Gradual rise in temperature in south Bihar along with moisture incursion in the atmosphere from a cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand led to formation of cumulonimbus clouds, which caused lightning. Accordingly, thunderstorms started occurring from late noon hours.” He added thunderstorms along with rainfall is likely in the region over the next two to three days, including possibility of heavy rainfall at one or two places in the next 24 hours. The IMD, in its all-India bulletin issued on Saturday evening, stated that under the influence of the cyclonic circulation over Jharkhand and neighbourhood, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls and thunderstorm and lightning are very likely over most parts of east and adjoining central India, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha during the next 24 hours. Weathermen claimed that while the intensity of showers is comparatively more in south Bihar, the upcoming spell of rain from June 30 is likely to be more intense in northern parts of the state. “Moist easterly winds are likely to pick up strength, causing enhanced rainfall activity along the Himalayan foothills regions of north Bihar, north Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh around July 1 and 2. It would lead to increased inflow into the rivers originating or flowing over these regions,” the IMD bulletin said. Bihar has received good rainfall in the initial weeks of the four-month-long monsoon season (June- September). Southwest monsoon had entered Bihar through Purnia in northeastern parts of the state on June 12, a day ahead of its schedule. The state has received 142% excess rainfall till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lightning-kills-6-as-rain-pounds-bihar/articleshow/83878233.cms||Piyush Tripathi

The minister told this newspaper that though there was no immediate threat of return of Covid as the third wave, review of the existing health facilities and forward planning would help in facing any situation. He said no case of Delta Plus variant of Covid has so far been detected in the state. Pandey, however, said 20 samples of Covid positive patients have been sent to a Bhubaneshwar laboratory for confirmation of the strain of Delta Plus reported from some states. He added 50 samples would be sent to the same laboratory on Monday. “We have actually planned to send at least 100 samples from the state for confirmation of the new variant,” Pandey added. The minister said soon after witnessing the surge in covid cases in its second wave, the health department had started preparations on different fronts like recruitment of doctors, installation of oxygen plants, strengthening of the government hospitals, including medical colleges, and supply of additional instruments based on modern technology. He said, “The health department will soon get 250 new ambulances which will be made available to different districts to carry people to district hospitals or the nearest medical colleges from rural areas.” Meanwhile, with the cases of the new variant Delta Plus increasing in some states, all major hospitals in the state capital have begun reviewing their facilities. Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) superintendent Dr I S Thakur said though no specific alert regarding the new Covid variant has been issued by the state government, the process of enhancing oxygen availability was underway. “One liquid oxygen plant has already been installed at PMCH and it will be made functional in a week,” he said, adding another plant to be provided by the Indian Oil Corporation will have the capacity to generate 5,000 litres of oxygen per minute. Dr Thakur said despite the number of Covid patients declining to four at the hospital, the 100-bed Covid ward is still functioning. “The paediatric ward has 40 beds for treatment of Covid-infected children. We will use all the 200 beds of this department for Covid treatment if required,” he added. The Nalanda Medical College and Hospital is busy installing a cryogenic oxygen plant to fill at least 1,000 cylinders per day, hospital’s superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said. “We have sent the names of paediatricians, medical officers and nursing staff for online training to be organised by the health department,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-100-samples-to-be-sent-to-odisha-for-covid-variant-test/articleshow/83877954.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Patna||Bihar govt takes steps to ameliorate Covid impact, revive economy||PATNA: Even as the Covid-induced lockdown impacted the first quarter of the current fiscal, the state government has initiated some measures to absorb the shock and ensure revival of the economy. The state’s economic and other activities, barring the essential services, remained barred from May 5 to June 8. Beginning with its first unlocking from June 9, followed by second one from June 16 and the third from June 23, the state has by now seen the progressive unlocking of the market and economic activities. Incidentally, when Bihar, along with a few eastern states, was hit by the Yaas Cyclone for three days from May 26, it compounded the agony of the people. The full impact of the lockdown and unlocking process on the economic activities during the first quarter of the current fiscal would be known only by July-end or by early August, as the government would collect and collate the data from the main revenue earning departments (commercial taxes, transport, registration and stamp duty, land registration and mines and geology), as well as from the works departments (rural works for construction of rural roads, road construction department for highways and major roads, water resources, building construction and rural development), sources said. Yet, from before the lockdown, the state government had begun taking steps to absorb the future shock that was to unfold. The major step in this regard was the induction of nine ministers from the BJP and eight from the JD(U) in the council of ministers in early February by CM Nitish Kumar – four months after the formation of the government. It facilitated the decision-making process in various departments, observers felt. While the acute concerns about the second wave of coronavirus pandemic began to be raised from February across the country, the Bihar government extended the period for paddy procurement from the famers till February 21and wheat procurement till June 15, besides increasing the quantity of wheat to be purchased/procured from the farmers at the MSP. It, in a way, helped the farmers earn income. Besides, the harvest season, along with the related activities of threshing the grains, their packing, loading and unloading on to the trailers of tractors on way to the yards of the open markets, or to the officially designated procurement agencies like Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and Vyapar Mandals, also kept agricultural workers absorbed. Further, in tune with the government’s long-term policies to revive the economy, industries minister Shahnawaz Hussain took to pooling in the investors to establish ethanol production plants in the state. He said there has been tremendous response from the investors, which, in fact, had led him to announce that ethanol plants would be opened in every district by even providing the land of the closed sugar mills to them. Similarly, the government came out with its oxygen production and refilling incentive policy. As a result of it, proposals for nine oxygen production units worth Rs 67.28 crore had already been given stage-one clearance by the State Investment Promotion Board. On June 18, the government came out with its two policies for promoting and incentivizing entrepreneurial activities by way of subsidy worth 50% of the project cost with a maximum of Rs 5 lakh – Mukhyamantri Udyami Yojana (MUY) for women from general sections as well as from backward classes and also for transgenders, besides MUY for youths from the general sections and backward classes. Hussain said it was an extension of the already existing MUY for entrepreneurs from scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), first framed in 2018, followed by that for the extremely backward caste (EBC) groups. According to him, while projects of 5,100 SC and ST applicants had been selected, as many as 3,732 of them had been given first instalment of the incentive money in the form of subsidy, 3,132 others second instalment. As many as 1,418 others had the third and last amount of subsidy. Similarly, of the 1,918 selected EBC entrepreneurs, 1,266 have been paid the first instalment, 576 others second instalment and projects of 133 others had already become functional after getting the final third instalment of the incentive money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-takes-steps-to-ameliorate-covid-impact-revive-economy/articleshow/83878000.cms||Abhay Singh

Sources in state police headquarters said Maoists had remained mostly unaffected during the first phase of the pandemic last year, but several of them fell ill in the second wave. A senior IPS officer said the fear of pandemic among Maoists could be gauged from the fact that they have barred their sympathisers, logistic suppliers and villagers to come around their hideouts in jungles. “We have got to know that the Maoists direct villagers to keep the supplies or ration for daily use at a particular spot. They then pick up those items only after villagers return. The pandemic has limited their activities in the state,” the officer said. He added though several Maoist cadres and commanders had got infected in the second wave, there was no report of any death. “Maoists did get infected with Covid-19. This was established from their communication interceptions. However, none had come out of hideouts for treatment in any hospital,” he said. The officer added security agencies got to know from surveillance that Maoists were procuring medicines in jungles. “Some people supplying these medicines to Maoists were also intercepted near Chhakarbandha hills at Gaya-Aurangabad border,” he said. ADG (operation) Sushil Mansingh Khopde said there were inputs that one or two cadres had died, but nothing is confirmed. “Several Maoists were symptomatic and suffering from cold and cough. This happened when the second wave was at its peak in April and May,” he said. Gaya ASP (operation) Dharmendra Kumar Jha said reports about deaths of two Maoists in jungles of Chhakarbandha at Gaya-Aurangabad border were received. “However, these deaths were not unconfirmed. Several attempts were made to deliver medicines to Maoists in Chhakarbandha by locals. At least 30 Maoist cadres had fallen ill in Chhakarbandha sub-zone,” Jha said. Arwal, Aurangabad, Banka, East Champaran, Gaya, Jamui, Jehanabad, Kaimur, Lakhisarai, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda, Nawada, Rohtas, Vaishali and West Champaran are the Maoist-hit districts in the state as per Union ministry of home affairs. However, Maoist violence is mostly reported from Gaya, Aurangabad, Jamui, Munger and Lakhisarai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-19-hits-maoists-hard-in-bihar-many-infected/articleshow/83878041.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Will touch Bihar CM’s feet, but oppose his wrong policies: Chirag Paswan||PATNA: LJP MP from Jamui, Chirag Paswan, has claimed that he will touch the feet of chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar due to the latter’s seniority in politics, but oppose his policies. In an interview to a private news channel on Saturday, Chirag said, “I will have no hesitation in touching the CM’s feet whenever I meet him. But I will continue to oppose him for his policies.” Deeply hurt after the coup in the LJP, which was founded by his father and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Chirag revealed, “I decided to go solo in the Bihar assembly polls last year after a meeting of senior party leaders which was also attended by my uncle, Pashupati Kumar Paras.” To a query, he replied that his father had advised him not to contest the assembly polls in coalition with the JD (U) which had caused a split in the party in 2005 and 2010. “The LJP was in coalition with the BJP,” he said and blamed the JD (U) for the recent coup. Chirag also alleged that his uncle not only deserted him, but led to a crisis in the LJP even before the death anniversary of senior Paswan, who had nurtured the party. “He stabbed me,” he told the channel. Referring to RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s offer to join hands, Chirag said he would like to thank him. “He is like my younger brother. I honour his offer, but my priority is to make the ‘Ashirvad Yatra’ a grand success.” He, however, admitted that the two political stalwarts — Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Pawan — had cordial relations. “They have worked together for a long time,” he said and accused the BJP of leaving him in the lurch when the LJP faced a political turmoil after its five MPs quit. Reacting to the allegation, BJP spokesperson, Nikhil Anand, told this reporter, “What happened in the LJP is a family affair or an internal matter. The BJP has nothing to do with the internal matter of any political party.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-will-touch-cms-feet-but-oppose-his-wrong-policies/articleshow/83878294.cms||Ramashankar
---||Hyderabad||Don’t give up on your dreams, ace shuttler P V Sindhu tells youth||HYDERABAD: When world badminton champion and Olympic silver medallist P V Sindhu suffered a stress fracture in 2015, she feared her sporting career would end prematurely. But like a true champion, she refused to give up. She fought the odds and today she is the frontrunner to be India’s flag-bearer at the Tokyo Olympics. Sindhu, who was one of the speakers at TEDxYouth@SuchitraAcademy organised by Suchitra Academy International School, Hyderabad on Saturday, shared the highs and lows of her badminton career. “People say that the most striking feature of my game is my attitude and never-say-die spirit. I had my highs and lows, a time when I thought I will not be able to do it. A time when I thought I may let my fans down,” said the Padma Bhushan awardee. “I wasn’t winning games. My career graph was hitting a low. People said I was not performing well. Now, when I look back to those times, I think, what a dark phase it was.” She said that the never-say-die spirit is easy to talk about but very hard to follow in real life. “During one of the practice sessions, I injured my ankle. I was on a break for 4-5 months with an important tournament just around the corner and my world was literally crashing. I didn’t have confidence and I did not think I would make a comeback or give my 100%,” said Sindhu adding that her injury was severe and that she couldn’t perform with that pain. “I thought my career was over. Trust me, I really thought this was it,” she added. Recalling what motivated her during the phase, she added, “One day, I was going through old photographs of my training days and I just hit a pause and thought is it really over? How could I even think that? As a sportsperson, I decided to commit myself to be the better version of myself every day. Where did that passion go? Where did that never-say-die spirit disappear?” “I was just thinking to myself that it was the time to reset my thoughts, hold myself together, and bring back the zeal that I had begun with,” she said and added that she had begun to practice with a cast on her leg at the academy and home and had to keep wearing it for more than four to five months. “I just thought about my goal and nothing else. I think the rest is history,” said the recipient of the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award. She said that after the injury, she came back much stronger, won a lot more tournaments, including the World Championship and Olympic silver medal. “I proved myself wrong,” she said. . “We just need to focus on what will help us to rise up after every pause or setback. Take a moment, just pause, reset, and bounce back stronger,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-give-up-on-your-dreams-ace-shuttler-sindhu-tells-youth/articleshow/83879976.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Kolkata||Three day market closure in pockets of South 24 Parganas, Howrah||KOLKATA/HOWRAH: Markets in Sonarpur-Rajpur municipality in South 24 Parganas and in north Howrah will remain shut for three days to bring down the positivity rate to nil. In these two areas, the positivity rates are still high, and since markets are the super-spreader zones, the civic authorities want to shut them to contain the spread. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee herself has asked these zones to adopt measures to minimize the positivity rates. Sonarpur-Rajpur municipality administrator Pallab Das said, “We held a series of meetings after 114 people tested positive here in the last two weeks. On Friday, 12 tested positive. This is why we collectively decided to close 15 markets in the area from Monday to Wednesday. On July 1 and 2, we will review the situation and decide the next course of action.” However, medicines, milk and bread retailing will be exempted from this closure. Niladri Nag, a businessman from Sherwood Residential Complex, said, “We have no problem if the market remains shut for three days. We can stock things for a week. But the bigger question is whether this shutdown would be of any efficacy. There should be wider vigil in the market where people don’t social distancing and often lower their guards.” Sarba Ghosh, a teacher from Sugam Park, said, “We hope the market authority will keep a tight watch on Sunday when there can be big crowds of buyers stocking up on things as much as possible before the closure. There can be an artificial crisis and resultant price rise of commodities.” In north Howrah and Liluah, the Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) has decided to shut bazars at Belur, Haraganj, Naskarpara in Ghusuri, and Liluah supermarket from Sunday to Tuesday. “We will review the situation on July 2 to decide the next course of action. The decline in the positivity rate has not been at our expected level,” said HMC administrator Arup Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-day-mkt-closure-in-pockets-of-s-24-parganas-howrah/articleshow/83878919.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MMRDA to open Sealink-BKC arm of flyover on Mon||Mumbai: Traffic snarls and congestion at the Kalanagar junction will soon ease, as the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will throw open the Sealink to Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) arm of the flyover on Monday. The 604 m long, two-lane flyover will criss-cross above the Kalanagar flyover on Western Express Highway. MMRDA had already opened the 715m long BKC-Sealink arm of the flyover on February 21. The Authorities are also carrying out construction of a 310-meter long and 12-feet wide road running through the government land to streamline traffic from Dharavi to Sealink. This work is expected to be complete by December 2021. The two flyovers and the bypass will serve the purpose of reducing traffic snarls.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Colleges conduct meetings to fix modalities of UG admission||KOLKATA: Activities in Kolkata colleges have picked up with senior teachers and management holding meetings — virtually — over the modalities of admissions to undergraduate courses that are likely to start in August if boards publish Class XII results by end of July. The meetings are taking place between principals, board members, heads of the various departments, senior professors and those maintaining the colleges’ websites to streamline issues like calculation of cut-offs and percentage of weightage. Major boards like ISC, CBSE and HS cancelled their Class XII board examinations due to the pandemic and have started evaluation of students based on the marks of Class X board exams and Class XI annual exams. “We have been having internal meetings to discuss different aspects of admissions. The colleges have to streamline several processes before the admissions start,” said Siuli Sarkar, principal of Lady Brabourne College. The admission will be conducted online. To ensure safe and swift operations, the colleges also need to improve their IT infrastructure. Many colleges have a separate website for admissions while others are toying with the idea of setting one up. Many have discussed the idea of online interviews or counselling sessions for students making it on the merit list before granting admissions to assess their aptitude in subjects they have applied for. Some institutions like St Xavier’s College, the Bhawanipur Education Society College, St Xavier’s University and JD Birla Institute have already started sharing admission information with candidates. “The admissions might begin if the boards publish the results by end of July,” said Tapan Kumar Poddar, president of the Calcutta University chapter of All Bengal Principals’ Council and principal of Vivekananda College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-conduct-meetings-to-fix-modalities-of-ug-admission/articleshow/83878944.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Nyaz Ahmad, coordinator of the Bihar Kisan Sangharsa Samanvay Samiti, Purnia unit, said, “The sacrifice of our colleagues at Delhi border will not go in vain. The Union government will have to pay attention to farmers’ demands. More than 600 farmers have laid down their lives fighting for the cause. It is independent India’s longest movement.” Mohammad Islamuddin, district president of the All-India Kisan Mahasabha, said, “If the mandi system has shortcomings, the government should make changes in them. Only 7,000 mandis are functional in the country against the requirement of 42,000.” “The mandi system was abolished in Bihar in 2006. The MSP for maize, fixed by the government, is Rs 1,860 per quintal. However, farmers are unable to sell their produce at the MSP,” he added. Avinash Paswan, a member of Bihar Kisan Sangharsa Samanvay Samiti, Purnia unit, said, “In the name of reforms in the farm sector, the government is trying to hand over agri business to big private players. As a result, the remaining mandis will come to an end under the influence of corporate houses.” Earlier, wearing black badges, farmer leaders also paid floral tributes to Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, a seer as well as farmer leader who first propagated peasant movement in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/purnia-farmers-to-centre-repeal-farm-laws/articleshow/83878351.cms||---

The government notification follows the recommendations of a review committee headed by the education department’s secretary and constituted by the department on June 22, 2021. The committee was constituted to review all the cases of candidates who had qualified the 2011 State Teacher Eligibility Test (STET), but whose certificates were not being considered valid for the appointment now and also those who qualified the 2019 STET but whose names did not figure on the merit list. The committee observed that as per National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE)’s letter dated June 9, 2021, STET certificates issued with effect from February 11, 2011 would remain valid lifelong. The state government has been requested to initiate necessary action accordingly. Hence, as per the department’s order, the validity of certificates awarded on the basis of Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) organised for classes I to VIII would remain valid for appointment lifelong with effect from May, 2012. Similarly, the validity of STET certificates would also remain lifelong with effect from June 2012. It was further decided that all candidates who were declared to have ‘qualified’ on the basis of minimum marks awarded in STET 2019 would be given an opportunity to participate in the seventh phase of appointments of teachers in secondary and higher secondary schools. Appointment of teachers in primary and secondary schools in the state is facilitated by the appointment authorities constituted under district boards and civic bodies in the light of the guidelines and merit list would be prepared on the basis of merit, the notification added. The STET-qualified candidates had been agitating for the last several days demanding validity of their test results and inclusion on the merit list. The education minister had already announced that justice would be done to all the eligible candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/more-stet-qualified-candidates-to-be-hired-in-seventh-phase-govt/articleshow/83878052.cms||B K Mishra

Now, the familiar dakia or postman would provide the same service and that too on your doorsteps. This newly introduced service would be provided by all the post offices of the Prayagraj and Kaushambi district from next month. The step is being considered as a further expansion of the range of services being offered by the postmen and post offices which will now facilitate car and bike insurance. “We have started giving training for this new service to our staff members and we plan to start the same from July 1. Any customer can visit the post office to avail the service or if needed, the postmen would come to your house and provide the facility of insuring vehicles," said senior superintendent post (SSP), Prayagraj zone, Sanjay D Akhade while talking to TOI. He further added that the service has been started through India Post Payment Bank (IPPB). Any vehicle owner can get his vehicle insured by either visiting the post offices or by calling 155299, paving way for the postman to visit home and insure the vehicle. To take advantage of this facility sitting at home however one needs to have an account with India Post Payment Bank. For this, the bank has tied up with Bajaj Allianz and Tata AIG General Insurance Companies. The above insurance facilities will be completely paperless and the person wishing to insure will have to show the registration certificate (RC) of his or her bike or car and a copy of the old insurance. The amount of insurance premium will be debited from your IPPB account of the Department of Posts, explains Akhade. The insurance policy will be available immediately and will not require any paperwork, he added. The benefit of this facility can be availed through all the postmen of the post office. Now postmen can go from door to door and provide the benefit of this facility to the people at their homes. To take advantage of this facility, it is necessary to have an account in the IPPB of the department of posts. “Anyone who does not have an account at IPPB, the same would be opened by providing Aadhaar and mobile number and the process would take just five minutes," said the SSP. The IIPB of the postal department has been created by the government to deliver services from the bank to the rural areas where this service would be very helpful, feels the official. To avail of this facility at your doorstep, call 155299 or place a request on the Post Info App or click on ccc.cept.gov.in/ServiceRequest/request.aspx, he informed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/now-postman-to-provide-vehicle-insurance-at-doorstep/articleshow/83878709.cms||---

These new cases were reported in Patna (17), Muzaffarpur (13), Saharsa (11), Begusarai (10), Nalanda (10), and Purnia (10). Two deaths, one in Nalanda and another in Nawada, were also registered, taking the state’s toll to 9,579. No figures on vaccination were shared by the state government on Saturday. However, the data of the Union government states that 1.55 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines, including 1.33 crore first doses and 22 lakh second doses, have been administered to the beneficiaries in Bihar so far. Meanwhile, the state is gearing up for a mega immunisation drive as part of which it has targeted to vaccinate 6 crore people in six months from July. Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh told TOI that nearly 1 lakh beneficiaries would be inoculated on July 1. “We have already vaccinated 83,562 people on Friday. While Pune had vaccinated 1.39 lakh people that day, Mumbai inoculated 86,520 beneficiaries,” he added. The DM pointed out that the vaccination drive would not be conducted at all the designated places on Sunday except three 24X7 immunisation sites — Hotel Patliputra Ashok, Patliputra Sports Complex and Polytechnic College — and two evening centres — S K Memorial Hall and Ramdeo Mahto Community Centre in Patna City. “The other centres will be sanitized and a day off given to the healthcare workers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/number-of-new-cases-dips-as-190-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-bihar/articleshow/83878054.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Kushwaha was reacting to leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s statement that the state government would fall in the next 2 to 3 months. Responding to a media query, Kushwaha also countered the RJD’s claim that 17 JD(U) MLAs were in touch with it to topple the Nitish government. “If the RJD leaders are claiming that our 17 MLAs are in touch with them, they should realise that many RJD MLAs are also in our contacts. I will not talk more on this issue at this juncture because politics is considered the game of possibilities,” he said. Kushwaha, who merged his RLSP three months back with the JD(U), was talking to media persons at his new residence here. Kushwaha was made a member of the Bihar legislative council weeks after he merged his party with the JD(U). Earlier on Friday, Tejashwi, while responding to the demands of the RJD supporters in his Raghopur assembly constituency, had told the locals, “Don’t be upset, wait for some time. This government will fall in the next 2 to 3 months. Then, all your works will be done.” Tejashwi’s statement has caused an upheaval in the state’s politics, inviting sharp reactions from the NDA leaders, especially those from the JD(U) and the BJP. A few days ago, a senior RJD leader, Shyam Rajak, who was earlier a minister in the Nitish Kumar-led cabinet, had claimed that altogether 17 JD(U) MLAs are in touch with the RJD leaders and they would help in toppling the Nitish government. Reacting to Tejashwi’s statement, senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday said, “The leader of opposition is daydreaming like Mungeri Lal. People of Bihar has given mandate to the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government and the government will complete its full term of five years with the motto of ‘Justice with Development’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-govt-to-complete-its-full-term-kushwaha/articleshow/83878251.cms||Madan Kumar

The participants were the 100 cities selected under the mission, including four from Bihar – Patna, Muzaffarpur, Biharsharif and Bhagalpur. The awards were given to smart cities on the basis of several parameters, such as social aspects, governance, culture, urban environment, sanitation, economy, environment, water and urban mobility. Sustainable business model of Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCC) and innovation in Covid-19 management were also counted for the awards. Harshita, public relations officer of Patna Smart City Limited, said more weightage was given to utilisation of the funds, projects executed, projects in the tender stage and awarded by the smart cities. “There are several parameters to judge the smart cities. In Bihar, the projects are not matured to utilise funds,” she told this newspaper. As per the current ranking of smart cities, Patna stood at 61st position among all the smart cities in the country, Biharsharif (70), Bhagalpur (91) and Muzaffarpur (99). The PSCL has so far received Rs 380 crore, including 194 crore, from the Centre. Of the amount, Rs 131 crore has been utilised. Under the PSCL, only two projects – mega screen at Gandhi Maidan and redevelopment of Beerchand Patel Path – have been completed. Adalatganj lake area redevelopment, Jan Seva Kendra, Intermediate Public Transport Stand, Intelligent Solid Waste Management and ICCC-cum-PSCL building are under construction. Six projects – 3D wall painting, facelift of S K Memorial Hall, Happy Streets, development of road joining Beerchand Patel Marg, installation of e-toilets and ICCC – are under the tender stage. State urban development and housing department minister Tarkishore Prasad and principal secretary Anand Kishor could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-city-from-bihar-smart-enough-to-bag-award/articleshow/83878022.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Eat healthy, wear masks to keep Covid and viral infections at bay||PATNA: With the arrival of the monsoon season, the fear of vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue, encephalitis and chikungunya looms large in Bihar. The residents are also concerned about the spread of Covid-19 during this period. Although no direct relationship between the rainy season and the spread of Covid infections has yet been medically established, health experts maintain that the former could have an indirect impact on the latter. Spitting on the roads, for instance, is a common and unhygienic practice in both urban and rural areas, which increases the risk of virus transmission. Rainwater can wash away the virus from such contaminated surfaces. Moreover, a lot of people spend more time at home during the rainy season, which reduces their chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, told this reporter, “Although there is no relationship between rains and the spread of corona, people, especially children, are more susceptible to viral diseases during the season. If someone suffers from a vector-borne disease, his immunity will become weak. Consequently, he will be attacked by Covid easily.” Paediatrician, Dr Arun Shah, observed that Covid-19 was neither water-borne nor vector-borne, but air-borne. “However, people should protect themselves from all infections so that their immunity is not compromised. We already know that Covid is more harmful for people with comorbidities,” he said. Dr Shah also urged people to protect themselves from viral infections and stay healthy. “Besides, they should continue washing hands frequently, wearing masks, eating healthy, using personal utensils, keeping distance, and avoiding crowded areas that are not properly ventilated,” he added. The principal of Government Ayurvedic College, Dr Dineshwar Prasad, pointed out that all infectious diseases spread rapidly and advised people to stay home during the monsoon season. Yoga expert, Dr Prabhakar Devraj, said, “One should take all precautions to ensure that one does not suffer from infectious diseases and Covid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eat-healthy-wear-masks-to-keep-covid-and-viral-infections-at-bay/articleshow/83877944.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar govt has failed in dealing with floods, erosion: Tejashwi Prasad Yadav||PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Saturday accused the state government of meting out step-motherly treatment to the people living in areas represented in assembly by members of opposition parties. He also uploaded flood-related questions to his Twitter handle and claimed these issues were raised even during the budget session of the state assembly. “In the assembly, I had asked many questions related to erosion and floods. However, except false assurances, the Nitish government did not take any concrete step,” Tejashwi tweeted on Saturday, a day after visiting Raghopur, his assembly constituency. Even at Raghopur, the younger Yadav scion lashed at the government for not initiating any development work in the area. “This is Laluji’s area and Tejashwi is winning from here. The government is intentionally not carrying out any developmental work,” Tejahswi said. He alleged the government was not releasing money for development works in Raghopur. Meanwhile, the ruling JD(U) has rubbished the allegations levelled by Tejashwi and reminded him of problems people had faced due to floods and erosion during Lalu-Rabri regime. “During his parents’ time, lakhs of people used to get displaced and nothing was done to stop erosion. In fact, gone are the days when the entire village used to get swallowed,” JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said, adding the water resources department was working with promptness in the entire state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-has-failed-in-dealing-with-floods-erosion-tejas/articleshow/83878283.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Mumbai||Returning to Mumbai by flight? Check the time of RT-PCR report||MUMBAI: For air passengers returning to Mumbai after a short trip to another state, getting a negative status on the RT-PCR report is only one hurdle crossed. What is equally important is the time the laboratory issued the report, because unlike most other states in India, the nitty-gritties involved in the BMC norm on this matter can be rather stifling. A Mumbai resident’s one-day travel itinerary to Goa collapsed after the Mumbai laboratory issued her RT-PCR report earlier than she expected. The BMC order on the compulsory negative RT-PCR report states that it "will have to be issued from upto a maximum of 48 hours before the time of passengers' entry from any part of the country into Maharashtra". Sonia Bhatia (name changed on request) had her sample collected on Friday morning and the report was issued at 5.59pm the same day. She was to fly to Goa on Saturday morning and return on Sunday by a 6.30pm IndiGo departure to Mumbai. But the IndiGo website specifies that the 48 hour "RT-PCR timeline starts from the report issuance time. Passengers not in possession of the same will be denied boarding”. Bhatia said: "The airline officials in Mumbai and Goa said I had narrowly missed the deadline.” What was worse, she learnt that when flights to Mumbai are delayed, passengers with RT-PCR reports close to the 48-hour deadline have to undergo a fresh test. Read AlsoAfter RT-PCR only order, Covid positivity jumps in Maharashtra, 18 districtsCovid-19 test positivity rates for districts as well as the state increased significantly a day after the state government ruled that weekly positivity rates (WPR) for its district-wise, multi-level unlock plan would be calculated only on the basis of RT-PCR reports.But when flying to smaller cities like Goa, a delayed flight too spells trouble. In Goa, swabs are collected only between 10am and 1pm. "My flight was delayed, I missed the deadline for taking test. Goa airport doesn’t have an RT-PCR testing facility. Then again, in Goa, swabs aren't collected on Sunday. So now I’ll test on Monday and fly out on Tuesday. Alternatively, I’m trying to book myself on a Sunday afternoon flight to Mumbai. How difficult travel has become,’’ she said, adding that Maharashtra could at least deem the PCR report valid for 72 hours like most other states. The BMC order was issued on May 13, when Covid cases were high. Said a travel agent: "The common pattern with the state government has been, issue a travel restriction when Covid cases are high and then forget about it altogether. Covid cases have dropped, many have been vaccinated, but there has been no revision, no change to the 48-hour order."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/returning-to-mumbai-by-flight-check-the-time-of-rt-pcr-report/articleshow/83880058.cms||---

ED booked Baheti under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act – 2002 (PMLA) and arrested him on Thursday. He was produced before a special court in Nagpur and remanded in custody for eight days. Baheti is a key accused in the Rs 4 crore Krushnur grain scam that was unearthed by the Nanded police, then headed by IPS officer Chandrakishor Mina, in July 2018. The scam refers to the alleged diversion of wheat and rice consignments, meant for public distribution scheme from the Food Corporation of India’s (FCI) godown to the facility of India Mega Agro Anaj Limited, owned by Baheti at the Krushnur MIDC under the Kuntur police area in Nanded. The police then seized 10 trucks loaded with rice and wheat gunny bags bearing monograms of government of Punjab and the FCI. Baheti and 18 others, including 10 truck drivers, were arrested in the ensuing investigation by the state CID, which has, till date, filed two chargesheets _ first on August 6, 2019 and the second on March 19, 2020. Baheti was released after the HC granted him bail in May 2019. Following the latest development, ED in its statement maintained ‘This scam involved more than 3,000 ration shops of two Districts and 28 godowns of the Food Corporation of India. Some unknown agents, traders, business people and government officials were also involved in the said scam.’ In a press statement, ED has stated that the investigation against Baheti is based on the FIR and chargesheet filed by Nanded police against Baheti under relevant provisions of Indian Penal Code and Essential Commodities Act. ‘The accused gained an illicit pecuniary advantage from public distribution system by forming syndicate and thereby started systematic theft of government quota ration grain at Nanded. During the investigation, it was revealed that the accused person had indulged in unlawful activities and illegal profiteering’ read the release. ‘The modus operandi was that PDS food grain (wheat and rice) from the warehouses of Food Corporation of India was transported in trucks to various tehsils of Nanded district and Hingoli districts of Maharashtra. These trucks were diverted to the factory of Baheti namely M/s India Agro Anaj Limited instead of their designated destination’ stated the ED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-industrialist-held-by-ed-in-grain-scam/articleshow/83876211.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Being treated with ECMO, akin to a heart-lung bypass machine used in open-heart surgery, enabled rest to the boy’s heart muscles, giving it time to recover. ECMO pumps and oxygenates a patient’s blood outside the body allowing the heart and lungs to rest. The Paravur resident was referred to Amrita hospital in Kochi. MIS-C in children is now linked to Covid-19. He was most likely had an asymptomatic Covid-19 or exposed to Covid-19 in the weeks preceding to presentation as widened by positive antibody titers to Covid-19 in his blood. MIS-C had severely affected his heart muscles, which were inflamed and unable to pump blood. His BP had dropped to extremely low levels. Despite medications and ventilator support, his condition didn’t improve. “We soon realized that the child needed more medical attention, and it was decided that an ECMO would help his recovery as the machine would take over the heart-lung function. Putting the child on ECMO for a few days allowed rest to his heart muscles, giving it time to recover,” said Dr Sajith Kesavan, head, department of Paediatric Pulmonary and Critical Care, Amrita Hospital. The boy was taken off ECMO after 72 hours and is out of intensive care now. “The child will be back to a normal 11-year-old child’s routine in a few weeks,” said Dr Suma Balan, consultant paediatrician and paediatric rheumatologist, Amrita Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/city-doctors-use-ecmo-to-save-11-yr-old/articleshow/83878922.cms||---

She made a U-turn on her return to Baghpat and filled the nomination form as the RLD candidate on Saturday. Later, she claimed in a press conference in Baghpat that she was forcibly made to join BJP though her pictures wearing a BJP stole and standing with the BJP MP had gone viral earlier. Her husband Jai Kishore said, “We were taken away and there we were forced to join BJP with a threat that if we did not succumb to the pressure, police cases would be filed against us. What could we have done in those circumstances? But we are true soldiers of the RLD and my wife has filed nomination as the RLD candidate.” Mamta Kishore was elected as member from ward 13 which is a reserved seat. Notably, SP and RLD had jointly made Mamta Kishore their candidate for the post of district panchayat president. Out of 20 district panchayat members elected in the recently held panchayat polls, only four seats went to BJP. Despite repeated attempts, Baghpat MP Satyapal Singh could not be accessed for his comments. Local leadership, too, kept mum on the development. BJP, meanwhile, has fielded Babli Devi as candidate for the post of president. Interestingly, Babli Devi, too, had been elected as SP candidate and had recently defected to BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/hours-after-joining-bjp-dist-panchayat-chief-candidate-back-in-rld-fold-to-fill-nomination-form/articleshow/83877878.cms||Sandeep Rai

Speaking at a news conference in Kochi on Saturday, Sabu said he resigned from Congress due to the conviction that he can’t continue to serve the public as a party leader. Those close to Sabu said that he was having a strained relationship with Congress leadership after the party denied him a ticket to contest from Tripunithura in the recent assembly elections. But Sabu denied it during the news conference. Sabu had been a prominent runner for mayor’s post when the UDF came to power in Kochi Corporation in 2010. As the rival groups in the party objected to electing Sabu as the mayor, Tony Chammany became the mayor then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-b-sabu-quits-cong-associates-with-cpm/articleshow/83878914.cms||---

A number of activists, including RSS workers, members of communist and socialist organisations were jailed under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) during the emergency imposed by then prime minister Indira Gandhi. The Smruti Mandir is a training campus for the RSS, and also has a memorial to Dr Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, founder of RSS. Joshi is a swayamsevak, and said he had completed the third-year officer training camp, the ultimate training session for RSS workers. This is perhaps the first time a full-time RSS worker held a protest, even if symbolic, at the RSS campus in Nagpur, where the Hindutva fountainhead has its headquarters. Joshi has threatened to commit self-immolation at Reshimbagh on October 15, if the pension demand is not met. At Reshimbagh, Joshi said he was allowed to enter the premises, pay homage to Hedgewar but not allowed to take any pictures. “It was disheartening they did not allow us to click a photo,” said his wife Mangala, who was accompanying him. An officer at Kotwali police station, where Joshi was taken, said they had reached the spot as there were directives from seniors about Joshi’s protest at Reshimbagh. He cooperated and agreed to hold the protest elsewhere on police request. Joshi said he was jailed for 15 months from 1976 along with his father Sadashivrao. The duo was lodged in Raipur jail of then Madhya Pradesh. Originally a resident of Bhilai in Chhattisgarh, where he was politically active, Joshi has now shifted to Aurangabad. Joshi’s protest was targeted at both RSS Sarsanghchalak (chief) Mohan Bhagwat and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Despite a number of letters, including to Bhagwat and Modi, there has been no response. It was also due to the sacrifice of numerous activists during the emergency that Modi, himself a swayamsevak, became prime minister. He could not have become the PM without the blessings of RSS. Now, both Modi and Bhagwat seem to have forgotten the foot soldiers who fought for maintenance of democracy in the country,” Joshi told TOI, after being released by the police. He was also accompanied by Annaji Rajdhare of Nagpur, who also identified himself as an RSS worker, and anti-emergency activist who had been jailed. “I continue to be an RSS worker, regularly attending shakhas. I have utmost respect for the organization and remain loyal,” said Joshi. He demanded that every one who suffered police atrocities and was jailed under MISA should be given pension and status at par with freedom fighters. Joshi said along with him there were members of Jamaat-e-Islami and socialist leaders like Madhu Limaye, Sharad Yadav and other members from leftist and socialist organizations. He had even joined Samata Party leader George Fernandes in his election campaign in Raipur after the emergency, said Joshi. He has also met Anna Hazare and and RSS senior worker Sambhaji Bhide, who have assured support in taking up the matter further. “The issue has been raised by a number of outfits and the matter was raised in Parliament too. However, as the government remains indifferent, I decided to take up the cause on my own,” he said. Rajesh Loya, city chief of RSS, confirmed that Joshi is a swayamsevak, and said it was an issue to be dealt with by the central government. The RSS has no role in the pension matter, he said. Joshi said he has the support of a number of activists of the anti-emergency movement. They could have also turned up but did not due to Covid. “I am already getting phone calls from across the country,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rss-worker-protests-at-smruti-mandir-demands-pension-for-misa-detainees/articleshow/83896367.cms||Shishir Arya

Navy has however denied any trespass or security breach in the incident. The 18-year-old in military camouflage was intercepted by Navy officials and was handed over to the Harbour police. A case was registered against him invoking Sections 140 (wearing garb or carrying token used by soldier, sailor or airman by whoever, not being a soldier), 419 (cheating by personation), 447 (criminal trespass), and 465 (forgery) of the IPC. Police later released him on bail as they identified that he had no ulterior motives. “He always wanted to join the forces. However, he flunked the military recruitment drive held six months ago even as a few of his friends cleared the test. He told his family and friends that he was selected and that he was under training,” said an officer with the Harbour police. The matter however attained significance as the incident happened on Friday, hours after the departure of defence minister Rajnath Singh who was at the Southern Naval Command in the city for the review of the works on indigenous aircraft carrier. The Navy however said in a statement that that there was ‘no security lapse’ at the gate. “A boy in his late teens tried to enter the naval base without having proper defence identity card through the gate. The guard on duty held him and handed him to his superior,” Navy clarified in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/youth-booked-for-attempt-to-trespass-into-naval-area/articleshow/83878937.cms||---

The International Day against drug abuse and illicit trafficking has been observed annually on June 26. It is aimed at creating awareness among the public regarding the dangers of drug abuse and to encourage co-operation between the public and legal authorities in the fight against drugs. South Goa SP Pankaj Kumar Singh said that though drug dealers have constantly tried to set up their business in Goa, “they have been constantly battered by numerous raids and seizures conducted by Goa Police.” “Goa police have in effect broken the backbone of this illicit trade by seizing large quantities of drugs and arresting hundreds of drug dealers. We are determined to end drug abuse in Goa and we have implemented stringent measures to curb this menace,” Singh said even as he urged the public to report any drug-related activities in their locality. “All police inspectors and sub-divisional police officers (SDPOs) have been instructed to take strict action against any person found dealing or consuming drugs and other psychotropic substances,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/police-spread-word-on-ills-of-drug-abuse/articleshow/83881307.cms||---
---||Pune||Crowdfunding activities see major rise as compared to pre-pandemic times||PUNE: There has been a significant rise in crowdfunding activities across the country and donations have almost doubled as compared to pre-Covid days. The trend may also indicate the financial crisis faced by people due to the pandemic.Piyush Jain, co-founder and chief executive officer at ImpactGuru.com, said, “We receive an average five donations, per minute. Just before the peak of the second wave, the fundraising velocity was at one donation, per second. Patients have raised money to fund Covid treatment expenses, cover long-term hospital/ ICU treatment, lung transplants and even black fungus related ailments. People can donate as much as Rs 5 crore to as little as Re 1.”Anoj Viswanathan, co-founder and president of Milaap, said, “The outpouring of global solidarity and the response has helped raise more than Rs 120 crore for Covid-19 causes from 3.5 lakh donors. During the first wave, the preliminary theme of fundraising was for meals for the worst-affected segments, like daily wage earners and migrant workers; followed by funds for medicines and personal protective equipment for healthcare and other frontline workers. In the second wave, campaigns concentrated on supply of hospital essentials, oxygen concentrators and supplies for frontline workers, as well as individual campaigns focused on memorials and hospitalizations costs.”He added that, until May 2021, global donors have contributed around Rs 54 crore to various causes.While Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Pune, and Chennai account for over 50% of total donations, Tier II cities are catching up. India ranks as the 14th most generous country according to the Charitable Aid Foundation (CAF) World Giving Index 2021.In addition to campaigns to support Covid expense, crowd funders have helped those seeking money for higher education, daily wage workers, the elderly and underprivileged.Another category garnering attention on such portals is rare diseases, specifically raising funds for Zolgensma, said to be the most expensive drug which is a potential cure for children diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. Mihir Kamat, father of 10-month-old Teera, raised Rs 15 crore from 87,000 donors for the drug on Impactguru.com. “Inspired by a success story in Canada, we started a crowdfunding campaign and reached our target. Parents, dabbawallas, people from the remotest parts of India were donating, some even giving Rs 10 as it was all they could afford. We even reached out to the Union and state governments, who waived off GST and import duty for Zolgensma, to the tune of Rs 6 crore,” he shared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crowdfunding-activities-see-major-rise-as-compared-to-pre-pandemic-times/articleshow/83880095.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Allegations of horse-trading rife in Bijnor, independents hold key to dist panchayat president poll||BIJNOR: Allegations and counter allegations of horse-trading are flying thick in Bijnor as both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)and the Samajwadi Party (SP) are in the race to win the district panchayat president poll. On Saturday, former district panchayat chairman Sakendra Pratap Singh filled the nomination as the BJP candidate while the SP fielded Charanjeet Kaur. In total there are 56 elected district panchayat members out of which the SP and its alliance – Rashtriya Lok Dal and Bharatiya Kisan Union -- have 20 members. The BJP has only eight and the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) six but they have already shown allegiance towards the BJP. Now, the remaining 22 members are independents and Bhim Army supporters and are being aggressively wooed by both these parties. BJP’s candidate Sakendra Pratap Singh filed his nomination papers in presence of state minister Ashok Katariya, former Member Parliament (MP), Bhartendra Singh and district president, Subhash Valmiki. Although the BJP won only eight seats, Singh claimed that there are 32 district panchayat members in his camp. On the other hand, Charanjeet Kaur claimed that her party has the strength to win the presidential post. The SP MLA from Nagina assembly seat, Manoj Paras, said, “All people know that the BJP has lost the district panchayat members' poll in the state. But now it wants to win the president’s post on the basis of hooliganism. The administration and the police are working as BJP workers. District panchayat members are being intimidated. They are using all means to win the poll. We have sent a memorandum to the President of India and demanded that the poll be conducted fairly and fearlessly.” The BSP seems to be marginalised in the polls. According to a BSP leader who did not wish to be named, the party was not in a position to get the president’s post. Therefore, it has not fielded any candidate. Speaking to TOI, BSP’s district president in Bijnor Jitendra Sagar said, “There is no guideline about the district panchayat chairman post from the party high command. We are not taking part in this poll but we are galvanizing our outfit. We will follow the instructions our party president will give in the coming days.” Voting is slated for July 3. In the bordering Amroha, BJP candidate Lalit Tanwar filed his nomination paper on Saturday. He is the son of former MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar. He has almost won the district panchayat president’s post as the nomination application of the other candidate, SP’s Sakina Begam, has been rejected because of inconsistencies in her nomination papers. Sakina Begam is the wife of six-time MLA from Amroha and former cabinet minister, Mahmood Ali. Ali is veteran leader of SP in Amroha. Disappointed by the rejection of his wife’s nomination, Ali said, “It is a murder of democracy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/allegations-of-horse-trading-rife-in-bijnor-independents-hold-key-to-dist-panchayat-president-poll/articleshow/83877890.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||For accurate results, more RT-PCR labs in rural Maharashtra||The state government’s move to rely on RT-PCR tests to determine weekly positivity rates will need more labs and swab collection centres in rural areas that do not have adequate Covid testing infrastructure currently. In districts like Osmanabad, Gadchiroli and others, only 12 to 15% of Covid tests are done via RT-PCR, currently the gold-standard to detect Covid. Officials in these districts are now demanding more specialised labs and swab collection centres to track their weekly positivity rates more accurately. In fact, data has shown that more than 50% of the state's districts are relying more on rapid antigen kits (RATs), than RT-PCR for Covid testing. Officials said they would need more labs to generate the kind of data the state is seeking to determine weekly positivity rates — key to its new unlock plan. State health minister Rajesh Tope said a meeting of all district authorities will be convened. “We will direct all RT-PCR labs to optimise their testing capacity. The state has the capacity to conduct 2 lakh daily tests. We will ensure there is more focus on RT-PCR tests, given the new orders,” he said. —||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/for-accurate-results-more-rt-pcr-labs-in-rural-maharashtra/articleshow/83880206.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Kochi||Kerala: Yellow alert of heavy rain sounded in seven districts||KOCHI: The southwest monsoon has been weak in the state. However, the weather department has indicated heavy rainfall of 7-11cm in seven districts from June 28-30. The yellow alert has been sounded for Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Malappuram, Wayanad and Kasaragod. There’s also a warning for thunderstorms with lightning very likely to occur at one or two places in Kerala from June 27-30. In the open seas, strong winds, with speeds reaching 40-50kmph gusting to 60kmph, are likely over the southwest and west-central Arabian Sea. The highest 24-hour rainfall has been recorded in Hosdurg with 4cm while Poonjar got 3cm and Vaikom, Kodungallur and Erimayur received 2cm rainfall each. For Kerala, the first month of the monsoon has been disappointing with 29% deficiency recorded in the state from June 1-26. Thiruvananthapuram, which gets good rainfall during this season, has the highest shortage with 49% rainfall, followed by Palakkad with 44%, Alappuzha at 39%, and Thrissur with 38%. Meanwhile, the unusual behavior of the monsoon continues with IMD stating that the progress of the southwest monsoon into eastern, central, and adjoining northwest India has been earlier than normal by 7-10 days. But, further progress is unlikely during the next week. As of now, the cumulative rainfall of the first month of the Indian summer monsoon till June 21 has been an excess of 37% above the long period average. Northwest India received the highest excess of 74% followed by central India with 58%. The southern peninsular regions have 24% excess and the northeast has 13% more rainfall. Private weather agency Skymet said that the monsoon raced to cover almost 80% of the country well before normal schedules. The low-pressure, which formed over the north Bay of Bengal, was instrumental in pushing the monsoon currents up to east Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, the monsoon surge over the west coast of India also became active due to the pull of this low-pressure area. And monsoon reached south Gujarat before time. It said that the overall rain surplus of the country would keep on decreasing until the first week of July. But east India will remain one of the rainiest metrological divisions until then. The monsoon will not progress further until July 6- 7. Therefore, north-west India, including Delhi, will continue with hot and humid weather, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/yellow-alert-of-heavy-rain-sounded-in-seven-districts/articleshow/83878942.cms||---

Now, these medicines are hardly moving off the shelf. With the second wave ebbing and demand for various medicines nosediving, pharmacists have returned some of the stock to the manufacturers but they can’t do the same for non-returnable ones like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Bevacizumab. Unless the requirement for Covid-related drugs shoot up in case the third wave strikes, pharmacists would be helpless once these drugs cross the expiry date. The demand for anti-fungal drugs has also gradually declined due to slight fall in cases of mucormycosis in the region. Unlike six doses of Remdesivir and one for Tocilizumab prescribed for Covid patients, up to 60-120 vials of Amphotericin B per patient are needed for treating mucormycosis. Hospitals are still sending their requisition for Amphotericin B to the collector’s office. “We are not sending any requirement for Remdesivir and Tocilizumab as already some stock is left with us,” said Dr Anup Marar of Orange City Hospital. Genetek Lifesciences Private Limited based in Wardha has stopped production of Remdesivir. Its proprietor Dr Mahendra Kshirsagar said the formulation is now readily available with them and they can kick-start production on demand any time. Hetal Thakkar, secretary of Nagpur Druggists and Chemists Association, said Remdesivir started losing it demand after WHO removed it from medicines prescribed for Covid. “At least 5,000 vials of Remdesivir would be available with stockists or distributors, carrying and forwarding agents and at the depots. Only time will tell what would happen to these drugs which have limited shelf life,” he said. Favipiravir was another most sought-after drug for Covid. “From around 10-12 strips per day, its demand increased to more than 3,000 strips per day in April. During the peak, Favipiravir stock would get exhausted in no time,” said Thakkar. Sunil Balani, stockist and retailer, who also co-owns Jai Baba Medical Stores, recalled delivering 50 vials of Remdesivir to a hospital at Sakoli on May 26 and another 52 to Kunal Hospital in city on May 16. “There has been no movement thereafter. Another common Covid medicine Faviflu, which once had an extremely high demand, doesn’t even find a mention in prescriptions today,” said Balani. Murlidhar Kewalramani of Suresh Medical Stores said that even high power steroids like Dexamethasone have no takers now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poor-demand-for-remdesivir-toci-leaves-pharmacists-worried/articleshow/83880092.cms||Soumitra Bose

All she did was to turn down a marriage proposal and what followed were events that almost destroyed her personal and professional lives. The suitor took revenge by trapping her in a narcotic case and getting her arrested by police. His conspiracy was revealed in a police crime branch probe after Viswanath approached the chief minister seeking justice. As per the crime branch report submitted before the judicial first class magistrate-III, the main accused is Harish, the son of the founder and chairman of a prominent hospital in the city. Harish is a UK-based businessman. Vivek Raj, a former employee of Sobha Viswanath has also been arraigned as an accused in the case. It was on January 21, the officers of Museum police station seized 480gm of ganja from Sobha Viswanath’s clothing store, Weavers Village, at Vazhuthacaud following a raid. Viswanath was not present when the search took place. Police later summoned her to the store and recorded her arrest. “My employees were also in the store. But the police did not care to consider the possibility that one of them might have placed it in the store. Instead, they took me into custody,” Sobha Viswanath said, adding that this made her suspicious about the possibility of a conspiracy. Since the ganja seized was less than a kilogramme, she was allowed get a station bail. Two months later, she filed a petition before the CM. Sobha Viswanath, 35, said that Harish was a family friend. She has been living separated from her husband for six years ago and her divorce case is pending before court. Following her separation from her husband, Harish, who was also a divorcee, expressed his wish to marry her. Since she had come out of an unhappy marriage, she was not willing to take another risk and hence, turned down his proposal. “This was two years before my arrest. After that I had no contact with that person,” she said. She did not hide her disbelief that he was spending all that time hatching plans to trap her. The probe was conducted by DSP S Amminikuttan. The probe team had found some suspicious movements of a maid while examining the surveillance camera footage of the store. On questioning, she revealed the involvement of Vivek. He had visited the store once and asked the maid to turn off the cameras. Later, Vivek showed the probe team more ganja hidden in the store’s bathroom, which the local police could not find. Following this, his arrest was recorded. Harish is yet to be arrested. The maid is also yet to be arraigned in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/woman-rejects-proposal-gets-trapped-in-ganja-case/articleshow/83878949.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Higher pollution aggravated Covid cases in Mumbai, Pune’||Mumbai: Cities, including Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, and Ahmedabad, experienced the highest number of Covid-19 cases and casualties between March and November 2020 owing to higher pollution levels involving PM 2.5 emission loads, says a new study. It was conducted by a team from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar, IITM-Pune, National Technology Institute Rourkela and IIT-Bhubaneswar. It was recently published in the Elsevier Journal. These emissions were mainly due to fossil fuel-based activities such as vehicular and industrial emissions, garbage burning and construction. The air has suspended particulate matter (PM). Many of these are a complex mixture of dust, pollen, soot and smoke. Of this, PM 2.5 is tiny and can invade the lung and affect the upper respiratory system, similar to Covid-19. “What is worrying is there is evidence that coronavirus sticks to fine particles such as PM 2.5, allowing them to move from one part to another by making the air-borne transmission of Covid-19 more effective. Rising pollution load is becoming more of a catalyst to aggravate Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Saroj Kumar Sahu, lead author of the study, which analysed data from 16 cities and showed two other hotspots in Maharashtra: Nagpur and Chandrapur. Other participants in the study included Poonam Mangaraj, Gufran Beig, Suvarna Tikle, Bhishma Tyagi and V Vinoj. Ashok Shingare, member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, said, “Keeping in mind the transport sector as a major source of pollution in Mumbai and Pune, we have leapfrogged from BS IV to BS VI (car engines) but implementation and adoption of these new vehicles is lacking.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/higher-pollution-aggravated-covid-cases-in-mumbai-pune/articleshow/83881321.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar
---||Aurangabad||No heavy vehicle turned up for lifting fly ash at Parli||Aurangabad: Happiness of residents from Pangri and surrounding villages in Parli of Beed district knew no bounds on Saturday, after none of the heavy vehicles turned up at the Parli Thermal Power Plant to lift fly ash.Pangri village is in the vicinity of Gopinathgadh of Parli, the constituency represented by social justice and special assistance department minister Dhananjay Munde in the Assembly, in Beed district. Villagers claimed that the development was a result of the unique agitation by village women, who intercepted 15 heavy vehicles carrying fly ash. Video clips and photographs of the women pulling the drivers down from the vehicles and hitting them with footwear for refusing to sweep the roads went viral on various social media platforms. The drivers of the trucks subsequently gave in to their demand and cleaned up the road with their shirts.Balu Munde (65), a villager, told TOI, “This was the first time that not even one heavy vehicle turned up at the thermal plant to lift fly ash available for free.”Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) records revealed that the Parli Thermal Power Station has a capacity of 1,170 MW and generates 7,55,167 tonnes of ash a year. Tens of heavy vehicles daily ply on the streets of Parli to lift thousands of tonnes of fly ash that is generated at the thermal power plant. This fly ash is available for free due to which there is a mad rush to lift it. This ash is used in the production of high quality fly ash bricks. Beed is one of the largest fly ash brick markets in the country. Improper covering of the fly ash results in pollution, apart from leaving layers of dust inside homes and utensil on daily basis.Another villager said, “To bring a check on the havoc caused by the fly ash in our lives, we have been making rounds of the offices thermal plant, deputy collector, ZP CEO, district collector, guardian minister, energy minister to chief minister, for years. The solution came only after we decided to resolve it ourselves.”Parli rural police station’s assistant inspector Maruti Munde said, “The residents of Parli and surrounding villages are upset and have pledged to sit on an indefinite agitation at Azad Maidan in Mumbai.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/no-heavy-vehicle-turned-up-for-lifting-fly-ash-at-parli/articleshow/83876201.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He added that they will continue a collaboration with the institute for another three months to sequence more samples sent from the state. Tope said, “We currently send 100 samples per district in a month. That number may be scaled up if there is a rise in cases reporting Delta-plus,” he told TOI on Saturday. Twenty-one samples from the state have tested positive for Delta-plus so far. Director of CSIR-IGIB, Anurag Agarwal, told TOI that the the tie-up with Maharashtra has yielded important genomic insights. “We remain committed to taking this partnership further. This is expected to go beyond sequencing and should be towards supporting the state in building genomics capacity at key medical institutions,” he said. State task force member Shashank Joshi said having more facilities locally in the state will help. “We need to test more samples for genomic sequencing. And for this, we need more laboratories,” Joshi said, adding that besides sequencing, sero surveys and clinical data are key to tracking the Delta-plus variant||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-ties-up-with-delhi-institute-for-surveillance/articleshow/83880132.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chennai||Toxic positivity and how to spot it||Chennai: Browsing through the positive posts put up on social media did help Abhinav Swaminathan during the pandemic. But, when he lost his grandmother recently to Covid-19, the same posts became jarring."The algorithm is set based on my activity so ‘positive’ posts keep cropping up on my timeline. But it gets annoying when you see a grim news item followed by three or four influencers talking about just spreading ‘positive vibes’. I had to unfollow them to reset my algorithm," says the 29-year-old IT professional from Madipakkam. "It is good to be positive, but sometimes these posts on positivity make me feel confused and my emotions seem invalid."During the pandemic, there has been great stress on the need to stay positive and spread happy vibes. On social media, influencers and life coaches with no background in the psychological sciences continue spreading ‘positivity’. But while staying upbeat, expressing gratitude and having a sunny outlook to life is good, the unrelenting stress on having to plaster a smile on your face and be constantly cheerful even while dealing with the grim reality is leading to a culture of toxic positivity on the internet, one that’s taking a toll on the mental health of many people.Divija Bhasin, a Delhi-based counselling psychologist and social media influencer, has been making Instagram reels and videos for more than a year. With a double master’s in psychology, Bhasin makes content on mental well-being. Her series ‘Psychologist’s Review of Reels’ calls out content creators who spread fake information on mental health issues such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression."There is too much wrong information on mental wellness. Most of them focus on smiling every day and being happy as cures to serious mental health issues. While they could be helpful, they are not going to cure anything," says the 24-year-old, who uses movies and other pop culture content to spread awareness about the importance of therapy during Covid-19. Packaging facts in an interesting manner without being preachy is key, she says. "This is important when it comes to spotting the difference between content that is positive and one that promotes toxic positivity," says Bhasin.For, toxic positivity ignores the realities, such as trauma. "What is the positive side to trauma? We need to first accept our pain and negative emotions to heal," she says. Even people’s bios on social media profiles that say "spreading positive vibes" and "hustle hard, spread only positivity" can be toxic in nature. "We should be realistic rather than positive in times such as this," she says.Influencers, though well-intentioned, can cause more damage, especially since they are not trained psychiatrists or psychologists, says Bhasin. "I have seen one who confuses being organized with obsessive compulsive disorder, and another who provides "cures" for depression," she says.While Bhasin believes mental health content should be created only by mental health professionals, Anna Nagar-based consultant psychiatrist Dr Vikas Prabhav says life coaches and influencers form a crucial part of the mental health system.He says there is a thin line between positive and toxic positive content. "If you feel guilty of experiencing negative emotions as everyone around you is telling you to be positive, it can impair your daily functioning," he says.In a period of collective trauma, one must come to terms with the inevitability of pain. "Using positivity to distract from pain can stop healing. If motivational messages on positivity make you feel guilty or not positive enough, just block or unfollow it," says Dr Prabhav.Celebrity and social media influencer who promotes positivity by mentioning the importance of seeking help and taking breaks on social media is Gabriella Natalie Charlton. The 21-year-old, who has been vocal about mental wellness, does not have a background in psychology. However, the reality-show star who recently contracted Covid-19, speaks on seeking professional help and encourages her 1 million followers to fully experience negative emotions and pain."Putting out messages on positivity can be tricky as I have so many young followers who can be easily influenced. I cannot force someone to overlook the difficulties they might be going through, that’s when my content would become toxic," she says.However, some people find following the right influencers online helpful at a time when they are forced to be in isolation. "Consumers also play a huge role in understanding what content is toxic. While we cannot control larger things like the pandemic, we can control what we consume online," says Devanandsha D, a 30-year-old consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/toxic-positivity-and-how-to-spot-it/articleshow/83877892.cms||Harshitha Kumayaa

A woman office bearer of the company was also arrested. Police were searching for the CEO, his wife and three others on the charge of cheating depositors of Rs 31.92 crore since 2018 by promising handsome returns of 270% for six months’ investment. A team headed by senior inspector Muralidhar Karpe, assistant inspector Shilpa Lambe, police constables Sachin Inamdar, Pravin Kanchan, and Balasaheb Bhongle arrested CEO Abhijit Sanjay Kulkarni (34) of Law College Road.

---||Kanpur||Several ‘firsts’ in Prez’s train journey to Kanpur||Kanpur: Railwaymen called President Ram Nath Kovind a “People’s President” for using a train to commute to Kanpur. President Kovind travelled to Kanpur from Delhi by the Presidential train on Friday, June 25. This Journey of the President has marked several “firsts” in the history of Indian Railways in general and North Central Railway in particular. This is the first time that the President will be visiting his birthplace after taking over his present assignment. It is also the first time in the history of Indian Railways when any President came out of his special train enroute his journey to interact with common people and address the gathering at any roadside railway stations. Further, it is also the first time when the President decided to undertake a train journey by a Presidential train as opposed to the Presidential saloon which was in vogue in yesteryears. It may be noted that the President travelled in a coach comparable to the ones in the Maharaja Express tourist train. The service of the Presidential saloon, which was in use since independence had been discontinued on the instructions of the President owing to high costs involved. This saved the exchequer crores of rupees annually which was incurred in the upkeep of those saloons. President’s train journey has been a morale booster and a confidence builder for Railwaymen involved in the process and at large as well. Now, the railwaymen are fondly calling President Kovind as the ‘People’s President’ for his decision to take a ride on the common man’s mode of transportation. Loco pilots of the Presidential train Sanjay Kumar Singh and Anil Kumar Dixit have described this journey as their “journey of lifetime”. They felt pride in becoming part of this journey. Railwaymen worked hard day and night to provide a flawless and seamless journey for the nation’s first citizen. Functionaries involved in the process included the staff and officers from all ranks and departments of organization. Vinod, a trolleyman in the track maintenance department at Dadri station says, “We inspected the tracks thoroughly before passing this train. I felt proud as a railwayman as our President was using the train as his mode of conveyance to his home.” Exchanging all right signals at stations, level crossings and passing trains is an integral part of IR safety protocol in train operations. Vivek Kumar (gateman), Devesh Kumar (pointsman) Aligarh station, Lakhan Lal Meena (passenger guard) Tundla headquarter, Santosh Kumar (station master) Etawah and numerous other alert railwaymen performed their duties diligently and expressed the feeling of satisfaction and pride after the train passed safely from their locations. They called the moment to be awesome for all railwaymen. Akshay Deep Chauhan, guard of the Presidential train from Delhi Safadarjung to Kanpur Central said, “I lived one of the most unforgettable moments of my life, being the guard of the presidential train was an opportunity of a lifetime. This journey gave me the deepest sense of fulfilment, delight and happiness.” The teams deployed at two stopovers at Jhinjhak and Rura and at Kanpur Central Railway Station in the leadership of GM/NCR VK Tripathi and DRM Prayagraj Mohit Chandra kept everything up to the mark to welcome President Kovind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/several-firsts-in-prezs-train-journey-to-kanpur/articleshow/83878756.cms||---

He will be the party’s face in the polls,” Singh said while talking to reporters here on Saturday. Asked about the lunch hosted by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya for Yogi following his (Maurya) June 16 statement that ‘BJP Parliamentary Board and its national leadership will decide under whom the next assembly elections will be fought in the state’, Singh said, “Everyone knows that marriage of deputy CM’s son had taken place recently. The CM was invited to bless the newly wed couple. It was a limited gathering in view of Covid-19 protocols.” On BJP’s prospects and Samajwadi Party (SP) bid to utilise West Bengal (WB) poll slogans like ‘Khela Hobe’ in the forthcoming state assembly polls, Singh said “the game will definitely happen but it will be played by BJP with the blessings of the people of the state”. The minister said that the state government had won the battle against the first wave of Covid-19 and put an effective check on the second wave. “Now, we are preparing for the third wave and the state government will ensure all steps to combat any variant of the virus,” he added. Asked about the farmers’ agitation, Singh said: “The farmers should not worry as the state government has ensured record purchase of wheat on minimum support price (MSP) from them. The quantum of purchase is greater than the purchases made during SP and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) governments on MSP. The BJP-led government at the Centre is in talks with the protesting farmers and is trying to increase their earnings.” On the recently busted racket in religious conversion of the people, Singh said, “Those involved in the racket have been arrested and their connections in other states and countries are being traced to initiate appropriate action.” Singh also denied that a decision has been taken by the state government to bring a law for population control. “However, population should be controlled as it is in the interest of the country and will strengthen its economy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/yogi-will-be-bjps-facein-assembly-polls-singh/articleshow/83878731.cms||---

BJP candidate Dr VK Singh filed his nomination papers in the presence of party’s Prayagraj and Phulpur MPs Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Keshari Devi Patel, respectively. He filed the papers in the prescribed four sets with the signatures of eight proposers. Giving this information, BJP corporator Pawan Srivastava said, “While addressing the workers before the nomination, state vice-president and MLC and district in-charge Laxmanacharya in his address said that the eminent doctor of Prayagraj, Dr Singh is the winning candidate. He said that all the workers of the BJP have done an excellent work by showing solidarity and are worthy of being congratulated for the forthcoming win.” Likewise, Samajwadi Party candidate Malti Yadav also filed her nomination papers for the post of district panchayat president. After the nomination, SP candidate Malti Yadav said, “I am sure of my victory. SP supporters are being intimidated and threatened with fake cases by the administration. Despite this, the number of supporters of SP has increased from 61 to 65.” “The situation has become such that the BJP candidate is not able to find support from the panchayat members. The BJP candidate, the party and the entire government are desperate and disappointed,” she added. Earlier, both the candidates took out processions on the road before reaching the district panchayat office for filing their nominations. The norms of social distancing and wearing of masks was partially followed by supporters of both the parties. Because of their procession, a long traffic jam was also witnessed on the main roads of the city, especially the roads near the reserve police line and UPSC crossing of the city. Notably, several gram sabhas collectively form a ward. The district has 84 wards from where one zila panchayat member each gets elected. Now, to become the president of the district panchayat, the candidate (which are two in the present contest) should have support of over half of these zila panchayat members (in terms of Prayagraj it is 43 or more). Elections for the president’s post would be held on June 3 and counting would be held after polling on the same date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjp-sp-candidates-file-papers-for-district-panchayat-president-poll/articleshow/83878698.cms||---

In districts such as Osmanabad, Gadchiroli and many others, only 12 to 15% of Covid tests are being carried out via RT-PCR. Officials in these regions are now demanding more labs and swab centres to track their weekly positivity rates more accurately. Data has shown that more than 50% of the state's districts are relying more on rapid antigen kits (RATs), than the more accurate RT-PCR for Covid testing. State health minister Rajesh Tope said a meeting of all district authorities will be called to discuss the matter. “We will direct all RT-PCR labs to optimise testing capacities. The state has the capacity to conduct two lakh daily tests. We will ensure there's more focus on RT-PCR tests, given the new orders,” he said. The minister said help will be provided to regions that don’t have enough labs. “We know some districts have the problem of not having enough labs to carry out RT-PCR tests. They will be given assistance. Others who have the capacity but are still doing more rapid tests will have to go back to the RT-PCR regimen as these tests form the standardised assessment for the entire state,” he said. A health official said the state decided to have one level of assessment as many areas were using more RATs to increase the denominator (population tested) and cut positivity rates. “That would not have generated correct data,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-regions-to-get-more-labs-for-better-estimates-of-covid-spread/articleshow/83880188.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The victim, Vandana Mishra, was president of women’s wing of the Indian Industries Association (IIA), Kanpur Chapter and a resident of K-Block, Kidwainagar, and had complained of uneasiness post Covid treatment on Friday evening. District and Police officials met Vandana Mishra's family members and apologised and conveyed President Kovind condolence messageHer family members were taking her to a private hospital in Sarvodaya Nagar in a car, but were stranded at Govindpuri Railway Flyover as the the President’s special train was scheduled to pass that way. They alleged that they pleaded with the policemen deployed at the bridge, but to no avail. The car could finally move only after the special train passed through the flyover. However, by then it was too late for Vandana, who was declared dead by the doctors on reaching the hospital. Meanwhile, President Kovind and his wife Savita Kovind expressed their heartfelt condolences over the demise of IIA women’s wing chief following the unfortunate incident. The President’s wife has instructed the senior administrative and police officials that such a situation should not occur in future again. Subsequently, city police commissioner Asim Kumar Arun, DCP South Raveena Tyagi and DCP Traffic BBGTS Murthy, visited the house of the entrepreneur in Kidwai Nagar with the condolence message of the President and his wife and tendered an apology to her family members on Saturday morning. Arun tweeted, “On behalf of Kanpur Police and myself, I am deeply sorry about the demise of Vandana Mishra. This is a big lesson for the future. We pledge our ‘route’ system will be such that citizens are held up for the shortest possible time so such incidents are not repeated.” Another tweet said President Kovind was disturbed by the incident. “He (the President) called the police commissioner and the district magistrate and enquired about the incident. He asked officials to personally convey his condolences to the family,” the police said. Additional DCP Kanpur South has been asked to carry out an inquiry, and a sub- inspector, Sushil Kumar, and three constables have been suspended over the incident. Murthy, meanwhile, said that an inquiry has been ordered into the matter. “It would be probed whether the family members of the victim had apprised about medical emergency to the policemen on duty and they did not let them proceed further,” he said. There is a clear instruction of the Commissioner that if there is any medical emergency somewhere, then immediately the patient has to be removed from the traffic and sent forward, he said. DCP Traffic further said, “Traffic was stopped on Govindpuri railway flyover for some time. As per the Blue Book, the President has a protocol. Under the same, when the train passes through the rail tracks under the bridge, the vehicle has to stop for a minute or two. If the traffic was stopped there, people would have been trapped.” Vandana Mishra had also been an office-bearer of the Indian Council of Women Entrepreneurs. She had a Covid infection a month and a half ago. She recovered and tested negative but as far as her health is concerned, as per her family members, she became quite weak. For the past few days, she complained of anxiety and vomiting. On Friday morning, her husband Sharad Mishra took her to the private hospital. After undergoing some tests, she came back home. In the evening, she again complained of uneasiness. The family members soon left with her for a private hospital, but they got stuck in the traffic restrictions. The last rites of the Vandana Mishra were performed at a city ghat on Saturday. DM Alok Tiwari, police commissioner and DCP South attended the cremation ceremony at Bhairavghat. Later, the DM met her family members, including her husband Sharad Mishra, and expressed his condolences and assured them efforts would be made to prevent recurrence of such incidents in future. President Kovind, on a five-day visit to the state, had arrived in Kanpur on Friday evening (June 25) by a special presidential train. On June 27, he will visit his native village Paraunkh, besides Pukhrayan in Kanpur Dehat. On June 28, he will visit the state capital before returning back to the national capital on June 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/woman-entrepreneur-trapped-in-vvip-traffic-curb-dies-in-city/articleshow/83878745.cms||---

---||Nagpur||No coaching classes, non-essential shops, restros to shut on weekends||Nagpur: Even as the district’s Covid-19 weekly test positivity rate (TPR) as per RT-PCR worked out at 0.8% on Saturday, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and collector’s office have decided to close down coaching classes and keep non-essential shops and restaurants (dining) shut on weekends from June 28. Essential, non-essential shops, private offices, gyms, salons etc will be allowed till 4pm only. Citing detection of Delta Plus variant in some parts of the state, the government on Friday had revised unlocking norms introduced as per level system. New guidelines brought all districts under Level 3 irrespective of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy. Accordingly, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector Ravindra Thakare issued orders for relaxations and restrictions in city and rural areas, respectively. Radhakrishnan cited Level 3 rules for not allowing non-essential shops and restaurants on weekends. “E-commerce items, services and takeaway, home delivery of food allowed on all days,” he told TOI. Thakare said separate order was issued on Saturday to reduce timings of bars and wine shops from 11pm and 8pm, respectively, to 4pm on weekdays. “These establishments will be not allowed on weekends,” he said. The number of guests at marriage ceremonies has been reduced from existing 100 to 50. At funerals, earlier permission for 50 persons has been revised to 20. Probably for the first time, restriction up to 4pm has been imposed for marriage ceremonies. Also, these ceremonies can be held for only three hours. Also, the authorities have imposed a condition of operating gym, salons, spa, beauty and wellness centres without AC till 4pm. Granted permission to reopen only a week ago, coaching classes will have to shut again from June 28. Also, schools, colleges, religious places for visitors, political programmes, swimming pools, water sports etc will continue to remain closed. Sources in NMC said that there was proposal to allow malls by seeking special permission from the government but the district disaster management committee (DDMA) dropped it in the meeting held on Friday evening. Malls are not allowed in Level 3. Restriction on free movement of people (curfew) will be in place in entire district from 5pm. People can venture out on roads or in public places only for medical or emergency purposes. The authorities have allowed Gorewada jungle safari, Maharajbagh zoo and Botanical garden to remain open till 4pm. Pass will not be required for entering into district from other districts or states. The civic body has continued with mandatory RT-PCR test for flyers from other states. The government on Saturday released weekly TPR of all 35 districts in the state as per RT-PCR tests. Earlier, weekly TPR was calculated on basis of all tests, including RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests. As per government’s data, 238 persons tested positive from 31,578 RT-PCR tests in the district between June 19 and 25, for weekly TPR of 0.8%. The district’s weekly TPR is seventh lowest in the state. It was 3.86% between May 28 and June 3, and declined to 3.13% between June 4 and 10 and 1.25% between June 11 and 17. At 0.2%, Wardha district has the lowest weekly TPR in the state. Chandrapur’s weekly TPR is 0.6% and second lowest in Vidarbha. Gadchiroli (5.9%) and Buldhana (7.5%) are only two districts in Vidarbha with weekly TPR of above 5%. All 11 districts are in Level 3 as their weekly TPR is below 10%. Considering the prevailing situation of the pandemic, the government and district-level authorities are likely to revisit the restrictions and relaxations on July 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-coaching-classes-non-essential-shops-restros-to-shut-on-weekends/articleshow/83880174.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Goa||Goa: Vainguinim locals approach high court against beach wall||PANAJI: The Vainguinim Valley Residents Association (VVRA) has approached the high court against the construction of a concrete wall on Vainguinim beach by a starred hotel. The association has sought that a stop work order be issued against the construction, based on the findings of two expert members of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, which points towards irregularities. “We are presently waiting for a date to be allotted for the hearing. We will take this fight till the end. We will approach the National Green Tribunal too, if required,” said Aakash Madgavkar, managing committee member of the VVRA. The association said that there was deliberate delay in issuing stop work order, which has helped the work of construction of the wall to advance. Association president Collin Curry said that the hotel has been attempting to usurp the public beach to put up deck beds etc for a long time now. “The hotel claims that it is constructing the wall to prevent sand erosion, but in such cases eco-friendly material is used, whereas at Vainguinim, concrete and PVC pipe has been used and the water resources department has allowed this. If the wall is constructed, it will lead to complete deterioration of the beach. We, through our fight, want to make sure that the construction of the wall does not set a precedence for other parts of Goa and the rest of India,” Curry said. Madgavkar said that permission for repair of an anti-erosion structure was granted in 2017, which the hotel is now using to construct the wall even though five years have passed since.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vainguinim-locals-approach-hc-against-beach-wall/articleshow/83881476.cms||---
---||Delhi||Gender gap: 12 lakh more men vaccinated than women in Delhi||NEW DELHI: More men are protected against the coronavirus than women, at least if vaccination figures are anything to go by. So far, 42.3 lakh men in Delhi and 30.5 lakh women have been administered one or both doses of the anti-Covid vaccine. On Saturday, Delhi added another two lakh to the 72 lakh that have received the jab in the city, the highest single-day number since vaccination began in January. An elated deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said in a tweet: “Vaccination in Delhi is happening at a record pace! For the last three days we have vaccinated more than 1.5 lakh beneficiaries. Today, surpassing all previous records, Delhi vaccinated 2,05,170 persons! This is how we are going to protect Delhi from the 3rd wave!” Of the 72, 82, 653 individuals inoculated till 4pm on Saturday, the highest number of people belonged to the 18-44 age group, followed by the 45-60 year olds, while around 16.4 lakh people above 60 years rolled up their sleeves for the injection. With 8.4 lakh vaccinations, South district leads among the 11 districts in vaccination coverage. Of those who got the jab, 55,88,759 are first timers and 16,93,894 those who have gone for their second shots. The gender breakdown reveals that 42,33,080 males and 30,48,167 females are now protected. Among them, 52,32,905 individuals were given the Covishield vaccine and 20,48,513, Covaxin. A very negligible number of individuals, just 0.018%, have reported adverse events following vaccination. The vaccination figures reveal that half of the capital’s eligible population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi demanded that the central government give at least 45 lakh vaccines to Delhi government in July. Delhi received 58,000 doses of Covaxin on Friday and 53,000 of Covishield. “For the past month, we have been repeatedly asking the Centre to give us vaccines for the youth because young Delhiites want to be vaccinated, knowing it is the only way to avoid the third Covid wave,” Atishi said while releasing the vaccination bulletin for Friday. The AAP MLA Atishi said that the youth of Delhi are registering themselves through the CoWIN app. She added, “Now walk-in vaccination is also being allowed at all the centres in Delhi. Many youngsters are availing the walk-in facility. It is because of this that we are able to carry out a large number of vaccinations. The pace of vaccination in Delhi is increasing with each passing day.” She continued, “As the number of people getting the vaccine continues to grow, so does the number of people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Due to this, not only are those people becoming protected, but the whole of Delhi is also becoming safer because as the number of vaccinated people increases, the potential third wave of Covid will only spread at a much slower rate.” With 8.4 lakh vaccines in stock, Delhi could immunise people for five more days at the current pace, so Atishi has written a letter to the Centre requesting it for 45 lakh doses due to the city’s fast pace of inoculation at the rate of 1.5 lakh per day. It is only in this manner that the capital can vaccinate the citizens in time to prevent a third wave.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Class 12 scores to play role in engg, pharmacy admissions?||Mumbai: With students focussing only on entrance exams and paying little attention to their boards, the state government may soon consider giving weightage to class XII scores for admissions to professional courses — engineering, pharmacy, and agricultural education. The higher and technical education department has formed a nine-member committee under the chairmanship of the state CET cell commissioner to see if it is feasible and if it is, then how much weightage be given for the board scores. In a circular released by the department on June 23, the state has also asked the committee to study criteria for admission to professional courses in other states and draw recommendations. The committee is slated to submit its report by July 31. Currently, admission merit lists for engineering, pharmacy and agriculture are drawn based on MHT-CET scores and class XII aggregate is used only for the student’s eligibility. Students have to score at least 45 or 50 marks in class XII (either physics-chemistry-maths or physics-chemistry-biology), depending on the state’s policy in any given year. In a meeting presided by the deputy chief minister, it was discussed how admission to professional courses can be given based on CET and class XII scores and not CET alone. “It was discussed how a student scoring 45% in class XII is considered on a par with a student scoring 90%. Some felt that the student scoring 90% must get some advantage. There is also a lot of emphasis on coaching classes and the entrance exams. The whole idea, therefore, is to see if we can give some weightage to board scores to draw the merit list,” said a government official. The nine-member committee comprises CET cell commissioner Chintamani Joshi, Mumbai University’s pro-vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni, professor S G Bhirud from VJTI, representatives from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Technological University, two representatives from agricultural universities, principal of a pharmacy college among others. Lauding the move, Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said that the government must also consider the large number of seats going vacant in engineering institutions while making such a decision. The weightage should not be too much such that it discourages students from pursuing the course. In 2013, the then MHRD minister Kapil Sibal had floated a similar plan. He had proposed the two-step JEE for admissions to class IITs. While his proposal was to give 40% weightage to class XII scores, it was later changed and now class XII scores are used only as the eligibility criterion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-class-12-scores-to-play-role-in-engg-pharmacy-admissions/articleshow/83881508.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Trichy||Upgrade facilities in my school, says Class V boy in letter to CM Stalin||TRICHY: A class V student of a panchayat union middle school (PUMS) in Trichy has written to chief minister M K Stalin seeking steps to upgrade his school on par with private schools. V Mahapathanjali, 9, who shifted from a private CBSE school to the PUMS at Koppampatti village near Thuraiyur last year found that there were no extra-curricular activities in the school. While he could learn computer, spoken English, yoga and silambam in his previous school, there were no such classes in his new school. There was no smart classroom and students were not taken for field visits. He decided to bring these to the notice of the chief minister, and in a handwritten letter, Mahapathanjali requested him to improve the classroom infrastructure of the school. He said in the letter that his father told him that resolutions passed at grama sabha meetings have significance. He had attended a few grama sabha meeting along with his father in 2018 where a resolution was passed to upgrade the school. However, no steps were taken so far in this regard. The boy lamented that the school doesn’t have the practice of taking students on field visits unlike in the private school which help them learn new things. As the letter went viral on social media, chief education officer R Arivalagan visited Mahapathanjali and discussed the matter with him. He assured the boy that necessary steps will be taken to fufil his requirements. With about 230 students, the school has nine tile-roofed classrooms. Being a 75-year-old school, the building is several decades old. “We have been urging the authorities to improve the classroom infrastructure,” said headmaster R Ashok Kumar. On the request of Mahapathanjali on separate teachers for extra-curricular activities, the HM said since the boy came from a CBSE school, he expected the same facilities in the government school as well. “We will take steps to offer such extra-curricular classes once the school reopens after the pandemic,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/upgrade-facilities-in-my-school-says-class-v-boy-in-letter-to-cm-stalin/articleshow/83879012.cms||Sampath Kumar

While the school has also added 50-odd students in other classes, taking the total strength to 641, the school is likely to be allocated more teachers this year by the school education department. According to government norms, a school with over 641 students should have 18 teachers. Since the school has 10 teachers, it is expected to get eight more in the transfer counselling to be held in a couple of months in the district. Though it could admit over a 100 students last year as well, teachers say that novel initiatives to enhance learning have made the school much sought-after in the locality. Assistant teacher H Pushpalatha said they could break the stereotype that only children from disadvantaged sections and poor economic backgrounds are joining the school. “It is true that parents who could not afford fees in private schools are bringing their children for admission, but we have parents working as professors in city colleges,” she said.“Besides encouraging students to watch Kalvi Tholaikatchi, the school is encouraging children to learn from other online platforms as well. While most of the parents have smartphones, the teachers are connected to them through WhatsApp to make the children do homework under the supervision of parents,” said headmistress P Jayanthi. The city corporation has promised to build a few more classrooms to accommodate additional students. We could manage now as schools are closed due to the pandemic, but we expect more classrooms once the schools reopen after the pandemic, she said. Says V Anitha, a government school teacher in Pudukottai district who admitted her child to the E Pudur school, “The school is no less than a hi-tech private school where students are exposed to electronic gadgets for smart learning. They are taking sports, music, indoor games classes free of cost for the students by employing special teachers. We expect the same once the schools reopen,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-govt-school-set-to-enrol-over-100-students-in-class-i/articleshow/83879011.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Termites take off, bird-hits on planes spike||AHMEDABAD: Three bird-hits were reported at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport over the past ten days, just when the monsoon set in. Researchers revealed that the majority of the bird-hits during the monsoon occur because flying termites become active in the season. They thrive in the grass on the SVPI airport campus. Sources also said that for a month, airport authorities have been clearing sackfuls of bitter apple, a wild plant that has been growing amid the grass on the airport campus. On Friday morning, a Bengaluru-bound Indigo airlines flight suffered a bird-hit at around 9am, which caused severe damage to its engine. “It could not be ascertained which bird hit the aircraft but it was sure a sizable one which wrecked the engine blade,” a source said. “The incident occurred when the aircraft was accelerating for takeoff. All the 220 passengers were safely deplaned and flown to Bengaluru on another aircraft.” Three of the five bird-hits in 2021 were reported after the monsoon began. A researcher who has been involved in bird and animal sighting studies at the city airport said: “Kites, which are birds of prey, are responsible for 80% of the bird-hits at the city airport.” The researcher went on to say: “They also prey on flying termites.” The researcher said that regular cutting of grass and spraying of insecticides are necessary to curb the termite problem. Among other birds which often strike aircraft at the city airport are red-wattled lapwings and pigeons. Sources said that a few years ago, red-wattled lapwings were found nesting at the city airport. All the three bird-hits were reported to the aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), in line with the protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/termites-take-off-bird-hits-on-planes-spike/articleshow/83879016.cms||Niyati Parikh

While most of the protests were led by BJP functionaries who held the MVA responsible, in Nashik, Congress demonstrated against the Centre. In Nashik, the city police booked BJP MLA and party chief secretary Devyani Pharande and 25 others, including city unit chief Girish Palve and former MLA Balasaheb Sanap — who were participating in rasta roko near Vilholi on the Mumbai-Agra national highway — for alleged violation of Covid norms under the Disaster Management Act (DMA). “We detained the party members and registered cases under section 51 of the DMA, obstructing government officers in discharge of duties, under IPC section 341, 269, 270 and 188,” said inspector Kumar Chaudhary of Ambad police station. The protestors were released after a couple of hours. The BJP workers in Nashik rural, led by Dindori MP Bharti Pawar, organised a rasta roko in Niphad. The agitation lasted 30 minutes and blocked traffic. Congress functionaries, led by city unit president Sharad Aher, former minister Shobha Bachchhav, Vatsala Khaire and others demonstrated against the Centre. Aher said the OBC reservation was discontinued during the tenure of the BJP-led Devendra Fadnavis government. Now, the BJP at the Centre is also not taking any steps to resolve the issue. Aurangabad BJP MLA Atul Save said the state government had failed to produce the empirical data to defend the OBC quota. Along with other BJP functionaries and party workers, he staged a demonstration on the Jalna road. “The state government had a weak presentation in the legal battle on the OBC quota. As a result, the political reservation was scrapped. The MVA government’s inaction is responsible for this,” he said. BJP MP Bhagwat Karad said his party would step up the agitation in the future. Govt can’t suppress voice of Marathas: MeteBJP-supported MLC Vinayak Mete on Saturday accused the state government of suppressing the voice of a Maratha community. “Instead of fulfilling the just demands, the state government is suppressing our voice. We will not fall prey to bullying tactics,” he said. At a rally in support of reservation in Aurangabad, Mete, the founder of Maratha group Shiv Sangram, said the restoration of quota under SEBC would help the needy in the Maratha community. “The MVA has many powerful Maratha leaders, but they are not keen on restoring the SEBC quota. Maratha youths now have to take charge of the fight for reservation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/obc-reservation-protests-held-in-nashik-aurangabad/articleshow/83876377.cms||---

In Mumbai, too, the highest-ever single-day turnout of 1.54 lakh was recorded—almost 56% of the vaccines were given out in BMC-run centres that provide free Covid vaccination. “The vaccination drive in the state has gained momentum in the last few days, leading to significant progress. Every day we are recording better work as compared to the previous day. Yesterday, the state crossed the 3-crore vaccine level, and today, a record number of over 7 lakh vaccines were given,” said state additional chief secretary (health) Pradip Vyas. National Health Mission commissioner N Ramaswami, who is in charge of Covid-19 vaccination in the state, said that the aim is to complete 9 lakh vaccinations in a day. “If we get adequate stocks of vaccines, we could complete vaccination for the 18-44 age group within 85 days,” he said. However, as the Centre has committed to give 1.15 crore vaccine doses to the state for July, it remains to be seen if the momentum can be maintained. In Mumbai, over 75% of Saturday’s turnout were recipients in the 18-44 age group. Over 15 lakh vaccine doses have been given to this age group so far while the overall doses stand at 50.9 lakh. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that the BMC has over 2.38 vaccine doses . “We have requested the state to give us more doses in order to vaccinate the maximum number of people daily,” he said.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Residential schools in PPP mode mulled||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government plans to start a new scheme to found modern residential schools in PPP(public private partnership) mode, in which selected promising children can study and the government will fund such schools on a per child basis. The state education department has prepared a draft scheme to promote competitive residential schools which can provide a good education to students from humble backgrounds studying in government schools. Sources privy to the development said, “The state government has planned to promote large residential schools in the state with 1,000 to 2,000 students capacity with all modern facilities and training centres for competitive exams. The government expects that private players will come forward to develop these modern residential schools where students of parents who can afford good residential schools can put their wards and the government will select promising students from humble backgrounds who study in government schools and fund their education.” “The government aims to select about 1 lakh students from government schools on the basis on entrance exams and other performance parameters and give them admissions to good-quality private residential schools so they get better education. At present there are residential schools in tribal areas but their output is not up to the marks as students from nearby areas go there and they don’t get quality education and exposure to competitive exams. At the proposed residential schools. the government will ensure these students get both. The government will pay Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 per child for around one lakh students. The government expects to set up around 100 new PPP model residential schools. Each is expected to have 15 to 20 acres of land. The government aims to select the best students from tribal and backward areas and provide them competitive education and opportunities in civil services, medical education, IITs and other opportunities,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/residential-schools-in-ppp-mode-mulled/articleshow/83879051.cms||Kapil Dave

---||Hyderabad||Wading through the crypto maze, one step at a time||HYDERABAD: The gold rush of cryptocurrency may have allured many Indians to its fold over the last year but many new entrants are still finding it an uphill task to wade through the nitty gritty of investing in digital currency. While there are many platforms to invest in crypto, one needs to be extra cautious because in the case of cryptocurrencies, there is no central regulatory body that will come to your rescue as in the case of stock markets, where you can reach out to the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for redressal of grievances. Nischal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange WazirX and member of Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), set up under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), said there are over 1.5 crore investors holding crypto assets worth over Rs 1,500 crore in India. Shetty explained that cryptos are not a get-rich-quick scheme but a high-risk form of investment, which is why people should only invest based on their risk appetite. Darshan Bathija, CEO of crypto exchange Vauld, pointed out that anyone can start a crypto exchange since cryptocurrencies are unregulated instruments. “It is important to check who backs these exchanges - who the investors in the platform are as well as the backgrounds of the core team and founders of crypto exchanges,” he said. Apart from that, he said it may be beneficial to see if the platform has the appropriate legal licenses to serve your geographical location. Hygiene checks like app store reviews and social media presence could be helpful. The best test would be to contact the customer support of the platform to alleviate any concerns, he added. While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact number of crypto exchanges extending their services in India, it is a common practice for popular ones to resort to self-regulation. Shetty of WazirX, which has nearly 6.5 million investors on its platform, said that they perform stringent KYC verification of every user with their PAN card, photo and address proof. “We also do a secondary KYC verification through the linked bank accounts of users to ensure that we receive deposits only from whitelisted bank accounts before allowing a customer to transact on WazirX. Lastly, we allow only KYC-verified and whitelisted accounts to withdraw funds from our exchange,” he said. Similarly, Avinash Shekhar, Co-CEO, ZebPay, that has over 4 million users, said the exchange currently has a KYC procedure in place which requires all users to verify themselves using their address proof, ID proof, and complete bank account verification. Users can transfer funds in INR to and from the verified account only. Shetty said India can take a cue from developed countries like the US, UK, Switzerland, Japan and New Zealand, among others, who are already trying to regulate crypto assets in a way that they foster innovation and fight crime at the same time. The Indian government is still mulling its stance towards cryptocurrency with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, earlier this year, indicating that the government would take a `calibrated approach’ to cryptocurrency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wading-through-the-crypto-maze-one-step-at-a-time/articleshow/83879028.cms||Swati Rathor

As against the 1,298 cases registered last year between January 1 and May 31, in 2021 only 1,064 cases were registered, which is a drop of approximately 18%. Though cases of murder, rape, dacoity, kidnapping and deaths due to negligence have increased this year, cases of thefts, burglaries etc have also reduced this year. Murder cases have risen from last year’s six cases to 11 this year, while rape cases have increased from last year’s 17 to 34. Chain robbery has always been a menace in the city every year. However, with 38 cases of chain robbery till May 31 this year, cases of chain snatching were only two less than cases registered last year. Further, vehicle thefts also saw a drop of two cases compared to last year. Meanwhile, this year as well as last year, during April and May restrictions were imposed by the district administration and the police to control the spread of Covid. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Sanjay Barkund said while the police were on the streets right from the beginning this year due to the regular checking related to Covid, preventive actions in the form of externments or detaining criminals under strict laws like Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) have also been taken continuously, which led to drop in overall crime rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/18-drop-in-nashiks-crime-rate-when-compared-to-last-year/articleshow/83876374.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Trichy||Why Trichy failed to impress in smart cities award||Trichy: The Indian smart cities award (ISAC) 2020, recognising cities for innovative projects taken up under the smart cities mission programme, has come as a disappointment for Trichy with the city not featuring in the 19 award categories. Lack of uniqueness and poor pace of progress in executing the infrastructure projects were cited for the poor show. Cities that were selected for smart cities mission along with Trichy or afterwards have bagged awards. ISAC was instituted to recognise best practices while assessing a city’s performance in planning and implementing the smart cities project. Governance, environment, social aspects, culture and urban mobility were some of the 10 broad ‘pillars’ under which the awards were instituted. The ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) invited reports with evidence from smart cities across the country on projects implemented between August and October. Project implementation, fund utilisation, stakeholder engagement were analysed. The shortlisted cities were told to nominate their projects under three award categories such as project award, innovative award and city award (sub-divided under 19 categories). In all, 71 cities qualified for round 2 but Trichy did not figure among them. Based on the innovation, outcome, replicability and sustainability, the submissions were selected by a jury for the award. Indore and Surat were declared as overall winners while Chennai secured an award for restoration of water bodies, Covid innovation category and Tamil Nadu was adjudged the third best state. Erode and Tirunelveli also received recognition for their performances. The poor performance of Trichy was attributed to the slow pace of project execution and lack of innovation in the projects proposed. Trichy, thus far, has completed only war memorial illumination, LED light conversion, public parks and statue installation, all termed as insignificant proposals for the awards. “The submissions we made were cited insufficient to qualify. Many of our projects are nearing completion, so we will secure an award in the next season,” an official of Trichy corporation said. The city was criticised for not focussing on health, urban mobility and waste management equally in the proposals. “Trichy failed to involve public and experts in drafting project proposals. Issues like traffic management were not even considered for a solution,” S Vijayakumar, a city-based architect, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/why-trichy-failed-to-impress-in-smart-cities-award/articleshow/83879074.cms||Deepak Karthik

He said that at present, even those who have received both doses of the vaccine have to furnish a the certificate. The CM said that if the court allows the entry of people who are fully vaccinated, it would reduce inconvenience to the public at the borders. His statement came after he visited the Keri checkpost, where the government has started a rapid antigen test facility. “There was a huge queue for testing, and it causes inconvenience to the people, sometimes, testing kits also get over,” Sawant said. He said that the state government has “over-prepared” for the third wave. The curfew extension will now end on July 5 at 7pm. The announcement on Saturday was the fifth since the first curfew on May 9. During the last extension on June 19, shops in shopping malls (except cinema halls, theatres, multiplexes and entertainment zones) were allowed to be open from 7am to 3pm. Earlier, shops with essential commodities were allowed to remain open only till 1 pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-let-those-with-2-jabs-enter-sans-ve-certificate/articleshow/83880261.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Eight held for PDS foodgrain racket in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: City crime branch arrested eight persons for their alleged involvement in a racket diverting subsidized foodgrains from ration shops of the public distribution system (PDS) to the open market for sale. Those arrested were diverting the food grains by generating fake bills in the name of people who had not collected their monthly ration. Crime branch officials said the accused were collecting details and names of people who had not collected rations using a special purpose-built software, Gamescan. The cops said more arrests are likely to take place as this was a state-wide scam. With the help of ration shop owners and middlemen they conspired to divert subsidized foodgrains to the open markets. The accused allegedly used software to collect data of beneficiaries such as names, Aadhaar card numbers, ration card numbers, biometric details, and the username and password of the software used by ration shop owners, the official said. “The software created by the accused helped gather data of beneficiaries, which they used to generate online bills of those who did not collect their monthly rations. This way, they would show that the ration has been sold to beneficiaries, but would instead sell them in the open market,” said a senior official of the crime branch. Based on a tip-off, the police first nabbed one Alpesh Thakkar, who contacted ration shop owners and got details of beneficiaries who had not collected their rations. The police found an excel sheet on Thakkar’s mobile phone, which had details of such beneficiaries, username and password of ration shop owners and the shop code, a release from crime branch stated. Further investigation led the police to Rafiq Manesiya, Javed Rangrej, Latif Manesiya, and Mustufa Manesiya, who were allegedly involved in supplying two software applications to ration shop owners to gather data on ration card holders, crime branch officials stated. Police have arrested the creators of the software Gamescan, Kaushik Joshi and Deepak Thakor, and the supplier of Savedata software, Hitesh Chaudhary, all of whom are from Banaskantha district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/eight-held-for-pds-foodgrain-racket/articleshow/83879072.cms||---

At this private, five-room villa overlooking abundant greenery and an ancient hill they spent three peaceful, luxurious nights. It was a good getaway during difficult times. Ramchandani is among the growing tribe of city dwellers who are escaping to the nearby hill stations of Lonavala, Khandala and staying preferably at “isolated places” the private villas and resorts market themselves as. “We didn’t want to leave the safety of our home and expose ourselves to a crowded hotel. So, a private villa like Myna provided us the feel of home stay though we were vacationing,” said Ramchandani. “Since pandemic times’ protocols demand minimum mixing and distance maintaining, it is possible at a bungalow or villa. There is a huge demand for the villa and mine is booked 100% till August end,” said Myna’s owner Khalid Ahmed Kherada. The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) officials said almost all of their resorts across the state are now open and attracting 100% booking on weekends while on weekdays the booking is up to 40%. Dinesh Kamble, general manager MTDC for resort operations, said all hill resorts had received 100% booking on weekends. MTDC General Manager and spokesperson Chandrashekhar Jaiswal said people seem to be seeking an “escape route” as there are reports of a mad rush at almost all destinations since unlocking began. The most sought-after resorts this season include Malshej Ghat, Karla, Bhandardara, Matheran and other popular beach destinations such as Tarkarli, Ganpati Pule, Harihareshwar Mahableshwar and Lonavala. Sherry Bhatia, president, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI), said their member hotels having resorts at most of these destinations are doing good business though for a few places such as Murud Janjira the permission to unlock was yet to come. Ramesh Gaikwad, booking agent for villas and bungalows for holiday stays, said there is a spike in both bookings and enquiries for private villas. “If you want to see the rush in Lonavala area, come on weekends when traffic is huge and the villas are booked 100%. People are ready to pay up to Rs 50,000 a night for a villa with five rooms, pool and open space for games like badminton,” he said. Asif Fazlani who owns the 70-acre Fazlani Natures Nest, A Wellness Retreat at Lonavala, with 76 rooms on his property, said that people want relaxation. “Due to the lockdown and curbs, people are stressed and they want to relax and also want to avoid exposing themselves to infections in crowded places,” said Fazlani.

---||Trichy||5 Trichy temples selected for FSSAI’s Bhog certification||Trichy: The food safety and standards authority of India (FSSAI) has identified five temples in Trichy district for the blissful hygienic offering to god (Bhog) certification scheme. The Ranganathaswami temple in Srirangam, Thayumanswami temple in Rockfort, Vekkaliamman temple in Woraiyur, Samayapuram Mariamman temple and Jambukeswarar temple in Thiruvanaikoil have been selected in the first phase. FSSAI said that the objective of the programme was to ensure cleanliness and quality in temple kitchens. By the first week of July 2021, the food safety department and a third-party agency authorised by the FSSAI will conduct a pre-audit study in the five temples. Quality of the kitchens, standards of food products used, conditions of vessels and water used for cooking will be inspected. The temple managements will be given a minimum of 15 days period to carry out corrective measures. After a certain period, the same team will study the kitchens again for the post-audit survey to verify whether the corrections were implemented. Quality of water, location of washing vessels, reliability of cooking products and skills of temple cooks will also be assessed. “We will upload the photographs and observations made in the official portal of Bhog and FSSAI. The third-party agency will also record their inference for grading the kitchens based on the two audits,” Dr R Ramesh Babu, district food safety officer, said. There will be a total of 120 marks for the Bhog survey. Temples securing more than 100 marks will get 5-star rating while temples securing 90-100 marks and 80-90 marks will get 4 and 3 stars respectively. More temples will be inducted into the survey in a phased manner, FSSAI said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/5-trichy-temples-selected-for-fssais-bhog-certification/articleshow/83879063.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Goa||Over 90% of Goa aware of sexual rights, freedom: Survey||PANAJI: Goa has an increased awareness of sexual rights and freedom of women with over 90% of people believing that a woman is within her right to refuse sex with her husband if she is aware that he has intercourse with other women, according to the findings of the National Family Health Survey 2019-20 (NFHS-5). Also, 90% of women and 93% of men believe that the woman is justified in refusing to have sex with her husband, “if she is tired” or “not in the mood”, the survey has found. The questions over conjugal relationships were added for the first time in NFHS-5 and have thrown up some pleasantly surprising answers on what transpires in marital beds. “Eighty nine per cent of men agree that if a wife refuses to have sex with her husband he does not have a right to get angry and reprimand her, refuse to give financial support, use force to have sex even if she does not want to, or have sex with another woman,” NFHS-5 findings states. In Goa, the NFHS-5 field survey was conducted in North and South districts from August 30, 2019, to November 26, 2019, through a private entity. For the survey, the information was collected from 1,856 households—2,030 women in the 15-49 age group and 313 men aged 15-54. As per NFHS-5, around 5% of ever-married women in the 18-49 age group reported their husband having physically forced them to have sex against their wishes. Another 3% stated that their husbands had forced them with threats or in any other way to perform sexual acts they did not want to perform. “Overall, 8% of ever-married women have experienced spousal physical or sexual violence from their current husband or, if not currently married, from their most recent husband. Few ever-married women (2%) reported that they have initiated violence against their husband when he was not already beating or physically hurting them,” the survey said. Among married women in the 18-49 age group, 7% told of having experienced any form of physical violence committed by their husband. Five percent reported having undergone any form of sexual violence from their husband and 6% said they have experienced any form of emotional violence committed by their husband. Though these figures may seem low, the survey has also thrown up some disturbing data as well. Around 35% of women and men agreed that it is okay for a husband to hit or beat his wife under some circumstances in Goa, according to NFHS-5. Women were found most likely to agree that wife beating is justified if the woman has shown disrespect for her in-laws (30%).

However, new Covid cases and TPR remain constant, due to which the state continues to be in the plateau phase for more than a fortnight. On Thursday and Friday, the total number of patients on the ventilator was 937 and 923, respectively. Those in ICUs were 2,353 and 2,368, respectively. During Covid peak in May, the state had seen an increase in ICU admissions with a 7-day average of ICU admissions being between 3,500 and 3,800, and ventilator admissions being between 1,450 and 1,500. The seven-day average of new Covid cases in the state is now 11,509 and TPR is 10.4% as against 14,431 seven-day average new cases and TPR of 14.1% as on June 11, when there were first indications that amid lockdown relaxations the state had entered a plateau phase of Covid spread. In contrast, the 7-day national average TPR was 5.2 % as of June 11 and it has now come down to 2.9%. “Covid cases are coming down and our hospitals are not burdened now. But the problem is that we are not testing enough now. Along with lockdown relaxations we should increase testing so that we identify cases early and control the spread,” said Dr Arun N M, internal medicine expert who has been analyzing the Covid trends in Kerala. State’s test per million now is 3,049, while as on June 11 it was 3,000. The concern is that, unlike in the past, when the state used to test all primary contacts of a Covid patient, that is not happening now. To bring down TPR, government testing is more in the community and less amongst contacts. Very few contacts go for Covid tests voluntarily. This has the health experts concerned and they said that if there is no check, then delta the ‘most transmissible’ of variants identified so far will spread rapidly among unvaccinated populations in the state. Even the delta plus variant has been identified in Kerala. “With a decline in the exponential number of cases, the number of in-patients and serious cases has come down. But if you look at the Covid data of the last 10 days you realize that the numbers are stagnant and not progressively decreasing,” said Dr Jayakrishnan A V, chairman of Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee on Covid vaccines and vaccination strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ventilator-occupancy-dips-below-1000/articleshow/83879081.cms||Preetu Nair

He normally bought flags, jerseys, or whatever was available in the city. The Covid-19 pandemic, though, means this year it’s different. Shops have remained shut and restaurants closed. There are no public screenings either, and everyone is forced to watch Euro 2020 at home. Tavora, a midfielder who dons colours for Hyderabad FC in the Indian Super League, is stuck at home too, but the excitement of watching his favourite team play remains unmatched. “Watching Portugal play gives you a different thrill,” said Tavora, who also played for GDSC Alvarenga, a club in the fourth tier of Portuguese football. “Portugal are now in the knockout stage. The draw is quite tough, but the performance against France gives me hope. On their night, Portugal can beat any team in the world.” The defending champions finished third in the group of death that also had world champions France and Germany, besides Hungary who played their games at home. They won just one of their three group games and now face world’s top-ranked team, Belgium, in the pre-quarterfinals at the Estadio La Cartuja in Seville on Sunday. Goa’s ties with its former coloniser run deep. Their rule here saw the introduction of language, music and, of course, football. For many, this relationship with Portugal who ruled the state for 450 years, has stood the test of time. “I remember listening to the commentary on transistors at the 1966 World Cup in England. Portugal had one of the strong sides with Eusebio in top form but lost in the semifinals. I hope they can make amends and win a major trophy on English soil,” said Hillary Fernandes, a 72-year-old football enthusiast from Porvorim. Portugal has one of the stronger teams at Euro 2020 with many of their players doing duty for top teams in Europe. There is Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way, while Manchester City centre-back Ruben Dias was voted the Premier League’s Player of the Year. Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United), Joao Felix (Atletico Madrid), Bernardo Silva (City), Diogo Jota (Liverpool) and Renato Sanches (Lille) are the other stars in the team. “There are so many great players in the squad that it’s imperative for coach (Fernando Santos) to get the team combination right. We must go with the team that played against France (2-2 draw),” said Welvin Menezes, the Goa Velha based CEO of Sporting Clube de Goa, whose entire family is rooting for Portugal. Gletta Mascarenhas is nervous and excited in equal measure. A huge fan of Ronaldo, she is delighted with the striker’s five goals in the championship and is praying that he scores another one that will not just help Portugal in the knockout clash but make him the world’s top international goalscorer. “Belgium won’t be easy, but Portugal can definitely get the better of them. It will be memorable for everyone if Ronaldo scores the winner,” said Mascarenhas, whose hero equalled Iranian legend Ali Daei’s international goalscoring record in the previous game.  Portugal face Belgium who have won 13 matches in a row and, along with France, are the favourites to emerge champions. The Belgians won all three of their group matches ahead of the round of 16 but fans have spotted weaknesses.  “Belgium has a suspect defence which Portugal can exploit,” said Abner D’Souza. “If the team can sort out the midfield and remain tight at the back, we can win this one. Belgium is the biggest hurdle in the path, and once we clear this, there is no stopping.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-portugal-takes-on-belgium-goa-prays-hopes-for-a-ronaldo-winner/articleshow/83880286.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 21 Covid patients with Delta+ variant were not vaccinated?||MUMBAI: None of the 21 Covid patients infected with the new Delta-plus variant in Maharashtra were possibly vaccinated. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the epidemiology cell of the state government’s public health department, said they were still gathering information of patients, who are spread across the state, but preliminary information indicates most were not vaccinated. Three patients were under 18, and not eligible for vaccination. The state government has decided to step up vaccination in these five districts in the coming days. N Ramaswami, commissioner of state National Health Mission, said areas where the Delta-plus variant was found were being monitored closely. “We have increased Covid-19 tests and vaccination in these areas,’’ he said. Delta-Plus or AY.1 variant was detected in nine Covid-positive samples from Ratnagiri, seven from Jalgaon, two from Mumbai and one each from Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg districts. On Friday, the state declared that one of the patients from Ratnagiri, an 80-year-old woman with severe anxiety disorder, died at Ratnagiri Civil Hospital on June 13. She was admitted to a Covid-19 care centre on June 1, but doctors transferred her to the civil hospital as she needed specialised psychiatric drugs and care. “She was aggressive and difficult to manage even though we started her on psychiatric drugs,”' said Ratnagiri civil surgeon Dr Sanghamitra Phule. Her son, also Covid-19 positive, was kept nearby in the hospital, but she was difficult to manage. The state is awaiting results of other samples sent to Institute of Genomics & Integrative Biology in Delhi for genetic sequencing. The health department is trying to understand how these 21 could have got infected with the Delta-plus virus. “Most of those affected in Ratnagiri are from a farming background with no international travel. They have not even travelled outside the district,’’ said Dr Phule. The central health ministry said there are 48 cases of Delta-plus variant and results of more samples sent for gene sequencing are awaited. Experts said it can escape antibodies and has high transmissibility, making it a variant of concern. It emerged from the Delta variant that was first isolated in Vidarbha region and considered to be one of the causes for the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-21-covid-patients-with-delta-variant-were-not-vaccinated/articleshow/83880290.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: No relaxations in curbs for now||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The review meeting chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan decided to not to give further relaxations in the lockdown declared in the state. The meeting decided not to relax the restrictions since the test positivity rate (TPR) has not gone below 10%. Even though the meeting considered the demands to bring some relaxations in the weekend lockdown, the health department took the view that it should be continued. The meeting observed that even during the weekends the places of worship can open with limited restrictions. All the churches can open on Sundays but only 15 people will be allowed at a time inside the church for the prayer and mass. Not just churches, other places of worship can also function on Sundays. The Christian missionaries had requested the government to allow Sunday prayers in churches. But the government decided not to allow overcrowding in the churches. The health department took the view that the restrictions and the weekend lockdown should continue until the TPR becomes 8%. At present, the TPR is 10.66% and there is serious concern that it would touch 11% in the coming days. Hence the health department took the stand that any kind of relaxation at this moment might lead to an increase in TPR in the state. Based on the health department’s recommendations, the chief minister took the view that at present there is no need for reviewing the present lockdown restrictions. It has also been decided to review the situation of the state again on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-relaxations-in-curbs-for-now/articleshow/83879115.cms||---

This is the second oxygen generation plant in the city after the one in Government Rajaji Hospital. The third oxygen plant with a capacity of 200 litres per minute will be commissioned at the GRH on Sunday (June 27).The generator at the railway hospital established at Rs 50 lakh was inaugurated by Madurai divisional railway manager V R Lenin. It is the first oxygen generator in a railway hospital in Southern Railway. Hospital sources said that the generator will suck air, remove moisture, segregate nitrogen from oxygen and supply oxygen to patients in need through two large cylinders.Madurai railway hospital has 105 beds and all of them are supported by centralised oxygen supply. Eighty five of these beds are dedicated for Covid-19 patients in addition to a 14-bed non-oxygen supported isolation ward. Though the hospital has a one kl liquid oxygen plant and oxygen cylinders, it faced difficulty in buying oxygen through tankers during the second wave of Covid-19 when more patients needed oxygen support.This paved way for the installation of an oxygen generator in view of the preparedness for the third wave. The generator that reached the hospital last Saturday was installed in less than a week.Madurai railway hospital also has 18 oxygen concentrators – seven with a capacity of ten litres each and eleven with a capacity of five litres each – to meet the requirements of patients when the existing beds are overflowing. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/o2-plant-installed-at-madurai-rly-hospital/articleshow/83879094.cms||---

Though no casualties were reported, the route remained paralysed for close to six hours. Chief PRO of Konkan Railway, L K Verma, said a front wheel of the loco of the Nizamuddin—Madgaon Rajdhani Superfast Special derailed inside the Karbude tunnel between Ukshi and Bhoke railway stations at 4.15am on Saturday. The derailment occurred owing to a “boulder fall”, he said. Konkan Railway officials said that the rail maintenance vehicle and accident relief medical van having re-railing equipment reached the site soon after the incident and relief and restoration work was launched immediately. Senior railway officials also rushed to the site to monitor the progress. Verma said after restoration work was completed, a track-fit certificate was issued at 8.18 am and the Rajdhani Superfast Special was cleared from the affected track at 9.14am. Traffic was restored at 10.27 am, he said. Deputy general manager (PR), Baban Ghatge, told TOI that four Goa-bound trains running along the Konkan Railway route were affected by the derailment. Lokmanya Tilak Terminus—Mangalore Matsyagandha Express, Konkan Kanya Express, Gandhidham—Nagercoil Gandhidham Express and Ajmer—Ernakulam Marusagar Express were delayed by almost 3 hours. The Rajdhani Superfast Special arrived at Margao at around 2.30pm, a delay of nearly five hours. “The derailed Rajdhani train was brought to Ratnagiri station where the loco was changed for its onward journey,” Ghatge said. This is the second time in the past six months that a derailment has occurred in the Ratnagiri region of Konkan Railway. On December 20 last year, the front axle of a utility track vehicle had derailed between Diwankhavti and Khed railway stations, severely affecting rail traffic on the route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-bound-rajdhani-derails-paralyses-route-for-6-hours/articleshow/83881617.cms||---

The order signed by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal says that any non-compliance would invite action under the Disaster Management Act 2005 and India Penal Code. This comes at a time when the positivity rate in Mumbai is 3.96% and oxygen bed occupancy 26.04%. Only last week, it issued a similar order stating that ‘level 3’ restrictions would be effective till June 27. The latest order comes in the wake of concerns arising out of the Delta-plus variant, and in keeping with the state government’s deciding to impose stricter lockdown curbs, thereby downgrading the ‘five-level’ relaxation to ‘level 3’. Traders, however, expressed concern. “Business is likely to be hampered very badly and this will give an advantage to e-commerce. It is not practical to spend on overheads... So, shops and restaurants will remain shut,” said Viren Shah of Federation of Retail Traders welfare Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tighter-curbs-of-level-3-to-remain-until-further-notice/articleshow/83880298.cms||Richa Pinto

While bus operations have been resumed, passengers find it tough to have a place to have food, hoteliers said. Parcel only service is not viable to the hotels. As a result, the majority of the hotels remain closed in Madurai district. Thousands of employees in the sector are left without jobs for the past two months. On the other hand, hotel owners are struggling to make both ends meet. They are forced to pay the employees, power bills, taxes and rent from their pocket. They have urged the state government to allow them to operate with a 50% dine-in facility from Monday considering the financial issues. Madurai district president of the Hoteliers Association K L Kumar said the hotel owners are in deep financial crisis as the hotels are closed for months together. Many have been forced to sell their hotels. The state government should allow the industry to function with a 50% dine-in facility to prevent hoteliers from taking any extreme step. “Only a miniscule number of hotels are functioning at present. Those who are operating are witnessing only 25% of the normal business. We have spent all our resources towards salary, rent, taxes and other running costs and are not in a position to bear more losses,” he said. Members of the Small Eateries Association have also urged the state government to allow dine-in facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hoteliers-in-dire-straits-want-govt-to-allow-dine-in/articleshow/83879116.cms||---

As foreign minister S Jaishankar met his Greek counterpart Nikon Dendias in a bilateral visit that happened after 18 years, the two leaders discussed "geo-political and geo-economic realities, including the Indo-Pacific". An official readout said the two countries acknowledged "the convergence of each others' vision for a free, open, inclusive and cooperative Indo-Pacific ensuring connectivity and growth for the region." This was a significant outcome from India's perspective. Greece has been an important linchpin for China's BRI in Europe. China's shipping firm Cosco took a majority stake in Piraeus 2016. The port is at a strategic location between the Asian and European continents. An official MEA readout said Greece became an official signatory to the International Solar Alliance (ISA), with the Greek foreign minister submitting the agreement to the Indian side, and was "welcomed to the family of the ISA". "Both sides agreed that this will assist the two countries in realisation of the energy goals set by the respective governments to make renewable energy a significant part of the energy supply After the India-Europe summit, India is getting down to the business of engaging almost every member of the EU. Jaishankar also called on Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis and conveyed greetings on the 200th anniversary of Greek independence. He also unveiled a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Athens. The discussions, said the MEA statement, covered trade and investment, and ongoing cooperation in science and tech, culture, academics etc. India is keen to restart formal negotiations on an FTA with Europe, and all member countries would have to sign off on it.

The budget airline has been operating four flights a week connecting Delhi-Madurai-Singapore since September 2017. The service was doing well before Covid-19 stopped operations last year. Though it was to resume this April, Airports Authority of India did not give slots citing timing issues for late night flight. Subsequently, Air India Express operated only one flight in the sector on Mondays. The Delhi-Madurai flight, which was operated thrice a week, was stopped in March. While bookings for this sector have not opened since then, those for Madurai-Singapore sector have also been closed now. The flight from Delhi departed at 9.55 am and reached Madurai at 1.10 pm while in the return journey, it departed from Madurai at 1.55 pm and reached Delhi at 5.10 pm. The timings provided the much-needed connectivity for the business community as well as those travelling for education and leisure. Aviation enthusiasts are now circumspect whether Madurai is being intentionally neglected. The Madurai-Singapore sector was one of the profitable routes for Air India Express on Pan India-Singapore routes, they say. S Sankar, an aviation enthusiast, said there are talks that the flights could be suspended. The viability of a flight comes down when the station is handling a lonely flight in a week. We are approaching elected representatives to apply pressure to continue both the services” he said. He said AIE operated Vande Bharat flights to bring expats from Gulf countries which saw good patronage for outbound services too, especially Dubai, which resulted in increased services. This could have been made a regular flight, providing a second connection to Dubai. SpiceJet is already operating a flight to Dubai. An official of Air India in Madurai said travel restrictions by the Singapore government are yet to be fully lifted for Indian passengers. Once that happens, Madurai-Singapore flight will be operated which will be followed by Delhi-Madurai flight||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/demand-to-resume-aie-flights-from-madurai/articleshow/83879122.cms||V Devanathan

Up next from his Aadhava Foods, says Krishnakumar, is the mushroom laddoo, of which the prototype is ready to bite into. "The fear of the pandemic has more people interested in immunity-boosting foods, and mushroom is one of them. I’ve also created an instant health mix with traditional grains and powdered oyster mushrooms," he says. According to Prabhakar K, director of the Centre for Plant Protection Studies at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) in Coimbatore, mushrooms have literally mushroomed in both cultivation and consumption in the state over the past couple of years. "The number of entrepreneurs making value-added mushroom products such as noodles, pickles, and soup powders, is growing," he says. In the past year, TNAU’s monthly training sessions on mushroom cultivation had more than 700 people signing up for it in 2020 alone. "Mushrooms are not expensive to grow and give farmers a good return on investment. For every `1 invested in mushrooms, you get `3.25 in returns," says G Thiribhuvanamala, associate professor of plant pathology at TNAU. "The value addition is five times if you turn mushroom into products like pickles or biscuits," says Thiribhuvanamala, who has added mushroom pickle to her menu to get her kids to eat it. According to TNAU surveys conducted in the past year, Thiribhuvanamala says vegetarians who were sceptical of the fungus, categorising it as non-vegetarian on account of its meaty flavours, have warmed up to it. In Delhi, Rooted Active, which markets mushroom coffee, has seen a growing number of repeat buyers. "We infuse Arabica coffee with mushrooms such as lion’s mane and chaga, which are considered nutrient-dense superfoods," says Subhash Sirpal, head of operations. "We have many takers among coffee drinkers who want to add a shot of health into their cuppa. Because mushroom coffee is less acidic and has lower caffeine." Nutritionist Dharini Krishnan says mushroom, a vegetable protein, is a good source of vitamin D that is important for bone health. "It is also high in potassium, which is needed for heart health, and has phenols that have anti-inflammatory effects. It’s good for the immune system, which is why it has been trending during the pandemic," she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/whats-behind-the-mushroom-boom/articleshow/83878060.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Attempt to murder slapped, vaccine conman faces life term||KOLKATA: The 28-year-old accused in the fraud vaccination camp case has been charged with attempt to murder. If held guilty, Debanjan Deb, could be imprisoned for life or minimum 10 years. “We will submit a prayer before the court to add Section 307 of the IPC (attempt to murder) against Deb,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Any person who commits and act with intention or the knowledge that the same could cause death would be held guilty of the charge. Deb was arrested on Tuesday for organizing multiple vaccination camps, in which hundreds of people, including MP Mimi Chakraborty, were injected with suspected antibiotic instead of Covid vaccine. It was Chakraborty who had alerted the police after she got suspicious of Deb’s camp when she did not receive her vaccination certificate even four hours after getting her shot. Three new cases have been registered against Deb at the Kasba police station, taking the number of FIRs to seven. An equal number of complaints have been pending at several other police stations. The SIT set up to probe the case booked Deb for attempt to murder after the state administration brass asked police commissioner Soumen Mitra to ensure he received the harshest punishment for deceiving people and putting their lives at risk . Police said the suspected antibiotic administered to at least 587 recipients could cause severe harm to them and Deb had done so knowingly. The SIT on Saturday arrested three associates of Deb who helped him run the fake centres and open a current account fraudulently in KMC’s name. The three were appointed by Deb who reportedly said they were working for an NGO operated by the KMC. Two of the accused, Sushanta Das (54) from Salt Lake and Rabin Sikdar (31) from Barasat, were the alleged signatories of the fake KMC bank account, which Deb opened last December. The third arrested, Taltala resident Santanu Manna (44), reported collected personal details of “vaccine recipients”, including their Aadhaar data, and helped Deb run the fake camps. The Alipore court sent the three to police custody till July 2. In the new FIRs at Kasba police station, police said the total cheated amount would cross Rs 1 crore. In the first case, one private firm alleged they paid Deb around Rs 1.2 lakh to get its 172 employees vaccinated. Another Tangra contractor claimed he was cheated of Rs 90 lakh after Deb promised to get him a contract for the construction of a stadium off EM Bypass. In the third FIR, a pharma company claimed Deb cheated them of Rs 4 lakh by promising to arrange a tender on their behalf. By evening, a medicine trader claimed Deb had not paid him Rs 26 lakh after buying medicines from him. The private bank, which was provided fake documents to open a current account, is also contemplating filing a case. Police will also probe the role of some KMC officials and contractors. “We are writing to KMC to know if he was awarded any contracts directly. We are also enquiring if he had access to any officer at the headquarters,” said a source. His police links will also be investigated. “We are asking OCs to report how Deb took part in the programmes held by the force,” said a senior officer. Deb’s links with information and cultural affairs department officials, with whom he had worked at times from 2014 to 2017, are under scanner. Cops visited Taltala, where Deb had stored his Covid kits at a club and met politicians and traders during 2020 Jagaddhatri Puja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/attempt-to-murder-slapped-vax-conman-faces-life-term/articleshow/83879258.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

People using android phones can also find the nmc e-connect on Google Play Store,” he said. This appeal comes after a citizen, who registered a complaint through a link was cheated for around Rs 25,000. According to a complaint letter (not an FIR) with the Panchavati police station, Yogesh Patil, a resident of Mhasrul road registered a grievance with the NMC through an online portal. He searched for the complaint grievances portal of NMC and reached www.complaintboard.in/complaintboard-reviews/nashik-nmc, where he registered the grievance about drainage problem outside his residential society. He got a call and the caller said he was speaking on behalf of NMC’s centralised call centre located in Noida and asked the victim to pay Rs 20 as fees through the online payment link sent. The victim followed and marked Rs 20 as pay but Rs 4,096 was withdrawn from his account. He immediately called the same number following which the caller asked the victim to click on the same link as he had modified the ‘payment amount’ and the excess amount would be returned. Upon clicking for the second time, Rs 20,000 was siphoned off. Jadhav said there is no centralized customer call centre as such.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/register-complaints-on-nmc-website-or-via-app/articleshow/83876528.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Aurangabad||RTO gathers data of ambulances, oxygen tankers||Aurangabad: Acting on the directives of the state government, the regional transport office (RTO), Aurangabad, has started compiling data related of ambulance services and oxygen supplying tankers. Aurangabad regional transport officer Sanjay Metrewar said that the measure has been ordered with a view to prepare for the possible third wave of Covid-19. “Going by the past experiences, it is essential to have data of ambulance services which can be contacted and roped in during any health crisis. The country, for the first time, witnessed mass transportation of oxygen for medical purposes during the current pandemic and, therefore, having data of such transportation services would also prove handy,” he said. The office of transport commissioner has asked all RTOs in Maharashtra to submit the necessary data from their jurisdiction by June 28. The desired details involve vehicle registration details of the ambulance service and the contact number of its owner and operator. Regarding the oxygen supplying tankers, the RTOs have been told to mention the dimensions of the vehicle also while sending the data. “The supply of medial oxygen was routed through the Indian Railways in many parts of the country that were hit due to Covid-19. Some tankers were found unfit for carrying oxygen from these special trains due to height or width-related issues,” Metrewar said. As per official data, Aurangabad district has around 350 registered ambulance services and around eight tankers engaged in the supply of medical oxygen. Notably, RTOs have been also told to bring on record vehicles operating as ambulances without official registration. To achieve this, RTOs have been asked to make the best use of mobile teams ‘Vayu Veg’ to track down such vehicles, it was said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rto-gathers-data-of-ambulances-oxygen-tankers/articleshow/83876513.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Panel to examine engg option for biology group students||Ahmedabad: The state government has decided to form a special committee to frame rules for admission to undergraduate professional courses. The 11-member committee, to be chaired by Gujarat Technological University (GTU) vice-chancellor Navin Sheth, will among other issues consider the option of allowing Class 12 Science B group students (who opted for biology instead of mathematics) to enrol in engineering courses.“The All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has given its assent to the option of students from Group B or those haven’t opted for PCM (physics, chemistry and mathematics) in Class 12 science also getting admission to engineering courses. It is now for the state government to decide if it wants to allow this option,” said a source in the education department.The decision is likely to bring relief to engineering colleges which had about 34,000 vacant seats last year. About 54,000 students are likely to pass out this year from the A group after the government cancelled the board examinations. Some 80,000 students of Class 12 science (B group) will also pass this year. “This year, more students are likely to enrol for engineering courses due to which the number of vacant seats may gone down substantially,” said a government source. Kamlesh Joshipura, member of the fee regulatory committee (technical) and former vice-chancellor of Saurashtra University, and Rajul Gajjar, member-secretary of the admission committee for professional courses (ACPC) who is also principal of LD College of Engineering, are part of the committee. The committee will frame rules for college admission including increased weight being given to the Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET) over Class 12 performance for college admissions, sources said. Every year a merit list for college admissions is drawn up by giving 40% weight to the percentile obtained in GujCET and 60% weight to the percentile in the Class 12 (science) board exams. “We will consider changing this to 60% weight to GujCET and 40% to the Class 12 (science) performance,” said a member of the proposed committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/panel-to-examine-engg-option-for-biology-group-students/articleshow/83879147.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Pandemic nightmares? Get help at Dutch psychoanalyst’s ‘spooky cafe’||Somewhere along the streets of Varanasi, Manoj is accosted by a big black cobra with its hood spread out, staring at him in rage. He wants to run away but the ground beneath him is teeming with angry venomous vipers. He fears that if he moves, they might bite and so he freezes.  Shubhangini is in Bangalore, driving her son to school for his annual day program. But it’s not a regular road. The path is made up of stairs spiralling upwards. Shubhangini trundles along until the stairs go missing. The car crashes. Mother and son are safe until the son stumbles. Shubhangini grabs him but he slips away. She goes running down in desperation and finds her bruised son tiptoeing out of the wreck.  What seems like a leaf out of a dystopian script is in fact a surrealist collection of dreams that people around the country have been getting out of bed with. As waking life itself takes on an odd and illusive air in the pandemic — people have been reporting more strange and intense dreams than usual — some related to the virus, some about abstract fears, and some just bizarre.  With people puzzling over this phenomenon, Dutch Jungian psychoanalyst Robert Bosnak, who has spent the past four decades studying dreams, has been in much demand lately. After walking Americans through their surreal dreams at the peak of the pandemic in the US, Bosnak has been hosting what he calls the Spooky Dreams Cafe — a free Friday-night online gathering to address the pandemic dreams of people in India.  “I started this in March 2020 when things got bad in New York. India is now going through what the US went through last year. Volatile emotions have triggered powerful dreams that reinforce the trauma that people are experiencing and I wanted to give people in India a chance to get together and talk about their dreams because dreams can be very helpful in times of stress,” explains Bosnak who refuses to interpret dreams. “I create an artificial flashback and help shift perspective from the narrator. When you start experiencing it from the other perspective — be it a person, animal, or object — something remarkable happens,” says Bosnak who helped Manoj deal with the cobra in his dream and his fear of dying by getting him to re-enter his dream and embody the snake. “Emotions are embodied states. For Manoj, his entire body was affected by fear. Once he moved out of that embodiment to a non-habitual one, his fears calmed down and healing began to take place.” Except for the location of the dreamers, the peculiarity of pandemic dreams points to fundamental human problems — survival, death, loss, anger and rage — that go beyond culture, points out Bosnak. “A woman in New York walking through the city unable to recognise the city she lives in and an Indian woman climbing up a hill, not recognising where she is. The tricky thing about the pandemic is you don’t see destruction everywhere because it’s not a war. Everything looks exactly the same and yet it's unrecognisable,” says Bosnak stressing on the “healing power” of nightmares. Shubhangini, a regular at Bosnak’s Dreams Cafe, now maintains a dream journal and is learning to channel “bad” dreams. “I realise it springs from the emotional and physical chaos I’ve been experiencing in the pandemic. Addressing that turbulence within me is helping me process real-life anxieties,” she says.  Mumbai’s Shashi Mudgal believes that her recurring pandemic dream about her father she lost five years ago, stems from a place of hidden grief, “illuminated” in the quarantine. “With the blurring of structures and borders and nowhere to go, I now see a movement between my waking life and dreams.” India now has a small community of Jungians with two Jung Centers in Bangalore and Ahmedabad and close to 30 clinical and non-clinical Jungian psychoanalysts, increasingly integrating dreamwork into their mental health practices. “Kusum Dhar Prabhu was India’s one and only Jungian analyst in the ‘80s. It’s still a small group that became active around 2017 but in the pandemic, we’ve seen more people drawn to Jungian psychoanalysis,” says Manasa K, president, Jung Center Bangalore that has been running an online Facebook group since last year called ‘Dream Sutra’.“With the usual systems broken up and a fear of the vast unknown, people are looking inward and especially curious about their powerful dream imagery,” says Manasa, who prefers leaving it to the dreamer to determine what their subconscious mini-movies mean. “We refrain from analysing any dream and let the meaning emerge for each of us individually.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pandemic-nightmares-get-help-at-dutch-psychoanalysts-spooky-cafe/articleshow/83881679.cms||Mohua Das

According to some developers, with the festive season approaching, the sale of properties will further gain momentum in the next few months. “The fact that a significant number of residential properties were booked in such a short span of time is an indication that despite the pandemic, people are keen on buy flats. Apart from local Nashik residents, people from Mumbai, Pune and other districts of north Maharashtra are showing interest in buying residential properties here,” said Mahajan. Nashik’s realty sector had come to standstill between March and May due to the second Covid wave. Construction activities had stopped as migrant workers had left for their hometowns. However, with the restrictions being eased and the pandemic ebbing in Nashik, migrant workers have started returning and construction work has restarted. Mahajan added the quantum of inquiries from prospective buyers too had increased significantly and the conversions of these inquiries into actual business will take another couple of months. Sujoy Gupta, the chairman of the realty firm Samraat Group in Nashik, said things are gradually looking up. “I have various residential projects under construction in different parts of the city. In June alone, my firm sold 30 flats. Some of these buyers are from Mumbai. If this positive trend continues, the real estate sector will register good growth. I am getting plenty of calls for my properties,” Gupta said. Umesh Wankhede, the office-bearer of Credai-Nashik and the chairman of the real estate committee of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (MACCIA) said over 1,000 residential projects with around 20,000 flats are under construction across the city. “During the first and second Covid waves, people came to realise how much they need a home. Therefore, many have started planning to buy homes,” said Wankhede. Naresh Karda, chairman of Karda Constructions, a major realty company, said although there are restrictions after 4 pm, people are visiting project sites in the morning. Calls and site visits have increased this month and some inquiries have also converted into bookings. He did not disclose how many flats have been sold in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/300-flats-sold-in-nashik-in-june-after-relaxation-in-restrictions/articleshow/83876557.cms||Tushar Pawar

Stating that Covid situation in Aurangabad is well under control, Aurangabad Jilha Vyparati Mahasangh (AJVM), has pressed for permissions for different shops to operate between 7 am and 7pm. “As our social responsibility, we followed all Covid-related restrictions in letter and spirit in the past. Such cooperation included closure of shops for almost one-and-a-half month until early June to contain the spread of the infection. We will ensure whole-hearted support to the battle against the pandemic this time also but no unilateral decision must be taken on timing of our shops,” AJVM president Jagannath Kale said. As per Level III restrictions defined in the past, shops other than offering emergency services were allowed to remain open up to 4 pm from Monday to Friday and remained shut completely on Saturdays and Sundays. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan said that the Level III restrictions have been defined by the state government itself and were uniform in nature. “We will issue a detailed order regarding fresh instructions shortly,” he added. Also, citing financial losses running into crores of rupees, AJVM has also demanded relief measures to tide over the crisis. “A very large population is dependent on the retail sector and different elements associate with it. Despite reeling under the financial losses for more than a year, the government has not considered any relief measures for us. Besides a separate relief package, waiver in different taxes and payment of utility bills has become essential now,” Kale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/allow-shops-to-open-from-7am-to-7pm-traders-body/articleshow/83876538.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ethnographic study of Warli tribe documents 150 Waghoba shrines||Mumbai: Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which has the highest population density of leopards along with Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary, shows the presence of Waghoba shrines. Waghoba refers to big cats (tigers and leopards) whose worship is highly prevalent among the indigenous Warli community. The worship of the big cats points to building of a mechanism for co-existence in shared spaces.While leopards today populate the landscape, anecdotal evidence and government records show the presence of tigers.In a rare ethnographic study of Warli tribe cultural practices, 150 Waghoba shrines were documented in Thane, Mumbai suburbs and Palghar, showing the worship of Waghoba is highly prevalent among the indigenous community. The study by Ramya Nair, Dhee, Omkar Patil, Nikit Surve, Anish Andheria, John Linnell and Vidya Athreya in 2018-19, documents oral narratives related to Waghoba and negotiation of shared spaces in relation to big cats in multi-use landscape. GPS location of each shrine was recorded to map its geographical distribution.The article ‘Sharing Spaces and Entanglements with Big Cats: The Warli and Their Waghoba in Maharashtra, India’, published in ‘Frontiers in Conservation Science’ in April reveals the cultural and societal context within which co-existence is embedded and shaping of human-leopard relationship in the landscape.The article focused on Warli communities, though the Waghoba is also worshipped by Kolis and Thakkers. All villages that housed the Warli community had a Waghoba shrine. Athreya, scientist, Wildlife Conservation Trust, which funded the study, said this was the first time a study had been done on the shrines.“The study is essential to understand existing relationships and need to acknowledge the importance of traditional institutions for conservation,” said Athreya. The oral narratives reveal the shrines were an outcome of a need to avoid man-animal conflict.In Kartod village, which has the only big temple to Waghoba, the killing of a tiger by a mother to save her child led to the setting up of a shrine on the advice of the Shaman(village medicine man) to avoid misfortune.The deity carved in stone or wood along with the sun or moon is worshipped on special events of the community and on the first day of Diwali, celebrated as Waghbaras.“Warlis commence important life and social events, such as weddings, naming a child and building a new home, only after receiving blessings from Waghoba. Likewise, they pray to the deity so that the big cats do not prey on livestock,” the article states.It focuses on the role played by the Shaman, an intermediary between people and big cats. The article underlines the need for conservationists to focus on ecological dimensions and understand social cultural constructs in aiding shared spaces. “We learnt Warlis believe in a reciprocal relationship where Waghoba will protect them from negative impacts of sharing spaces with big cats if people worship the deity and conduct the required rituals, especially the annual festival of Waghbaras,” the article stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ethnographic-study-of-warli-tribe-documents-150-waghoba-shrines/articleshow/83881741.cms||Clara Lewis

He also announced a cash award of Rs 2 crore for those winning silver and Rs 1 crore for bronze medallists at the multi-national event next month. Also known as Tokyo 2020, the 2020 Summer Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8, 2021, in Japan after it was postponed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We had promised in the DMK election manifesto that an Olympic Academy will be established in four zones in Tamil Nadu. Our promises will be fulfilled. A world-class gym and a state-of-the-art facility to scientifically aid sportspersons will also be set up,” Stalin said. Stalin was addressing athletes and sportspersons from Tamil Nadu after inaugurating a special Covid vaccination camp for sportspersons at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium. The camp was organized by the Department of Youth Welfare and Sports, Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu, Health Department and Tamil Nadu Olympic Association. Stalin promised that his government is committed to promoting sportspersons. “Whether it’s a sixer by Dhoni or a goal by Ronaldo (Cristiano), the audience in the stadium and those watching on television feel it as a personal achievement,” Stalin said on a sportsperson’s connect with people. He added that icons such as Sachin Tendulkar, M S Dhoni, P T Usha and Karnam Malleswari inspire the next generation of sports personalities. “A sportsperson can inspire a generation and you all should keep that in your mind and be assured that the Tamil Nadu government will support you in your well-being and welfare.” Stalin said. He also spoke on the importance of team spirit in sports. “Life is a game, it is said. There are several in this country who treat politics like a game too. But, sports should be taken seriously. Sportspersons bring repute to the country and inspire a generation,” Stalin said. Reminiscing about his sporting abilities in his youth, the chief minister said that not only as the leader of the state, but also as a sports enthusiast he will stand by athletes and sportspersons for their development. Nethra Kumanan, Varun Thakkar and K C Ganapathy (sailing), G Sathian and A Sharath Kamal (table tennis), C A Bhavani Devi (fencing) and paralympian T Mariappan have qualified for the marquee event from Tamil Nadu. Bhavani Devi, who became the first-ever Indian fencer to qualify for the Tokyo Olympic, has been provided an incentive of Rs 5 lakh. The other six athletes will also be provided the cash incentive, Stalin said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rs-3-crore-for-tn-athletes-who-win-oly-gold-cm/articleshow/83879169.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Schools, parents protest 25% fee waiver||AHMEDABAD: After school management, the state education department’s plans to extend the scheme of waiving 25% school fees for the academic year 2021-22 as well, is facing resistance from parents. While the school trustees have threatened to seek legal action if the government does not rethink its decision, parents’ groups want a fee waiver of not less than 50%. The All Gujarat Parents’ Association on Saturday said they will also explore legal option if the fee waiver is not raised to 50%. “There are many parents who have suffered financially in the second wave and due to Covid-19 related restrictions. Job losses and financial crisis remain a big challenge for parents for over a year now. Online education is likely to continue this year too given that the country will face the third wave of Covid-19 in next few months. So, we demand that the government increases the fee waiver to 50%,” said a member of the association. The new academic session for schools began on June 7 in the state. Many schools have taken advance cheques of fees from parents, said sources. On Friday, state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama told media persons that the government plans to give a fee relief of 25% this year as well. According to school trustees and management, schools are faced with severe financial crisis as many parents haven’t paid the fees for 2020-21 after the government announced to cut fees last year. There are some 20,000 self-financed schools in the state which will be affected by the government’s decision. Last September, the state government directed all private schools to cut annual school fees by 25% for 2020-21. The Self-Financed School Management of Gujarat has threatened legal action if the government implements the 25% fee waiver plans as announced before the media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-parents-protest-25-fee-waiver/articleshow/83879193.cms||---

Some of them are set to start next week. The Kerala University has scheduled the fourth semester UG examinations on June 29 and July 1. Other exams, including PG, BEd and MBA, would also start by the end of this month. Following online protests by students, Shashi Tharoor, MP had urged governor Arif Mohammed Khan to intervene in his capacity as the chancellor. The student community, Tharoor said, were going through a period of mental stress and uncertainty. It would be improper to push them to attend off line exams when they are not fully vaccinated and with no proper public transportation available now. KSU president K M Abhijit said the government should direct universities to conduct exams online or explore other options to evaluate students. “Since no serious academic interaction happens in the online teaching mechanism the universities have currently put in place, there is no logic in insisting that the unvaccinated students should troop to colleges and take exams on classes which never happened,” he said. The exams should be held online or postponed till all students are vaccinated or the Covid situation improves, he said. Meanwhile, protests still continue against the general education department move to conduct Plus One examination in offline mode in September. The Supreme Court had, the other day, advised a set of petitioners to take up the matter with the Kerala high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/concern-as-varsities-go-for-offline-exams/articleshow/83879199.cms||B S Anilkumar
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Two die after consuming spurious liquor in Etah, one critical||AGRA: Two persons died after allegedly drinking spurious liquor at Jamalpur Durjan village under Jalesar police station area in UP’s Etah district on Friday while one is battling for life at a private hospital in Hathras. The deceased were identified as Mahesh Singh and Jaipal Yadav while Raghuraj is in hospital. According to police, the family members cremated Mahesh without informing the authorities. However, police managed to secure Jaipal’s body and have sent it for a post-mortem examination. Giving details, Uday Shanker Singh, Etah senior superintendent of police, said, “Preliminary investigation found that the three people drank liquor on the evening of June 24, and they fell ill in the night. Mahesh and Jaipal died on Friday. Raghuraj was admitted to a private hospital. We have received information that the three men had put some tablets in the liquor. We are awaiting the post-mortem report of Jaipal.” An alert has been sounded in Etah following the two deaths that took place just weeks after some 100 people died of alcohol poisoning in Aligarh between May 28 and June 6. The hooch deaths were first reported in Aligarh’s Lodha block when villagers started dying allegedly after consuming toxic liquor illegally sold to authorized vends. The toll soon spread to adjoining blocks. On June 2, 12 people died after drinking toxic liquor dumped by the same gang along the Upper Ganga canal near Rohera village in Jawan area. Another person had died the day after in Aligarh’s Kodiyagunj village. SSP Uday Shanker Singh said, “The entire matter is being investigated by the Jalesar police station team. We are trying to identify the place from where the three men had purchased the liquor. Raghuraj’s statement will soon be recorded. All the station house officers have been directed to ensure no manufacturing or sale of spurious liquor takes place in their areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/two-die-after-consuming-spurious-liquor-in-etah-one-critical/articleshow/83874827.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Backlog Covid deaths push second wave toll by 7.5% in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: The number of Covid-19 deaths in the second wave of pandemic has gone up by 7.5% in the last few days with the addition of 106 casualties that occurred between April 1 and May 31 but were not updated by the hospitals on health department’s Covid portal. These ‘uncounted’ deaths came to the fore in the last 11 days when the office of the chief medical officer (CMO) asked the hospitals –designated as Covid facilities during the surge in April-May – to conduct an audit of their manual records and update the data on the portal. The process to update the records on the portal started on June 15. Since then, 106 casualties have been reported from about a dozen hospitals, both government and private. These hospitals include Balrampur Hospital, DRDO Covid facility and a prominent private hospital on Kanpur road, among others. The most devastating period of the second wave was from April 1 to May 31 when about 1,226 patients died, according to the estimates based on state covid bulletins issued daily. Now, after the audit, it has been revealed that during this two-month period at least 106 (8.6%) more deaths took place in addition to 1,226 fatalities in Covid hospitals. As a result, overall casualties since the start of the second wave from March 15 till June 26 (Saturday), has reached 1,429. These 106 ‘backlog’ deaths account for around 7.5% of the total toll. In April, when the daily cases were very high, many patients died for the want of oxygen-supported beds in hospitals overwhelmed by the surge. Some patients also succumbed while in home isolation as they could not get oxygen cylinders on time. These causalities have not been counted in the overall toll so far. Health officers said it was the duty of the hospitals to feed the data of deaths in real time. These deaths were recorded manually in the hospital register but not uploaded on the portal then, apparently because of untrained staff and workload. Officers said they would also include deaths that occured in home isolation if reported by the families of Covid victims. CMO Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “Every hospital has been given a user ID and password for the portal to update details of patient admissions and deaths in real-time. However, some hospitals have updated data now when we asked them to conduct an audit.” Director, Balarampur Hospital, Dr SK Pandey said, “The records of the deaths and admissions are duly communicated to the CMO office daily and it has to upload them on the portal.” Similarly, officials managing DRDO hospital said they had given soft copies as well as hard copies of all the records to the CMO office to feed the data on the portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/backlog-covid-deaths-push-second-wave-toll-by-7-5/articleshow/83880349.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Goa||Goa: Salcete businessmen in a quandary over vaccination hesitancy in staff||COLVA: Vaccine hesitancy among employees has been a cause for concern among several small businessmen in Salcete’s coastal belt. They say that despite coaxing staff to get inoculated against Covid-19 — especially during the government’s free statewide vaccination drives — many have refused to comply. As a result, a number of entrepreneurs have now begun informing their workers that their services may be terminated if they do not get the jab. Some local authorities too have been issuing notices to businessmen, hawkers and vendors instructing them to get themselves and their staff vaccinated in order to stem the spread of the pandemic. “Of the 10-12 personnel in my store, some have not even taken the first dose of the vaccine despite me trying to convince them. I have informed them that they might lose their jobs,” a businessman from the area said. Despite the deadly second wave of Covid-19 crippling the state’s healthcare infrastructure and claiming several lives, apprehensions about vaccination against the virus continue to be widespread. Some youths who run a vegetable kiosk at Varca told TOI that they hadn’t participated in Tika Utsav 3 — which began on June 13 — despite the vaccine being offered in their very village. In another instance, five members of a family who operate a general store disclosed that none of them had taken the first dose of the vaccine. They attributed this to a clash in timings. “Our business hours are from 7am to 3pm. By the time we close and have lunch, it is past 4pm, by which time the vaccination drive ends,” they said. Some others running small businesses have a different take. “Vaccination goes both ways. Besides staff having vaccine hesitancy, some customers visiting my store can have the same fears,” a store owner said. “But while I can urge my personnel to get the jab, I cannot keep asking customers if they have taken the vaccine. If I do this, I might lose my customer base.” Differences in opinion also prevail among the local authorities. While Varca sarpanch Charlton Lourenco said he has issued notices to all entrepreneurs within the panchayat’s jurisdiction to get themselves and their staff vaccinated, Carmona sarpanch Allwyn Jorge maintained that such directions must come from higher authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salcete-bizmen-in-a-quandary-over-vax-hesitancy-in-staff/articleshow/83880360.cms||---
---||Delhi||Not enough water in Delhi, still most private players don’t harvest rain||NEW DELHI: Around 98% of Delhi Jal Board properties, 91% of eligible educational institutes and 67% of government buildings have been equipped with rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. In the case of private properties, however, coverage remains dismal, with only 2,116 private buildings in Delhi equipped with functional RWH systems at present. A recent DJB report states that 4,124 schools and colleges now have RWH systems, while installation in the remaining 407 eligible institutes will be carried out in a phase-wise manner. Similarly, 3,705 government buildings can now harvest rainwater, with 1,767 yet to do so. In August 2019, DJB made it mandatory for all the properties with area of 100 sq metres and above to have functional RWH systems. As per regulation 50 of Delhi Water and Sewer (Tariff and Metering) Regulations, buildings with RWH systems get a rebate of 10% in the water bill, while those failing to comply are required to pay 1.5 times the bill amount as penalty. Compliance has been lower than expectations. A DJB official said that revenue department records showed only 2,116 properties eligible for the rebate, up from 1,869 in July last year. More than 13,286 DJB customers have been penalised for non-implementation of the RWH rule and fined a cumulative Rs 74 crore. The DJB official said, “Rain centres and Jal Shakti Kendras have been created in each district and anyone can visit these places to learn about the guidelines, requirements, basic structures and rebates for RWH systems.” TOI visited parts of Delhi and found RWH pits choked with silt, leaves and natural debris in both residential colonies as well as on flyovers. The lack of maintenance of such units, including covering the collection area, is impeding progress, claimed experts. In Vasant Vihar, locals reported that recharge pits and stormwater drains were either covered completely or were concretised to create parking space, resulting in waterlogging each monsoon. “Regular inspections by the authorities can help improve the situation,” suggested Vallari Sheel, local resident and tree activist. Rajiv Suri, a Defence Colony resident, pointed out that community parks offered a great option for rainwater harvesting if each park had one large RWH pit to naturally boost the groundwater collection in the area. Suri said while RWH units had been created over the Kushak drain in the locality, the entire structure was concretised and covered, thus stopping water from percolating down below. “RWH pits have been built over the Kushak drain, but they are at an elevation and not at the lowest point to which water can easily run down,” explained Suri. “They also do not have openings and residents are unsure whether this is recharging the water table. Natural and much smaller pits could be made instead where a bioswale exists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-enough-water-in-capital-still-most-pvt-players-dont-harvest-rain/articleshow/83879202.cms||Paras Singh

Speaking on the occasion of the International Day of the Seafarer, GSAI urged the Centre and state government to address concerns of the seafarers, and in particular the vaccination drive rollout. GSIA is likely to approach the government asking for a scheme to help retired and unemployed seafarers set up their own businesses. “We have observed that a lot of our seafarers are in very critical financial condition. Our plan is to approach the government if some of our seafarers want to start a business, to give them an interest-free loan without any collateral security,” said Gabrial Pinto while speaking on the occasion of Day of the Seafarers. Stating that the pandemic has heaped misery on retired seafarers, Pinto said that former seamen could earn their livelihoods if the government provided initial financial assistance. “It is time for the government to intervene and save livelihoods of those who have helped keep Goa’s economy afloat,” Pinto said. GSAI president Frank Viegas said that because of the prevailing “grim scenario” thousands of seafarers continue to remain stranded aboard ships for longer than usual periods. “An equal number of them are here facing financial difficulties, desperate to relieve crew on ships and start earning wages again,” said Viegas. GSAI said that the Day of the Seafarers is an appropriate occasion to seek better working conditions and welfare of seafarers. “We urge and plead with the Central government to urgently address the pending issues such as debarment of continuous discharge certificates (CDC) pension which has been stopped from October 2019,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/help-struggling-seafarers-set-up-biz-govt-urged/articleshow/83880365.cms||---

Chakraborty — who has a sluggish liver and gall stones — has been suffering from severe stomach cramps and low blood pressure. She also had a fever on Wednesday. Chakraborty’s doctors, however, have said that the actor-politician’s illness may not be related to the fake vaccine — which, according to an investigation by Kolkata Police, possibly contained Amikacin. Her creatinine and urea level in the blood is satisfactory as well and doctors suspect the stomach cramp and drop in blood pressure may have happened because of excessive stress. The TMC MP from Jadavpur had taken to Instagram on Thursday afternoon to ask all those who had taken the vaccine along with her to remain calm and not to panic. Even after her illness on Friday, she has stressed that the illness may not be related to the vaccine as she waits for a final lab test report from the KMC about the contents of the vaccine. While her cellphone was switched off on Saturday, she is learnt to have confided in her close associates that she would take a fresh shot of the vaccine once the lab test reports arrive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mimi-falls-ill-but-docs-say-it-may-not-be-related-to-fake-vax/articleshow/83879197.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

A scam worth crores of rupees has been carried out by members of BJP and their relatives. Did the PM ask why this scam happened? Has he sought to know who all are involved in it? Land worth Rs 5 crore was sold for Rs 18.5 crore while another piece of land worth Rs 30 lakh was sold for Rs 2.5 crore,” he said. In his letter to Bhagwat, Singh alleged that the trust is stealing from the donations made by lakhs of people for the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and he would like to meet Bhagwat with proof to update him on the scam. On Saturday, Singh made fresh accusations against BJP mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay and his relatives, linking them with the land scam. “A 255 sqm land worth Rs 10 lakh was bought by the mayor’s accountant Vishnu Kumar from Harish Pathak’s brother Anil Kumar Mishra on March 15. The witness to the deal was Deep Kumar Narayan, the mayor’s nephew. This land was sold to the trust for Rs 60 lakh on March 18, and the witnesses to this deal were Upadhyay and Mishra,” he said. Claiming that the same group of people had been purchasing land at cheaper rates and selling it within days or, in one case even minutes, at several times profit to the Trust, Singh said details of some of these deals had been exposed in public but the government was yet to take cognisance of these.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-mp-wants-to-meet-rss-chief-over-temple-land-row/articleshow/83880368.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Papers in, wetland authority to revive, conserve 180 waterbodies||NEW DELHI: As Delhi currently does not have a single notified waterbody, the state wetland authority and other agencies concerned are working towards conservation of around 180 waterbodies. The agencies concerned have submitted documents for ecological restoration and conservation of these waterbodies. The Union ministry of environment and forest and climate change came out with guidelines last year for implementing Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. The guidelines state that for each wetland proposed to be notified, a ‘brief document’ has to be prepared with information like demarcation of wetland boundary, supported by accurate digital maps with coordinates and validated by ground truthing; ecological character description; account of pre-existing rights and privileges and modalities for enforcement of regulation. TimesViewDelhi is plagued by pollution. Wetlands help reduce pollution, recharge groundwater tables and provide habitats for flora and fauna. At least some of these water bodies should be notified. They deserve legal protection.An official of the state wetland authority said, “We have received brief documents for around 180 waterbodies. A committee comprising wetland experts will review these documents. The brief document also contains challenges in the management of wetlands like dumping of waste, discharge of sewage, encroachment or excessive growth of weed. Once they are finalised, we will start our work by prioritising the environmental characteristics of a wetland and start the process of notifying them.” The official added that “the submission of documents by land-owning agencies acknowledges the presence of waterbodies.” According to the guidelines of the Union ministry of environment & forest, the state wetland authority may endorse the brief document to the state government concerned or UT administration. If a wetland is notified under Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, it will start getting legal protection and activities like dumping of waste, discharge of untreated effluents and encroachment will be prohibited for its conservation, said an official. Authorities at the state wetland authority, which constituted in 2019 for restoration of wetlands after an order of NGT, said there was no official data on the number of wetlands and their area in Delhi but it was believed that there were around 1,000 natural waterbodies in the capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/papers-in-wetland-authority-to-revive-conserve-180-waterbodies/articleshow/83879210.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Chennai||Covid ‘country drug’ kills 1 in Tamil Nadu; 3 critical||ERODE: One woman died while her husband and two others were battling for lives after they consumed a ‘country drug’ for Covid-19 near Chennimalai in Erode district on Saturday. Police said an unidentified person had visited the house of 70-year-old Karuppanna Gounder at Perumalmalai area in Karungoundanvalasu village on Saturday morning to test the family members for Covid-19. Superintendent of police V Sasimohan said the person had given them some tablets saying that it was a ‘nattu marundhu’ (country drug) that would help them keep the virus at bay. Karuppanna, his 55-year-old wife K Mallika, daughter Deepa, 30, and maid Kuppammal, 65, consumed the tablets. “Within a few minutes, they started vomiting and swooned on the floor. Neighbours rushed them to the government hospital in Erode. Mallika, however, died on the way,” the SP said. Karuppanna and his daughter were later shifted to a private hospital in Coimbatore. Maid Kuppammal has been referred to the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital. The SP said Karuppanna and Deepa were out of danger, while Kuppammal’s condition was critical. “The father-daughter duo are still in the intensive care unit.” The SP said four teams led by deputy superintendent of police (Perundurai division) V Selvaraj have been formed to nab the accused. “The preliminary inquiry hasn’t shed any light into the incident. Efforts are on to nab the accused at the earliest.” The SP said the exact reason behind their death could be ascertained only after postmortem. “We don’t know about the medicine and the same could be ascertained only after the viscera test.” The Chennimalai police have registered a case and further investigations are on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/covid-country-drug-kills-1-in-tn-3-critical/articleshow/83879230.cms||---
---||Nagpur||‘Immediate task is 3rd wave. It’s always good to be overprepared'||The Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS), formed over 50 years ago in the city, is a society of multiple specialists under one umbrella. It has 2,200 doctors. Such a society across the country is unique, says its president Dr Ravindra Sarnaik. In 1967, the society was initiated with the vision to bring different specialists on one interactive platform to facilitate communication, understand challenges, educate doctors and promote publishing work in reputed journals. Dr Sarnaik, a well-known pulmonologist, is also national vice-president of the Indian Chest Society(Maharashtra chapter) and chairman of the National College of Chest Physicians. In an interview to TOI, the member of various Covid task force appointed by the court, civic body and district administration, talks about the AMS’s role amid emerging infections like mucormycosis, and the recent cluster of cases in the district.Excerpts... Q. What are the aims and objectives of AMS?A. The AMS was formed to promote medical education for specialist doctors, clinical research and publication of distinguished work. The academy encourages documentation and publication of challenging cases and surgeries in reputed scientific journals. The city is blessed with renowned medical professionals who are making us proud across the world. We have formed a committee for encouraging international membership for our esteemed alumni settled overseas. Every year, many doctors from institutions are successfully making progress in various fields in different parts of the world, and doing a commendable work. We aim to connect with them through AMS.Q. In what way does the society help Nagpur?A. We plan to initiate a central information system as per AMS objectives and uniformly work with plans of regulatory authorities for rural health as well as issues posed due to the long-Covid. We shall conduct training and workshops for doctors beside community services. Past presidents and former office bearers are actively helping us in different ways. Various subcommittees have been formed focusing on preventive health and planning to take this forum forward. The health and fitness committee shall sensitise members for regular health checks, guiding them regarding research advances in exercise, diet and nutrition through cyclical meetings, training and workshops.Q. What is the role of the committee?A. We have subcommittees with one chairman and members comprising various specialists like pulmonologist, cardiologist, paedertician, gynaecologist etc. The subcommittee, New Emerging and Re-emerging Infection (NERI), is a special committee formed in the backdrop of the pandemic. This has a unique objective of evaluation, analysis and creation of evidence based preparedness to face the likely medical emergencies in the community. The NERI committee consists of experts, who are working in networking with different agencies, building up consensus and formulating solutions in available resources. The immediate task ahead is the projected third wave of the pandemic and the principle of working is, its always good to be overprepared than underprepared.Q. Tell us about the emerging infection? A. The emerging infection is a important subject. In 1999, WHO and the Centre for Disease Control had announced that the incidence of infectious disease in the human race would be the greatest health threat that has no national boundaries. It travels across the globe in a very short time. We have seen influenza outbreaks due to climate change. New variants of viruses do emerge, despite attaining herd immunity and vaccination. In short time, the novel coronavirus variants have not only emerged, but have taken over the original wild strains in a number of infections. The old infection or it’s re-emergence has multifactorial effect/reasons and they account for public health problems. Subcommittee will focus on preparedness for such re-emerging diseases. With the viewpoint of CDC and WHO, it will assess and evaluate how re-emerging disease can be controlled. Currently, we have cases of the Delta Plus variant in India. A subcommittee shall analyse it’s likely impact in the region and give suggestions to control its spread. Specialists will collect reliable data, assist in submitting scientific understanding thereof. These would surely give input that can be shared with administrators as a fact check to even circulate in social media for community education.Q. Will it run parallel to other official committees?A. AMS is an independent NGO with own aims and objectives. As every geographical area has its own specific local issues, the rapid action plan for comorbidities with Covid like cancer or heart disease, diabetes has to be different. Our committee would tie up with advisors of national repute for guidance.Q. What is the plan regarding the black fungus?A. The government has formed a task force. Being part of the committee, we are aware about the terms of reference. If there is an adverse patient, we get data. Our emerging infection committee members will study why Nagpur is one of the few cities where an unprecendented number of mucormycosis patients surfaced. Why mucor cases increase so much and how it can be stopped next time our experts will investiage. New infections like Delta variants spread rapidly. By the time we think about it, it has already reached our doorsteps.Q. How will your committees help in Covid, post-Covid?A. Right now, every day we hold meetings on such issues. Many of our members have already treated Covid patients and coordinated with the district task force. Many doctors have utilized evidence-based medicine. For example, ‘X’ medicine or therapy doctors find useful and it becomes popular leading to a shortfall. The academy panel will prepare a document based on scientific rational to help doctors prioritise who needs it the most or how much it is useful. The academy is not a regulatory body nor does it have statutory powers. But scientific rational can be put up by us. Whatever challenges we are going to face, a response will be decided. Theoretically speaking, the second wave was 4.8 times severe than the first and had lakhs of cases. The third wave is estimated to have 1.8 times more impact. So we would need adequate admission or beds, and preparedness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/immediate-task-is-3rd-wave-its-always-good-to-be-overprepared/articleshow/83880400.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The majority of the rain activity occurred in south and central Delhi. India Meteorological Department has forecast chance of light rain on Sunday as well. A dry week is expected after that till July 2. Safdarjung — Delhi’s base station — recorded 0.6 mm of rainfall till 5.30 pm on Saturday, while Lodhi Road recorded 1.2mm in the same period. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD, says conditions are favourable for light showers and drizzle activity on Sunday as well, but dry-warm weather is expected after that. “The maximum could touch 41 degrees Celsius by Tuesday and humidity levels will also remain high. From Tuesday onwards, strong dry surface winds will be a factor in Delhi with no rain expected till July 2,” said Srivastava. Till Saturday morning, Delhi had received 29.6 mm of rainfall in June, as compared to a normal of 47.7mm, making it a deficit of over 30% this month. Srivastava says the onset of monsoon is unlikely this week. “After Sunday, no rain is expected, unless conditions become favourable. Delhi will have to wait longer for monsoon showers,” said the IMD scientist. Delhi’s maximum on Saturday was recorded at 38.7° C — one notch above normal. The minimum was, meanwhile, recorded at 25.6° C — three notches below normal. The relative humidity oscillated between 36% and 71% in the last 24 hours. Despite light showers, the city’s air remained in the ‘moderate’ category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 163 on CPCB’s daily index. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a body under the ministry of earth sciences, says isolated rainfall may occur in some places in Delhi in the next two days. “Although ventilation is favourable for dispersion, long-range transport of dust is expected for the next three days. Isolated rainfall is likely in the next two days and the aerosol washout may influence AQI marginally,” the SAFAR report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/light-rain-expected-today-brace-for-dry-week-ahead/articleshow/83879227.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Schools tell teachers to follow dress code while taking online classes||KOLKATA: Complaints from parents after allegations of a teacher being “inappropriately” dressed while conducting an online class have prompted the headmaster of a prominent government school to issue a notice laying down a dress code for teachers. Several other schools have already informed the faculty about the dos and don’ts while holding online classes. The move came close on the heels of an incident in which Bidhannagar Government High School, a co-educational institution in Salt Lake, had to issue a dress code for teachers after a male teacher of the school was charged with conducting online class with wearing only a pair of trousers but no shirt on his torso. At Ram Mohan Mission School, principal Sujoy Biswas said that teachers have been asked to strictly follow the same dress code while holding online classes as they did during physical classes. “They have been told to wear formal clothes. No inappropriate dressing is allowed. The students are also in their uniforms. There can be no deviation from this rule,” Biswas said. In St. Augustine’s School, Ripon Street, a policy book for teachers exists. “The dress code for faculty is noted down in the handbook of the teachers’ code of conduct. Even during online classes, male teachers wear ties and no sleeveless dresses are permitted for the women teachers. These are the basic codes which pre-existed and remains in place during the virtual classes,” said Richard Gasper, principal of the school. In CBSE affiliated schools, similar instructions have been given out to the teachers. Krishna Damani, the vice-chairman of South Point School managing committee, said, “Last year, teachers were informed about the code to be followed, including appropriate clothing. We have not received any complaints on this count from parents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-tell-teachers-to-follow-dress-code-while-taking-online-classes/articleshow/83879239.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand high court asks CM to convene immediate cabinet meeting and resolve issues of non-payment of wages to roadways workers||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Saturday yet again slammed the state government for its failure to pay the wages of thousands of roadways workers for several months. The court has now asked chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat to immediately call a cabinet meeting, preferably by Monday, and decide on the payment of salaries that have been pending since February. The directions came from the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma during a special sitting on the issue with chief secretary Om Prakash, secretary finance Amit Negi and secretary transport Ranjit Kumar Sinha in attendance. The court was informed by the officials that a proposal is being finalised to tide over the financial crisis and revamp the Uttarakhand Transport Corporation (UTC). The proposal, according to officials, will be tabled before the cabinet. They added that the cabinet is scheduled to meet in the next 15 days. The judges also said that the issue involves the violation of the fundamental rights of the workers. During the hearing, Justice Verma said that the situation is so pathetic that it amounts to begari (forced labour). “Withholding salaries in lieu of work amounts to begari which is also an offence,” said Justice Verma. Meanwhile, the court also stated that the government is “merely making a mumble full of promises” and that “it cannot be permitted to function in a laid-back style”. The court, in its order, said, “It is a critical condition that requires an immediate solution for people who are penniless, and who are beginning to starve. Every single minute counts. They cannot be satisfied with a mere promise that the cabinet will be convened within fifteen days to solve their socio-economic problems. Such a placebo does not cure the disease.” It added that considering the violations of Article 21 (right to life) as well as Article 23 (prohibiting human trafficking, forced labour and slavery) and labour legislation, “the court requests Hon’ble chief minister to immediately call a cabinet meeting, preferably on or before 28.06.2021 to resolve this financial crisis of the corporation, and to ensure that the arrears of salaries from February to June 2021 are paid to the employees”. The bench has directed the chief secretary to inform the court of the cabinet’s decision on the issue by Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-asks-cm-to-convene-immediate-cabinet-meeting-and-resolve-issues-of-non-payment-of-wages-to-roadways-workers/articleshow/83878223.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Delhi||Van Mahotsav kicks off in Delhi, to continue for 15 days||NEW DELHI: Environment minister Gopal Rai on Saturday launched a mega plantation drive — Van Mahotsav — from Garhi Mandu, which will see MLAs from all 70 legislative assemblies and cabinet ministers plant saplings across the capital until July 11. Delhi government has set a target of planting 33 lakh saplings this year — a large chunk of which will be planted during the Van Mahostav drive. “Under the leadership of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, we have organised a mega plantation drive to increase Delhi’s green belt and reduce pollution. After the 2020 state elections, we had decided that two crore saplings would be planted in the next five years. The 33 lakh saplings is the part of this initiative,” said Rai, while planting a sapling and urging citizens to come forward and take free saplings from its 14 government nurseries. The campaign will run for the next fifteen days and the deputy chief minister, cabinet ministers and the Vidhan Sabha speaker will lead this movement in various parts of the city. The environment minister urged people to include tree plantation in their daily lives and make it a habit. “Only then will we be able to deal with this problem. The government has already started working to fight winter pollution. All Delhiites should participate in the Van Mahotsav so that we all can get rid of pollution,” Rai added. Rai, the Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Babarpur had recently asked the agencies to carry out a third-party audit, the final reports of which will be released soon. “All the departments involved in the drive have been ordered to conduct an audit of the saplings being planted. The report of the forest department is complete and will be released soon,” he said. The minister also claimed that a tree transplantation policy was launched last year to ensure Delhi remains green. Expert agencies were also empanelled in the past few weeks to ensure trees were safely transplanted. “Our new tree transplantation policy will help in transplanting trees that were cut due to development projects. The agencies for transplantation have also been empanelled,” Rai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/van-mahotsav-kicks-off-to-continue-for-15-days/articleshow/83879236.cms||---
---||Chennai||50% weightage for Class X score in Tamil Nadu Class XII marks||CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin on Saturday announced the evaluation criteria to compute marks for state board Class XII students by fixing 50% weightage for Class X board exam marks, 30% for Class XII internal assessment and practical exams, and 20% weightage for Class XI marks. The average of the best of three marks scored by students in any of the Class X board subjects would be taken for arriving at the weightage, a government release said. The state education board would also give opportunity for students who are aggrieved with their marks to write an exam after the pandemic and that would be considered as their final Class XII score. Marks will be declared for nearly 8.5 lakh Class XII students before July 31 as ordered by the Supreme Court. The evaluation method announced by TN is different from that of the CBSE which gave almost equal weightage to Class X, XI exams and XII pre-board tests (30:30:40). Explaining the rationale behind more weightage for Class X marks, school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi said students had appeared for Class X exams in a non-pandemic year after attending physical classes. “The Class XI exams conducted last year too was affected by the pandemic. The present method was chosen by the chief minister keeping in mind the interest of rural students, urban students, toppers and average students,” he said. The formula was fixed based on the report submitted by a 10-member committee. The state board would conduct a separate exam for private candidates after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides. State board schools have completed practical exams for Class XII students before April. The Class XII practical exam marks (20 marks) and internal assessment (10 marks ) will be calculated for 30 marks. If the subject doesn’t have practical exams, then the internal assessment marks will be converted into 30 marks. Further, if the students could not take part in Class XII practical exams due to Covid-19, their Class XI marks will be used for tabulation. If students could not attend both Class XI and XII practical exams, their practical marks would be calculated based on Class X theory exam marks. If students had failed in a subject in Class XI, they will be awarded 35 marks considering the Covid-19 situation. Students who did not take part in theory exam, internal assessment and practical exam in Class XI and XII would be considered as private candidates, the release added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/50-weightage-for-class-x-score-in-tn-class-xii-marks/articleshow/83879256.cms||---
---||Agra||Live and dead insects: National food laboratory finds Hathras spices samples ‘unsafe’ for human consumption||AGRA: The report from the National Food Laboratory in Kolkata has revealed that spices that were seized from a local manufacturing unit in Hathras six months ago were “unsafe” for human consumption. The owner of the manufacturing unit is the ‘Mandal Sah Prabhari’ of Hindu Yuva Vahini, Anoop Varshney. An analysis of the seized contents has revealed that while the coriander contained “live and dead” insects, the content of copper and arsenic was found to be higher than the prescribed limits in turmeric and there was presence of non-permitted colours, Sudan dye, in chilli powder. Prof TP Singh from Agra’s SN Medical College said any kind of toxins are harmful for the body, including dead insects. “Long-term use of copper could cause gastric ulcers and use of arsenic could create liver and neuropathy problems if used for a long period of time,” he said. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, “Sudan dyes, a synthetic chemical, are not allowed to be added to food. There has been worldwide concern about the contamination of chili powder, other spices, and baked foods with Sudan dyes since they may have genotoxic and carcinogenic effects.” When contacted, designated officer of food Safety department in Hathras, Devashish Upadhyaya, told TOI that a case will be filed in the chief judicial magistrate’s court. He added that under section 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 punishment for “unsafe food” is imprisonment along with fine that could be extended to life imprisonment and fine not less than Rs 10 lakh in case it results in death. According to officials, the samples of the spices were earlier sent to the state laboratory in Lucknow through a registered sealed envelope on December 15 but the samples were allegedly changed by the suspect as the same parcel was rebooked on December 30. The department lodged an FIR against Varshney under section 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraudulently used as genuine any document) IPC at Hathras police station on February 11 this year. Hathras’s then joint magistrate Prem Prakash Meena had raided the spice manufacturing unit and seized the spices after a tip-off on December 13 and 14 last year. Officials said that Varshney was unable to provide a licence for operating the spice factory at the location where it was being run at the time of the raid. Also, he could not produce the licence of the brands, which were being packed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/live-and-dead-insects-national-food-laboratory-finds-hathras-spices-samples-unsafe-for-human-consumption/articleshow/83874995.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Delhi||Let’s join hands to avoid any oxygen shortage, says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Trying to move on from the recent controversy over a Supreme Court-appointed panel report on Delhi’s oxygen demands during the recent Covid-19 resurgence, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged everyone on Saturday to work together to ensure there was no oxygen shortage if the city got hit by another Covid wave. “May we work now if your fight over oxygen is over?” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi. “Let us together create a system so that no one faces oxygen shortage during the third Covid wave. People faced an acute oxygen shortage in the second wave. It should not be repeated in the third wave. Corona will win if we fight with each other. The nation will win if we fight together.” A day earlier, AAP and BJP wrangled over the audit report that apparently said Delhi government had exaggerated the oxygen requirements during the recent Covid crisis. AAP leaders accused BJP of misusing the report for political gains, saying it was neither signed nor approved by the Supreme Court’s oxygen audit committee. BJP, on its part, charged Delhi government with creating an artificial oxygen scarcity in the city. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia asked whether those crying for oxygen during the scarcity were untruthful, though leader of the opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri asked the CM to resign for the “oxygen mismanagement”. Meanwhile, Delhi government clarified that the demand for 700 metric tonnes of oxygen was calculated on the basis of central government and Indian Council for Medical Research, taking into account a consumption of 24 litre per minute for ICU beds and 10 for non-ICU beds. On Saturday, Sisodia again hit out at BJP, repeating his earlier Bhartiya Jhagda Party jibe. “They aren’t bothered about oxygen or third wave. They might well be busy in elections in some states when the third wave strikes, only to fight with some states after the polls,” Sisodia remarked in a tweet in Hindi. Retorting, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the problem with Aam Aadmi Party was that it refuses to be accountable. Since the report came into the public domain, he alleged, AAP had been raising irrelevant issues to avoid giving a proper clarification on Delhi’s oxygen requirements. Bidhuri led a protest by BJP workers on the issue on Saturday in front of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in east Delhi. They burnt an effigy of the CM and blamed him for the deaths due to the shortage of oxygen. “AAP leaders artificially created a ruckus over oxygen shortage to defame the Narendra Modi government,” Bidhuri maintained. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta also announced that the party would launch mass protests against Delhi government if the chief minister did not apologise for “mismanagement of oxygen” during the recent crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lets-join-hands-to-avoid-any-o2-shortage-cm/articleshow/83879247.cms||---

Another ATS official said, “We found documents of some individuals in NCR, who were forcefully converted. “Umar Gautam and Mufti Kazi Jahangir Qasimhad visited these areas several times. All these details are being scrutinised,” said the officer. The official also said that the duo had also resided in Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Meerut in the past. They had stayed in some areas of Ghaziabad, where they also allegedly converted youths and women. The ATS officials also said that they have got links of the arrested duo with a suspicious society based in Assam. “The credentials of the society are being verified and its details will be shared with us by the Assam police,” the officer added. Qasmi is the chairman of Islamic Dawah Centre (IDC) in Delhi’s Jamianagar. Most of the funds were received in the name of IDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ats-takes-accused-in-conversion-case-to-4-dists-to-gather-evidence/articleshow/83880451.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Home care cover likely for non-Covid patients||KOLKATA: With the fear of third wave of Covid-19 looming large, insurance regulator IRDA has urged insurers to explore a product for home treatment of non-Covid patients. Sources in National Insurance Company (NIC), one of the leading PSU insurers, said earlier this week there has been a discussion with IRDA for a product which would cover home treatment in individual policies for non-Covid patients, including critical illness. The home treatment was allowed in September following opening of satellite centres by hospitals and for Covid patients at home. It is also allowed for some corporate health insurance policies. The new product would be in personal health insurance domain. Individual health policies constitute the bulk of health insurance industry and IRDA now wants to expedite cover for non-Covid cases in these new normal times. But, sources said insurers are yet to finalise the modalities of the product. “It is in the discussion stage. We are looking at different aspects like pricing of the product. Secondly, whether it can be offered as an add-on benefit with existing products with a higher premium. It will be discussed with actuaries and then we might devise the product and file it to IRDA,” sources added. Actuaries apply mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance, and other industries. An official of a leading private insurance company also said there has been a verbal discussion with IRDA for a possible home product for non-Covid cases. But, he pointed out that it is yet to take any call on this. “ Jyotirmay Kundu of Heritage TPA pointed out that in some corporate policies home treatment is already covered. Chiranjib Bera of Raksha TPA said planned hospitalization is still being cancelled or deferred due to Covid fear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/home-care-cover-likely-for-non-cov-patients/articleshow/83879269.cms||---

After receiving the railway’s nod, the JDA completed the launching of steel girders over the railway line. An official said, “Before the lockdown, the JDA has completed the viaduct and approach road works on both ends of Bassi RoB before the lockdown. The work of Rs 48 crore project will be completed till September,” he said. The second wave of Covid had resulted in slowing down the JDA big budget infrastructure projects in the state capital. The state government had allowed construction activities during the curfew but the spread of the infection among supervisory staff and labourers stalled all works. The JDA was be forced to extend project deadlines of almost seven projects by a period of six months to one year. An official said, “After the digging of Ramniwas Bagh underground project started, the chief designer of the awarded firm succumbed to Covid. The JDA engineer also got infected and in such a situation, the work was affected.” The JDA also faced a shortage of manpower at all construction sites due to migration of workers, which stimulated uncertainty over completion of projects on time. A senior official said, “To construct the flyover at Civil Lines the JDA has awarded the work, however, it cannot be initiated. Similarly, Jhotwara elevated road work was also delayed due to shortage of skilled labour and material.” The work on Sodala elevated road project again encountered a serious setback due to shortage of oxygen. Source said that trained gas cutters and welders migrated from the city in absence of oxygen. “Many labourers who were involved in welding-related work had gone in absence of work. It would take long to gather the momentum and restore the resources,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-plans-to-open-bassi-rly-overbridge-in-september/articleshow/83880455.cms||---

The ED’s remand application has mentioned diversion of funds collected from the bar owners by Waze into the account of Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha through a Delhi-based hawala operator. Deshmukh is the president of the trust and his sons, Salil and Hrishikesh, trustees.The ED has recorded statements of prominent bar owners in the city who had allegedly collected money from other bar owners known to them for the smooth functioning of their business. They said in December, 60 orchestra bar owners paid Rs 40 lakh to Waze as “good luck” money and then between January and February over 1,700 bar owners had collectively contributed Rs 4.3 crore for Waze, who handed over the collection to Deshmukh’s staff.Waze had told the bar owners the collected money will go to “Number 1” and the crime branch and social service branch of Mumbai police, the remand application said.The ED’s remand plea said Surendra and Virendra Jain, Delhi-based book entry operators, had said that Hrishikesh, through his associate, had approached them requesting an arrangement to take cash from him and transfer the amount to his trust through regular banking transactions as donations. It further said the cash collected from bar owners in Mumbai was transferred to the Jain brothers through a hawala channel, who used several Delhi-based paper companies to layer the funds before transferring that into the account of the trust. An associate of Hrishikesh, who connected him to Jain brothers, has also confessed to the entire transaction, the agency said.Meanwhile, Deshmukh on Saturday wrote to the ED expressing his inability to present himself for questioning. He said, “I am sanguine to expose the falsity, hollowness and lack of substance in the allegation levelled against me.” It is learned that the ED may summon Deshmukh for questioning again next week. It had recorded his partial statement at his residence in Worli on Friday after searching the premises along with his two other residences in Mumbai and Nagpur. In their statements to the ED, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil said they had instructions from the then home minister’s office to collect Rs 100 crore from orchestra bar owners and others with the help of Waze for Deshmukh. The ED recorded Waze’s statement in Taloja jail on May 19, where he said he got instruction directly from Deshmukh at his official bungalow to collect Rs 3 lakh every month from each bar owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sachin-waze-told-bar-owners-money-would-go-to-no-1-says-ed/articleshow/83880464.cms||Vijay V Singh

In fact, there was a chaos at a private hospital CVC in Mukundapur on Saturday when almost double their daily turnout thronged the centre. “We were administering between 200-300 doses a day and the number of people coming in for jabs suddenly shot up to close 500 in the past couple of days,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. The AMRI group also said the footfall in its hospital CVC has gone up by about 30%. “Our number had dipped to about 800 doses a day but today we had about 1,400 people turning to take the jab. Could be coincident but there is a jump in footfall,” said R Venkatesh Zonal director (East) Narayan Health. Many among the ones turning up are now asking the vaccinators to show the vaccine vial, the batch number and expiry date and so on. “People have definitely become more cautious after the fake vaccination camp. Even some people who have earlier taken the shot from the hospital are now calling or mailing us with concerns if they had been administered authentic vaccines. This shows how deep-rooted the fear with vaccinations has become,” said Rupali Basu, Woodlands Hospital managing director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/footfall-rises-at-private-hosp-cvcs-many-seek-to-check-vials-before-jab/articleshow/83879257.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Goa||Goa: SCERT to continue with curtailed syllabus for classes I to VIII||PANAJI: The curtailment of syllabus by 30% from classes I to VIII will continue during the current academic year 2021-22 and the State Council For Educational Research and Training (SCERT) will issue a circular in this regard soon, SCERT director Nagaraj Honnekeri said. The syllabus was curtailed for the last academic year due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation. “The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education has decided to continue with the curtailed syllabus for the new academic year as well for classes IX to XII. Therefore, as there should be continuity, we will also be issuing a circular shortly continuing with the 30% cut in the syllabus for 2021-22,” Honnekeri said. The decision has been taken as the pandemic situation continues to be the same as last year. “Last year, an exhaustive list was provided to schools of the topics which have been curtailed. The same will continue this year,” Honnekeri said. He said that with the pandemic, as classes are being held online, the focus of schools has changed accordingly to ensure that the child has a broad understanding of the topics. Therefore, the curtailment is seen as reasonable in this situation. The council had told schools last year to encourage self-study of topics which have been curtailed. However, the portions are not to be included in the term-end examination to assess students. The SCERT has also prepared teaching videos which are set to be telecast again with the start of the new academic year through locals TV channels. It is for the benefit of students who may not have internet connectivity required to attend live teaching sessions. SCERT had constituted a board of studies from classes I to VIII to identify the topics in the syllabus to curtail, and based on their recommendation, it decided the topics to be kept out. At the primary school level, the topics curtailed were mainly in language subjects of English, Konkani, Marathi and Urdu, and in environmental studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/scert-to-continue-with-curtailed-syllabus-for-classes-i-to-viii/articleshow/83880450.cms||---

The positivity rate also slipped to 0.12%, which is the lowest since the pandemic hit the national capital. In the third week of April, Delhi’s Covid positivity rate — percentage of positive results from tests — had touched 36%, which was among the highest in the country. According to the state health department, 72,920 tests were conducted across Delhi in the last 24 hours. These included 50,839 RT-PCR and 22,081 via rapid antigen tests. Delhi reported its first peak in Covid-19 cases in June 2020. The second and third peaks were reported in September and November, respectively. A serosurvey report released in February 2021 showed more than 50% of the population had developed protective antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 during the three peaks. Despite that, the city witnessed a fourth peak from April onward, which turned out to be the deadliest yet. On Saturday, the capital recorded nine fresh fatalities due to Covid-19, taking the death toll in the city to 24,961. The tally of Covid cases in Delhi currently stands at 14.33 lakh, of which 14.07 lakh patients have recovered or been discharged from hospitals. Of the 23,692 Covid beds in the Delhi, 22,684 (96%) are lying vacant.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: In pandemic times, drug smugglers changed modus operandi, NCB’s haul increased 58%||LUCKNOW: Change in conditions due to coronavirus pandemic has led to the seizure of psychotropic substances in higher quantities as compared to previous years even as smugglers changed their modus operandi to peddle drugs and became active in more districts of the state, according to the Lucknow unit of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). As per the data shared by NCB, as compared to 2019, about 58% more drugs were seized in 2020 when coronavirus lockdown was in place. Officials said drugs were seized in higher quantities due to two reasons – trafficking of drugs in higher quantities through vehicles instead of human couriers and activities of smugglers spreading to five more districts. Earlier, smugglers were active in 10 districts – Basti, Varanasi, Bahraich, Azamgarh, Kanpur, Bareilly, Gorakhpur, Siddharthnagar, Lakhimpur Kheri and Barabanki. However, in 2020, drug traffickers also started operating in five more districts — Badaun, Amethi, Lucknow, Mirzapur, and Jhansi. These districts have been put under special surveillance. “The highest surge was witnessed in the seizure of opium, which skyrocketed from 24kg in 2019 to 431kg in 2020. One kilogram of opium costs about Rs 1lakh,” a senior NCB officer said. Zonal director, Narcotics Control Bureau, Lucknow, Prashant Srivastava told TOI, “Prior to lockdown and Covid-19 restrictions, opium traffickers used human couriers for drug trafficking who used to carry a maximum of 250g drugs with them. “Since 2020, smugglers have started hiding large opium consignments in spare tyres, especially created secret cavities attached to the vehicle’s axle, below fuel tanks and engines of trucks carrying essential commodities,” Srivastava said. “For the first time in UP, this year we have seized pharma-based drugs. As many as 1.76 lakh bottles of codeine-based cough syrup were seized in Jaunpur and Varanasi. The drug was being smuggled to North-East states,” he said, adding that the drug racket was organised. “It starts from the west UP districts of Mathura and Agra and from Varanasi it is transported to North-East states. A bottle of codeine, which costs Rs 40-45, is sold at Rs 500 in the North-East,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-pandemic-times-drug-smugglers-changed-modus-operandi-ncbs-haul-increased-58/articleshow/83880472.cms||---

The Congress MLA led a delegation of the Goa Entertainment Association (GEA) to meet chief minister Pramod Sawant where he highlighted the plight of performers. GEA and Faleiro have requested Sawant to create a scheme where interest free loans are provided to performers with a deferred mode of payment or with a five year repayment holiday. Faleiro said the Covid-19 restrictions make it difficult for entertainers to organise or perform at local events and thus they have lost their source of livelihood.  “With the imposition of Section 144, the curbs and restrictions of the curfew and the concept of social distancing, no income could be earned from local events such as parties, dances and weddings,” said GEA president Herschel Mascarenhas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/entertainment-industry-needs-help-faleiro/articleshow/83880466.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Punjab police SIT questions Sukhbir Badal in Kotkapura firing case||CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president and former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal was questioned for nearly four hours on Saturday by the Punjab police special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case. Sukhbir reached the Punjab Police Officers Institute (PPOI) in Sector 32 at around 11 am as summoned by the SIT. The 3-member SIT headed by ADGP LK Yadav had earlier on June 22 questioned Sukhbir’s father and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal in the case for over two hours. Other two members of the SIT are Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal and Faridkot range DIG Surjeet Singh. Sukhbir was the deputy chief minister and also the home minister when the incidents of the desecration of a religious text and the subsequent police firing took place in Faridkot district in 2015. Since the former chief minister had objected to the presence of former director prosecution Vijay Singla with the SIT members during his questioning, Singla resigned from the SIT as legal expert on Friday stating that "he did not want to get into the mess". As a show of support, various Akali leaders, including Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Bikram Singh Majithia and Dr Daljit Singh Cheema, had also reached PPOI during Sukhbir’s questioning on Saturday. SAD says Cong leaders have already indicted Badals The SAD leaders later held a press conference to convey that the Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Sunil Jakhar and Navjot Singh Sidhu had replaced the SIT and had already indicted the former chief minister and the SAD president in the Kotkapura firing case. They said that it was probably the only incident in the world in which the SIT wanted to know who ordered the firing after the relevant competent authority, the SDM, had already declared that he had ordered it. "It is like the SIT asking the SDM not to disclose that he had ordered the firing because it wanted to blame the Badal family for the same," said the SAD leaders. Akali leaders Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said, "It is clear that the SIT has become a puppet in the hands of the Gandhi family which is remote-controlling it from 10 Janpath." They said if the SIT wanted to regain its credibility it should probe the role of Jakhar, Sidhu and Rahul Gandhi in hatching the alleged conspiracy to frame the senior SAD leadership. The SAD leaders said it was shocking that the PPCC chief had recently stated that he had explained the entire issue to Rahul and that the latter had understood the same and told the chief minister to "frame Badals" in the case. They said Sidhu had also goaded the SIT to do the same in a statement on Saturday, and while Jakhar and Sidhu had committed contempt of court, charges should be pressed against Rahul for becoming an abettor to an illegal act. Sidhu had on Saturday tweeted, "6 Yrs since sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib Ji.. No Justice in 2 yrs of your rule.. No Justice in the following 4.5 yrs.. Today, New SIT inches closer to Justice for Punjab’s Soul & you cry of political interference.. Political interference was that which delayed Justice by 6 yrs." He was replying to a SAD president’s tweet stating, "While farmers suffer, CM is busy keeping Gandhi family happy & has accepted @RahulGandhi’s directive to implicate SAD leadership in false cases..." The SAD leaders said the new SIT’s agenda “is to keep the pot boiling and not to solve anything”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-police-sit-questions-sukhbir-badal-in-kotkapura-firing-case/articleshow/83880481.cms||---

It entered his windpipe and got stuck deep in his left bronchus. After initial attempts to get the nut out, his family rushed him to a private hospital from where they were referred to CMCH.CMCH doctors decided to perform an emergency bronchoscopic removal of the foreign body under general anesthesia, said dean Dr A Nirmala. “Head of ENT department Dr A R Ali Sultan, along with associate professor Dr V Saravanan and assistant professor Dr M Nallasivam, performed a rigid bronchoscopy under anesthesia to remove the object. They found the object obstructing the left main bronchus. If the procedure had not been done immediately, it would have led to lung collapse, respiratory failure and death of the child, who is now postoperatively well,” said the dean.The dean advised parents not to allow children play with small objects like stone, areca nut and groundnut or make them laugh while eating. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-docs-save-toddler-who-choked-on-peanut/articleshow/83879277.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: RBI bars netagiri in key urban co-op bank posts||Mumbai: Over six months after the NDA government at the Centre amended the Banking Regulation Act, the RBI has issued a notification to provide for a ban on the appointment of members of Parliament, legislators and members of local bodies as whole-time directors of urban cooperative banks. Once appointed a whole-time director, a person cannot hold any position in any other bank or private firm. The person appointed should not have been convicted of an offence involving moral turpitude. The notification, issued on Friday, provides for stringent rules for the appointment of the managing director and CEO; the appointed person should be a graduate in economics, finance or banking. It was found that in several urban cooperative banks, MDs and CEOs are appointed on the basis of their political clout and lack the basic qualifications required to be in the banking sector. Now banks will have to examine if the MDs and CEOs have been appointed in accordance with the RBI notification. While most of the district central cooperative banks in the state are NCP-controlled, urban cooperative banks are controlled by the BJP, the NCP and the Congress. An official said the NDA government was unhappy with the lack of professionalism and rampant corruption and irregularities in urban cooperative banks and decided to amend the Banking Regulation Act to provide for more regulatory powers to the RBI. Following the amendment, NCP president Sharad Pawar stepped in to oppose the proposal, saying it was an attempt to gain control over the more than 500 urban cooperative banks in the state. “If there is a need, we should approach the court,” Pawar had told a meeting of NCP cabinet members. Following Pawar’s directive, a cabinet sub-committee headed by cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil was set up. It decided to approach the high court against the amendment. The official said that large-scale frauds in urban cooperative banks, particularly in the state, prompted the NDA government to amend the Banking Regulation Act for more powers to control the banks. “The PMC Bank made a beginning in large-scale irregularities and hundreds of depositors are left high and dry owing to the financial crisis in the bank. Along with the PMC Bank, more than a dozen urban cooperative banks are facing a similar situation. Administrators and liquidators have been appointed for most of the banks. However, there is no desired relief to the depositors,” the official said. Cooperation commissioner Anil Kawade said the department was studying the notification issued by the RBI on June 25. “We will study the notification and come out with an action plan,” Kawade said. Another official associated with the banking sector said that it remains to be seen if the new rules are applicable to urban cooperative banks in the state. “We have 503 urban cooperative banks in the state, but there is no concept of whole-time directors. RBI has proposed to appoint its nominees to urban cooperative banks as whole-time directors, then only RBI will be able to gain control over the banks,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rbi-bars-netagiri-in-key-urban-co-op-bank-posts/articleshow/83880495.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Production of Uttarakhand’s state fruit impacted, farmers suffer losses||MUSSOORIE: Kaafal, the state fruit of Uttarakhand, has failed to make an appearance in the markets this year resulting in loss of incomes for several locals — associated with its collection and sale — in Tehri Garhwal while also depriving Kaafal lovers of this unique fruit. According to villagers, heavy rainfall and hail in May affected the fruiting of Kaafal. Sandeep Khanna, a resident of Bhatoli village in Tehri Garhwal, said, “The sale of Kaafal is a significant source of income for the villagers. Many locals collect the fruit from the forests and sell it near Kempty Falls and in Mussoorie.” He added that some farmers earn up to Rs 50,000 from the sale of this fruit in one season. Dinesh Barthwal, another resident of the village, told TOI that Kaafal produce fluctuates every year but this year, it is unusually low. The fruit is equally popular among tourists and locals. Kaafal trees are largely concentrated in Bhatoli, Bhediyana, Gaonkhet, Ghandiyala, Sartoli, Baglo-ki-Kandi and Dudhli villages Tehri Garhwal and adjoining Mussoorie. “In our village, several households collect and sell Kaafal but this year, its produce is negligible. We feel that excessive rainfall and several hailstorms in May affected its fruiting,” said Naresh Nautiyal from Baglo-ki-Kandi village of Tehri Garhwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/production-of-ukhands-state-fruit-impacted-farmers-suffer-losses/articleshow/83878240.cms||Anmol Jain
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Onus on Kerala government to secure tenure of next police chief||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The choice of candidates offered to the state government for appointment as state police chief could kickstart a legal debate over their tenure. None of the three candidates shortlisted for the state police chief’s post have two full years of service left, as envisaged by the Supreme Court in its verdict in Prakash Singh versus Union of India case. It is reliably learnt that as per the list finalized by the Union public service commission (UPSC), the officers include K Sudesh Kumar, B Sandhya and Anil Kant. While Sandhya has one year and 11 months of service left before she retires, Kumar has one year and six months and Kant has just seven months remaining for retirement. As all three candidates have less than two years for superannuation, if the chosen candidate superannuates before completion of two years, it would run into conflict with the Supreme Court’s decision in the Prakash Singh case, in which the court gave modification and clarification in 2018. “An endeavour has to be made by all concerned to see that the person who was selected and appointed as the director general of police continues despite his date of superannuation. However, the extended term beyond the date of superannuation should be a reasonable period. We say so as it has been brought to our notice that some of the states have adopted a practice to appoint the director general of police on the last date of retirement as a consequence of which the person continues for two years after his date of superannuation. Such a practice will not be in conformity with the spirit of the direction,” the court had said. The court later clarified that only those officers with minimum six-month tenure left in their service should be considered for the post of state police chief. Section 97 of Kerala Police Act, 2011, is not in conformity with the court’s judgment. It says that the government shall ensure a minimum tenure of two years for police officers posted as state police chief, but this tenure shall not be applicable in cases of superannuation, promotion, reversion, suspension, leave, etc. However, the Supreme Court’s three-member bench led by the then chief justice, while modifying Prakash Singh case verdict in 2018, also said that any legislation or rule framed by any state or the Centre running counter to the court’s direction shall remain in abeyance. Being the first appointment of police chief in the state after the modification, it remains to be seen whether the state government offers a full two-year term for the new police chief by extension of service, or the police chief will have to demit office when they superannuate from the service. “Several states had offered extension to the state police chiefs, citing the Prakash Singh case, allowing them to complete a full two-year term. However, it is for the first time, the state is facing the situation since the court modified its verdict in 2018,” a senior police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/onus-on-govt-to-secure-tenure-of-next-police-chief/articleshow/83879283.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Kolkata||Kolkata vaccination scam: Medicine bought with money from ‘KMC’ current account||KOLKATA: The anti-bank fraud section of the detective department has launched a probe into the three bank accounts owned by Debanjan Deb, who has been arrested for holding fake vaccine camps, to establish the money trail and profit motive. All the accounts witnessed multiple transactions ever since the pandemic broke out in March 2020. Besides an old account in his name, Deb operated a current account with a private bank that he had opened in the name of KMC by forging signatures. He parked money in yet another account. Those two accounts now have very little money, with one showing negative balance and the other Rs 70,000. Sources said the current account in the name of KMC Planning and Development was opened in December 2020 with Deb providing a fake certification by KMC and a fake letter, allegedly countersigned by a senior KMC official. Deb had told bank that transactions there would be in crores. In reality, the total transaction till date has been Rs 6.5 lakh. The antibiotic that he is suspected of passing off as vaccine was reportedly bought with money from this account. So were the 3,000 fake KMC holograms. “We need to access this account to find out how he paid the 14 staffers and about the money he parked after securing sub-contracts from KMC contractors,” said an officer. Cops have written to the banks for access to account statements in the past two years. Joint commissioner (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said, “Collecting transaction details will take some time. Till then, we are recording statements of people with whom he had financial transactions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/med-bought-with-money-from-kmc-current-a/c/articleshow/83879329.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The drug needs to be procured and administered before the baby turns two, which is on July 6, giving the couple hardly 10 days more.It was five months ago that Kumar and Priyadarshini figured out something was wrong with the way Mithra was walking. They realized that her whole body shook when she took even a few steps. She kept falling when she tried to walk. The child also did not crawl, but could eventually stand.The parents decided to take the opinion of doctors in Coimbatore. “Once they confirmed her bones and nerves were alright, the doctors suspected that she had initial stage or mild form spinal muscular atrophy and took a blood sample, which they sent to Centogene laboratory on May 5. On June 5, we got a confirmation that she had an initial stage of spinal muscular dystrophy,” Kumar told TOI.Though Mithra, who is admitted in KMCH, has only an initial stage of spinal muscular atrophy, characterized by weakness and wasting in muscles, doctors fear that if left untreated, it could progress. The disorder, which leads to a loss of specialized nerve cells, called motor neurons that control muscle movement, may eventually affect her ability to breathe on her own. The only treatment option available is gene therapy — specifically a drug called Zolgensma. However, the drug, which costs Rs 16 crore, has to be administered before she turns 24 months.The late diagnosis had left the parents with exactly a month since diagnosis. “We have raised Rs 7 crore so far, but urgently require another Rs 9 crore,” said Kumar. On Thursday, chairman of Bannari Amman Groups donated Rs 10 lakh. People interested in contributing can do so through ketto.or, impactguru or the Care and Welfare Foundation in Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/parents-race-against-time-to-raise-rs-16-crore-to-save-daughter/articleshow/83879293.cms||---

Collector G S Sameeran inaugurated the event.“As it is not advisable to donate blood immediately after taking Covid-19 inoculation, we have been advising people to donate blood a few days before taking vaccine. The collected blood would be handed over to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital’s (CMCH) blood bank,” IMA honorary secretary A K Ravikumar said. “As a token of appreciation, donors will be issued tokens to get Covid jab. A vaccination camp will be organized shortly after discussing with the health department.”The blood bank at CMCH has more than 1,500 units of blood and components, said district blood transfusion officer A Mangayarkarasi. “We don’t have any shortage. But, as the government relaxes the lockdown norms and once the hospital resumes surgeries, there might be a raise in demand for blood. To avoid such situations, we have decided to gradually improve stock by conducting camps.”“Presently, only delivery and emergency operations are performed in CMCH and during the normal period, we would require more than 2,000 units of blood per month. According to government norms, a person can donate blood only after 14 days of taking jab.

In an overnight operation, an STF team raided a flat in the Patel Nagar area of Dehradun and arrested two persons. The team also recovered electronic gadgets and hi-tech software from their possession. The accused have been identified as Vaibhav Gupta and Sud Khan, both residents of the Patel Nagar area of Dehradun.

The high-voltage drama unfolded shortly after 1.15pm when Dhabhai’s staff, including her driver and guards, claimed to have caught a youth with an iron rod, barely 50-feet away from the main gate of the officiating mayor’s house at Dhawas area near Heerapura on Ajmer Road. Dhabhai said she was inside her house, preparing to go out and attend a programme when she heard a commotion outside. “I was told that a miscreant had jumped the wall of the adjacent empty plot and rushed towards my house when my staff stopped the attacker,” she said, adding that for the past several days, she had been followed by suspects throughout the city. The Jaipur police, however, was quick to contest the officiating mayor and her staff’s claims of the alleged attack. A battery of police officials that descended at her house told TOI there “was little evidence,” to indicate any attack had taken place. They claimed the incident was borne out of a traffic-related fight. “There is a slip-lane which runs alongside the stretch of the Ajmer Road behind her (Dhabhai’s) house. After 12.30pm, two youths on a scooter confronted two other boys riding on a bike for overtaking a wrong cut on the lane. This argument quickly escalated and the youths clashed with each other,” said a senior official of the city police. Shortly after the fight broke out, one of the youths ran away from the brawl after being beaten up by other boys on the scooter. He ran across the street and jumped the wall of an empty plot adjacent to Dhabhai’s house. “The mayor’s staff spotted the youth inside the adjacent plot and followed him. But he managed to flee,” said SHO, Karni Vihar, Jai Singh. According to the Karni Vihar police station, the staff then caught hold of the youth’s friend, identified as Shaitan alias Pintu. He was sitting beside the bike which did not have any registration number on it. “Shaitan hit his head with a stone in order to sow panic and flee. We have detained the youth and are questioning him,” Singh said. Neither the officiating mayor nor her staff reported any injuries. The Jaipur police said they were investigating the case. “We had spoken to the eye-witness sitting at the tea shacks and the passers-by. They confirmed to us that four youths on two separate vehicles had clashed with each other,” a senior police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/officiating-mayor-alleges-attack-bid-youth-detained/articleshow/83880514.cms||---

At many vaccination sites, people had to return without taking the jab. At some places, a message of ‘no vaccination today’ was pasted on closed gates since morning. The primary reason for this was that the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) got more doses of Covaxin instead of Covishiled on Friday. According to RMC they got 2,000 doses of Covishiled in addition to the carry over stock of 300 doses for Saturday. These 2,300 doses were used before noon and thereafter people were asked to come later. According to RMC officials there was rush of youth for the first dose, besides those whose second dose was due.

Tamil Nadu was placed third among the states in the smart cities ranking. Sampath Kumar Subramaniam, state coordinator, Smart Cities Mission Management Unit, government of India, said the city corporation’s performance in implementing smart city projects was good, despite the lag that was caused by the pandemic situation.“Under the mission, the corporation has been implementing bigger projects with a long implementation period. The Union government had, however, considered the number of projects that were completed last year. Hence, the number of projects that the corporation had completed during the period was fewer,” he said. He said the city corporation had to face tough contest this time as it was pitted against the cities that were selected in the first round of the smart cities mission. “How efficient the corporations were in entering the data also mattered in the contest.”Pointing out that Tamil Nadu had won the state award, he said it meant all the smart cities in the state were doing well and their contributions were also taken into account. “Both the Union and the state government’s fund allocation and the fund utilization rate is good in the state.”Expressing disappointment, R Ravindran, secretary, Residents Awareness Association of Coimbatore, said, “The state of the city corporation, which was so proactive and managed to get selected in the first round of smart cities mission, is a bit disappointing. But I am confident that the corporation will top the smart cities again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corporation-fails-to-make-a-mark-in-smart-cities-awards-contest/articleshow/83879318.cms||Nivedha Selvam
---||Kochi||Despite shoddy show, KWC gets crores as fund||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala women’s commission (KWC), which faces a major public relations disaster with the ignominious exit of its chairperson M C Josephine following her scornful demeanour, has got crores of rupees approved by the state government to take up its activities. The member secretary had submitted a proposal to the state government to continue its awareness programmes through social media, electronic media, documentaries, audio-video spots, print media, out door publicity, brochure and booklets during the present fiscal. The order issued by the social justice department sanctioning Rs 1 crore for the proposal says that the KWC is committed to regain the status of women by a dual action of empowering the women community and equipping them to fight against all forms of inequalities. The government had also approved Rs 40 lakh for KWC’s ‘special awareness campaign’ which is meant to sensitize Keralites on gender equality and to uplift the status of women. Women rights activist Adv J Sandhya, who has actively fought against domestic violence, said that KWC has often failed to study the issues of women and ensure a systemic intervention. “They waste too much time listening to complaints. They have done little to understand gender discrimination and subjugation. When was the last time KWC studied an issue and submitted a report with recommendations? Connecting with women is not the problem here, there has to be a proactive intervention,” she said. KWC also submitted a proposal worth Rs 1.57 crore for conducting 238 seminars and legal workshops on the problems faced by women as part of preparing an annual report on lacunae of the laws in force which affect the right to equality and fair treatment of women and also on remedial legislative measures. While the proposal was for Rs 1.5 crore, the departmental working group meeting in April approved the proposal but limited the expenditure to Rs 75 lakh. KWC also submitted a proposal to outsource human resources for conducting programmes like workshops, trainings, seminars, etc. and for office automation, man power charges in connection with office automation and the purchase of vehicle under the project titled ‘strengthening/modernization of the Kerala women’s commission’ at a total of Rs 27.45 lakh. The proposal was submitted citing that the manpower now available with the commission was insufficient for organizing various programmes. However, the departmental working group had considered the proposal and decided to approve the project without the vehicle purchase and human resources components and instructed the member secretary to forward a separate proposal. Later, the government sanctioned Rs 5.45 lakh separately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/despite-shoddy-show-kwc-gets-crores-as-fund/articleshow/83878281.cms||Aswin J Kumar

In the past fortnight, there has been a rise of almost 40 per cent in the prices of vegetables. Wholesalers of Muhana Mandi on Saturday said that prices will show rising trend till the end of July. However, from August onwards, the prices are likely to drop. TOI on Saturday spoke to the retailers and wholesalers to know the reasons why there has been continuous rise in the prices of the vegetables. “Till May we were getting all the basic vegetables from the farms of Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Tonk and Karauli. But from June 12 onwards when pre-monsoon showers started, the supply of the local crops has been affected. Monsoon is the season when we see a dip in the supply of the locally harvested vegetables,” Shiv Shankar Sharma, a wholesale dealer of vegetables at the Muhana Mandi told TOI. He added that the rising trend in vegetable prices will continue till the end of July. “From August 1 onwards we will start getting the locally harvested vegetables including bottle gourd, round gourd, ladyfinger, lemon, cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes and others. That would be the time when the dip in the prices is expected,” said Pappu Lal Prajapat, president Rajasthan Fal Sabzi Thok Vyaapar Mahasangh. “In May the prices of bottle gourd, ladyfinger, round gourd, coriander, tomatoes and ginger were low to an extent that they were sold at cheaper prices compared to May 2020. However, since June 1 the prices are increasing, mainly because of short supply, damage to local harvest and increased demand,” said Abdul Sagir, a wholesale dealer of vegetables. The round gourd which was sold in Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg in retail in the month of May is now been available in Rs 60 to Rs 70 per kg in the retail. Similarly, ladyfinger which was available in Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg in the month of May is now available in Rs 40 to Rs 60.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/local-harvest-exhausted-veg-prices-begin-to-soar/articleshow/83880585.cms||Ashish Mehta

The investigation has found serious lapse on the part of revenue department in discharging their responsibility to protect the scheduled and reserved trees from assigned land by rampantly giving certificates without proper verification whether the trees were reserved or belonged to the category of scheduled trees. Also, the report has pointed out that the revenue department failed to take action against those responsible for the illegal felling under Section 10 of the Land Conservancy Act. The forest department officials gave transit passes in Form III to transport the felled timber on the basis of the certificates issued by the revenue officials. The Konni tahsildar, for instance, had issued a letter to all village officials under him stating that the responsibility of the revenue department officials while processing the applications received with regard to felling of trees in assigned land was to issue possession certificates and it shall be issued after examining the documents. Further, the letter also stated that if they receive any complaints of forest department officials hindering felling of trees it should be forwarded to the district collector. The investigation team has included the letter in the probe report. The Meppadi forest range officer in Wayanad had sought clarifications from the village officer of South Muttil village and Vythiri tahsildar on the status of trees on receiving applications for transit passes from landowners. Even after the village officer issued a certificate on January 25, 2021 with regard to felling of three rosewood trees, all the 14 applications were rejected on Jan 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/forest-dept-issued-transit-permit-in-all-districts-except-wayanad/articleshow/83886567.cms||---

The truck was ferrying around eight tonnes of explosives. The truck, which had loaded the consignment from Secunderabad, was heading to West Bengal, Raipur and other places via Singroli in Madhya Pradesh, where it had to deliver consignments at a coal mine. As the truck broke down, driver Dharmendra Pal left to find a mechanic and then got engaged in consuming liquor. Meanwhile, the cops spotted the vehicle which had ‘explosives’ inscribed in the rear side. Sensing trouble, the cops alerted the bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS). Intelligence units like the state anti-terrorist squad (ATS), too, reached the spot. Referring to the documents inside, cops established communication with the consignor and also the consignee for verification.

The plan is to dart the tusker with sedatives on Sunday to fix the radio collar.All the three kumkis were brought to Mettupalam from the Anamalai Tiger Reserve separately, starting Tuesday, and are stationed at the forest timber depot on Kotagiri Road.The radio collaring operation is codenamed as MP20T1. A Sukumar, forest veterinary officer, Coimbatore forest division; K Rajesh Kumar, veterinary assistant surgeon, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR); E Vijayaragavan, veterinary officer, animal husbandry department; and N S Manoharan, retired regional joint director, veterinary services, are part of the operation.D Venkatesh, district forest officer, said the frontline staff from Mettupalayam and Sirumugai were deployed in the reserve forest to closely monitor the tusker’s movement. “After the arrival of kumkis, the tusker has not come out of the deep forest for the past three days. Our teams are ready to dart the animal with tranquilizers as and when it comes out to a place that is suitable for operation.”The forest department is radio collaring the elephants that frequently stray into the human habitats in the Mettupalayam forest range to study their habitats and migratory paths, and prevent man-elephant conflicts.Chief wildlife warden had earlier issued the order to radio collar Baahubali for the study purposes. It’s the World Wildlife Fund that provides the forest department with radio collars.The radio collar would help study the movement of elephants in their habitats, how far they venture out of the habitats, how far they travel to raid agricultural fields, and how far they migrate a year. With the help of the device, the forest department could also trace the migratory route of the elephants and obstacles on the path, if any.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/baahubali-to-be-radio-collared-today/articleshow/83879340.cms||A Subburaj

Also, they were into making their reports in the favour of companies having 20 or more labourers who have to have mandatory deduction of provident funds and other employee welfare things. Even if these companies were not abiding the rules, they had always given their decision in favour of these companies if any worker came for his claim settlement or complaint,” he added.Elaborating more on this, M N Dinesh, additional director general, ACB, said, “As per Building and other Construction Workers Act, 1996, the builders are supposed to deduct 1 percent cess of their total construction cost. So, in this to favour the builders they were allowing them to undervalue the cost of project to enable them to pay for lesser amount of cess.”Senior officers stated that these officers were also involved into fraudulently claiming the money from the welfare funds of the labours of organised and unorganised sector.State labour commissioner Prateek Jhajharia was arrested after he was caught red handed while taking a bribe of Rs 3 lakh from two agents at his Gandhi Nagar residence late Friday evening. An Indian Postal Service (IPoS) cadre officer, Jhajharia is currently posted at the labour department on deputation.

They were born in a male body but experienced constant surge in female hormones. They needed a gender-neutral option to express their identity and this certification has given this option to them. The Dehradun district administration felicitated their paperwork and through the social welfare department got them certified legally. Sharma and Kajal are happy that they finally have a true legal identity. “Otherwise, everywhere our face in IDs wouldn’t match our present body,” said Sharma who applied at the Centre’s national portal for issuing certificates of identity to transgender persons. A source disclosed to TOI that while the certificates have been provided, the state government is yet to notify the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. The Act prohibits discrimination against trans people in employment, education, housing, healthcare and other services Sharma has led a difficult life. Her own family stigmatised her. “Despite born with a male body, I used to feel that I needed a boyfriend. I would feel like dressing up in sari but I could not,” said Sharma who got her sex realignment surgery done in Delhi. After the surgery, her brother boycotted her. “He feels that I have let him down,” said Sharma who used to be known as Sunil and came from a small village in Uttarkashi. Now, she has left behind her family, friends and relatives to start her life afresh, away from her roots. Natasha Negi, another transgender and a native of Chamoli, is facilitating the certification of trans people in Uttarakhand and said that people have to change their mindsets. She is the state secretary of the LGBTQ Community. Negi has done advocacy work for her community in different parts of the country but feels Uttarakhand lags behind in LGBTQ sensitisation. “In Uttarakhand people are still reluctant in accepting transgender people, our society really needs to overcome this and stop stigmatizing us,” said Negi who has also applied for the ID. When TOI tried to connect with Kajal, she wasn’t available for comment. Meanwhile, talking about the state’s trans community Hemlata Pandey, district social welfare officer of Dehradun, told TOI, “Until now officially Uttarakhand didn’t have any transgender people, because none of the schemes meant for them had so far been availed by any trans person. But with this certification, it would become the duty of the state government to give all the benefits to the beneficiaries.” Pan India over 1,000 trans people have received their identity proofs so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-issues-its-first-transgender-ids-to-two-trans-women/articleshow/83878293.cms||Shivani Azad

As per data from the CoWin portal, the 3 crore-mark was breached at around 2 pm. By the end of the day, as many as 3.03 crore doses of vaccine had been administered in the state. Maharashtra, on the other hand, has dispensed 3.09 crore doses so far. Describing this a morale-booster, officials in the state health department credited the hard work put in by field staff besides drives undertaken to boost immunisation in the state such as 'Mission June' and 'Cluster Approach'. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath lauded the achievement but reminded officials that there was no stopping till the entire eligible population is inoculated. The state now eyes to undertake 10-12 lakh vaccinations per day from July. Insiders claimed that if UP got an adequate supply of vaccines, the state would be able to vaccinate the entire population by end of August. For this, the state government has urged the Union government to provide six crore doses to UP and as per sources, negotiations are on. More than 7,500 vaccine sites have been set up in the state to roll out the vaccination programme. Data suggests that 2.60 crore persons in the state have taken at least one dose of the vaccine while 43.17 lakh have been fully vaccinated. In terms of the age break up, over 80.63 lakh doses have been provided to the 60-plus population while 1.11 crore doses have been administered in the 45-60 years age group. In the 18-44 years age group, 1.12 crore persons have been vaccinated. So far, 1.75 crore males and 1.28 crore females have taken the vaccine in the state.

---||Chandigarh||Capt harassing farmers for power at Modi govt’s behest: AAP||Bathinda: Aam Aadmi Party has accused the Captain Amarinder Singh-led Congress government in Punjab of not providing electricity for eight-hours to farmers for paddy irrigation in Punjab “at the behest of Narendra Modi government”. Speaking to mediapersons in Bathinda on Saturday, AAP state farmer wing president MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan alleged that under a well-thought out conspiracy, the farmers were being provided power for only four hours. “Even canal water supply is being cut off. These are all attempts to appease central government by punishing farmers protesting against agricultural laws,” he claimed. The MLA said the Captain government had been in power for the last 4.5 years and like the Badals had been claiming that the state was power surplus. Yet they failed to provide enough power supply, he added. The farmers were forced to irrigate paddy using expensive diesel. “Captain Amarinder Singh is now releasing Rs 500 crore for management of power, out of fear of the farmers’ wrath. Such steps should have been taken in May,” he added. The Captain government should immediately pay the outstanding bill of Rs 2,200 crore to the power corporation. Before the 2017 assembly elections, Amarinder Singh had promised to review the power purchase agreements inked by the Badal government with the private companies but it had not been done yet. He further alleged that Captain and the Badals pretended to have surplus power and paid Rs 5,400 crore to the companies without purchasing any power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/capt-harassing-farmers-for-power-at-modi-govts-behest-aap/articleshow/83880624.cms||---

---||Kochi||DYFI removes Chembilode area secy||Kozhikode: DYFI Kannur district committee on Saturday dismissed its Chembilode area secretary C Sajesh from the organization after it emerged that he had reportedly given his car to Arjun Ayanki, a suspect in the gold smuggling case connected with the Ramanattukara gold heist bid. The action comes after the party distanced itself from persons associated with the incident who reportedly were actively campaigning for the Left, especially in cyber space. DYFI Kannur district secretary M Shajar in his Facebook post earlier had said that smugglers only have one aim, no matter what colour (social media) profiles they maintain. “At a time of social media excess, it is easy to artificially create popular opinion. One can excite innocent souls by posting pictures with catchy captions through a ‘Red’ profile on social media. Though they have no connection with the organization at the place where they live, some became ‘leaders’ through cheating people outside. These are ‘warriors’ on Facebook during the day and indulged in smuggling at night,” Shajar said in his post, adding that DYFI had expressed its stand against them when such groups were identified. It is suspected that the red car in which Ayanki travelled to the airport on the day of the crime belonged to Sajesh. It is learnt that the action against him was for maintaining a relationship with antisocial gangs. Earlier, senior CPM leader and minister M V Govindan had said that the party would never protect gold smugglers. He had said that protecting those involved in cases was not the policy of the party. He said that ward-level people’s committees would be formed against narcotic and smuggling gangs. BJP state president K Surendran said that the involvement of CPM in the Ramanattukara gold case has now become clear. He alleged that the Kannur district secretary of CPM disowned the accused in a press meet as he suspected that the case would reach CPM. Meanwhile, Karipur police investigating the Ramanattukara gold heist bid arrested two more people. The arrested have been identified as Koduvally native Fijas and Manjeri Pandikkad native Shihab. Police on Saturday conducted evidence collection along with five accused who were granted in police custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dyfi-removes-chembilode-area-secy/articleshow/83879348.cms||---

On Friday, the state government informed Vadodara health department about the 38-year-old female resident of Jarod who became the first recorded case of new variant in the district. The patient, having her roots in Maharashtra, had tested positive of Covid-19 in April but is completely asymptomatic like the other members in her family who too do not have any symptoms. Her husband works with the National Disaster Response Force. Health officials, however, have started scanning their neighbourhood as part of precautionary measure. Health of even those residents whose age is below 18 years is being monitored. “We started our inquiry on Friday soon after we were informed. There is no cause of concern regarding the health of the family members. But we are taking precautionary measures as part of the protocol,” said Dr Uday Tilawat, additional district health officer. “The residential society was divided into containment and buffer zones. Four teams were formed under supervision of medical officer to screen all the residents. Four samples were also collected. Of the 309 persons who were screened, not a single person displayed any symptoms like fever, cough or cold,” he said. Tilawat further informed that there are 253 persons in the society who are eligible to undergo vaccination. “Of these, 118 have taken their vaccines while we will be covering the rest of them,” he said, adding that 37 residents were vaccinated on Saturday itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jarod-case-restarts-health-screening/articleshow/83878321.cms||---
---||Kochi||Assembly ruckus: Kerala government moves SC to withdraw case||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has approached the Supreme Court seeking permission to withdraw a criminal case filed against six CPM leaders who had went on a rampage inside the state assembly in 2015 as part of the opposition’s bid to stall the budget presentation by former finance minister K M Mani over his alleged involvement in the bar bribery case. The government’s special leave petition argued that the request for withdrawal of the cases against the members of the House was ‘filed in good faith and public interest’. However, former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has filed a caveat petition, requesting the apex court to hear him before pronouncing an order in the case. He said the incident was a blot in the history of the assembly and democracy and those named in the case should be tried and punished. The LDF government approached the SC after the high court refused to intervene the Thiruvananthapuram chief judicial magistrate court’s refusal to let the government withdraw the infamous case. The HC single bench had observed that the withdrawal of prosecution ‘will not advance public justice’. The HC had also refused to subscribe to the arguments that the accused were entitled to protection of legislative privileges. The petition argues that the HC had failed to take note of the fact that the alleged acts took place when the assembly was in session and the FIR was registered without the permission of the speaker. “Article 105 (3) and 194 (3) of the Constitution of India confer certain privileges and immunities to the members of Parliament and state legislature. The act of the accused being in relation to their function as members of the legislative assembly, no criminal proceedings can be initiated,” the SLP contended. The state government also argued that the acts committed in assembly, even if punishable offences, are to be considered as part of the procedure of the House. At best, their action will only amount to breach of privilege or code of conduct against which only speaker is entitled to take action. A division bench of Justice D Y Chandrachud would consider the plea on Tuesday. General education minister V Sivankutty is one of the main accused in the case. Others who face charges are former higher education minister K T Jaleel, former industries minister E P Jayarajan, former MLAs K Kunhammad Master, C K Sadasivan and K Ajith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/assembly-ruckus-state-govt-moves-sc-to-withdraw-case/articleshow/83878303.cms||---

I know all of you are working day and night.” At the peak of the pandemic, daily admissions in Goa ranged between 200 and 230. Of these, about 60 to 80 patients, and sometimes even more, were admitted to GMC. The most challenging period was the past two months when the hospital ran out of beds several times and patients could be found all over the hospital. The situation changed once the super-speciality block was thrown open for Covid-19 patients. “I remember the day when we had almost 140 patients without beds. Even the examination hall was turned into a ward and everyone chipped in offering their services,” GMC dean Dr S M Bandekar said at the felicitation function. Bandekar said that the hospital was able to provide beds to patients on wheelchairs, stretchers and trolleys within a short span and make all necessary arrangements simply because the staff members co-operated. “These are challenging times. Even while the second wave is not yet over, there are talks about the third wave. And there’s the delta plus strain that’s been detected in some parts of the country,” Rane said. Rane said GMC kept on admitting patients, even after all its beds were occupied, since it could not deny admission as it is a state institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rane-challenges-galore-but-med-staff-working-day-night/articleshow/83880625.cms||---

Speaking to reporters here, Sultana said she had gone there expecting an arrest and that she suspected an agenda behind the proceedings against her. “Their main agenda was to silence my voice. This case itself was something that was forced upon me by a certain section,” said Sultana. She added that police seized her phone without even giving time to note down any of her contact list numbers. Sultana added that police checked her phone multiple times. “They have been questioning me for these many days and whenever I was being quizzed, my phone was with them. They have been checking my WhatsApp, Instagram etc. They checked my bank accounts, my mother’s bank account and my younger brother’s bank account,” said Sultana. She said she was happy about the favourable verdict she got from the court. “The court had directed me to cooperate with the investigating officers. I followed whatever the court said,” she said. Sultana claimed that the news that she violated quarantine was fake and that it was common sense that in these pandemic times, people who travel for a particular issue, would only try to come back as soon as possible. Sultana was let off by Kavaratti police with a directive to appear before the investigation team if summoned. She was summoned for questioning in connection with the sedition case registered against her for a comment that a ‘bio-weapon’ was used against Lakshadweep during a TV channel debate. She had reiterated her stand that she meant the policies of administrator Praful Patel through her comment. The Kerala high court on Friday had granted anticipatory bail to Sultana in the sedition case against her. The court had earlier granted her interim anticipatory bail and had asked her to appear for interrogation before the investigating officer.

He had stored some jackfruits and small onions that he had harvested on Friday in the house.”A wild elephant got the smell of jackfruits and attempted to enter the house around 3am on Saturday. “The elephant pulled the roof tiles down, damaged the side wall of the house and ate nearly 40 jackfruits,” Mahendran said.Mahendran and other farmers rushed to the spot and chased away the elephant after an hour’s struggling. “We used tom-toms and burst firecrackers to chase the elephant away,” Mahendran said.He later alerted the forest department officials, who visited the house and assessed the loss. “We will send the report to the higher officials and issue maximum of Rs 25,000 to the farmer,” said P Ganesh Pandian, forest ranger, (incharge) Sathyamangalam forest division.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/wild-elephant-damages-house-for-jackfruit-near-sathyamangalam/articleshow/83879351.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Travel agents got firm to trust fake vax providers’||Like most others, taking a post-vaccination selfie was on the wish list of employees of a Borivali firm. But the organisers of a vaccination camp that was set up at their office last month explicitly forbade them from doing so. Employees let it pass. Many of them however started to worry when vaccination certificates wouldn’t get generated even 10 days later. The two-day camp at Borivli’s Mansi Stocks and Shares Advisory where 514 people were given shots has turned out to be the biggest among all fraudulent vaccine camps carried out so far; the other camps covered between 40 and 390 people each. “Our intention was to look after our staff and their families and protect them from the pandemic. The accused were very convincing and there was no room for doubt,” said a member of the management. A travel agency used to look after all ticketing requirements of the stocks firm. Two travel agents—Seema Ahuja and Shrikant Mane—inquired with the firm if they wished to vaccinate their employees as they had been working through the lockdown. They introduced the management to Mahendra Singh, the mastermind, who offered to organise a camp through vaccines supplied by Charkop based Shivam Hospital. The management says they checked online and found that Shivam hospital had permissions to function as a Private Covid VAccination Centre (PCVC). They may not have known that the permission to function as a PCVC was only upto April 28. Over seven hours collectively on May 26 and 27, five people visited the firm’s office and used their fridge for storing ice-boxes containing “vaccine vials.” They took up a room and set up all their equipment. The stocks firm paid up Rs 1000 per dose for vaccinating 514 people. The accused collected a list of employee names and Aadhaar numbers and said the data would be entered online at the back end. About 10 days later, about 100 certificates were generated but some other hospitals were mentioned as vaccinators. “Ahuja and Mane earned a commission of Rs 120 per dose, while the rest went to Singh,” said a police officer. It was Singh who had recruited the duo for the camp. Singh used to book his tickets from the same agency where Ahuja and Mane worked. When they told him money had dried up during the lockdown, he asked them to join his vaccine camps. The duo found targets for vaccination from among other clients of the travel firm. They have also been booked in bogus camps at a Thane insurance company and a Parel education centre. The BMC pressed charges in the Borivali case as they were neither intimated about the camp nor was any MOU made between the hospital and the camp organisers. “We found a quotation from Shivam Hospital for the vaccines. Besides this, private hospitals are not permitted to charge more than Rs 780 per dose, so there was overcharging in this case,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, assistant municipal commissioner, R/Central Ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-travel-agents-got-firm-to-trust-fake-vax-providers/articleshow/83880652.cms||Nitasha Natu

He said this scheme would benefit eight lakh Dalit BPL families in the state. The announcement at the collectors’ conference comes close on the heels of an inquiry ordered by the CM into the alleged custodial death of Dalit woman Mariyamma in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district and sending a fact-finding team to her native Chintakani in Khammam district. The CM had first made an announcement about the Dalit scheme in February while addressing a public rally in Nalgonda’s Halia. Later, making an announcement in the course of budget presentation for 2021-22 in the assembly in March, finance minister T Harish Rao said the CM had conceived the new scheme for all-round development of Scheduled Castes. At the Halia meet, KCR had also indicated that the allocation for ‘CM Dalit Empowerment Scheme’ would be increased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-1k-cr-scheme-to-benefit-8l-dalit-families/articleshow/83879586.cms||Koride Mahesh

Dalmia Bharat Group MD Puneet Dalmia said the ability of family businesses to adapt has enabled them to withstand the pace of changes. “Stable shareholders, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship spirit has been some of the key hallmarks of family business,” he added. He also stressed on the need to foster innovations, treat family members as professionals and build upon the skill-sets of the members and explore new growth trajectories. Pointing out that family businesses have sustained themselves due to the inherent spirit of entrepreneurship, Forbes Marshall co-chairman Farhad Forbes said that with new growth opportunities coming up, the next generation is poised to steer their organisations to the next level.Thermax Ltd chairperson Meher Pudumjee emphasised the need for a strong and robust governance structure that would go a long way in consolidating the family business structure.

---||Dehradun||A 500km road trip, saplings on flight: How Uttarakhand built country’s first garden with trees from all states,union territories||NAINITAL: A first-of-its-kind garden in the country which has state trees from all 28 states and eight union territories has opened to the public in Uttarakhand. The inauguration of ‘Bharat Vatika’ in Haldwani was the culmination of an 18-month effort by the Uttarakhand forest department which included saplings delivered via flight and even a 500km road trip that was made to hand over a plant. The Bharat Vatika is meant to showcase the biodiversity of the country. The one-acre green expanse has a Chinar tree from Kashmir, a Nag-Kesar from Mizoram, a Puddock from Andaman and Nicobar Islands among several others. But procuring the green heritage from each state and union territory was no easy task. Sanjeev Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (research), told TOI that in one instance a local government official drove from Coimbatore to Chennai, a distance of over 500 km, in his vehicle to deliver state trees of Tamil Nadu and Lakshadweep. “We were able to get the saplings to Coimbatore but since there is no flight from there to Uttarakhand, they were driven by a local official to Chennai, from where there is a flight to Dehradun,” he said. In another instance, Agarwood — state tree of Tripura — was delivered to Dehradun on a special flight that was running during the nationwide lockdown last year. Chaturvedi said the forest department had tried getting the saplings couriered from various states but barely any of them survived the transit. In some cases, seeds were received via courier and grown in the forest department’s research centre in Haldwani. For the forest department, the challenge now is to provide suitable growing conditions for trees from different parts of the country. “We have the state tree of Rajasthan — Khejri — that grows in a desert while its neighbour, Hollong from Assam, needs rain throughout the year. And neither of the tree can survive the dry winter in our state without support,” said a forest official, adding that arrangements have been made to ensure the young trees thrive. “For instance, the Hollong tree will be watered more frequently while the Khejri tree has been planted so that it receives maximum sunlight. In winter, we’ll put up tarpaulins to protect it from frost,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/a-500km-road-trip-saplings-on-flight-how-ukhand-built-countrys-1st-garden-with-trees-from-all-states-uts/articleshow/83878353.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Samajwadi Party sacks 11 district chiefs as BJP zila Panchayat candidates win unopposed||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party on Saturday sacked presidents of party units in 11 districts, mostly the ones where the BJP candidate has been elected unopposed as zila panchayat chairman. Nomination for the polls ended on Friday evening. The move is being seen as an attempt to hand out a stern message to the party leaders and cadre that the party means business. The SP state president Naresh Uttam Patel on Saturday evening announced that district presidents of the party units in Gorakhpur, Moradabad, Jhansi, Agra, Gautam Budh Nagar, Mau, Balrampur, Shravasti, Bhadohi, Gonda and Lalitpur have been removed from their post on the directions of the national president Akhiklesh Yadav. No reason was however cited in the letter issued by the party announcing the removal of the district presidents with immediate effect. Interestingly, in most of these districts, BJP candidates for the Zila Panchayat chairman post are all set to be declared winners unopposed as no other candidate filed nomination papers. The deadline for filing nominations ended on Saturday evening. The party also sacked one Sachin Yadav from the party for six years for indulging in anti-party activities in Farrukhabad and issued a stern warning to all party cadres that any move which happens to be against the interest of the party will be dealt with in a similar manner. In the political circles the move is being seen as an attempt of the party leadership to send across a warning to the cadres and office bearers to adopt result oriented strategies with regards to party’s aim of making its presence felt in the democratic process of the state. Party sources said there were reports that in some of the districts where action had been initiated, SP candidates were unable to file their nominations owing to issues list missing proposers and incomplete documentation despite the district presidents having assured the party state chief that everything was in place. “However these are merely allegations which are being verified and appropriate action would be initiated against anyone found guilty,” said a senior SP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-sacks-11-dist-chiefs-as-bjp-zp-candidates-win-unopposed/articleshow/83880676.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Hyderabad||Naresh flays Prakash Raj over MAA panel||HYDERABAD: A day after actor Prakash Raj announced his panel for the elections to the Movie Artistes Association (MAA), association president and actor Naresh on Saturday wondered what was the haste in announcing a panel three months before elections were due in September. “More surprising is the fact that those who are in the committee now showed up with Prakash Raj even before the election process has begun,” Naresh said. “A former president who participated in the press conference along with Prakash Raj has made comments charging that there was hardly any activity in the association. This should have been condemned by those belonging to the present body who were sitting there. They should have rebutted the statement. By keeping quiet, it meant that they were agreeing,” actor Siva Balaji, who is joint secretary in the present committee, said. Naresh explained all the activities taken up by the committee. “When Prakash Raj spoke at the press conference, he was not even sure as to how many members exist in the association,” Naresh said. Naresh said there are 914 life members, 29 associate members and 18 senior citizens. He said a life insurance policy was taken for 728 members. An amount of Rs 50 lakh was given to the families of 16 artistes who died and health insurance was done for 314 members. Pension for needy artistes was increased from Rs 3,000 to Rs 6,000 and the MAA membership fee was reduced from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 90,000. A job committee also worked to get movie assignments for 35 artistes. “Do not make comments that no work has happened in MAA. At a critical time when we have been busy with the life insurance work for the members, Prakash Raj comes up and announces a panel for the elections when the process for elections has not begun,” Naresh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/naresh-flays-prakash-raj-over-maa-panel/articleshow/83879966.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

What happened to that promise?” Uttam said at the ‘Dalitha Avedhana Deekasha’ organised by Congress at Gandhi Bhavan on Saturday. “How is it that the chief minister did not even consider having a person from the Madiga community in the cabinet?” he questioned. The Congress leader said there should have been an SC/ST sub-plan in the budget as a large percentage of the population comprised of these sections, but even this was not provided in the budgets so far. Uttam pointed out that it was only after representatives of Congress met KCR that he announced action against police personnel responsible for the custodial death of Mariamma in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district. “But firstly, how did police even think that they could get away meeting out such treatment to a Dalit? It is obvious they believed that the powers that be would come to their defence and rescue,” he said. “We will continue to fight on behalf of Dalits,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/uttam-honour-promises-made-to-dalits/articleshow/83879819.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Hyderabad||Adopt Brazil model for effective use of urban land: Telangana CM||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has asked the officials to adopt Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) model for effective utilisation of urban land in a scientific manner. He said every collectorate should have twin helipads and a ‘state chamber’ so that ministers and state-level officers could use them during their official tours. For protecting government properties in every district, the CM directed the collectorates to prepare an inventory of government properties and land by July-end and appoint an estate officer, who will work under the direct control of collectors in districts, and a state-level estate officer under control of the chief secretary. Officials said the Rio de Janeiro model is more consistent with environmental estimates. Identification of urban land use and land cover is one of the first requirements in this model to monitor and evaluate accelerated growth in towns and citues taking into account environmental and socioeconomic impacts on the civic infrastructure, officials said. The CM held a meeting with district collectors, additional collectors, district panchayat officers, district forest officers, DRDA officers and senior officials on Palle Pragati, Pattana Pragati and Haritha Haram programmes at Pragati Bhavan on Saturday. The CM announced that Palle Pragati and Pattana Pragati programmes will be held for 10 days from July 1. In the eight-hour long meeting, the CM reviewed progress of various works such as construction of vegetable and non-vegetable markets and development of graveyards, protection of government properties and planned growth of gram panchayats and municipalities. For taking up developmental works in the districts, KCR announced that Rs 2 crore special fund would be kept with each minister and Rs 1 crore with each collector. MLAs will have to get approval from the district minister concerned for utilising his constituency development fund, he said. He said the government would come up with a policy for migrant workers soon. Stressing the need for massive plantation, the CM asked offcials to take up plantation in hillocks and barren lands. “Every mandal should have ‘Prakruti Vanam’ in about 10 acres. Acquire land wherever is required for public purpose. Since collectorates are being shifted to new integrated complexes in many districts, the lands should be utilized for public purposes. Land for at least five dump yards should be identified keeping in view of future requirement and construction of markets for every one lakh population,” he said. The CM said book adjustment between the departments should be done by July and clear arrears like electricity bills. To prevent haphazard growth of cities and areas around Hyderabad, KCR said there should be a proper plan for development of infrastructure facilities such as roads, drinking water, sewerage system and other facilities. ‘Without approval of the collectors, new layouts should not be permitted,” KCR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-adopt-brazil-model-for-effective-use-of-urban-land/articleshow/83879531.cms||Koride Mahesh

The duo were unwell and had taken shelter in one of the sheds built for pilgrims to Hemkund shrine, according to the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) team which rescued them from an area near the shrine at an altitude of 4,633 meters. They were identified as Ali Osha and 29-year-old Harpreet (who only uses his first name). “Both were rescued safely. They had fallen ill due to the cold weather,” said Yashwant Singh, superintendent of police (SP) Chamoli, adding that they were taken to the hospital for examination and later discharged. On June 17, the two had left for Ghanghariya-Hemkund trek in Chamoli district along with a Japanese and a French trekker. Heavy rain separated the group a day later. When the team members returned to the base camp earlier this week, they informed Govindghat police about the missing duo on June 24. The director general of police (DGP), Ashok Kumar, directed a search operation to be launched by SDRF on Friday and the team was able to locate the trekkers within a few hours. “Fortunately, they had not wandered off from the main trek route so we were able to trace them in a short time. They had enough food supplies and essentials which they used for sustenance for eight days,” said a member of the SDRF rescue team. Meanwhile, SP Chamoli said a case under Disaster Management Act would be lodged against the Indian member of the team for violating Covid protocol and embarking on a trek closed to hikers due to the pandemic. The SP said foreign nationals would not be booked since they may not have known that the trek route is closed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/slovenian-trekker-1-other-rescued-from-hemkund-trek-8-days-after-they-went-missing/articleshow/83878350.cms||Gaurav Talwar

He is also close to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. It is in his chartered aircraft that Kishan Reddy airdashed to Hyderabad. In fact, it was KCR himself who sent and facilitated Eatala Rajendar’s entry into BJP,” Revanth Reddy said. “In the next two and a half years, our fight against KCR will intensify. We will take up public issues of importance and will leave no stone unturned in showing how the government is against dalits, minorities and girijans,” he said. Revanth Reddy said all programmes and actions will be decided after consultation with all senior leaders in the party. In reply to a question, he said even if any leader spoke against his appointment as president with the party high command, they only had the interest of the party in mind in giving their opinion. I do not think they were against me. I take it positively,” he said.  “The very fact that opinions are taken in the Congress party itself reflects the democracy in the party,” he said.While thanking Rahul Gandhi for his appointment, he said he would not disappoint him in the trust that he has imposed in him. He said he would also work in such a way that Sonia Gandhi will be happy that she put faith in him.Revanth Reddy said he had immediately met the senior leaders of the party who were immediately available. He said he would meet others too including V Hanumantha Rao, Bhatti Vikaramarka, Jeevan Reddy, Komatreddy brothers and other seniors to seek their guidance. The new PCC chief charged the government with filing false cases against Congress workers and he would fight with the government on that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-whose-flight-brought-kishan-to-hyd/articleshow/83879912.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Chandigarh||Amarinder urges Rajnath to approve MOA for Sainik School in Gurdaspur, Bathinda||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday urged Union defence minister Rajnath Singh to immediately approve the memorandum of agreement (MoA) for Sainik School, Dalla Gorian in Gurdaspur district, and also sanction a third Sainik School at Bathinda. In a letter to the Union defence minister, Amarinder said the state government would sign the MoA for the third Sainik School as soon as the approval of the ministry is received. He pointed out that the state government has already allotted 40 acres of land at Dalla Gorian to establish Punjab’s second Sainik School and the MoA has also been signed and submitted to the department of ex-servicemen welfare in the ministry of defence. However, he said this will not, in his opinion, suffice to meet the aspirations of the Punjabi youth. Emphasising the need for at least one Sainik School each in the Malwa, Doaba and Majha regions, the three natural geographical divisions of the state, he said it was felt that a third Sainik School in Bathinda will suitably cater to this requirement. He said Sainik Schools are prestigious institutions that have consistently maintained the highest standards in imparting education to children across the country. For many years, he said, these schools have groomed youth into responsible citizens and many key positions in the Armed Forces are today manned by the alumni of these schools. Sainik School, Kapurthala is at present the only Sainik School in Punjab, established way back in 1961. The youth of Punjab have always displayed an exemplary zeal to join the Armed Forces and to serve the nation. There is, thus, an urgent need to establish additional Sainik schools in the state, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amarinder-urges-rajnath-to-approve-moa-for-sainik-school-in-gurdaspur-bathinda/articleshow/83880704.cms||---

Long queues where seen outside the Government High School in Musheerabad — venue for the event — right from 9 am, with people cutting across age groups turning up to support the initiative collectively organised by the the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and the Association for Promoting Social Action, (under the United Federation of Resident Welfare Associations), in association with The Times of India. According to GHMC officials, over 1,100 people were vaccinated between 9 am and 2 pm on Thursday. Those who attended the drive, lauded TOI for its efforts to spread awareness about Covid-19 appropriate behaviour through its campaign — Preparing Hyderabad for a New Normal — and educate residents about the dos and dont’s as they start stepping out of their homes again, post the lifting of the lockdown. “Social distancing and wearing masks are the two most important precautionary measures that people must take now, especially with predictions hinting at the chances of a third wave,” said a resident, urging TOI to take up similar campaigns across educational institutions as they prepare to reopen. Some even suggested that the drive be conducted on public transport systems, to reach more people. “Of course vaccines will protect us from the virus, but at the same time we cannot sit back and take it easy. We must adhere to the norms — especially maintaining a certain distance while in public places and wearing a mask — till the pandemic has completely died out,” said Narasimha Reddy, a government teacher and resident of Musheerabad. A resident of Chikkadpally, B Chaitanya Kumar, said, “To avoid a similar situation in the future, the TOI’s campaign must be taken very seriously and followed strictly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/as-toi-spreads-the-word-locals-in-musheerabad-line-up-for-jab/articleshow/83879380.cms||Sunil Mungara

"I told them that the country's first Prime Minister promised us plebiscite and went back on it. Narasimha Rao promised us autonomy and said, 'sky is the limit'. He promised us autonomy on the floor of the House. Where is it?" Farooq asked at his Gupkar Road residence. His son and former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah was also present. He said that at the PM's meeting, all invited persons could put forth their views. "This was the first step from their side that somehow the situation is improved in J&K." "There is a level of mistrust and that has to be removed... and how you (GoI) do it, you have to decide. That is why Dr Karan Singh (former J&K governor)... said statehood must be brought forward," he said. "Let's wait and see what they (the Centre) do... Whether they will remove the mistrust or let it continue." Dismissing suggestions that People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) was weakened, Omar said, "We were not invited on the basis of the alliance. Had it been so, only one (leader) would have been invited. In the meeting, we didn't say anything outside the agenda of the alliance." Omar told reporters it was made clear during the meeting that the statehood should be restored to J&K before assembly polls. "(Ghulam Nabi) Azad sahib spoke on behalf of all of us... We want delimitation, statehood and then election. If you want to hold polls, you will have to restore statehood first," he said. On the process of delimitation, he said NC had authorised its president Farooq Abdullah to take a view as and when the party is approached by the commission again.Referring to some leaders refusing to talk about the restoration of Article 370 as the matter was "subjudice", Omar said it should not come in the way of discussing the issue.

---||Chandigarh||Villagers set up panel to assist police probe in Bhawanigarh sacrilege case||Patiala: The residents of Johliyan village in Bhawanigarh, Sangrur district, on Saturday formed a five-member committee, including two villagers, to assist in the probe being carried out in the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib on Friday, in which a woman set the holy book on fire. The committee comprising Johliyan sarpanch Pavittar Singh, Kulwant Singh, Bachittar Singh, Amarjit Singh, Rampal Singh and Rajinder Singh, has given an ultimatum to the police to conduct a thorough investigation and catch the culprits by July 4. On Saturday, Sikh groups gathered at Johliyan to look into the further proceedings in the sacrilege case and announced to hold Akhand Path on July 2 which would be concluded on July 4. Two committee members hailing from the same village said a few years ago, the accused woman was a follower of Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda, but from the past some time they haven’t heard about her any activity as a follower since the Dera chief was imprisoned. Police are yet to identify any such links with any dera so far and claimed that the investigation was underway. Sikh preacher Harjinder Singh Maji, said, “Police cannot shield the accused woman by terming her mentally disturbed as it clearly seems to be a conspiracy. The woman had purchased petrol and poured it on Guru Granth Sahib and set it on fire. Some villagers had claimed that she was a dera follower but we want the police to investigate and bring out the truth.” Sangrur SSP Viveksheel Soni said, “The committee has been formed by the villagers to assist the police in the investigation and they haven’t given any ultimatum. We have already arrested the accused woman, but it would be inappropriate to comment at the moment on any links behind the incident as the investigation is underway. Some Sikh activists announced to set house of accused woman on fire, but they apologised after villagers opposed their provocative statement as it could disturb peace.” Police have also questioned a local shopkeeper in the village from whom the accused woman had purchased petrol to commit the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/villagers-set-up-panel-to-assist-police-probe-in-bhawanigarh-sacrilege-case/articleshow/83880730.cms||Bharat Khanna

However, they would be officially declared winners on June 29 — last day of withdrawal of nominations — before scheduled elections on July 3. BJP-supported nominees got a cakewalk in Gorakhpur, Gonda, Balrampur, Shravasti, Ghaziabad, Chitrakoot, Moradabad, Jhansi, Mau and Bulandshahr and came out trumps in Varanasi and Meerut after SP candidates’ papers were rejected. In CM Yogi Adityanath’s turf Gorakhpur, BJP candidate Sadhna Singh, daughter-in-law of late chief minister Veer Bahadur Singh, is all set to be elected unopposed as zila panchayat chairperson after the SP candidate failed to file her papers, following violent clashes between rival supporters at the collectorate gate. Varanasi, witnessed a dramatic turn of events in which both sets of nomination papers of the SP-backed candidate, Chanda Yadav, were rejected during scrutiny, paving way for BJP’s Poonam Maurya to bag the chairperson’s post with no rival in fray. Maurya too had filed two sets of papers, but one was found valid, while the other one was junked. In Meerut, Gaurav Chaudhary of BJP was elected unopposed after nominations of SP and RLD-backed candidate were cancelled. However, there were hiccups for BJP at Unnao, where party rebel, Arun Singh, filed his nomination as an Independent. Though he preferred to call himself a BJP soldier fighting the SP candidate, Malti Rawat, he was not barred from filing his nomination. And this despite Shakun Singh being declared the official BJP-backed nominee. Earlier, his ticket was cancelled following complaints by the Unnao rape survivor about his ties with Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Sengar, who was sacked from BJP after his conviction in a rape case. Shakun Singh filed her nomination on Saturday, 48 hours after being declared the official candidate by BJP, but Arun Singh raised eyebrows after he was accompanied by Unnao MLA Pankaj Gupta’s brother, Neeraj Gupta, to the nomination centre. In another signal of cracks in BJP’s Unnao unit, a viral video showed Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj greeting Arun Singh. A relative of state minister, Raghvendra Pratap Singh, Singh is a zila panchayat member from Auras ward in Unnao. Of the 51 zila panchayat members in Unnao, only nine are affiliated to BJP. SP has 19 and BSP has three members and 20 are independents. At least 26 votes are needed to win the election.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: A Revanth Reddy made TPCC chief, pips veterans||HYDERABAD: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday appointed Malkajgiri MP and firebrand leader A Revanth Reddy as the new president of Telangana Congress Committee to revive and lead the party to victory in 2023 assembly polls. Despite granting statehood to Telangana, Congress has been losing elections and the party high command has chosen Revanth to get the Congress back to winning ways in this Telugu state. Revanth, who joined the Congress in October 2017, got the post bypassing all the senior leaders, loyalists and veterans in the party with the AICC leadership being told that he has the charisma and commitment to revive the party in Telangana and bring it to power in 2023. Also, that the firebrand leader has the tone, tenor and language to take on TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and BJP state president Bandi Sanjay. "Revanth is the right choice and perfect answer to the TRS and BJP," said former minister Mohd Ali Shabbir. Though senior leaders had opposed his candidature stating he comes from RSS background and was a leader of ABVP in his student days, what worked in his favour is that a majority of party office-bearers including TPCC vice-presidents, general secretaries, district presidents, former ministers, MPs and MLAs spoke in favour of Revanth in the consultation exercise done by AICC incharge of Telangana, Manickam Tagore. However, some of the senior leaders alleged that this consultation process was stage managed by Revanth. Sources did not rule out the possibility of some of the leaders, unhappy with the development leaving the party. Revanth has multiple challenges of stopping the exodus from the party, minimizing infighting, take on the ruling TRS and a resurgent BJP and re-establish the party's connect with voters. And all this even as the money laundering and cash-for-vote scam case is being investigated against him by Enforcement Directorate and ACB. Revanth, who was TPCC working president, succeeds N Uttam Kumar Reddy who headed the state Congress unit since March 2015. Former Indian cricket captain Mohd Azharuddin has been named one of the six working presidents. Veteran Congressman and former MP V Hanumanth Rao had openly expressed opposition to Revanth Reddy saying that the former TDP MLA should not be allowed to lead the party and it would be disastrous to the organisation itself. Among others, Hanumanth Rao considered that he was the right choice for the party president’s post in Telangana. Sangareddy MLA Jagga Reddy was also in the forefront of asking that he be appointed as president. Bhuvanagiri MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy was also in the fray. In the last couple of years, the aspirants had made a beeline to Delhi to impress upon the party leadership about why they would be suitable for the post. Some, it is learnt, also went to give their opinion about why certain persons should not be considered for the post. Some had tried to block Revanth Reddy’s appointment, telling the party leadership that he would not be the right choice. Revanth’s immediate challenge will be to lead the party in the poll that will be held to the Huzurabad assembly seat following the resignation of former health minister Eatala Rajendar, who later joined the BJP. In the 2018 assembly elections, Revanth had campaigned for the Congress party in different constituencies but was unable to retain his Kondangal seat. Nevertheless, the party fielded him in the Lok Sabha elections the following year in 2019 and he won from Malkajgiri. The talk about party leadership began in 2018 itself after the Congress could not fare well in the assembly polls. As speculation began that Uttam Kumar Reddy would be replaced, he himself announced openly that he had submitted his resignation to the party leadership and said it was free to replace him anytime. In the 2019 elections, Uttam Kumar Reddy got elected to the Lok Sabha from Nalgonda. Revanth Reddy began his career in politics by first being associated with the Telangana Rashtra Samithi. In 2006 he was elected as ZPTC member from Midjil mandal but his political career got wings when the TDP’s N Chandrababu Naidu gave him a party ticket to contest from the Kodangal assembly seat in 2007 which he won three times in a row.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-made-tpcc-chief-pips-veterans/articleshow/83880733.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Hyderabad||After Eatala Rajender jolt, K Chandrasekhar Rao in damage control mode?||HYDERABAD: Faced with growing criticism that he is not accessible to elected representatives and his own party colleagues, that he does not meet people and that he has not addressed Dalit issues in his seven-year tenure as chief minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao appears to have made some ‘course correction’ if his ways of warming up to opposition leaders, senior TRS leaders and officials are any indication. Soon after he was sacked from the cabinet, BJP leader Eatala Rajender went to town alleging that KCR does not give appointments to his cabinet colleagues and MLAs and keeps them waiting. He even alleged that the doors of Pragati Bhavan are not open for common people. While it is too early to say if Eatala’s charges have dented the image of KCR or not, the CM giving appointment to Congress leaders to meet him in Pragati Bhavan on Friday in 10 minutes flat to represent a Dalit woman’s alleged custodial death has certainly done a world of good for his image-building exercise. Plus, the way he acted swiftly on their representation and ordered an inquiry into the incident and provided a job, house and announced compensation to the family kept the CM in good stead. It may be recalled this was the first time in the last seven years that the Congress leaders have got an appointment with the CM. Analysts said the CM does not want Mariyamma’s death issue to snowball into another Nerella episode. In 2017, eight Dalits of Nerella village in Sircilla district were tortured by police following an incident of torching of a sand-laden lorry allegedly by them as they believed four persons in the village were mowed down by sand lorries. The incident drew even national attention. As soon as Dalit organisations and opposition parties took up Mariyamma’s lockup death issue, the CM immediately plunged into action to negate bad publicity and said is government is implementing several welfare schemes for SCs and STs. Political analyst professor K Nageshwar said holding an all-party meeting on Dalit empowerment and preparation of guidelines was an attempt by KCR to reinvent himself. “After Dubbak and GHMC elections, KCR realised that the TRS is not invincible in Telangana. With word flying thick and fast that he is either confined to Pragati Bhavan or Erravelli farmhouse, the CM has started meeting people after the lockdown by touring districts and having community lunches with them. Another charge that leaders hold against KCR is that he takes unilateral decisions. No wonder, he began having consultations with elected representatives from opposition parties on Dalit empowerment,” he explained. Padmaja Shaw, retired professor of Osmania University, said several atrocity cases on Dalits have been registered in the state. “The government does not react unless court issues a directive. In the Dalit youth murder case in Peddapalli district, a former MLA is allegedly involved. KCR has now started the damage-control exercise,” she said. Political analysts said KCR appears to have realised that he made a mistake by trying to weaken Congress by inducting its MLAs into his party which has indirectly helped the BJP to grow in the state. “Now, he wants Congress to grow to contain the rise of the BJP in the state. That is why the CM has reacted immediately on Congress party’s representation on the Dalit woman death case,” Padmaja Shaw said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-eatala-jolt-kcr-in-damage-control-mode/articleshow/83878368.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Ahmedabad||Delta Plus: Focus on contact tracing in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: With two cases of Delta Plus variant already recorded in the state, the city and district administration have been directed to focus on contact tracing of confirmed cases and improve number of genome sequencing, said senior health department officials. “Mutation in virus is a natural process and we have seen multiple variants since last March. The new variant is said to have high infectivity and immune escape. Thus, identifying potential cases and isolating them as soon as possible holds key to the prevention of third wave,” said a senior health department official. For Ahmedabad city, the disease surveillance unit has been activated. It analyzes data based on several parameters, identifies emerging hotspots, and guides teams to increase Covid testing and find potential patients based on symptoms. Sources said that the officials have been asked to increase genome sequencing as the cases are very low. Ahmedabad city was the epicentre for Covid spread in both the waves, and thus the authorities have focused on the areas with low vaccination numbers to improve the coverage. Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state education minister, on Saturday conducted meeting with Ahmedabad collector and other senior officers on preparedness for the third wave. “The preparations are on to ensure there are adequate beds, ventilators, oxygen, medicines etc. The pandemic is very much in control now with effective steps. We have also launched ‘My village, Covid-free village’ campaign. More oxygen plants will be activated for the possible third wave,” said Chudasama after the meeting. Ahmedabad district collector Sandip Sangle said that preparations are being carried out based on the experience of past two waves. “The focus is on exhaustive screening of children and youth. Senior citizens will also be part of the preventive action,” he said. “All registered frontline workers have received their first dose of vaccination, and 82% have got both. Of those who are in the 45 years-plus category, 82% have got their first dose. Efforts are on to improve coverage among the younger population,” said a health officer with district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/delta-plus-focus-on-contact-tracing/articleshow/83879521.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Attacks on BJP men in Punjab by Cong-sponsored goons: Ashwani||Chandigarh: The ever increasing attacks on BJP leaders and workers in the state were not by farmers but by the Congress-sponsored goons, Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma alleged on Saturday. Such attacks would not be tolerated by his party and chief minister Amarinder Singh should resign from his position for failing to maintain law and order in the state, he added. Condemning the attack on party’s state vice-president Narinder Parmar in Batala on Friday, Sharma said, “It is not the farmers who are attacking us but these are the goons of the Congress who are trying to play a script of loot, and anarchy.” Unfortunately, the Congress has stooped to a new low and created an atmosphere of the Emergency, he claimed. The murderous attack on Parmar happened when he had gone to attend an event in Batala to mark the 46th year of Emergency. Sharma accused the chief minister of “politics of blood and deceit”. “He is nervous at the response BJP is getting and to scuttle us, he sends goons in the garb of farmers to attack and muffle our voice,” alleged Sharma. But, he said that his party leaders and workers will never cow down and would continue their activities. “The chief minister has the home department under him and is directly responsible for maintaining peace. He should resign for having failed miserably,” the BJP leader added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/attacks-on-bjp-men-in-punjab-by-cong-sponsored-goons-ashwani/articleshow/83880731.cms||---
---||Pune||All school students in Maharashtra to be taught bridge course||PUNE: Starting from Monday, all students of Standard I to X will be taught a bridge course designed by the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) on the basis of all important topics covered in the previous year’s syllabus. The course is expected to help students gain the required learning outcomes of the previous year. “Most of the last academic year was spent without any physical classes due to the lockdown. While the state had launched an online education module, there were reports from parents and teachers about the learning loss incurred by students. It is important to ensure that every student achieves basic competency from the previous class, which is needed to understand and perform well at the next level. Hence, the SCERT was asked to design a bridge course for all students studying in schools associated with the state board,” said Ramakant Kathmore, deputy director of SCERT. The programme will continue for 45 days. “The programme will include specific topics that will be taught through activity with the help of either the parent or teacher. An assessment will be conducted once every 15 days, which means, at the end of the programme, there will be three assessments that will help us understand the extent of success of the programme in making students achieve the required learning outcomes of the previous year,” said Kathmore. The inauguration of the bridge course will be held on Monday at 11am in the presence of Varsha Gaikwad, state education minister, in an online format. “An orientation session about various SCERT programmes has been organized immediately after the inauguration of the bridge course. Considering the importance of the programme, every stakeholder has been told to attend the session virtually,” said Dinkar Temkar, director of SCERT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/all-state-school-students-to-be-taught-bridge-course/articleshow/83879384.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Hyderabad||Huzurabad race: Jockeying for TRS ticket intensifies||HYDERABAD: There is a great demand for TRS ticket for Huzurabad with new names of aspirants cropping up even as the TRS leadership has begun a survey of suitable candidates to take on former minister, BJP leader Eatala Rajender in the by-election, which is expected to be held in next few months. Sources said the party is doing a rigorous exercise on selection of candidate as the leadership is not only keen on winning the Huzurabad seat, but also aiming to win with a huge margin to upstage Eatala in his fiefdom. In the recently held Nagarjuna Sagar by-election, TRS candidate Nomula Bhagath won with a majority of over 18,000 votes against Congress veteran K Jana Reddy. The margin was better than 2018 poll result when the TRS secured a 7,700-vote margin. The TRS wants to repeat Sagar result in Huzurabad also, sources said. While the name of TRS former MP and vice-chairman of Telangana State Planning Board B Vinod Kumar is doing the rounds, BC commission former member Vakulabharanam Krishna Mohan, TRS Vidyarthi wing president Gellu Srinivas and entrepreneur and former TTD member Dontha Ramesh are also trying their luck. There are rumours that the TRS leadership may lure former minister E Peddi Reddy, who is currently in BJP, into the party and field him from Huzurabad as he had represented the constituency before. Former minister and TDP leader Muddasani Damodar Reddy’s son M Kashyap is another aspirant after he jumped into the TRS from Congress. He had contested on a TDP ticket in 2014 but was unsuccessful. Interestingly, the name of retired IAS officer and brother of Damodar Reddy, Muddasani Purushottam Reddy, has also cropped up. Purushottam is vice-chairman of Vemulawada Temple Development Authority. “He can be a surprise element if the TRS chooses to bring a fresh face to take on Eatala,” party sources said.

BCPF chairman K Murali Manohar, convenor D Sammaiah and other leaders said that the caste census is required in the ensuing enumeration of national population census 2021 for fulfilment of demands and aspiration of the majority communities in the country. They said the caste census was last done in 1931 and later caste enumeration was completely stopped. The leaders said the UPA government had promised in 2010 that caste census would be conducted as part of 2011 census but later went back on its promise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bc-front-seeks-caste-census/articleshow/83878372.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Surat||Surat builds ‘box nests’ for its birds||SURAT: In an expanding concrete jungle, birds are adapting to newer nesting ideas in the Diamond City. They now prefer ‘container homes’ over the twigs and leaves nests. And why not? Finding a new home after losing the natural habitat in an urban landscape is not only a challenge for the humans. Looking at these issues, Nature Club Surat (NCS), a city-based NGO, has taken up the massive task of providing homes to the shelter-less birds by recycling plastic containers of edible oils and lubricants. It has already installed such ‘nest boxes’ at its office near Parle Point, at eco farm in Vesu and also at the Gavier Lake within the past eight years. And these ‘homes’ never go vacant, said an NGO member. Realizingthat there is a shortage of space in the city for birds to build nests, the NGO has decided to expand its reach. “Birds seek hollow spaces and crevices to build nests, which are depleting. Since our nest boxes are already a hit with the avians, we decided to provide same in all public parks and gardens in the city,” said Snehal Patel of NCS. Volunteers approached scrap dealers to buy five and 20 litre containers. In December last year, the NGO even raised Rs 50,000 through a music show for the project. The containers were washed and repainted before bird holes were made in them. “We had our volunteers, but staff of a couple companies too pitched in, and they had some good time. Bird holes were made of different sizes so that smaller birds’ nests remain safe from predators along with a water drainage hole at the bottom,” Patel said. In the past two months, 600 containers have already been installed in different gardens of the city and the NGO aims to install over 2,000 containers in total. “We are already seeing these containers being occupied by birds such as sparrows, Oriental robin-magpie and Indian robins, owls, mynas, parrots and even squirrels,” Patel said. He added that this project will not only provide safe places for birds for nesting but also increase avian population. “In our traditional houses, there used to be ‘chhajjas’ where birds made nests. Nowadays, people have mosquito nests or do not even open windows, disallowing sparrows to build their homes inside our houses. That’s how sparrows came to be earlier called ‘house sparrows’,” Patel explained. The NGO’s project not only involves placing these container nest but also maintaining them. After breeding season, the abandoned nests will be cleaned by volunteers so that new birds can occupy them again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-builds-box-nests-for-its-birds/articleshow/83878379.cms||Jay Pachchigar

---||Hyderabad||Telangana budget estimates reflect better income from sales tax and VAT||HYDERABAD: Notwithstanding the Covid-19 induced economic slowdown, a possible drop in sales of petrol due to price hike, Telangana’s budget estimates (2021- 22) and revised estimates (2020-21) reflect better income scenario from VAT and sales tax. In this aspect, the per cent of difference between revised budget estimates of 2020-21 and budget estimates of 2021-22 of the state stands at only 5%. The gap is observed to be lowest among the states with an expected annual income of more than Rs 10,000 crore from VAT and sales tax. Telangana is projected to get about Rs 26,500 crore from VAT and sales tax for the 2021-22 fiscal as against revised estimates of Rs 25.296 crore 2020- 21 fiscal. There will be a dip of just Rs 1,204 crore at five per cent gap. States such as AP and UP have a high gap between these two budget estimates at 38%, followed by Kerala (36%), Maharashtra (29. 4%), Rajasthan (28%) and Gujarat (16%). VAT is the major source of state income which mainly comes from petrol and diesel sales. Rajiv Amaram, joint secretary of the Consortium of Indian Petrol Dealers, observed that there is a drop in sales at the petrol pumps in the city. “Going by the trend, we can say that the drop in petrol sales is 30%, of which 10% can be attributed to a drop owing to price hike. This trend began last year,” he told TOI. Experts say that the state government is confident of performing well, but there are things to watch out for. Director of Andhra Mahila Sabha College for Women and former professor at department of economics, Osmania University, Dr A Nakula Reddy said that the actual realisation of income of revised estimates of 2020-21 fiscal would be known only during the 2022- 23 budget presentation. “If there is less gap between the revised estimates of 2020-21 and budget estimates of 2021-22, it means that the state government is very hopeful of getting good income, but no one expected Covid-19 second wave at that time, so we will have to wait till actuals are known,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-budget-estimates-reflect-better-income-from-sales-tax-and-vat/articleshow/83878382.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Pune||Pune: Heavy vehicles take a toll on NIBM Annexe Road||PUNE: Heavy construction activity on NIBM Annexe Road, Undri and Yeolewadi has led to an increase in flow of heavy vehicles carrying building material through a narrow road connecting NIBM Road to these areas. Cement mixtures, multiaxel trucks, lorries carrying crushed stones, gravels, rocks and construction debris ply 24×7 on this road. The road also has a steep gradient. Spillage from these vehicles has eroded the road, with debris strewn around for at least a km on either side. The road is unlit at night. Activist Rajendra Bhintade said, “The NIBM Road connects commuters to over 20 fringe villages. The slope between Sunshree Gold society and Cloud9, a gated society on the NIBM Annexe Road is in a pitiable condition for many days. Local residents have demanded that the height of the gradient be reduced, but the PMC officials are not keen on resolving the problem.” Bhintade has threatened to launch an agitation if the PMC does not repair the slope at the earliest. Management consultant Suhas Kulkarni said, “Plying of multi-axel truck and those carrying cement mixtures has severely damaged the road. We want the PMC to construct a concrete road.” Corporator Nanda Lonkar said, “The PMC has invited tenders to reduce the height of the slope and widen the road to 24m and the work for the same will begin in September.” Assistant inspector Lekhaji Shinde from Kondhwa police said, “The PMC has told us that there is no alternative route to divert heavy vehicles. There is an alternative kaccha road from where vehicles can be diverted near D-Mart.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-vehicles-take-a-toll-on-nibm-annexe-road/articleshow/83879425.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Maoist leader Haribushan's wife too falls prey to Covid||HYDERABAD: Two days after Communist Party of India (Maoist) announced the death of Central Committee (CC) member and Telangana Maoist state committee secretary Haribushan due to Covid-19, his wife Saradakka has also succumbed to the infection. The information about her death has been reportedly shared by Maoist party with Saradakka’s family residing in Mahabubabad district through a telephone call. In the last few days, Telangana police claimed that Saradakka was critical as she was suffering from Covid-19. “We came to know about her death from the family members of the late Haribushan,” Mahabubabad superintendent of police N Koti Reddy told TOI. “They said that they got a call from members of the Maoist party on Saturday morning. The caller informed that Saradakka’s final rites were also performed by Maoists,’’ the SP added. However, the Maoists not yet made an official statement on Saradakka’s death. In case of Haribushan’s death, Maoists had issued a written statement announcing that he had Covid-19 symptoms. Meanwhile, a couple, who has been working for CPI (Maoist), surrendered before Bhadradri-Kothagudem district superintendent of police Sunil Dutt due to fear of contracting the infection besides the alleged harassment of higher-ups. Madivilduma alias Surender, an action committee member (ACM) of Manuguru, and dalam member Sonu surrendered. The couple got married last month. Surender is a personal guard of Azad, a state committee member. “Recent death of CC member Hari Bushan, Bharathakka and a few others due to Covid-19 has put fear in Maoist cadres (sic),’’ Sunil Dutt said in a press release. Incidentally, some persons belonging to an alleged frontal organisation of CPI (Maoist) arranged photos of Haribushan and Saradakka and paid floral tributes to them in Kothagudem on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/haribushans-wife-too-falls-prey-to-covid/articleshow/83880745.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: These Covid-affected women are #NotAlone||Plans take on a life of their own, when the future is at its foggiest. When two former bankers from Mumbai — Reema Sen and Madhura Dasgupta — co-founded Aspire For Her (AFH) on Women’s Day last year to encourage and support women to enter and stay in the workforce, little did they know they were onto becoming powerful allies for countless women, newly widowed and brutally thrust into isolation and hardships by the pandemic. To help such women build back better from this crisis, Sen and Dasgupta initiated a platform last month called #NotAlone. The initiative aimed at practical, hands-on support for women who have lost their spouses or parents, who were also the primary breadwinners, focuses on grief counselling and support with succession management to preparing them for jobs and facilitating upskilling workshops. “NotAlone was not a pre-planned strategy. It was a response to what we saw in our immediate community of family and friends. Women were devastated after losing their husbands to Covid. Many of them were not just emotionally but also financially dependent on their partners. Some did not know if they had a bank account while some had never interacted with the external world,” said Sen who lost her father at a young age. Relying heavily on word-of-mouth, the platform has seen 57 women from across the country sign up for support since it was launched in May. NotAlone’s efforts to handhold these women through immediate and long-term support follow a five-step recovery plan — grief counselling and a safe community space; banking and financial literacy; help with insurance and inheritance claims; legal aid; and education and employment opportunities. “For us, these women are not database entries to match jobs with skill sets. We treat each woman as an individual in a very fragile state and recognise that she has her own set of requirements,” says Sen. One such woman is *Pinky, an MBA in retail management. Her world fell apart when she lost her husband last month, just days after their daughter’s first birthday. “I need to get my confidence back and stand on my feet again,” says the 33-year-old. A grief counsellor managed to bring *Asha, 32 with a 3-year-old daughter — who lost her husband last month — back from the brink when she learnt that Asha had tried to harm herself in a state of helplessness. A fortnight into the NotAlone program, Asha is better aware of her inheritance rights and trying to regain her strength to look into her future. While several corporates have already joined forces with NotAlone as “empathy partners” either to hire or put together a structured program for these women, Sen and Dasgupta’s past experiences as senior bankers — “putting together structures and institutionalising processes” — they believe will hold the initiative in good stead. *Names changed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-these-covid-affected-women-are-notalone/articleshow/83880765.cms||Mohua Das

The foundation stone for the Bharat Ratna Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar Memorial and Cultural Centre, to be located in Aishbagh, is likely to be laid by President Ram Nath Kovind during his Lucknow visit on June 28. The project is expected to cost around Rs 50 crore and sources indicated that a portion of the centre, which would include a 45m high statue of Ambedkar, may be completed by the first week of December so that it can be inaugurated on the Dalit icons’s death anniversary on December 6. Amid several memorials of Ambedkar and one dedicated to his wife Ramabai, constructed under the government of Mayawati in Lucknow, this memorial will boast of an urn containing his ashes. “This will be a grand building, housing a statue of Ambedkar, library, museum and auditorium. As per current plans, the statue will be 25-foot high, placed on a pedestal 20-foot high. Cultural activities will be organised there through the year, including seminars, plays etc. Students can visit it for research purposes,” said a government official. The library is likely to have a vast stock of digitalised literature, including books on Ambedkar and his own writings. “Efforts will be made to complete part of the project by December 6 so that it can be inaugurated in a grand ceremony to mark his death anniversary. Currently, soil testing is being carried out. As per plans, president Ram Nath Kovind will lay the foundation stone for this project when he visits Lucknow on Monday,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-govt-to-raise-memorial-in-name-of-ambedkar-in-lucknow/articleshow/83880738.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Delhi||How to teach kids in Covid time? Delhi schools get norms||NEW DELHI: Classes in Delhi government schools will begin on June 28. Before actual lessons, to be in semi-online mode, there will be two weeks in which students will be orientated to the new academic session. The first week will be given to re-establishing connections with the students and the following week to providing them with emotional support and bridging the learning gaps. This year onward, there will also be a monthly learning assessment cycle to align teaching-learning with assessment, the data from which will form part of the internal/external assessment for the 2021-22 academic year. The schools will resume semi-online, with deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia reiterating that institutions will remain closed until the situation arising from the Covid-19 pandemic eases. He also said, “Because of the pandemic, there has been massive learning loss. We will need not only to reduce this learning loss this year, but also provide deep emotional support to our children. They need to be mentally prepared for any teaching-learning activities.” In the first week after opening, teachers and school heads will establish contact with students and parents, update contact details, make WhatsApp groups and categorise students according to their phone availability, such as smartphones, feature phones or no phone. In the second week beginning July 5, teachers will talk to students about their well-being, understand their circumstances at home and find out if they need support of any kind. Light activities like reading, writing and numeracy in all classes up to Class VIII will be undertaken too. The focus in classes IX to XII would be to recap and revise. From August onwards, class-specific activities will aim at bridging the learning loss. While there will be generic and subject-wise worksheets for nursery to Class VIII, classes IX to XII will have online classes with subject teachers and students who have difficulty accessing digital devices will be provided short notes capturing the main points of the online lessons. These notes can be collected by the parents from the school on a weekly basis. Classes for XI will start after the declaration of Class X board results. Sisodia also said, “This year, we will have close alignment between teaching-learning strategies and the assessment to reduce the dependency on one-time exams for annual results.” For this, the record of monthly assessments based on projects/activities/assignments will be maintained by each school and uploaded on students’ modules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-to-teach-kids-in-covid-time-schools-get-norms/articleshow/83879431.cms||---

The fake posts, found across social media platforms, also said the US has “admitted” the coronavirus is “man made”. These posts are fake. The Biden administration has not sacked Dr Fauci and nor has it said that the coronavirus is man-made. Dr Fauci is often the target of fringe groups that claim the coronavirus was unleashed by a global alliance. Conspiracy theorists have claimed that he knew from the start that SARS-CoV-2 was a result of Chinese lab experiments. They cite a January 2020 exchange of emails between Dr Fauci and a biologist who wrote that certain “unusual features" hint at human intervention. Dr Fauci responded to the suspicion by calling for a probe into the origins. Those investigations are ongoing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fake-news-us-has-not-fired-dr-fauci/articleshow/83879422.cms||---

MP now has the fewest active cases among states with 5-lakh plus Covid count – a remarkable turnaround from over 90,000 around eight weeks ago. On Saturday, the state reported its lowest daily count of 46 and the positivity rate (0.06%) is among the lowest in the country. Active cases stand at 927. “Corona is under control in Madhya Pradesh. There are 35 districts where no new positive case has been reported. Active cases have dropped below 1,000. Considering this, the government has decided to end Sunday corona curfew with immediate effect,” the CM said on Saturday. Night curfew will continue. The CM appealed to people not to let their guard down. “Corona is under control in the state, but has not ended. People should remain conscious and ensure all precautionary measures. Please use masks and follow all Covid protocol,” Chouhan said, adding that shops will open on Sunday with strict Covid protocol. “MP again made a record in vaccination on Saturday and the campaign will continue,” Chouhan said. The seven-day positivity rate is 0.1%. “Despite this, there will be no let-up in corona tests --80,000 tests should be conducted every day,” the CM said. “The possibility of a third wave is not over. Therefore, more and more tests are necessary to remain alert. Testing and tracing in every nook and corner of the state will make it possible to identify and control the infection promptly. We must make efforts to identify the causes of each case so that all precautions can be taken,” Chouhan said, asserting that the government aims to eliminate the causes of the third wave. Treatment of Mucormycosis is very expensive, but it is necessary to save the poor and middle class families from the financial burden of treatment. Therefore, best arrangements should be made for its treatment in government health institutions,” Chouhan said. The CM asked officials to develop mechanisms to provide financial relief and emotional support to patients of serious and expensive diseases like cancer. Families and patients suffering from serious and expensive diseases like kidney ailments, bypass surgery, and thalassemia must be regularly monitored and supported, just as support was given to Covid patients, Chouhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cm-ends-sunday-lockdown-mp-gets-its-weekends-back/articleshow/83879419.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Malaria endgame: Telangana set to stamp out killer parasite||HYDERABAD: Telangana could well be the first state in India to eradicate malaria. At a time when the entire country is wrestling with Covid-19, Telangana’s vector control programme team has been tasting success in controlling the mosquito-borne disease. For the last two years, Telangana is reporting up to five cases per 1 lakh population and not a single death since 2017. “The state during the formation time was in pre-elimination stage (category 2) of malaria status, but now it has come very close to the elimination stage (category 0) and we well could be the first to do so,” said a top health official monitoring the vector control programme. Along with Telangana, states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Kerala are all reporting low cases. Health experts have called upon the Centre to set 2030 as a deadline to eradicate malaria from the country. After the Covid-19 pandemic began in 2020, there has been a quick reduction in the number of cases compared to previous years. From 2017, when the state reported a total of 2,688 cases, malaria numbers have come down to 1,709 in 2019 and in 2020, authorities reported 872 cases. Since 2017, the state has reported a total of 7,299 malaria cases. So far, this year, only 240 cases have been reported, giving hope of eliminating malaria sooner than expected. While there are risks of transmission in few remote districts of Telangana, the state is progressing well on the eradication front. “We are making all-out efforts to make our state malaria-free with Palle Pragati and Pattana Pragati programmes, where sanitation and cleanliness drives are being taken up in a big way,” Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health, told TOI. Public health experts attribute the sharp decline to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent focus back on healthcare systems. “Interestingly Covid-19 and malaria have similar symptoms, and GHMC for example has used spays for controlling Covid-19, and people got help in both ways,” Dr Subodh Kandamuthan, professor and healthcare centre director, Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/malaria-endgame-t-set-to-stamp-out-killer-parasite/articleshow/83880861.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Assistant controller with the legal metrology department Nitin Purushan led a team of officials who raided warehouses and stockists at Ponda, Corlim, Zuarinagar and Bicholim, where 3,096 rice bags of 25kg each were seized by the department for violation of mandatory declaration as required under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009. “Check the declaration and expiry twice before buying rice packages,” Purushan said, adding that the ‘jago grahak jago’ drive will go on till the violations under the packaged commodities rules are eradicated. The raiding team found 1,950 rice bags in a warehouse at Zuarinagar worth Rs 32 lakh where the rice bags did not have the mandatory name and address of the manufacturer, and the month and year of packaging. Of the bags seized, 500 rice bags were found with the date of packaging smudged or altered. A similar fraud was revealed at Maulinguem in Bicholim where 500 rice bags worth Rs 7.5 lakh were seized from a trading premises. At Corlim, 496 sacks of rice of different brands worth Rs 8 lakh were confiscated on the suspicion of being sold past their expiration date by the stockist. “The stockists will be thoroughly investigated,” Purushan said. The department has urged all consumers to check the name and address of the manufacturer, the brand name, country of origin, month and year of packing, retail price and date of expiry while buying any packaged food product. “Recently, it is being noticed by the officials of the legal metrology department that a lot of smudging and alteration of mandatory declaration is being taking place throughout Goa. If any consumer notices such a thing, kindly bring to the notice of the department by lodging a complaint at con-lega.goa@nic.in,” Purushan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rice-worth-rs-50l-seized-for-alleged-tampering-sale-post-expiry/articleshow/83882377.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra likely to conduct TET in September||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Council of Examination (MSCE) is likely to conduct the much-awaited Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) in September. Aspirants for teaching jobs in the state must clear the test, which was last held on January 19, 2019. “The TET 2021 will be held offline as an Optical Mark Recognition- (OMR) based examination. The online process to fill forms for the examination will start in July. We are thinking of going online in the next two years but nothing substantial has happened in that direction. As of now, the TET will be held in the offline mode itself,” said Tukaram Supe, commissioner of MSCE. The first Maharashtra TET was held in 2013 and the test has been held six times ever since. The last TET was held in 2019. “Due to the pandemic, the examination could not be held in January this year. While the exact dates have not been released yet, we are planning to hold the examination in September, which means candidates can fill the forms online from July,” added Tupe. Since its inception, TET has seen a very low percentage of candidates qualifying the examination. While the general category students need to score at least 60% marks to qualify for the examination, the same for reserved category students is 55%. In the examination held last year, 1,88,688 candidates had appeared for Paper 1, while another 1,54,596 candidates had appeared for Paper 2 but the passing percentage was just around 5%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-likely-to-conduct-tet-in-september/articleshow/83879441.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Bhopal||Delta-plus variant may be more lethal; genome sequencing lab in Bhopal by July||BHOPAL: Delta Plus variant of Covid-19-Though so far only 8 cases of the variant have been identified in should be monitored more effectively as it is being considered to be more contagious and with more virulence, say experts, while government plans to increase timely contact tracing. “Till now there has been no information regarding any mutation in the corona virus which had made it weaker. All mutations known so far have been beneficial for the virus. As such, the Delta Plus variant is also a mutation for which we could be more cautious. It is thus, considered that it has equipped itself well and could be more dangerous,” director AIIMs, Dr Sarman Singh told TOI. “So far we have 50 known cases till now and 3 patients have died which is 6% of the total patients. However, in Delta Plus infection, this death rate was 5%, but on the other hands, incidents like 50 is a very nominal data and it is not conclusive, but it is certainly indicative, though not conclusive,” he added. “It is very important to do more and more genome sequencing. Most importantly mask is very important. Be it Alpha, Beta, Delta or Delta Plus, masks are best options to keep the virus away, virus cannot enter through masks. As per available data there are indications that vaccines are also very effective tool against delta plus virus, vaccination should be the priority in any case,” he added. “The delta variants have the capability of severely affecting our body defence,” Singh said. Similar sentiments were expressed by Dr Lokendra Dave, head of pulmonary medicine department at Gandhi Medical College (GMC). Dr Dave said, “Whenever there is any new variant of virus, our bodies have not developed immunity against it, it spreads very fast. Even if, it’s effect vary from individual to individual, but when large number of patients are affected, it leads to collapse of the system, variant of concern is an alert level, wherein it is ensured that more and more tests are done, effective monitoring is done, if patients are found in clusters then testing, isolation is done there”. “This variant has such type of genetic material, wherein it’s virulence and infectivity becomes very high. Some patients have experienced, that the disease developed very fast and damaged the lungs, then the infectivity, ie, number of persons an infected person can affect is also very high. All we should do is ensure that we are strictly adhering to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour along with vaccination.” The government said it is working to ensure more timely and rigorous contact tracing of the patients. Medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “We were conducting around 80,000 samples daily. Efforts are on to ensure that genome sequencing is done in Bhopal itself it will lead to timely contact tracing.

---||Pune||Bombay high court allows some bars to reopen after paying 50% of excise fee||PUNE: The Bombay high court has granted an ad-interim relief to bars and restaurants under the United Hospitality Association (UHA), Pune, permitting them to restart their operations after paying only 50% of the annual excise licence fees. Earlier this year, UHA had moved the high court, seeking asking relief from excise renewal fees for restaurants in view of the operational restrictions imposed on them by the state government due to Covid-19. The interim relief order issued on June 23, however, only covers members of UHA. The association has close to 700 member restaurants in Pune and Mumbai, of which 250-plus permit rooms in Pune and around 20 in Mumbai are likely to benefit from the relief. The court order said the petitioner’s members were permitted to deposit 50% of the licence renewal fees with the state excise department. It said, “Against such deposit, the respondent state is directed to permit the members of the petitioner to carry on their businesses under their existing FL-III licences till the next date.” It also directed UHA to submit a list of its members, who have decided to pay 50% licence renewal fees, together with particulars of such payments and licence numbers to the excise department to enable the latter to implement the interim order. “If restaurants are not working 100% of the time, why are we being asked to pay 100% excise fee? We operate at 50% seating capacity, so the excise fee should also be reduced accordingly. The court accepted this,” UHA secretary Darshan R Rawal said. UHA President, Lovely Singh Narang, who owns Agent Jack’s and The FML lounges in Pune and Mumbai, said the state had earlier expressed an inability to grant such a relief. “Due to Covid restrictions, restaurants and bars were already not operational at 100%, so paying an excise fee of Rs 7.7 lakh for the entire year in one stroke was unviable. So, we approached the Bombay HC in March this year. We said to the court that restaurants have not been fully operational till nighttime and on many days, were only sustaining on parcel deliveries,” Narang said. Advocates Abhay Anturkar, Sujay Joshi and Ajinkya Udane represented the petitioner in the case. On June 18, TOI, quoting state excise department data, had reported that close to 20% of the restaurants that had yet to open weren’t able to pay the excise license renewal fee. Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association sources had cited a lack of manpower and the inability to pay the excise fee as the reason these establishments hadn’t opened. As per rough estimates, there are around 1,800 to 2,000 bars and clubs in Pune. State excise superintendent Santosh Zagade had said that while 1,673 bars renewed their licenses for 2021-22, around 320 have not approached them for the renewal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hc-allows-some-bars-to-reopen-after-paying-50-of-excise-fee/articleshow/83879434.cms||Neha Madaan

The proposal has been sent to the state government for approval. Once the proposal is approved by the Union government, it could pave the way for a separate treatment facility for employees covered under ESIC at Sassoon hospital. S Chockalingam, administrative controller at the hospital, said that the proposal was sent to the state government last month. The move will also result in additional infrastructure and manpower for the hospital. He added that the government needed some clarifications in the proposal, which were provided last week. Chockalingam told TOI, “The capital and running expenditure of the proposed wing will be borne by the ESIC, so it will not put any burden on state resources. The ESIC has funds to take care of the required infrastructure. The move will also result in starting new specialties at the existing premises.” He further said that the separate wing has been included in the Rs700-crore master plan that has been submitted to the state government for approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/separate-esic-wing-proposed-at-sassoon/articleshow/83879443.cms||Piyush Bhusari

After opening their shops, they realised that several products expired during lockdown and they now remain unsold as there are no takers for these goods. As companies are not taking these products back, shopkeepers have to bear huge losses. Radheyshyam Pandit, owner of general store in Arera Colony, said that losses he has incurred will take at least a year for him to bounce back. "I had opened the shop just two months before the first lockdown. As the business was new, I had invested lot of money at the start. Even business was flourishing; problem began after lockdown," said Dinesh Shukla, another shopkeeper. Asked about his losses, he said, "After a year several products that I had kept in the shop have expired. I could have sold them but two months of recent lockdown dashed my hopes. The companies have also refused to take back the products and I’m left with expired products in my shop." Shopkeepers are also worried that they will not get new products from the companies unless they pay their dues. "Situation is critical; I don’t know how to tackle this. I think I will have to switch over to some other business," said Shukla. Many shopkeepers are also planning to sell their shops. "Our work is majorly based on credit. I am already in huge debt, and now left with only an option to sell my shop,” said another shopkeeper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shops-open-to-expired-goods-no-takers-bizmen-count-losses/articleshow/83879444.cms||Ramendra Singh

The chorus expresses how Surti tourists miss binging in the union territory, their favourite watering hole, after the beach destination remained completely closed during the subsequent waves of Covid-19. Stanzas of the song also mention the seafood and other delicacies that lure foodies to Daman, while the last verse is dedicated to Devka beach, a favourite hangout spot for tourists while in the union territory. The video, which went viral, is believed to have been shot in a family function. Rising popularity of the song only portrays how Surtis miss Daman and desperately wish situation to turn normal soon. “We missed Daman the most during lockdown. Daman is the most favourite tourist destination for Surtis due to availability of liquor, good food and quality accommodation,” said Jignesh Gotawala, an architect. Daman’s hotel business suffered major losses due to the global pandemic. “Of the tourists, 75 percent are from Surat. Visitors from Surat play an important role in keeping Daman’s leisure industry rolling. We miss our regular customers from Surat,” said Harish Tangal, vice-president, Daman Hoteliers Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/pining-for-daman-surtis-sing-paeans/articleshow/83878499.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Adequate supply of oxygen beds, children’s ICU wards, equipment and essential materials are being made in all health institutions. Public cooperation and private sector participation are also being obtained. The CM was addressing the virtual inauguration programme of Covid Care Centre set up by Lupin Foundation at Mandideep in Raisen district from his residence on Saturday. Public health and family welfare minister Prabhuram Choudhary also addressed the programme.

Chief minister Chouhan said that in view of the emergency situation of Corona, Lupin Foundation has set up the Covid Care Centre. “It is a symbol of their social responsibility and sensitivity,” said Chouhan. The chief minister also appealed that we should follow the precautions to prevent Covid-19 so earnestly that this centre is not used as a Covid care center and may be used in vaccination and the treatment of other common diseases. The chief minister said that Mandideep is a big industrial centre of the state. A hospital will soon be set up here for the convenience of the working class. He said that the landrelated problem of Rahul Nagar of Mandideep region would also be resolved at the earliest.

In this centre, necessary machines have been provided by Lupin Foundation. This centre will be run by Block Medical Officer, Obaidullaganj. With its launch, people of Mandideep, Obaidullaganj, Gauharganj, Chiklod and Bari areas will be benefited. Chouhan said that the possibility of a third wave is not over. Therefore, more and more tests are necessary to remain alert. Testing and tracing in every nook and corner of the state will make it possible to identify and control the infection promptly. We must make efforts to identify the causes of each case so that all precautions can be taken. Chouhan said that it would be our aim to eliminate the causes of the third wave in the state. Chouhan said that the treatment of mucormycosis is very expensive. It is necessary to save the poor and middle class families from the financial burden of treatment. Therefore, best arrangements should be made for the treatment of mucormycosis in government health institutions.

---||Nagpur||Record 46,000 take jab in Nagpur district on Saturday, no vaccine today||NAGPUR: The district registered the single-day highest-ever Covid vaccination of 45,839 on Saturday due to a huge response from people in the 18-44 years age group. However, due to shortage of doses, there will be no vaccination in all the 121 free-of-cost centres of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Sunday. After taking a hit on Friday due to shortage of doses, vaccination resumed at the NMC’s centres on Saturday. The civic body had received 24,000 doses of Covishield from the state government on Friday evening. As per NMC’s data, 30,313 persons took the jab at 129 centres in the city on Saturday — 28,012 at NMC centres and 2,301 at 8 private centres. Of the total beneficiaries, 19,846 were from the 18-44 years age group. Vaccination programme began in the city on January 16. Until Saturday, 23,703 was the highest which was achieved on June 23, the first day of resumption of vaccination of 18-44 years age group. A 15,526 people took the jab at the zilla parishad’s 122 centres — 10,284 from 18-44 years age group. Thus, 45,839 persons, of which 30,130 were from the 18-44 years age group, took the jab at 243 centres in the district on Saturday. After the district high of 41,721 on June 23, inoculation declined to 37,054 the next day. The numbers dropped to 21,716 on June 25 due to closure of 96% of total centres. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI that NMC does not have Covishield doses. “We have also decided to close four centres of Covaxin and the staff some rest on Sunday,” he said. The civic body received 2,600 more doses of Covaxin on Friday. The NMC is running three centres of Covaxin for 45-plus and one centre for second dose of 18-44 years. The ZP will continue vaccination on Sunday as it has doses. The government allotted only 24,000 doses for the district on Saturday of which the NMC will receive 50-60%. This will not last even for a day. With more doses expected on Sunday, the civic body will resume the programme on Monday. Meanwhile, Spandan is likely to start Sputnik V, the Russian vaccine, from July 6. Care Hospital was the first in Vidarbha to begin Sputnik V from June 22. Alexis Hospital is also likely to make available the same vaccine in the first week of July. Vaccination was also reportedly affected in Chandrapur and Wardha districts on Saturday due to shortage of doses. A 320 could get the jab in Chandrapur district and 554 in Wardha district. Chandrapur and Wardha districts will get only 2,600 and 5,000 doses of Covishield, respectively, on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/record-46k-take-jab-in-dist-on-sat-no-vax-in-city-today/articleshow/83880884.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Bhopal-based Olympian Sameer Dad has been appointed the coach of men’s hockey academy recently. Efforts are now on to rope in former Indian hockey team centre forward Shivendra Singh of Gwalior for women’s hockey academy in Gwalior. Set up in mid 2000, the men and women’s hockey academy have produced several players for the national team. Even for Tokyo Olympics, Indian women and men’s teams have several players trained from both these academies. Sports department officials said that department wants to give priority to the local talent. "MP has produced several national and international hockey players. Shivendra Singh and Sameer Dad are such examples. After Sameer, department is trying to appoint Shivendra as the coach of women’s academy," said a senior sports department official requesting anonymity. Department is likely to approach Shivendra soon. "It will be a big step if Shivendra joins the women’s hockey academy. His presence in the academy will bring a lot of change in the academy," said the official. Shivendra was part of the Indian team that won a silver medal in the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, besides being a member of the bronze medal-winning side of 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games. He was also a part of gold winning Indian team in 2007 Asia Cup and 2010 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.

The NCB on Saturday sent Kaskar back to Thane jail after recording his statement in connection with the drug case.

Police have seized eight such cars on the basis of information provided by the arrested accused. The police had received a tip-off about a gang, which was led by Ankur Sanchaniya (24) and Shahbaz Joban (20), involved in selling stolen cars in Rajkot. The gang used to buy scrapped and damaged cars from insurance companies through online auctions. Thereafter, the two used to ask their aides in Delhi to steal a car of the same model and colour from another state. They exchanged the chassis number and engine number of the stolen cars with that of the scrapped ones and later sold the cars. Based on specific information, the police intercepted the car which the two accused — Sanchaniya and Joban — were using at the Nana Mauva circle. During interrogation the two revealed the car they were travelling in was also a stolen one. They also confessed to selling seven stolen cars in the last four year using the same modus operandi. “In many cases the insurance company buys the damaged cars in accidents at scrap value and sells it through an auction. This gang used to install the chassis, engine and RTO number of scrap cars into the stolen cars and sell them as second hand cars,” SOG police inspector R Y Raval said. Aslam Ansari, police sub inspector of SOG and investigation officer, said that the cops have seized seven cars that the two had sold in the last few years. “The accused sold four stolen cars in Rajkot and one each in Halvad, Morbi and Porbandar,” Ansari added. The stolen cars with the chassis, engine and RTO numbers of the scrapped cars used to be registered in the names of purchasers in the RTO record. The insurance companies while selling the scrapped cars also provided RTO papers and based on that, this gang used to transfer the cars in the name of the purchaser. The police seized eight cars valued at Rs 30 lakh and are searching two persons based in Delhi who used to steal the cars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/inter-state-gang-selling-stolen-cars-busted-by-rajkot-police/articleshow/83878519.cms||---
---||Pune||Many restaurants in Pune may stop dine-in services, mall staffers stare at layoffs||PUNE: Malls, restaurants, bars and eateries have suffered yet another blow, with the city reverting to the Level 3 restrictions from Monday. Though allowed to remain open till 4pm on weekdays, many restaurateurs said it made little sense to offer dinein services with operational window reduced by six hours. For malls, which will be shut under Level 3, things are back to square one. Many establishments now fear they will incur losses running into several crores per month and are staring at major layoffs. Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers Association (PRAHA), told TOI that of the 30-odd fine dining restaurants that had recently reopened in areas such as Aundh, Baner, Ahmednagar Road and Deccan, several were likely to revert to just parcels and home delivery. PRAHA president Shetty said, “Several restaurants were hoping to offer dine-in service from July 1, but now they will not, as most dine-in business happens only in the evening and at night.” He said their members recently carried out paid vaccination of their entire staff. “Losses for the industry keep mounting; the employees cannot even go back now,” Shetty said. PRAHA vice-president Vikram Shetty said restaurants cannot pay their staff half-wages. “Irrespective of the operational hours and no dine-ins over the weekend, staff will either have to be paid in full or told to go back home. If they leave, they are unlikely to return,” Shetty said. Restaurants said parcel service only made up 10-15% of their business. Many malls now fear to incur losses running into several crores per month and are staring at major layoffs. “Recurrent, sudden, closures are putting too much stress on our operations, which will impact employment. We have so far retained our workforce, but this latest blow pushed us back several steps,” Arun Arora, centre director, Phoenix Marketcity, said. Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, chief operating officer, Amanora Mall, said, “Non-essential shops can be open till 4pm on weekdays. Malls should also have been meted out similar treatment,” Rajpurohit said. “Irrespective of operational status, malls will have pay for electricity, property tax, and salaries. Establishments without deep pockets will be forced out of business,” a representative of a city mall said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-restos-may-stop-dine-in-mall-employees-stare-at-layoffs/articleshow/83879445.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Students, teachers hope CBSE will again cut syllabi||NEW DELHI: While students and teachers believe the syllabus for classes IX to XII should be reduced given the online nature of classes, educators say CBSE must take a quick decision so that schools don’t waste time and energy on text portions that are eventually excluded. Last year, the syllabus for these classes was reduced by 30%. Ashok Pandey, director, Ahlcon Schools, said, “I think the syllabus should be reduced because classes are online and we don’t know if schools will reopen soon. The other very important reason is the time wasted in teaching some topics for a month or two that might later be excluded from the year’s syllabus. There is no harm in reducing the burden now and add a chapter or two later if there is time left. But the prudent thing to do is to reduce it and not keep things uncertain.” The students agree. Rachna said, “CBSE reduced the syllabus last year and this year too the Covid situation is identical. I don’t know why the board takes such a long time to take a decision.” Rooma Pathak, principal of MM Public School, added, “The mental and physical toll on students’ health this year is higher than last year, so reducing the syllabus makes sense.” A few principals disclosed that CBSE had held an informal discussion on the syllabus with them. A K Jha, principal of Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, noted that the digital divide between students made syllabus reduction a necessity. “Most government school students, even in Delhi, do not have net access devices. Sometimes, two students share a phone. With family incomes hit by the pandemic, internet packs are a problem too,” said Jha. Jyoti Arora, principal, Mount Abu Public School, suggested that instead of cutting the syllabus, some topics could be turned into projects. Whatever the decision, it should be done in a proper manner, insisted Keshav Agarwal, who provides JEE and NEET coaching, highlighting how last year, the deletions for Class XII mathematics were “quite bizarre and meaningless” because what had to be taught relied on what had been cut out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-teachers-hope-cbse-will-again-cut-syllabi/articleshow/83879461.cms||Shradha Chettri

Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) has identified 85 such centres. On Saturday, these centres propped up vaccination numbers in city — more than half of the jabs administered were in BMC-run centres. BMC commissioner K V S Chaudary refrains for calling these centre as dedicated for women only. However, bridging the gender divide in vaccine administration is a deliberate move, he admits. “43% of all vaccines administered in Bhopal has been to women. Only 6.4 lakh women have been covered, whereas 8.3 lakh makes have been reached through the free vaccination programme. We hope to bridge this gap by another one lakh by the end of the on-going special campaign,” said Chaudary. These centres are usually manned by female vaccinators. The main vaccination room has a large enough curtain to make women feel more at ease. On Saturday, about half of all vaccine doses administered in Bhopal to be reported from BMC run centres. Overall in Bhopal about 45,000 doses were administered. BMC centres administered vaccine to protect against Covid-19 to some 23,500 beneficiaries. Overall in Bhopal, 122 vaccination centres were operational. About 13,000 people got vaccinated in camps operated through local SDMs. In the last week, about three lakh doses of vaccine have been administered in Bhopal. Out of these, only about 23,000 have been beneficiaries eligible for the second jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bridging-gender-divide-paying-dividends-in-bhopals-vac-target/articleshow/83879458.cms||Jamal Ayub

This detection was part of WGS (whole genomic sequencing) activity through specialised laboratories. According to civil surgeon, a rapid response team (RRT) comprising WHO surveillance officer, microbiologist, epidemiologist, medical officer in charge of unit, laboratory technician and health inspector, under the guidance of district surveillance officer was formed on June 26 to start containment activity.

The team has so far collected samples from five high risk contacts in the same household. Enquiries revealed that the patient’s sample were among the 169 picked by Delhi-based genome lab in May. The genome lab has picked up 157 more samples in June (till June 20) and the results are expected to be made public by first week of July, said the officials in integrated disease surveillance programme. “We have carried out sufficient contact tracing and testing of the patient. Now, our focus is on the contact tracing of those whose samples have been picked up in June. Besides this, efforts are being made to increase the genome testing of patients from Haryana,’’ said health minister Anil Vij. Vij said the government is fully prepared to fight the mutant virus. Responding to the letter written by the Centre to states about creating a containment zone, the health minister said the state has already asked the authorities concerned to create a containment zone and is also conducting large-scale testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/delta-plus-found-in-faridabad-patient-health-dept-forms-team-to-contain-variant/articleshow/83880888.cms||---

---||Surat||Kin of Kim accident victims to get compensation||Surat: Kin of 15 migrant workers who were mowed to death by a truck near Kim in January will get compensation amount, declared at that time by the state government, on Sunday. The cheques of Rs 2 lakh each will be given at an event in Pipodara village in presence of tribal development minister Ganpatsinh Vasava.“Majority of the family members of the deceased did not have required identity proofs. As a result, they were not eligible for compensation. Our teams helped them prepare the documents,” said Sanjay Patel, programme manager, Aajeevika Bureau, an NGO working for the welfare of migrant workers. The NGO teams assisted the families from Kushalgarh and Sajjangarh of Banswara district of Rajasthan and Bajna in Ratlam of Madhya Pradesh, to get the documents prepared. The incident took place on January 19 when the migrant construction workers were sleeping on the pavement on Kim-Mandvi Road. A speeding dumper truck crushed them in their sleep. Fourteen of the deceased were from Rajasthan while one was from MP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/kin-of-kim-accident-victims-to-get-compensation/articleshow/83878547.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Over 1.25 lakh in 45+ age group still waiting second dose||NAGPUR: Over 1.25 lakh in the 45+ age group in Nagpur district are now awaiting their second shots as Covid vaccine doses stock keeps flitting between record high and no stock. As per the government data, 1.58 beneficiaries from the 45+ age band had taken their first dose in April first week. More than 90% beneficiaries in the district have been inoculated with Covishield as only a handful centres are offering Covaxin due to erratic supply from its manufacturer. Between June 19 and 25, 21,391 got their second shots still leaving over a lakh in this age group pending. On June 26 too, only 7,250 turned up suggesting either beneficiaries are delaying or not able to find a slot. Between April and 3 and 9, the district centres had inoculated 2.39lakh beneficiaries with both doses — either Covishield or Covaxin. The gap between all first and second doses for both vaccines is huge. Of the total 16.26lakh vaccinations in the district till date, 12,85,657 have taken their first shots and 3,40,780 both. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde said vaccination definitely gives protection against severe disease “despite the fact that Delta Plus variant can have immune evasion as major cause of concern”. “This should be taken into consideration and should be a good reason for everyone to get vaccinated and get protection. The government must speed up and make sure the second dose is not delayed due to paucity of stock,” she said. Vidarbha Hospital Association convenor Dr Anup Marar said those above 45 who got their 2nd dose rescheduled from 4 weeks till the extended versions and were earnestly waiting for their 2nd dose are really unlucky. “After safeguarding themselves till 1st dose, they thought to get fully vaccinated 2 months back. Sadly, these Covishield 1st dose vaccinated got their 2nd dose rescheduled as norms were changed. Now when their rescheduled date arrived, vaccine non availability in government centers is a deterrent,” he said. Dr Marar added, “Many of them who planned their tours with children are now confused, worried and insecure due to the non-availability of vaccines over and above the extended rescheduling. The authorities should fix liability for this faux paus and render justice to these innocent people. I am sure authorities in their quasi judicial role will surely take action in a transparent manner quoting draconian rules as unconstitutionally enforced on general public and all sectors; on those officials also who caused this catastrophe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-1-25l-in-45-age-group-still-waiting-2nd-dose/articleshow/83880923.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Bhopal||Bhanpur land plan bags top slot in urban environment category||Bhopal: Solar energy project on the Upper Lake is not a one-off environment friendly project in the state capital; the most challenging project has been reclaiming of Bhanpur waste dump yard and making the area green again. It is the country’s first scientific treatment and land reclamation plan by Bhopal smart city, which bagged the city first place in the urban environment category of India Smart Cities Awards Contest (ISAC 2020) awards declared on Friday.At Bhanpur, there was 37 acres of land, which was a waste dump yard for Bhopal for over four decades. Now 21 acres of this treated land is envisaged to be commercially managed, which will generate an amount of about Rs 85 crores. A green zone is being developed in the remaining 16 acres of land. This is country’s first scientific treatment and land reclamation plan, according to an official. Another green project is at Adampur Chhawani, the location of current solid waste management site for Bhopal. At the location, charcoal will be produced from 400 tonnes of waste per day by the solid waste disposal plant at Adampur. It will result in annual savings of Rs 4.86 crore at current market rate.A Bio CNG plant is also being set up in Adampur at a cost of Rs 30 crore. The plant will produce 6400 kg bio CNG per day from 200 tonnes of wet waste in the plant. This will result in annual savings of about Rs 2.5 crore and an income of Rs 61 lakh per year for the BMC.Monetary benefits aside, going green has been on the agenda for the BMC for some time. Bhopal city has about 65030 street lights which will be changed to smart LEDs by 2026. The target is to install 80000 smart LED lights by 2031 in Bhopal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhanpur-land-plan-bags-top-slot-in-urban-environment-category/articleshow/83879477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Despite heavy rainfall, June surplus lower than last year||PANAJI: The combo effect of circulations over south Odisha and south Gujarat triggered heavy rainfall activity in a few parts of the state on Saturday, even as the surplus shrunk from 35% just over a week ago. The total rainfall in June this year, despite a normal commencement, is less than last year, at this stage. On Saturday, the seasonal total had touched 872.1mm, as compared to a normal of 755.3mm, a surplus of 15%, though in normal range. “Last year (in 2020), the surplus at this stage was 31%,” India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, scientist Rahul M said. The slackening in monsoon activity during the last six days yielded only about 110mm of daily average rainfall. On June 15, the wettest day of the season, the state recorded 120.1mm of rainfall in 24 hours. On Saturday, after the IMD, Panaji, issued a nowcast around 12.30pm about light to moderate rainfall with intense spells during the next three hours, the sky became heavily overcast. Few places in North Goa, including Mapusa, Old Goa and Sakhali witnessed heavy rainfall for a few hours. The circulations over Odisha and Gujarat were identified on Saturday morning. The systems enhanced the wind speeds and spurred intense convection — this was mostly in North Goa — and rain was accompanied by thunder. But the two systems over Odisha and Gujarat are unlikely to sustain for long to create much impact. There is no weather warning till June 30, the IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-heavy-rainfall-june-surplus-lower-than-last-year/articleshow/83881044.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Mumbai||Colombian gets 10 years’ RI in drug-trafficking case||MUMBAI: Observing that drug-trafficking not only eats into a country’s economy, but illicit money generated by it is often used for illegal activities, including terrorism, a special Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court convicted and sentenced a 32-year-old Colombian to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment for importing almost 6kg of cocaine estimated to be worth Rs 36 crore in 2017.  The accused, Freddy Andres Trujillo Renteria, was also fined Rs 2 lakh. He was arrested in 2017 from a South Mumbai hotel. Sentencing the accused for being in possession of commercial quantity of cocaine, special judge G B Gurao also observed, “…the offence is serious and against society at large. If the accused would have succeeded in disposing of cocaine in India, it might have destroyed many families.” Relying on intelligence received on June 8, 2017, a team of Narcotics Control Bureau, (NCB), went to a hotel where the accused was taking rest after his arrival from Ethiopia. The accused identified himself and said that he could understand and speak very little English. He spoke Spanish. The communication then took place with the the help of a mobile translator app. The accused denied an offer for personal search. The NCB officer then asked the accused about his luggage. On this, the accused opened one of his black laptop bags. When searched, the bag was empty but appeared to be heavy. The officer got suspicious and when the inner layer of the bag was opened, a packet with some white substance was found. A pinch of that substance was tested on a drug detection kit. It tested positive for cocaine. Five more packets were concealed in another inner layer of the bag. A similar search was conducted on the second bag and more packets of cocaine were recovered. The accused was arrested on June 10, 2017. Later, during further investigations, an interpreter helped the officers communicate with the accused. Special public prosecutor Leena Shinde cited the evidence of six witnesses, including the interpreter, to seek the conviction. The accused denied his role and claimed he was falsely implicated. The court held that the statement of the NCB officer was corroborated by the panch witness present at the spot during the search and recovery. “From the above evidence, prosecution has proved that the accused was found in conscious possession of 5.930kg of cocaine. Prosecution has also proved that samples were taken from the spot... Prosecution has proved that accused being Colombian has imported the cocaine from outside India,” the court said. The court said a copy of the judgment is to be forwarded to the Consulate of Colombia in Mumbai or Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/drug-trafficking-case-foreigner-gets-10-year-ri/articleshow/83880959.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Chandigarh||Vij says book Delhi CM for causing O2 shortage in other states||Ambala: Haryana home and health minister Anil Vij on Saturday targeted Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and said a "case of murder should be registered against Kejriwal and his associates" for allegedly causing deaths of people in other states due to more oxygen demand of Delhi during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Vij on Saturday morning made two tweets. In the first tweet, he said, "With (regard) to the false figures presented by the Kejriwal government of Delhi for obtaining more oxygen than necessary during corona period, that has affected other states and the patients who died due to lack of oxygen there. For this, a case of murder should be registered against Kejriwal and his associates." Seeking a probe in the matter, Vij said the second tweet: "A high-level committee should be constituted and the probe should be conducted that what the Delhi government has done with the oxygen which they obtained in excess than the requirement. It should be ascertained whether profit has been made by selling it (oxygen)." Both Haryana and Delhi ministers are in a war of words over the supply of oxygen and deaths due to its shortage. Reacting to Vij’s tweet without naming him in his tweet, Kejriwal tweeted in the afternoon: "If your fight over oxygen is over, do some work? Let us make such a system together that no one faces a lack of oxygen in the third wave. In the second wave, people suffered a severe shortage of oxygen. Now, this should not happen in the third wave. If we fight amongst ourselves, then corona will win. If we fight together, the country will win." On the other side, speaking about the first case of ‘Delta Plus’ variant reported from Faridabad district in Haryana, Vij said, "For the first case of Delta Plus variant that has been reported at Faridabad, we have ordered that 100% of all their contacts should be tested and genome sequencing should be done." Speaking about the farmers’ call of protesting at Haryana Raj Bhawan, Vij said, "Kisan andolan is ongoing for about eight months and now they are disappointed. To keep the kisan andolan alive, farm leaders are giving one call after another. Today, they gave a call to hand over a memorandum at Raj Bhawan, such events take place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vij-says-book-delhi-cm-for-causing-o2-shortage-in-other-states/articleshow/83880950.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Vaccination queues get longer as 45+ recipients turn up for second shot||KOLKATA: With a surge of recipients in the 45+ age group — for whom it’s time for the second shot — and priority groups being given precedence in time slots across government and civic vaccination centres, queues are getting longer at private Covid vaccination centres (PCVC) yet again. Most recipients of non-priority groups have been finding it tough to secure a slot on the Co-Win app or are being given deferred dates, forcing them to explore PCVCs. The 18-45 group was included in the vaccination drive on April 1, which was followed by the second wave in Bengal. Those who had got the first dose in the first week of April have turned eligible for the second shot this week. But many seeking a civic centre or a government hospital slot have been left disappointed. At a civic centre in Ballygunge, 100 tokens are being given to recipients other than those in the non-priority groups every day. But queues are forming from early in the morning, making it difficult for ordinary recipients to secure a dose. A Ballygunge Circular resident, who had received his first shot at a local civic centre on April 3, had to wait in the queue for two hours for his second shot on Saturday. “Two days back, I had come here for the vaccine but the non-priority slots were already full,” he said. A section of the KMC health department officials conceded that they don’t have the infrastructure to cater to all age groups. At present, KMC is running 150 vaccination clinics across 144 wards and 50 dedicated vaccination centres. “We have ramped up our infrastructure but that is still not enough to handle the pressure,” said a KMC official. A KMC vaccination clinic can at best handle 200-250 recipients of different age groups. “Beyond this number, we are helpless. If more people queue up at our centres, we request them to return the next day,” said a KMC borough executive health officer. The solution, according to the official, lies in increasing the number of vaccination clinics and searching for more community halls and other government-owned buildings to convert these into vaccination centres. Private hospitals and off-shore centres run by them have seen a surge as well. AMRI Hospitals saw the vaccination number shoot up from 1,500 till last week to 2,500 over the last three days. “Fortunately, we have enough in stock to cater to the rising demand. We had expected a larger crowd since slots are not easily available at government centres,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Peerless Hospital, too, has seen a surge since June 24. “A large number of our recipients are, in fact, getting their first dose. This should rise since government centres have included priority groups,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-queues-get-longer-as-45-recipients-turn-up-for-2nd-shot/articleshow/83878595.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Tribal minister Govind Gaude assured Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar that his ministry will allocate the entire funds for the project under the tribal sub plan and accord administrative approval to it no sooner he receives the file. Gaude also directed officials to recast the estimate within 20 days for taking up the road construction. The contractor, who had been alloted the tender in 2020, had abandoned the work citing problems related to Covid pandemic. “All panchayats in Sanguem taluka come under the tribal sub plan. Laying of underground power cable, construction of water reservoir with filter pump and laying the water pipeline from Kazur to Corla will be taken up from the funds of the tribal ministry,” said Gaude. The Sanguem MLA said that age-old demands of the tribal people from Sanguem have been neglected by successive governments and MLAs of different parties. Gaonkar further said that a Rs 54-crore estimate was prepared for laying of underground power cable covering areas of Netravali, Bhatti and Cavrem Pirla panchayat. The tribal minister reminded the MLA to lower the estimate upto Rs 5.7 crore as it is difficult to get financial concurrence for the bigger amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/abandoned-road-work-to-be-taken-up-in-sanguems-tribal-area/articleshow/83882541.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: No-vaccine-no-entry plan gets support from malls, doctors||KOLKATA: A suggestion that vaccine certificates be checked before allowing entry into malls and cinema halls by the 10-member expert committee set up to counter the third wave of Covid-19 has been backed by physicians and welcomed by the management of at least two malls in the city. Doctors feel vaccination is another safety measure that may provide protection from infection in such large air-conditioned spaces that can potentially turn into transmission hotspots. “If we want to decrease the intensity of the third wave, we have to be careful about transmission. Any gathering in closed spaces without restrictions can turn into a super-spreading event. Covid vaccination certificate can be a useful tool to prevent such spread,” said public health specialist at Swasthya Bhawan Anirban Dalui. While a vaccinated person may still get infected, the chances of its severity is reduced. Infectious diseases control specialist Debkishore Gupta said steps like regulating entry to only those who are vaccinated will stimulate the vaccination drive as people know that they will not get entry in these public places without the certificate. Authorities at Acropolis and South City malls said they were ready to implement the no-vaccine-no-entry proposal as soon as the state issued a notification. Terming the step an inevitable one to ensure safety, Acropolis Mall general manager K Vijayan said he felt proud to operate with a 100% vaccinated staff. “Right now, I cannot stop a person who isn’t vaccinated from entering the mall. But once there is a notification, I can ask customers to get vaccinated at the in-house facility first,” he said. At South City mall, where the management had considered introducing the no-vaccine-no entry rule before backing out due to opposition from retailers, mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree said he was all for allowing only vaccinated adults to enter the facility. “We are prepared to implement the system and are even looking at possible QR code readers at entrances to scan the certificates. Till we have something like that in place, we can deploy additional manpower to check the certificates. Those that aren’t vaccinated will be asked to go to the first floor of the parking area and get the shot,” said Bagree. Apart from being vaccinated, people must behave in a Covid-appropriate manner, said Peerless Hospital microbiology and molecular biology lab head Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. “It is important that people wear masks properly and maintain distance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-vax-no-entry-plan-gets-support-from-malls-docs/articleshow/83878618.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Both the senior Congress leaders demanded that the case against the youths be immediately withdrawn. “The Shivraj Singh Chouhan government that has totally failed to provide employment opportunities to youths across Madhya Pradesh, is now registering cases against them for demanding jobs,” PCC chief Nath tweeted on Saturday. On Wednesday, a march was organised by a united students’ front from the Karanja Chowk in Barwani to the district collectorate’s office. A memorandum to CM Chouhan was submitted to the collector, demanding that vacant posts in government jobs be filled. The district administration clamped Section 144 and the students allegedly violated the prohibition order. Following this, a case was registered against 25 persons. Nath asked CM Chouhan to withdraw the case filed against the youths. “Shivraj ji, withdraw the case against these youths and start a recruitment drive to fill up vacant posts,” he tweeted. He said the government should take initiatives to provide employment. Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya also took to Twitter and said, “Instead of giving employment to the youths, cops under the BJP government are hitting them with batons and registering cases. Withdraw the case immediately.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/nath-diggy-bat-for-unemployed-youth/articleshow/83879520.cms||---

The order issued on June 14 by Pradeep Tamta, CO Pauri city, which went viral on social media, read, “There is an apple tree inside the official residence of DIG Garhwal and security personnel posted there should ensure that the tree is well-protected from monkeys.There should be strict implementation of the order or else action would be taken against the personnel.” The matter reached the state police headquarters on Saturday after which senior officials enquired about the order from DIG Garhwal Neeru Garg who denied having issued any such order —either verbally or in written form. An explanation has now been sought from Tamta. Sources said that SSP Pauri Garhwal has also been directed to conduct a probe in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-enthusiastic-policeman-issues-order-asking-subordinates-to-protect-apple-tree-in-digs-residence-from-monkeys-or-face-action/articleshow/83877356.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The tiles are interlocked and not fixed using cement, so the monsoon has made it worse. Many pedestrians are stumbling on the upturned tiles and two-wheeler riders are becoming prone to accidents. A shopkeeper at Paltan Bazaar told TOI, “I know of at least three to four people who have fallen while riding a two-wheeler in the market. If the road is not repaired right now, bigger accidents may take place.” Sanjeev Budiyal, a commuter, added, “This kind of shoddy work is simply not acceptable. It is sheer wastage of taxpayers’ money. Authorities must check the quality of work given to contractors.” Unfinished Smart City work is also posing a problem at Dilram Chowk, where rubble and other construction materials are simply dumped on the road, making it risky for vehicles. Gunjan Singh, a college student, said, “It is better to try to stay home when it rains. The city roads are highly risky during monsoon because of unfinished work for Smart City projects.” Pradeep Saini, a resident of Survey Chowk, added, “Development works are important for the city but should they take place at the cost of our safety?” CEO Smart City and Doon DM Ashish Srivastava meanwhile said he has instructed officials and contractors to first finish the projects that have been started and not leave the work half done at any point as that can lead to accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/half-finished-smart-city-works-making-roads-risky-for-commuters/articleshow/83877348.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Two major technologies are used in garbage processing - waste to energy and waste to RDF and the general house will take a final call during the monthly house meeting on Tuesday. The detailed agenda, which explains working of both the plants in Delhi, reads, “The plant situated in Bawana Industrial Area, generated 24 megawatt power per day, whereas wet waste is used for the production of compost @ 80 metric tons per day. There is a proper system of leachate collection and its treatment via Leachate Treatment Plant. The second waste treatment plant situated in Okhla, New Delhi is working on waste to energy and 20.9 megawatt power is being generated from that. There is proper Leachate treatment system here.” On the Ambala-based plant, the agenda report says, “The company is operating and maintaining Bio-Methanation Plant at Ambala at the capacity of 80 ton capacity per day wet waste. It is processed through grinder and transmitted to pits. Further, it is pumped to anaerobic digester, it is pressed to 0.25 mm sieve, which segregates liquid and solid manure.” Sources in the civic body authority said that since the specially constituted technical committee has held discussions on the issue, majority of the officials and councillors are in favour of waste to energy system of plant, which looks feasible in the current scenario, but a final decision on the technology will be taken in the general house meeting after a detailed discussion. During the last general house meeting, some of the councillors had emphasised on the need to take a final decision as soon as possible as the matter had been delayed. After that, the house decided to visit some successful plants nearby and take a final decision. After this, an MC team visited New Delhi and Ambala recently. Although the municipal corporation had taken over the plant last year, but since it needs complete upgrade as recommended by the IIT Roorkee-based technical team, MC has been taking time to take the decision to choose technology to run this plant. Box: 11 companies interested Out of 13 companies, 11, including IIT Mumbai, evinced keen interest to upgrade the existing garbage processing plant of the city to make it fully functional with the latest available technology to run it on full capacity. Initially, all these 11 companies delivered detailed presentations before technical experts and senior officers of the MC but on the request of councillors, presentation was again organised last month. All these companies showed their plan, technology, skill, viability, mode of processing and also explained their plan to process the city’s garbage. Since there are two types of garbage, namely dry and wet, the companies explained the technologies of both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-to-take-a-call-on-garbage-processing-plants-on-tuesday/articleshow/83878615.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay plans to offer flexible UG coursework||MUMBAI: IIT Bombay is planning to offer its undergraduate students greater flexibility in adjusting their coursework to align with their interests. The idea is to allow students to choose between being a ‘generalist’ in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) by picking electives from within their own departments or others or a ‘specialist’ in one discipline by taking courses from the same (sub)discipline. The institute is in the process of revising their undergraduate curriculum framework and feedback is being sought from all stakeholders. While students can choose electives from other departments even now, the plan is to make it more flexible. “The idea is to allow students to take more electives outside of their departments. We are also planning to restructure the first-year curriculum. And there are other plans, nothing is finalised yet,” said an institute professor. The director of the institute, Subhasis Chaudhuri, shared the feedback forms for first- and final-year students on social media. He wrote, “IIT Bombay has undertaken to revise its undergraduate curriculum framework, with a broad philosophy to give more flexibility to students to adjust their coursework in tune with their interests… We are seeking inputs from all our stakeholders -- from students to recruiters.” He appealed to stakeholders to provide feedback on their experience with the current curriculum and how in their vision IIT-B graduates should be prepared to face future challenges 10 years from now. He said the curriculum for ‘specialists’ will be broadened in keeping with the current developments in various subject areas. Electives are usually courses that students pick from any departments out of interest or if it has any relevance in the existing curriculum. A student said there are some requisite conditions for choosing an elective, based on students’ cumulative performance index. Students can choose electives from their second year onwards, he said. The feedback form has questions on their curriculum, difficulties, and overlap with previous knowledge, said a student. It asked students if they want more courses in some departments, or if they want any course as a compulsory one, or if there is interest in double major programmes or more semester exchange programmes with international universities, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-bombay-plans-to-offer-flexible-ug-coursework/articleshow/83881002.cms||---

Since April 25, Rohit had been living at a shelter, Ni Aasre Da Aasra, in Magharpur village of Yamunanagar district. An official said Rohit had trouble recollecting information about himself. Rohit’s family has been traced with efforts made by assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Rakesh Kumar, who is posted in anti-human trafficking cell of Haryana Police crime branch, Panchkula. After a video call, Rohit’s son Amarnath and grandson reached Magharpur village to take him back. “We searched for him for many years. After losing hope, we thought that he is no more and also peformed his kriya karma (last rites), and recorded him as dead in records,” said Amarnath. “We received a video call from ASI Rakesh and I identified my father in the same. I amextremely happy and cannot believe this. This is nothing less than a miracle for us,” said Amarnath. Rakesh said Amarnath told them that Rohit was employed as a home guard in Mirzapur, UP, when he suffered an epileptic seizure and went missing. “As I work on such cases, I remained in touch with Jaskirat Singh, who runs Ni Aasre Da Aasra. Jaskirat told me that they found a 60-year-old man, Rohit, near Shahabad, Kurukshetra, who said his father’s name is Vishvanath.” “When I counselled him, Rohit named a village, Vijval. On the basis of the same, we started searching for his family. I found his family in about a week. From Rohit’s Vijval village, we came to know his family shifted to Bhatta village in Prayagraj, UP, about 20 years ago. We contacted the family there, shared Rohit’s photo and they identified him,” said ASI Rakesh. “The family said Rohit’s son lives in Gurgaon. Then we contacted him through a video call and he identified his father. The family took him home on Thursday. The paperwork has been done and some proceedings are ongoing,” said Rakesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/up-man-thought-to-have-died-reunited-with-family-after-28-years/articleshow/83881000.cms||JK Singh

This was the first mock drill this year. The ATS created a fake hostage situation and the entire exercise was conducted in real time. During the drill, the ATS got a call that some people had been taken hostage at Fort Aguada and accordingly the ATS rushed to the site. After understanding the situation, two teams were constituted to neutralise the ‘terrorists’ and ‘hostages’ were released. The total strength of the ATS is around 150 personnel. Pointing out that Goa receives frequent terror alerts as it is an international tourist destination and such drills help the ATS to be prepared in case of any untoward incident, a senior police officer said. There were a total 70 commandos from the rank of inspector to constable involved in the exercise who were briefed by deputy superintendent of police (ATS) Sandesh Chodankar in presence of PI B Paxieto and PI Raia Naik. No damage was caused to the fort, also no untoward incident occurred during the drill, Chodankar said. Goa ATS thanked the Archeological Survey of India for granting permission to conduct the mock drill at the fort and for guiding the ATS during the exercise. All Covid protocols were followed by the ATS during the entire exercise, the DySP said. In December, Goa police successfully completed a three-day counter-terror exercise with the National Security Guards (NSG). The objective of the drill, Gandiv-II, was to assess the capabilities and preparedness of the NSG and the state machinery in responding to a worst-case terror strike across multiple locations simultaneously. Police said that the exercise checked the interoperability of various departments and units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/terrorists-caught-hostages-freed-at-years-first-mock-drill-by-ats/articleshow/83882616.cms||---

National Independent Schools Alliance (Nisa) and Fedration of Private Schools Welfare Association (FPSWA) of Haryana on Saturday even threatened to move criminal complaints against heads of government schools as well as iniating contempt proceedings against Haryana government as the issue of School Leaving Certificates (SLCs) is pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court. “We were hoping that government will come to their rescue and some sort of relief package will be announced for them but all such hopes have come crashing down when our schools have found that government schools are stealing data of our students. One of our school director has sent notice to one of the principals of government school of Panchkula. And this will be followed by criminal complaint as well,” Nisa and FPSWA state president Kulbhushan Sharma said. “The law has a clear provision that no student can take admission in a new school without obtaining the SLC from the school where he or she was previously studying.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) claims that till now they have vaccinated 42.5% of 18-44 year population in the city and nearly 78% of the elderly population above 45 years. Mobile vaccination units are being deployed to residential societies to encourage vaccination drive “Our focus will be to enhance vaccination drive in slums, chawls and certain localities in the posh south and central zones of the city where the acceptance of vaccination has been low owing to myths and misconceptions,” said a senior AMC official. He added, “There are more than 26 lakh individuals in the city who are in the 18-44 age group and some 15.8 lakh in the above 45 years age group.” In all some 28.18 lakh people have received at least one dose of the vaccine in the city. “The number of individuals being vaccinated in a day has dropped to 40,000 owing to a slight vaccine shortage. we plan to do more than 85,000 vaccinations a day. But we will achieve the daily target once the vaccine supply chain strengthens,” claimed a senior AMC official. the civic body has even approached local councillors, religious and community leaders to motivate youngsters to organise and participate in the vaccination drive. “The vaccine supply will strengthen in the next three to four days,” said the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-scales-up-vaccine-drive/articleshow/83879559.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Restrictions imposed across Vidarbha region despite receding cases||NAGPUR: The district collectors of all 11 districts in Vidarbha region issued notifications enforcing level 3 restrictions on Saturday, following the directives given by state government. All districts in Vidarbha are in level 3, and the restrictions imposed are uniform across the region now. Nevertheless, the decline in Covid-19 cases and deaths continued on Saturday too. The region reported 188 new cases — a number lower even than in the first wave. The last time fewer than 188 cases were reported in a day was in July 2020. Deaths reduced to five, with eight out of 11 districts reporting zero deaths. The recovery count on Saturday was 441. With this, 10,72,707 out of 10,95,543 patients reported till date have recovered. The recovery rate of Vidarbha is 98%, even better than that during the receding of first wave in January 2021. Still, the level 3 restrictions have been imposed in all 11 districts taking into consideration the probable spread of the Delta plus variant of coronavirus. This has created panic and confusion among people. Many events and marriage functions planned for after June 28 are now staring at cancellation. Sudden implementation of new restrictions, despite the region doing well on both parameters — test positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy — left people in the lurch. More than 28,000 tests were conducted in Vidarbha on Saturday. Out of them, 188 were found positive, which means test positivity in the region is at 0.67% now. Districts like Gondia have even lower test positivity. Now, only 2,661 patients are under treatment in the region. With majority of them in home isolation, most hospital beds are unoccupied. The region enjoyed level 1 relaxations over the last two weeks and there was no spike in cases or deaths. District collectors have made it clear that these orders are temporary and can be revised in a week. Washim, for instance, has announced the date of July 12 to remove the restrictions. This means, the administration has made up its mind to have these restrictions for 10-12 days only. Yavatmal: The district reported no death for the 10th day in a row, keeping the toll unchanged at 1,789. The administration received 993 test reports, of which 15 were found positive.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Cops get award for arresting bellies||AHMEDABAD: Diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are common medical problems among the ranks of the city police. Sleep disorder is another condition that affects cops’ health. To motivate cops to take care of their well-being, deputy commissioner of police Zone V Achal Tyagi has decided to reward personnel who are above 45 and stay fit. On Saturday, a function was organized to felicitate the fittest in the category of 50 years and above. Tyagi had also invited a nutritionist who suggested healthy replacements for fried and calorie-rich food. “We have a special plan for the personnel,” Tyagi said. “They have been asked to improve their lifestyles. Next month, the person who has brought about lifestyle changes to lose the most weight will be awarded.” Tyagi said the idea is to encourage the personnel to live a healthy life. He said it was noticed that many personnel were facing stress and were overweight. Those on night duty could not sleep properly and needed at least six months to achieve a measure of normal routine. In these circumstances, Tyagi said, stress management was the need of the hour. He said that personnel were told to eat fruits and healthy biscuits instead of bhajiyas. “We cannot enforce a strict diet as it could be expensive,” he said. “So the dietician was asked to make a plan that kept in mind the personnel’s needs.” A senior cop said that the initiative was welcome. About 50% of the police personnel have bulging tummies and about 40% have diabetes and hypertension. He said the biggest problem is that cops do not have fixed times for lunch and dinner. Eating at odd hours causes weight gain and triggers lifestyle diseases. These were professional hazards, the senior cop said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cops-get-award-for-arresting-bellies/articleshow/83879553.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The two had stolen valuables worth more than Rs 4.78 lakh from the bank, which had come to fore on June 20. Partners-in-crime for several years, Banjare and Thakur are learnt to have contrasting attitudes towards their respective parents. While Banjare wanted to make his parents happy with his ‘earnings’ and ‘wealth’, Thakur was keen to attain a notorious stature as a burglar or thief, just as revenge against his parents who had abandoned him in childhood. The two had also purchased expensive mobile phones after stealing cash and valuables from the bank. They were planning to purchase another second-hand car for travelling to other states like Rajasthan for burglaries, as local cops had already identified their faces and whereabouts. It’s learnt that the police started trailing the duo after getting information of the substantial cash in their possession. The cops also came to know that the duo had settled the dues of their advocate in one go after he secured bail for them in an earlier case of two-wheeler theft. The duo’s bragging about breaking into a bank and sneaking away with substantial cash led to their arrest by a team of cops comprising naik police constables Shrikant Sable, Pankaj Lade, Sachin Andhale, Praful Pardhi and others, under assistant police inspector Nilesh Gosavi and senior inspector Vinod Patil of crime branch unit number five. Though police managed to net the duo last week while it was planning to sneak away to Rajasthan, Banjare and Thakur had already spent majority of the stolen money by then. The cops could only recover cash and valuables worth Rs 2 lakh from them. Police said the duo used to earlier steal two-wheelers to conduct recces and then strike at targets. They had been nabbed in the past for two-wheeler thefts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thief-gifts-rs50k-jewellery-to-mom-car-to-dad-after-looting-bank/articleshow/83879589.cms||Soumitra Bose

The owners of Dr Lalchandani Labs and Max Corporate Services have been asked to appear before the SIT on Monday as well. Investigation officer Rajesh Shah told TOI, “We recorded the statements of Arjan and Pawan Lalchandani on Saturday. Subsequently, we called Sharat and Mallika Pant for questioning once again. So far, none of them have admitted to any wrongdoing. We have asked the owners of the three firms to provide all the documents regarding Covid-19 testing during the Kumbh Mela. On Monday, the owners of Dr Lalchandani Labs and Max Corporate Services will be interrogated jointly.” Earlier on Thursday (June 24), the SIT had recorded the statement of Dr Navtej Nalwa, owner of Nalwa Laboratories.

Residents can get oxygen, medicines, among other things from those who have procured these supplies for their loved ones but are no longer in need as they had recovered from Covid-19. “I was desperately in need of an oxygen cylinder as my aunt’s saturation level was dropping rapidly. I tried all my contacts, asked for help through social media, but did not get any leads. That’s when I remember that sRide, a carpooling app, introduced a new feature for users to offer and receive help. Within two hours, I got oxygen from another user, who brought it for his father,” said Ch Harish, an entrepreneur, who resides in Kukatpally. He added, “I never expected to get help through a carpooling app. Even since I have been keeping a tab on people seeking help through the app with an intention to help at least few.” Denizens said that at a time when they couldn’t get any help from people around them, they received help from strangers. “My mom was in ICU and we were trying to get remdesivir for her. It was available nowhere in the market. We decided to try through various groups on WhatsApp and finally received help from a techie, who had four extra vials that were bought for his mother’s treatment,” said Srujana K, a student. Likewise, few used pick and drop services offered by food delivering platforms to send and receive medicines and food to unknown people. “When my wife and I tested positive for Covid-19, we were hesitant to have outside food. A volunteer sent us food by using pick and drop services for about 10 days,”said Kalyan P, a resident of Miyapur. Lakshna Jha, CEO and co-founder, sNeighbour and sRide, said, “It has been assuring to see many users on the app volunteer to extend a helping hand during these testing times. Through the pandemic, the app has empowered many people to seek and receive help and supplement each other with Covid critical items such as oxygen cylinders, groceries, drive to vaccination centres, medical kits, food supplies etc.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/carpooling-delivery-apps-help-residents-find-resources/articleshow/83879639.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Nagpur||Restrictions for short term: Covid task force||Nagpur: State Government bringing back the level 3 restrictions in all districts of Maharashtra has made people restless. Many of them are anticipating third wave, new peak and complete lockdown once again. However, Covid task force is not seeing anything like that so far. Members of state Covid task force told TOI that present restrictions are proactive step to control spread unless and until we come to know details about the behavior; infectivity and the immune evasion characteristics of the delta+ variant. Experts who have been following the delta+ related development, have told TOI that the variant is not as infective and fatal as its predator and imposing further restrictions will add into unnecessary public panic. Doctors said that there is zero evidence that this lineage is more virulant than original one. “Delta+ differs from deadly delta variant in K417N mutation which also present in beta variant. This mutation sacrifices ACE2 binding efficiency for antibody immune evasion. Hence delta+ may be less infective than delta,” said Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist. According to him, government authorities take decisions without thoughtful action and not following science. Meanwhile the study conducted by the ICMR and Imperial College of London shows that the new variant is unlikely to cause a new wave unless it leads to a complete loss of immune protection from a previous infection. Possibility of this is quite rare. “Rapid scale-up of vaccination efforts could play an important role in mitigating these and future waves,” the study added. As far as vaccine data is concerned, all vaccines are effective against all — alpha, beta, gama and delta — variants. As far as the delta+ is concerned, the data is awaited. But, experts claim that vaccines will be effective. “All vaccines are effective against delta. Covaxin has 3 fold reduction in titres, Covishield has 2 fold reduction, mRNA vaccines have 7 fold reduction. As far as delta+, the data is coming soon but likely to be effective,” said Dr Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/restrictions-for-short-term-covid-task-force/articleshow/83879637.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The incident took place on June 19 when the woman and her husband were doing their work at the site.“We carried out a complex surgery that lasted for over three hours. We not only had to be careful while removing the rod in order to not injure her organs, but we also had to be very mindful with anesthesia, which is usually given with the patient lying on his/her back or stomach. However, this patient could not be kept on her back or stomach as the rod had penetrated her chest,” said Sion hospital dean Dr Mohan Joshi. The incident took place at around 3pm following which she was rushed to Ghatkopar's civic-run Rajawadi hospital where she was referred to Sion hospital around 6pm. The woman's health is stable following a week, said authorities from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray telephonically congratulated the team from the departments of surgery and anaesthesia,” added Dr Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-labourer-with-1-5ft-long-rod-in-her-chest-operated-upon/articleshow/83881056.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Cases of Covid phobia on the rise in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Along with an increase in cases of overall phobias, several cases of Covid phobia are being reported in the city. Affecting almost all age groups and majorly affecting the elderly who have not been allowed to venture out, it has gripped some in such a way that they have not ventured out ever since the first lockdown. The psychiatry departments in various government hospitals and private hospitals together are seeing at least 10-15 cases per day, estimate experts. Covid phobia is the fear of the Covid-19 disease and its related complications including black fungus, post-Covid strokes and breathlessness. For people who have experienced Covid and the long periods of isolation and hospitalisation, the fear might be much higher. “Also, people who had to run around for beds and oxygen have been deeply traumatised by the experience leading to a phobia of the disease. Earlier, we used to see such post traumatic trust disorder (PTTD) cases in rape victims and people who have survived tsunamis, earthquakes and other such natural disasters. However, now we are seeing many such cases of Covid patients and their family members,” said Dr Ajay Kumar Joopaka, assistant professor (psychiatry), Gandhi Hospital. In several such instances reported at Institute of Mental Health, Erragada and that in private centres, people have been holed up in their houses for over one-and-a-half year now and remain gripped by Covid phobia. Also, general phobias, be that of heights, water or deaths have also flared up in patients. “We are seeing 1 or 2 cases daily. They are avoiding most parts of their daily life and are not stepping out at all. Elderly family members not allowing them to step out has instilled a deep fear in them. These patients can come out with some treatment and therapeutic exercises like yoga,” said Dr Uma Shankar, superintendent, Institute of Mental Health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cases-of-covid-phobia-on-the-rise/articleshow/83879659.cms||Amrita Didyala

On Friday, Balyan and other BJP members, including state minister Kapil Dev Agrawal with Nirwal, went to the collectorate and filed the nomination before the district magistrate Seva Kumari J. Meanwhile, Satender Balyan with his supporters from Rashtriya Lok Dal and Samajwadi Party also reached the collectorate. "Our candidate had won in the last zila panchayat president election, and again this time the BJP candidate will win," Sanjeev Balyan said. The minister ignored questions about his cousin. While Satender Balyan said, "We want the administration to conduct a free and fair election. If anything goes wrong in the election, we would launch a strong protest." To win the seat, the candidates need 22 votes, out of 43.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/tough-choice-for-balyan-as-opposition-fields-cousin-for-district-panchayat-president-post/articleshow/83877481.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Nagpur||Can’t plan ahead in this ‘start-stop’ cycle: Bizmen||Nagpur: As Nagpur again goes back to restricted timings from Monday, businesses say they are literally at their wits end on how to carry on further. Some are planning to shut down their businesses while others say this ‘start-stop’ cycle going on in a loop will sooner or later force them down the same road. Those dealing in perishable commodities say it’s almost impossible to figure out a strategy. Dilip Kamdar, who owns popular restaurants like Naivedhyam, Uttar Dakshin and even banquet halls, said “How does one stock up on perishable inventory now? I have no idea what the rule will be next week and how much capacity I am allowed to cater to. There’s no management formula which solves this problem. It’s just going from bad to worse.” Navneet Singh Tuli, who owns Under The Moon restaurant apart from other diversified businesses, said, “It’s the end of an era for new entrants into the hospitality industry. I have understood that in this scenario; hospitality can never be the main source of income. Dine-in closes at 4pm. Have you ever seen people partying at a dhabha at 2 in the afternoon? There is no way to plan for this because now we cannot retain staff nor can we provision well in advance for perishable inventory.” Ashwin Mehadia, who represents Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC), said, “How can my members plan for the future if they don’t even know whether shops will be open or not next week. When wholesalers buy goods from the manufacturer, its almost always in cash, but sale to retailers is on credit. But with their shops being either closed or having restricted timing, they will struggle to pay us back and also won’t be keen to place large orders.” “This stop-start kind of scenario takes away our power for bulk purchasing. Now, we will literally have to plan on a day-to-day basis, which means the price is set by the spot market. I think people who re-opened their businesses are regretting it,” said Tejinder Singh Renu, president of Nagpur Residential Hotels Association. Mohd Tahir, who owns a chicken shop, said, “About 40% of my sales is from restaurants. But with their timings being cut back, I get impacted. Now, I will have to place order with my wholesaler literally on a day-to-day basis, else I would tentatively book a fixed amount of birds for the weekend. It’s too risky.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cant-plan-ahead-in-this-start-stop-cycle-bizmen/articleshow/83879657.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: OBC quota in 4 months if BJP in power, if not I’ll retire, says Devendra Fadnavis||Launching a scathing attack against Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for its failurex to defend OBC reservation in the local body polls, leader of the opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, on Saturday challenged its ministers to hand over the reins to the BJP and said it would restore it within four months. He said this in Nagpur during a state-wide protest over OBC reservations. The BJP’s state unit on Saturday held ‘chakka jam’ protests across Maharashtra to press for its demand of restoring reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local governing bodies. The party had earlier announced that it would hold agitations at 1,000 locations in the state. Vehicular traffic was hit on the Mumbai-Pune expressway, in Thane and at entry points to Mumbai. “It’s high time; the MVA ministers should either restore 27% OBC reservation or step down. If we fail to do so, I will retire from politics,” he said, while addressing protesters gathered in large numbers in Nagpur. He was later detained by the police and released after some time. As Congress too protested (see box), blaming the BJP for the quashing of the OBC quota, Fadnavis, charged MVA ministers of making false promises and also making to constitute a backward class commission for the last 15 months. 'While the Supreme Court has asked for empirical data, state leaders are misleading the people that census data is needed. Instead of collecting data, they're blaming the centre for their own failures.” Leader of the opposition in the state legislative council, Pravin Darekar, agitated at Thane, blocking the road to Mumbai for some time. BJP leaders and party workers also tried to block traffic at Mulund and Dahisar check nakas. They were detained by the police. Former state minister Girish Mahajan, and MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha of the BJP protested outside Mantralaya. On Mumbai-Pune expressway, traffic was disrupted as BJP workers protested. Fifteen office-bearers were arrested and later released on bail.

The project, estimated to cost Rs 21 crore, has to be completed within two years, as per the tender notice. The ROB bridge will be constructed parallel to the one connecting Davorlim to the Quepem road. The work of pathway and approach road to the bridge, estimated to cost Rs 3.5 crore has already been tendered, sources said. Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, during the a site inspection of the location he had conducted in October 2019 along senior officials of he GSIDC, Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd and PWD Div VI, had said that since that it was imperative to construct a parallel bridge as the existing one was in a precarious state. “There are heavy pipes running along the bridge on both sides. The bridge was constructed by the Railways nearly 40-50 years back,” Kamat had said. Kamat had said that while Konkan Railway has adequate land on one side of the existing bridge, the under-construction ring road abutting the bridge on the other side would facilitate construction of an approach road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsidc-calls-tenders-for-rawanfond-bridge/articleshow/83882799.cms||---

They unequivocally said that getting the shot, while also following precautionary measures in public spaces, was the only way to fight Covid-19. “I am glad I took the vaccine, with some encouragement from my colleagues,” said 22-year-old T Janaki, a MBA student adding, “I strongly support TOI’s campaign because if people follow it seriously, it can help in reducing the number of Covid-19 cases.” Another youngster, 21-year-old Chandu Reddy, a resident of Zamistanpur in Musheerabad, aired a similar opinion. “Even if people get vaccinated, they must follow social distancing norms and wear a mask for their own safety and the well-being of those around them,” said the employee of a medical agency. Reddy took his first shot on Saturday. MBA student, G B Akhila urged everybody to stick to these protocols unless the spread of the virus is completely arrested. “Until then, we do not really know who can get affected when and how. So it is better to be safe than sorry,” she added. Along with encouraging TOI’s campaign, some students also appealed to the police department to strictly imposes a fine on those ignoring the safety protocols.

---||Delhi||Delhi government takes over private school after parents’ charges||NEW DELHI: After receiving complaints from parents, Delhi government has decided to take over the management of Swami Sivananda Memorial School situated in Punjabi Bagh. The parents had complained of school authorities arbitrarily charging extra fees from students. Besides the fees, the other issue raised by the parents was of students being intentionally failed and coerced to take admission in the same class. The statement issued by the government said it was a private school, but according to the school, it is a government-aided school built under Section 2 of the Delhi School Education Act. The school administration stated that they got to know of the government’s decision only through the press. A press statement issued by the government said, “Considering the complaints of parents, Delhi government constituted an inquiry committee for this matter. The committee found inadequacies in the functioning of the school and found that the issues raised by parents about the school are true. Upon presenting the report, the school management was given a chance to defend itself but they were not able to give any reasonable answers about the anomalies in its functioning.” K Ashok Rao, general secretary of Swami Sivananda Memorial Institute, the trust which runs the school, told TOI, “It is through the press I got to know of the takeover. Their decision had to be conveyed to us first. Quite an unusual conduct it is. They issued a notice under Section 20 several months back, which says the takeover of the school. An inquiry committee was set up in which two members of the managing committee were members. How can you be a member of the management committee and conduct the inquiry? We gave the reply and after that, we never heard of them.” As it is an aided school, the management committee members are appointed by the government. Over extra fees, Rao said, “It is absolute nonsense, as parents of the children on their own decided they want to contribute to the value addition being given by the school. When only 65% of the parents are contributing, how can it be called fees.” Value addition includes providing computers, sporting facilities, medical facilities and others to children. Rao further said, “We have struggled very hard, got a CSR grant and are constructing a new building with 12 rooms. We will have modern laboratories and library. The government has itself not given contingency fund for the last 10 years. Our director is a well-known educationist, we have a former secretary as member of the trust; we are not a bunch of thieves and crooks. We are providing children more than what we could.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-takes-over-pvt-school-after-parents-charges/articleshow/83879684.cms||---

District education officer Chintaman Vanjari directed the school to reply within seven days about the status of the issue. Vanjari also warned of revoking NOC of the school if it failed to comply. A parent from the school said, “We asked the school to give us EMI facility for payment. We are ready to pay 75% of the fee and for the rest, we told them to wait till the government takes a call.” The CBSE school had put online classes on hold for all students after about 700 parents did not pay fees. Sources in the school said some of the pending fees is from pre-Covid period. Similar cases of tussle between schools and parents have been reported from throughout the state, since last year. Some have approached courts, while some matters remain at the education department’s level. The state government itself had admitted that education officials face problems in implementing rules on the ground due to technical issues, hence views from stakeholders were being sought on what changes are needed to be made to the existing process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/edu-dept-asks-school-to-resume-e-classes/articleshow/83879666.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This is in addition to roughly 50 admissions and 50 to 70 new cases per day. Cases of anxiety and panic attacks are particularly on the rise. Also, relapse of mental illnesses in patients who had recovered or have been under control and on medication, is being seen increasingly. “It is the fear and anxiety around Covid-19 that is leading to the relapse inspite of being under medication. They are seeing their immediate family members and neighbours getting infected, which is kind of throwing them off the balance again. In such cases, the normal dose of medication is not sufficient anymore and it has to be increased substantially,” said Dr Uma Shankar, superintendent, Institute of Mental Health, Erragadda adding that overall mental health illnesses are on the rise. Meanwhile, anxiety remains the most common of mental health illnesses currently, this is followed by anxiety induced depression, panic attacks and phobias. The patients are coming with complaints of fearfulness, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, feeling unwell, palpitations and sometimes even fear of death. Abnormal grief reactions in both Covid-19 recovered patients as well as others who have lost family members is being seen as well. Reactions of grief like remaining secluded, non-communication, sleeplessness, crying and negative thoughts about life and world in general are also seen. “While normally it should take two to three months to overcome grief, the fact that many people could not attend funerals of their loved ones or could not even conduct last rites properly have led to the scenario. We are seeing an increase in such cases,” said Dr Minhaj Nasirabadi, secretary, Hyderabad Psychiatric Society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/anxiety-unlocked-imh-sees-10-surge-in-cases/articleshow/83879707.cms||Amrita Didyala

Then the veterinary student has online classes from 2pm to 5pm. Around 7pm, the 23-year-old drives to Janpath, India Gate, Dhaula Kuan, Chanakayapuri, Sarojini Nagar, Nauroji Nagar, Saket, Chhatarpur and some other places. On the way, she stops to feed monkeys and birds and after sunset starts feeding the cats and dogs on the streets. “Sometimes my friends accompany me in my car,” said Tomar brightly. “During the lockdown last year, I did this work all alone, but now have some volunteers to assist me.” It takes her around seven hours if alone to finish the task. Vibha Tomar, a fourth-year veterinary student feeds stray dogs daily at #SarojiniNagar in #SouthDelhi. https://t.co/KRyPM74Vwt— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1624771132000The fourth year veterinary student at Arawali Veterinary College in Sikar, Rajasthan, began feeding the street animals last year when the city was locked down due to Covid-19. Under the auspices of Oscar for Life Charitable Trust, which she found four years ago when her dog Oscar died, she continued the good work this year. Besides food, she takes seasonal care of the homeless creatures. In the winter, she prepared beds from discarded car tyres for them. With the sun beating down on the city, she places bowls of water for them and hopes to be able to put 1,000 bowls across the city. She also ties reflective collars on the canines so motorists can see them in the dark and avoid crushing them. Aware of the plastic burden on the environment, Tomar uses only leaf plates for the street denizens. The fourth year veterinary student at Arawali Veterinary College in Sikar, Rajasthan, began feeding the street animals last year when the city was locked down due to Covid-19“Sometimes colony residents get angry at me,” she smiled, but added, “And yet many of them also call to inform me about an ill dog. So I can’t say that people aren’t supportive. In fact, I have seen a change of heart in some.” Her parents got her Oscar when she was in Class II. Being the only child, the dog was more like a sibling to her. “Oscar died of kidney failure and arthritis. I want him to be remembered, so I started the trust in his name and began with vaccinating stray dogs,” said Tomar. “When I started posting information about my activities on Instagram, people started following me, even donated money.

---||Nagpur||Unvaccinated or uninfected more susceptible to Delta Plus: Doctors||Nagpur: While doctors feel primary treatment and intervention is going to be the same, some of them don’t foresee any immediate threat from the Delta Plus variant to Nagpur district where nearly 13lakh people have been vaccinated and 4lakh are believed to be having antibodies due to infection. Those vaccinated will certainly have protection, they said. “Even if someone gets infected, issues like dropping of SPO2, deterioration, ICU stay may not get longer,” they said. However, those not vaccinated or infected would remain susceptible and must treat any surge in cases as first or second wave, according to the doctors. As per health ministry, the variant of concern has been found in around 40 samples — 16 from Maharashtra besides Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. The Delta Plus has increased transmission rate, stronger binding to receptors of lung cells and possible reduction in monoclonal antibody response. City doctors say though the new variant of novel coronavirus was found in April, cases are still going down. Consultant physician Dr Mohan Nerker said it is difficult to say what impact the variant will have on citizens. “Not much is so far known about it except that it has been detected in some pockets of the country and it has high transmissibility. It has emerged from Delta variant which was behind the second wave surge. If antibodies do not weaken, this variant may not prove to be so harmful. Some patients have recovered too from the new variant,” said Dr Nerker, who is Covid unit in-charge of Seven Star Hospital. On May 24, TOI had reported about CSIR-NEERI lab already being part of Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) on SARS-Cov2 genome sequencing. As per the government of India project, the lab had already found double mutant B.1.617 (including B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 ) as ‘dominant variant’ in the samples investigated for the Nagpur region from January to May. Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said reinfection haven’t been seen. “I came across only one patient who was old age and diabetic. Delta plus has high transmissibility but only time will tell what impact it has on us. Those not infected certainly remain in high risk group,” he said. Infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayde said it is known that reinfection rates so far are not high. “As compared to the West where third wave is mainly due to Delta, we stand a better chance as our second wave was majorly contributed by the same variant. Delta Plus has immune evasion and it will be more virulent. So far evidence doesn’t support its higher complications rate,” she said. “Those who were exposed and suffered in second wave stand a better chance. But those who are vaccinated have to keep in mind this variant is notorious for immune evasion so its apt to take all precautions to prevent spread and exposure to the same,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unvaccinated-or-uninfected-more-susceptible-to-delta-plus-doctors/articleshow/83879713.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Protests were held in Mumbai, Nashik, Aurangabad , Nagpur and Pune and other parts of the state. The party said that the Centre is not providing the census data, which led to the situation. “The Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government has ignored our repeated demand for the last five to six years for handing over of caste-wise Census data. The Centre did not give the data. It is because of the BJP’s misdeeds that the entire OBC community is facing this challenge today,” Congress’s state chief Nana Patole had said on Friday.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Covid-19 vaccine does not cause GBS, say doctors||HYDERABAD: Covid-19 vaccination doesn't cause Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), point out city doctors. GBS is a condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves. The handful of cases reported in the country are merely coincidental and not triggered by vaccination. They said that GBS is triggered by viruses and Covid-19 is known to cause this rare disease, and added that to link GBS with vaccination is wrong as several research studies have proved that Covid-19 vaccines do not trigger GBS. “Understanding the epidemiology of rare diseases that will occur invariably by coincidence rather than scientific doctrine is important,” said Dr P Ranganadham, consultant neurosurgeon, Sunshine Hospitals, Gachibowli, referring to sporadic incidents of GBS. He said that it is one off incidence rather than vaccine causative. Stating that such sporadic cases would lead to vaccine hesitancy, which is still rampant in the country, Dr Ranganadham said a large epidemiological study by Stephen Keddie and others published in the leading scientific journal ‘Brain’ found no association between Covid-19 vaccines and GBS. In fact, Dr Ranganadham said the incidence of GBS has come down during lockdown as people avoided junk food. “Contaminated food containing Campylobacter jejuni, a type of bacteria, may result in GBS,” he said. Dr Gundluru Varun Reddy, consultant neurologist, Yashoda Hospitals, said that without careful statistical analysis and proper studies it would be wrong to associate Covid-19 vaccination and GBS. “For an individual the lifetime risk of acquiring GBS is 1:1000 and the annual GBS incidence is 1.7 persons per one lakh population. So, during the period of this massive vaccination campaign, naturally also some cases of GBS are bound to occur and it would not be correct to assume it as a causal association,” Dr Varun Reddy said. He said that when vaccinations are offering the best chance in preventing further waves of Covid-19, it would not be wise to promote myths pertaining to vaccinations without further scientific corroboration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-vaccine-does-not-cause-gbs-say-doctors/articleshow/83879733.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Ahmedabad||Corporate compassion stands tall in the pandemic||When the Covid-19 pandemic spread across the state, the corporate sector took a major hit. The companies’ businesses dipped sharply, but their liabilities and expenses remained constant. And the second Covid wave that lasted two months hit many employees and their families, raising the worries of company management. But instead of worrying about only the bottom lines, many companies having a presence in Gujarat took a compassionate stand for staff. The benevolent business community came out in support of the staffers and their families and ensured all the facilities in the hour of crisis and even if they fell to the virus. The 114-year-old pharma major, Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd (APL) announced financial aid of Rs 15-50 lakh for its employees who died of Covid. "While we cannot compensate for the loss suffered by the families, it is our hope that this benefit will help them rebuild their lives," said Pranav Amin, MD, APL. The firm with 13,000 employees has also covered each of its employees under Mediclaim policy, the cost of which is being borne by the company. As part of its commitment to financially support the family of the company’s employees, who have lost their battle against Covid-19, Welspun Group is providing 50% of the deceased employee’s monthly salary to his/her family for two years as a living allowance as well as medical insurance of Rs 5 lakh for 10 years for the family (spouse and two kids). The other initiatives include providing education fees for two kids up to graduation. Having interests in home textiles, line pipes, infrastructure and steel, Welspun Group operates plants at Anjar in Kutch and Vapi in South Gujarat. "We have set up several support facilities like healthcare and hospital setups near or within our manufacturing units, hospitalization and quarantine facilities, timely provision of any medical help required and providing oxygen support among others," said B K Goenka, chairman, Welspun Group. The company has set up Covid care centres and war rooms to help members leverage Welspun’s resources and networks for emergencies such as sourcing various amenities/requirements, including beds, medical consultations and testing without hassle. It has also established round the clock Wel-Care facilities at their Anjar and Vapi factories to cater to the medical needs of its workers and staff. These facilities offer more than 150 beds (including ICU beds), oxygen apparatus, ventilators among other facilities. Ahmedabad-based healthcare major, Zydus Cadila Group, has also been supporting medical expenses for its employees and their families hospitalized due to Covid-19 since the pandemic began in March 2020. "We have also set up a Covid care clinic for our employees and also offer free teleconsultation with doctors for employees across India," said the spokesperson of Zydus Cadila Group. Zydus has tied up with local hospitals to arrange for hospital beds and ICUs if required. "For employees working at remote locations, the families are being helped with daily staples and essentials," their spokesperson added. Ravi Kapoor, managing director of Vadodara-based Heubach Colours Pvt Ltd said, "During the second wave, we had arranged for oxygen concentrators for our employees and their families apart from ambulances that were available round the clock. We had formed a WhatsApp group wherein any employee could seek consultation and help from our medical officer at any hour," Kapoor said. "We did a vaccination drive for our employees and each one above 45 years of age has been vaccinated while 70% employees in the 18-45 age category have got the jab. Also, every employee has been covered with an insurance policy," Kapoor added. Ahmedabad-headquartered Meghmani Organics Group added an extra 14 days leave for employees who were affected by Covid-19. This was in addition to measures instituted by the company last year. "We also arranged oxygen concentrators and life-saving medicines as well as organized vaccination camps for around 800 of our employees and their family members," said Vikram Bhatt, head-HR, Meghmani Organics Group. Maulik Mehta, CEO and executive director, Deepak Nitrite Ltd (DNL) said that the company has covered all its employees with ‘Covid Kavach’, an all-inclusive, holistic insurance coverage. "Additionally, the company will also address hospital bills that exceed COVID insurance coverage as required. In the unfortunate event of any employee’s death from Covid-19, we have introduced financial support and assistance to the family of the deceased." Mehta added, "We have also initiated vaccination drives across our operations apart from disinfecting the sites and following all Covid-19 safety protocols. Deepak Foundation, CSR arm of DNL, has set up 50-bed Covid care centres too." Mehsana-based frozen snacks maker HyFun Foods also offered special Covid leaves to its employees suffering from Covid-19. "If a family member or members of an employee tests positive, we are granting 10 days of paid leave. Furthermore, we are also arranging hotel stays for those employees who want to avoid travelling during the lockdown and be in isolation to protect their family. This helped a lot of our employees to curb the spread of the infection," said Punit Shukla, general manager human resources, HyFun Foods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/corporate-compassion-stands-tall-in-the-pandemic/articleshow/83879790.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MahaRera orders on interest for late possession ‘erroneous’||Mumbai: Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal (MREAT), in a recent judgement setting aside a MahaRERA order, observed that it was unfortunate that MahaRERA had been taking a stereotyped yet erroneous view about Section 18 in several cases to cause far-reaching consequences for the real estate sector if accepted and stated that the impugned order was contrary not only to the object and purpose of RERA, but also against the law laid down by Bombay high court. MahaRera, in its order on a complaint of a home buyer about L&T Emerald Isle project in Powai, held that once construction was complete or possession was given, Section 18(1) ceases to operate, and had dismissed a complaint seeking interest for delayed possession. Section 18 pertains to interest for delayed possession. MREAT, in its judgement, also held that the home buyer was neither required nor expected to record that possession was being taken without prejudice to her right to claim compensation as the same was expressly and statutorily provided under Section 18 (1) (a) itself.Home buyer Rekha Sinha had booked a flat in April 2013 in Tower 4 of L&T’s project in Powai, for Rs 1,70,02,0851 but its possession was not handed over by October 2016, as per the agreement for sale. The promoter received the OC in September 2017 and possession was ultimately handed over in December 2017. Alleging delay in handing over possession, the home buyer filed a complaint with MahaRERA, claiming interest for delay and compensation. After MahaRERA member B D Kapadnis dismissed the complaint, the home buyer appealed to MREAT, which directed the promoter to pay interest. But the order was set aside by Bombay HC on second appeal and the matter was remanded back to MREAT to be decided afresh. The allottee was represented by advocate Harmeet Singh Dassan in MREAT, while the promoter was represented by advocate Nilesh Gala. MREAT members Sumant Kolhe and S S Sandhu stated in their judgement that the controversy in appeal had arisen as MahaRERA had declined relief of interest solely by taking the view that once construction was complete or possession was given, Section 18 ceased to operate. The members observed that to clarify the position of law, a bare perusal of provisions of Section 18 would make it clear that the promoter was obligated to hand over possession as per agreement or by date specified. The date specified in the agreement or in any other manner or form is sacrosanct and as held by the HC in the Neelkamal Realtors Suburban judgment, RERA does not rewrite the same. It therefore means that Section 18 would not operate only when possession was handed over within the specified date. But, where possession was handed over beyond the specified date, Section 18 would be attracted to entitle the home buyer relief.MREAT’s order directed the promoter to pay interest at State Bank of India’s highest marginal cost lending rate plus 2% for delay in possession on amount paid by home buyer from November 2016 to September 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maharera-orders-on-interest-for-late-possession-erroneous/articleshow/83881101.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

The similar scenes of November 26, 2020 came to fore when farmers braved water canons at Mohali-Chandigarh border on June 26 too and broke open the barricades using the might of tractors. This time the difference being, the farmers restrained it to some extent and tried to avoid direct confrontation and police too adopted some restraint. Earlier on November 26, 2020 when farmers had started their arduous journey towards national capital to hold protests against farm laws at bigger level were stopped at many places, but they had reached the borders of Delhi by breaking open the barricades and digging up roads. Farmers were to reach Raj Bhawans of Punjab and Haryana to handover memorandums addressed to the President of India, and though Punjab farmers succeeded in reaching near the Raj Bhawan, the farmers from Haryana preferred to handover memorandum at Haryana-Chandigarh border by cutting short the journey. The sources said seeing the farmers breaking barricades after facing water canons, the senior leaders had started feeling uneasy, as they did not want repetition of previous incident and asked farmers to restrain. The senior farmer leaders wanted to avoid any unsavoury incidents and going by it Haryana leaders preferred to curtail protest not going in for direct confrontation, added sources. The farmers in large numbers had assembled at Gurdwara Amd Sahib in Mohali and Nada Sahib in Panchkula on a call given by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) save democracy’ on completion of seven months into protests and 46 years of promulgation of Emergency. “The situation is similar to 1975 now as the present regime has put an undeclared emergency in place when right to expression is in danger and the dissenting voices are termed as anti-national. The Narendra Modi government is not ready to listen to the pains of the farmers who are sitting at the borders for seven months and the government is branding them as separatists, anti nationals and urban naxals. Despite all this, farmers will not sit back till their demand of repeal of three laws, enacting law on MSP are not met,” said senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/7-months-on-protesting-farmers-again-break-barricades-face-water-cannons/articleshow/83884213.cms||Neel Kamal

A team of specialised doctors would check the patients and provide assistance, they said. “Post-Covid symptoms can be dangerous if ignored. That is why this special arrangement has been done at the hospital,” said officials. Doctors appealed to the public to get their post-Covid complications, if any, checked at the facility. The hospital was also creating awareness among public to get vaccinated and removing doubts and rumours swirling, like people would become impotent after the jab, around it. Dr Mankirat Kaur, in-charge, mobilisation of people for Covid-19, said, “All these are rumours, The vaccine is safe.” Kaur requested couples who received both the doses from urban as well as rural areas to come forward and become ‘role models’ by spreading awareness about the benefits of the vaccination and rejecting the rumours. At the same time, a post-Covid care centre, ‘Umang’, was inaugurated at the Ayush dispensary in Sector 9. It has not been receiving many patients for OPD as people were not much aware about the centre, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-hosp-gets-30-bed-post-covid-ward/articleshow/83878749.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

The startup has raised a total of US $150,000 (about Rs 1.1 crore) from a US-based investment firm, EXL Investment LLC. Efforts are on for arranging further investments. In fact, the startup raised funds at a time when fresh investments in the restaurant industry have been halted as the sector is in doldrums in Gujarat and India due to the pandemic situation and frequent shutdowns. The cloud-kitchen startup operates out of a single outlet in Ahmedabad at present and offers ‘Ahmedabadi Biryani’. "Currently, we’re operating out of Ahmedabad only. With the fresh round of funding, we’re looking to expand into other markets such as Vadodara, Surat and Indore. We’re also looking to foray into other markets in western India," said Shihab Sheikh, co-founder, Rolling Plates, which was incorporated in 2018. As part of its initial plan, Rolling Plates plans to foray into tier-II markets through its cloud-kitchen model. The idea is to popularise Ahmedabad’s specialty of biryani not just in India but on the global platform as well. "In the next phase after strengthening the foothold in India, we also plan to venture into The United States as our first global market. Rolling Plates is also in talks for a JV with a Tanzania-based food-delivery and logistics startup to expand in the African market," said Sheikh. Besides expansion, the cloud-kitchen startup also looks at ramping up its technology offerings. "Being a food-tech startup, our priority is to build a strong and sound technology that can enhance our online ordering experience and logistics capabilities. Going forward we would create a robust data analytics framework that can improve the way we work and the kind of food that we serve to our customers," said Sheikh. Commenting on the growth potential of the startup, Sadaf Mansuri, founder of EXL Investment LLC, said, "The startup not only has the potential to grow in India and but also has the potential to make its mark overseas due to the unique taste of ‘Ahmedabad Biryani’. It has high potential to grow in The United States, where there is a sizeable chunk of Indian and Asian diaspora."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cloud-kitchen-rolling-plates-aims-to-expand-with-fresh-funding/articleshow/83879792.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Help at hand for rural domestic abuse victims in pandemic||* Ratnamala decided to run an illicit country liquor business from her home after her husband died of Covid. She had no choice after her in-laws heaped abuses and blamed Ratnamala for her husband’s death * After physical torture and inhuman treatment at her matrimonial home, Jyotsana returned to her parents * The family members of two orphaned girls – Aakanksha and Bali – wanted to usurp the girls’ share in the ancestral property. Currently, the two are living with a guardian who is the sister of their grandparents The Covid pandemic has had an indelible, multi-pronged, socio-economic damaging effect – crumbling healthcare infrastructure, saving lives, addressing humanitarian concerns and the need to keep the wheels of economy running. But, amid the raucous calls for saving lives, cases of domestic abuse and violence seem to have got buried, especially of those from the economically weaker sections and rural areas. And women – either widowed or tormented by jobless and alcoholic husbands – have been the worst sufferers as their tears dry up, voices muffle and they get dragged into an abyss of endless misery. Widows, especially the young or middle-aged, bear the brunt of in-laws’ wrath. Women are assaulted, abused, violated and ousted from their family homes and left to fend for themselves. Such incidents go unreported according to crusaders working on the issue. What worsens things for such women is the absence of a redressal mechanism to salve psychological and physical wounds with many sinking deeper in the quicksand of distress. With the courts closed, the police machinery busy with implementing Covid restrictions and administration focusing on Covid management, there is nowhere that these hapless women can get their voices heard. Such women need immediate help and it is at this juncture that the crucial role of village-level paralegal volunteers (PLVs) appointed by the District Legal Services Authority comes into play. These grassroot-level soldiers are trained and supported by Prakriti. The NGO working on women’s issues in Vidarbha and adjoining states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh for over two-and-a-half decades. Most of these PLVs work in villages of Saoner, Kamptee, Parseoni tehsils of Nagpur district. They brave the challenges posed by Covid times like no transport, most of the government machinery not visiting village or tehsil levels and yet trying their best to get work done. These volunteers, who are essentially local villagers, visit such women in distress and extend every possible help and support to resolve issues, overcome the situation or help reach a compromise. Some of the PLVs have themselves been victims of abuse, discrimination and have overcome adversities to help those of their ilk. One such PLV is Vaishali. Her story symbolizes the proverbial rising from the ashes and walking with head held high. Vaishali had been a victim of domestic violence, abuse and once driven to the extent of ending life by suicide after being unable to regroup her psychological wellness. But Prakriti’s counselling and guidance helped Vaishali to resolve to make her life worthwhile and also help those in the throes of a wrecked life. Vaishali counselled Ratnamala to quit illicit country liquor trade. She also got Ratnamala to enlist for government pension scheme for widows and destitute. Vaishali helped Ratnamala in getting her husband’s death certificate and got the age details of her son corrected on the birth certificate so that he is not deprived of education. After helping Jyotsana get back her share of wedding presents, Vaishali convinced Jyotsana’s father to construct a separate room so that she could live a life of dignity. Chitra is a PLV and an anganwadi worker. She assisted three women who lost their husbands to Covid. Chitra not only provided them with psychological support but also tapped government schemes to make them financially stronger and ensure education of their children and sustenance of their families. She is also helping Aakanksha and Bali. Chitra not only ensured that the girls do not lose out on something which they are legally entitled to and have been making efforts to convince their guardian to move an application in the court to restore the girls’ ancestral rights. These examples illustrate the absolute ignorance about two factors; one, quiet acceptance of adversities, physical and psychological abuse, domestic violence, no knowledge about government schemes etc; and two, obliviousness to a possible legal remedy available to live a life of dignity. This is where PLVs play a crucial role. They provide hope to the hopeless, assist in treading a hitherto unexplored legal path, help become self-dependent and stake claim to what they’re entitled for. Covid times have seen instances in villages when the parents hurriedly solemnize the wedding of their minor children as expenses would be less without bothering about the match. In some cases, the marriage is on the rocks in just a few days. The girls are subjected to abuse, violence and mental torment. As a result, the women return to their parents. PLV Nirmala uses this nuance to educate the people about the perils of underage marriage and the damaging effect it has on the mental, physical and economic health. An encouraging part of this narrative is that the PLVs are self-motivated and eager to help others. They get no allowance or any remuneration or even letter of commendation from the authorities for their selfless service. There have been occasions, when some of them even paid from their own pockets to provide ration to families on the brink of starvation. According to Abhijit Deshmukh, secretary, DLSA (Nagpur) and a senior civil judge, the efforts of the PLVs to help distressed rural women especially during the Covid-induced lockdown are commendable. “The way the PLVs counselled and assisted rural women victims of abuse and harassment to alleviate them of their plight is praiseworthy. Hope they continue to discharge selfless service for a better society,” he said. Senior civil judge Sonali Shah said that the PLVs should encourage and motivate others to help all those in need of help. Now with restrictions on a start-stop mode, the PLVs unanimously say: “Last year’s lockdown has taught us a lot. We now know how to negotiate a tricky situation. We will do our best so that no woman suffers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/help-at-hand-for-rural-domestic-abuse-victims-in-pandemic/articleshow/83879822.cms||Manish Sakharwade
---||Delhi||Delhi: 30% eateries renew health trade licence, expected to go up now||NEW DELHI: Reeling under economic stress following the two lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions, restaurants in the city seem to be slowly winding up their business. Public health officials from the three municipal corporations say that, so far, only around 30% of eateries have renewed their health trade licences. The licence renewal numbers are expected to go up as the city gradually fully unlocks and normal business activities resume. However, the pandemic has severely affected the operations of the restaurant industry and eateries downing shutters for good is being witnessed across the capital. Data from the municipal corporations is now ringing alarm bells about the future of the industry. An East Delhi Municipal Corporation official said only 29.4% of businesses had either renewed or applied for fresh health trade licences. Data from the public health department shows only 771 units currently have licences (65 new and 706 renewals). Under the corporation’s two administrative zones, 305 licences were taken in Shahdara North zone and 466 in Shahdara South. In 2019, the civic body had renewed 2,615 licences and 2,678 in 2018. Usually, the licences expire by March 31. “This time, eateries were granted several extensions. The fee ranges between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000 based on the seating capacity, with the highest slab being charged for more than 50 seats. In the current scenario, it’s a huge risk for eateries,” said the official. “The double whammy of the two lockdowns hit the eateries hard. Perhaps, high rents and associated costs have made it difficult to keep the business open,” added the official. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) official said the civic body earns around Rs 9 crore from health trade licences each year, but this time they had only collected only Rs 1.8 crore. Data from April and May showed that 778 establishments had renewed the licence, while the figure stood at 3,673 in 2019 and 3,750 in 2018. Officials said the renewal figures were low in both 2020 and 2021 owing to lockdowns during the annual renewal period. For North Delhi Municipal Corporation, too, the renewal figure stands at 30%. The April-May data showed renewal of 769 licences, compared with the pre-pandemic numbers of 2,427 in 2019 and 2,618 in 2018. A corporation official said they were planning to revise the renewal rates on the lines of SDMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/30-eateries-renew-health-trade-licence-expected-to-go-up-now/articleshow/83879813.cms||Paras Singh

However, there was no official announcement from the government or the school education department. PRTU leaders, who submitted a memorandum to CM at Pragathi Bhavan on Saturday requesting him to solve the teachers’ problems, said the CM, however, gave a green signal to start online classes. “CM directed education minister P Sabitha Indra Reddy to not start physical classes in haste. He also asked the minister to continue with the online teaching and ask only 50% of teachers to report to duty,” PRTU president P Sripal Reddy told TOI. In a meeting, where education minister, MLCs K Janardhan Reddy, K Raghotham Reddy, PRTU state president P Sripal Reddy, general secretary B Kamalakar Rao, and others participated, teachers requested the CM to issue instructions to defer temporarily the re-opening of schools due to the prevailing Covid situation, continuing with the online teaching and 50% teachers’ attendance. Their other demands include taking up transfers and promotions. “CM directed officials to prepare cadre based on new districts for promotions within 10 days and complete the process.

Around 200 residents participated in the protest. Foswac chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu said people were anguished with the garbage collection policy. “The Municipal Corporation is hell bent to disturb the peaceful life of residents as they have started a new garbage collection scheme by purchasing around 400 new vehicles. Garbage collection charges are around three times more than earlier charges collected by various RWAs,” Bittu claimed. He blamed the MC for arbitrarily imposing different rates on different residents for their water bills. “Some residents even got hefty garbage collection charges of up to Rs 4,500. Garbage collection charges in water bills are very complicated because most of the houses have one single water meter and owners are facing problems in collecting garbage charges from tenants and co-owners of houses,” he added. Bittu further stated that a few residents whose chidren live abroad said they would visit their families for months and would be charged for garbage collection in an empty house. He also claimed that vehicles deputed by the corporation are not efficient while garbage collection rehris work much better. Foswac general secretary J S Gogia accused the MC of imposing “useless policies” on residents. “They are promoting contractors in the city and are on a looting spree. They are ruthlessly spending public money without any sense,” he alleged. Secretary, Citizens’ Association, Sector 21 Pardeep Chopra said that in the name of the green tribunal, the MC has spent crores to purchase more than 400 diesel vehicles without thinking about the resultant pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-garbage-collection-policy-a-mess-residents/articleshow/83878769.cms||---

While on July 24, only about 6,000 private teachers got vaccinated, the numbers have slightly picked up on Friday. “We have been requesting correspondents to use these special drives to get their vaccinated. The numbers have slightly picked up, but there is still a long way to go,” said Y Shekhar Rao, president, Telangana Recognised School Management Association. There are about four lakh school teachers in the state, both government and private combined. Half of them, especially those aged above 45, are said to have already taken their vaccine. Teachers said that many are reluctant to take the vaccine as there is a crowd at primary healthcare centres (PHC). They said that only a few of these centers have special counters for teachers. “Having special counters at all PHCs will definitely improve numbers. Teachers are a little reluctant now as they are worried that they might catch the virus at these centres. However, once teachers start going to schools, the numbers will automatically increase,” said Shabir Ali, president, Telangana Private Teachers Forum (TPTF). Ali said that they will be organizing a special drive with the help of the Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) and Medicover Hospitals for teachers and their family members. “The drive was planned much before the state announced a special vaccination drive for teachers. About 5,000 teachers and their family members are expected to take part in the drive tomorrow at Hitex,” said Ali. Meanwhile, private budget school managements said irrespective of whether the state would start online classes only for class 9 and class 10 or for all students, they would be starting classes for UKG to class 10 students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teachers-give-special-covid-vax-drive-a-miss/articleshow/83879827.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid positivity rate goes up, but is still below 5%||Mumbai is among the districts in the state where Covid positivity rates have increased, but are below 5%. The city’s rate was revised from 3.7% last week to 4.7% now. The overall state average as per the new calculations for the June 19-25 period went up to 8.7% from 5.2% last week when positivity rate included both RAT and RT-PCR tests. A total of 36,043 people tested positive on RT-PCR in the week ending on June 25. Overall, nearly 15 lakh tests were conducted, of which 4.16 lakh were conducted using RT-PCR, while the rest used RAT. Apart from the change in WPR calculation, the state government has added stricter restrictions by doing away with the first two levels of its unlock plan that allowed several relaxations such as opening up of malls. Now, Level 3 is the base, resulting in districts that were eligible for Level 1 and 2 restrictions slipping to Level 3. As per the revised formula, any change in status can occur only after a two-week ‘declining trend’ as against one week previously. In the last two months, the state government's dependence on antigen tests has increased drastically. While the ratio used to be 70:30 between RT-PCR and RAT tests, only 41% of the tests conducted in June so far have been done using RT-PCR. Districts such as Buldhana, Gadchiroli, Sangli, Osmanabad and Palghar report even lower rates at 20%. Although known for its ability to deliver quick results, rapid antigen tests are not considered to be very accurate and are known to give false negative results. Hence experts don’t recommend their use in high numbers. RT-PCR is, on the other hand, considered to be the gold standard for detecting Covid-19. The reason for depending on RT-PCR tests is clear if one looks at Mumbai's testing statistics. On June 25, the city performed 17,200 antigen tests and 16,600 RT-PCR tests. The positivity rate for antigen tests was close to 1% while the RT-PCR positivity was almost 4% and the overall rate was little above 2%. Mumbai is among the few districts that conducts nearly 50% of its total tests through the RT-PCR route, but many districts don’t. "We realised that some of the districts were conducting random antigen tests to bring their positivity rate to make them eligible to open up. But, this kind of an approach was not giving us the correct results and so the revision was done,'' said a senior official from the state government. A doctor with the state government's public health department said positivity rates in certain pockets indicate that the second Covid wave is still raging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-covid-positivity-rate-goes-up-but-is-still-below-5/articleshow/83879895.cms||---

Police picked up protesters at Dehradun in Uttarakhand, Bangalore in Karnataka, Hyderabad in Telangana, Delhi, Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh to foil marches, said Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). “Where was the need to stop the protestors when the administration knew about the plans many days ago? It was only a matter of handing over a memorandum to the governor and not allowing even this much is a reflection of the undeclared emergency and authoritarian times we are going through,” said SKM statement. At Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, a delegation of farmer leaders presented the memorandum to a designated official of the Raj Bhavan there. In Maharashtra, farmer representatives met the governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and handed over memorandum. Similarly, in Himachal Pradesh, a delegation of farmer leaders met with governor Bandaru Dattatreya and gave a copy of the memorandum. In Odisha, a memorandum was handed over to the secretary of the governor in Bhubaneswar. Assembling of farmers and rallies to the Raj Bhawan happened at Patna in Bihar, Kolkata in West Bengal, Agartala in Tripura, Jaipur in Rajasthan, Ranchi in Jharkhand and Chennai in Tamil Nadu. In Delhi, protestors were initially not allowed to meet the lieutenant governor and were taken to Wazirabad Police Training Centre, but later on a virtual brief meeting was arranged with the LG and the memorandum was handed over to his representative.

The Trinity Challenge was launched by England’s former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, who is also master at Trinity College Cambridge, for developing solutions, using Big Data and analytics, to help prevent future pandemics. Out of the 349 applications from 61 countries the jury of the Trinity Challenge, launched in September 2020, selected eight winners (one grand, two second prizes, and five third prize winners). Ruchit Nagar, CEO and founder of Khushi Baby said their Khushi Health platform was developed to empower community health workers with offline mobile health tools to screen, refer, and follow up with Covid symptoms, comorbidity, vaccine schedules, and adverse events and also help health officials with GIS-dashboards and automated communication systems to deliver targeted, scalable responses. “Since launch on July 10, 2020, over 63,000 health workers, including ASHAs, ANMs and MOICs, have registered on the platform. Our mobile platform has been used to conduct more than 14 million screenings, 94,000 referrals and 31,000 follow ups across both rural and urban settings. We have identified over 59 lakh vulnerable people including pregnant women, senior citizens and children below 10 years besides 13 lakh high risk cases for Covid.” Khushi Baby began as a classroom project at Yale University by Ruchit Nagar in 2014 and after six years of grassroots involvement, it now has a 35-member team serving as the nodal technical support partner to the department of health in Rajasthan with interventions in digital census, reproductive and child health. “Over the next one year, our goal is to implement an expanded version of our Covid active surveillance platform, which will include a complete authenticated digital health census, and longitudinal follow-up across health verticals in Rajasthan. The solution will provide local and state governments with individual and community level Covid and non-Covid health profiles, vaccination statuses and adverse health outcomes,” said Mohammed Shahnawaz, COO and co-founder of Khushi Baby. The non-profit has also been selected by the Centre to strengthen the CoWIN. “Through this effort, we plan to scale some of our unique features to improve data quality and datadriven action across India,” added Shahnawaz. The total prize money of 5.7 million pound ($8 million) was funded by the founding members who include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to help the winners deliver their solutions. The first prize was won by a project in Thailand which gets 1.3 million pound. The project empowers farmers to identify and report zoonotic diseases that could potentially pass from animals to humans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipurs-non-profit-startup-wins-3rd-spot-rs-4-9cr-prize-at-trinity-challenge/articleshow/83879868.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Chandigarh||To be or not to be, that is the question for MC on Chrysanthemum show||Times News Network Chandigarh: The civic body authority is bringing the agenda item to take a final decision on celebrating the annual Chrysanthemum Show in December. Covid-19 stalled the annual show and now the MC has left decision to the house. The agenda item reads, “Chrysanthemum Show is being celebrated in the month of December every year. Last year, the same was not celebrated due to pandemic situation. The Chrysanthemum is perennial plant, which is propagated through rotted cutting. The preparation of Chrysanthemum requires lots of time, care, material and labour. At present, the Covid situation is not good and it is not known what the situation will be in December 2021, in which the said show is to be celebrated this year or not. The agenda is for the consideration.” As the Chrysanthemum show is the most popular flower show after Rose Festival in the city, the civic body authority spends a large amount of money every year on the show. Besides the general population, government and semi-government agencies also participate in the show. The event is organised at a cost of around Rs 18 lakh to Rs 20 lakh, including decoration, preparation and maintenance. Preparations start over two to three months before the show as it takes huge physical and mental exercise to plan things on the ground, which will not happen this time. Moreover, as civic body authority is also passing through a financial crunch, finance is another key factor. During the three-day Chrysanthemum Show, the civic body authority displays hundreds of flowers and organises prize distribution events for residents, government and semi-government bodies. Last year, the authority added some new features like music show.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/to-be-or-not-to-be-that-is-the-question-for-mc-on-chrysanthemum-show/articleshow/83878806.cms||---
---||Delhi||Back in business, Delhi malls see steady growth in number of visitors||NEW DELHI: Malls were among the first few establishments to be closed after the second wave of Covid-19 spread peaked. When they reopened, there were restrictions on timings and capacity and their biggest attractions such as restaurants were running to reduced seating and timing while cinemas are still closed. This is going to be a long recovery for them. However, since their reopening on June 7, things have not been as bad as they were predicted to be. Yogeshwar Sharma of Select Citywalk has witnessed a steady increase in the number of footfall. In terms of a month by month comparison, he says, it is better than last year’s numbers. “Consumer sentiment shows that people are confident and comfortable stepping out of their houses and coming to the mall with safety precautions. Vaccination has been an important factor in boosting confidence,” Sharma explains. An official at Ambience Malls says they are already witnessing 50,000 visitors on weekends and 20,000 on weekdays. From coffee shops to apparel stores, the turnout and customer spend have been heartening, the official adds. Just as malls reopened, videos of people in queue outside malls or lining the escalators without social distancing went viral on social media. Abhishek Bansal of Pacific Malls says that was initial pent-up demand, which has stabilised now. He says that his Dwarka and Tagore Garden malls have already touched 40% of pre-Covid footfalls. The numbers will remain in the range of 40-50% of 2019 figures as restaurants are not allowed to run their full hours while cinemas that add up to 20% of footfall are still shut, he adds. What has been heartening for Bansal is the reopening of all the outlets in his malls. He has noticed athleisure brands doing really well since reopening while restaurants with 50% seating and early closing are also doing steady business. Sharma too says that fast fashion, athleisure, consumer durable and beauty brands are the best performers. He explains that social distancing and queue managers are ensuring a safe shopping experience. Sharma expects the retail market to bounce back sooner this time as compared to last year. “It is too early to look at numbers. If we keep on maintaining the pace of the vaccination, there is a possibility of businesses soon getting back to the pre-Covid levels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/back-in-biz-malls-see-steady-growth-in-number-of-visitors/articleshow/83879854.cms||Amin Ali
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: From tomorrow, bridge course for all pupils of state schools||Starting Monday, all students of Std I to X will be taught a bridge course designed by the State Council of Education Research & Training (SCERT) on the basis of all important topics covered in the previous year’s syllabus. The course is expected to help students gain the required learning outcomes of the previous year. “Most of the last academic year was spent without any physical classes due to the lockdown. While the state had launched an online education module, there were reports from parents and teachers about the learning loss incurred by students. It is important to ensure that every student achieves basic competency from the previous class, which is needed to understand and perform well at the next level. Hence, the SCERT was asked to design a bridge course for all students studying in schools associated with the state board,” said Ramakant Kathmore, deputy director of SCERT. The programme will continue for 45 days. “The programme will include specific topics that will be taught through activity with the help of either the parent or teacher. An assessment will be done every 15 days, which means, at the end of the programme, there will be three assessments that will help us understand the extent of success of the programme in making students achieve the required learning outcomes of the previous year,” said Kathmore. The inauguration of the bridge course will be held on Monday at 11am in the presence of state education minister Varsha Gaikwad in an online format. “Various projects have been initiated by the council to make the teaching-learning process smooth at schools. Proper implementation of all the initiatives must be done in the entire state...,” said Dinkar Temkar, director of SCERT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-from-tomorrow-bridge-course-for-all-pupils-of-state-schools/articleshow/83881107.cms||Ardhra Nair

The department has also identified faulty electricity poles in each division to replace the highly damaged poles before the onset of monsoon. Since routine maintenance work in the electricity distribution network interlinking substations, transformers and households/commercial establishments was not taken up between February and May 2020, the city was reporting unusual power outages due to technical failure. Citing the conduct of board exams, witnessing people staying indoors due to lockdown and citing the assembly election, maintenance of distribution network and overhauling at substations was postponed. But, since the delay in scheduled maintenance was causing outages, Tangedco took up over 10 emergency power shutdown between June 18 and 24 for maintenance of live electricity wires in Trichy urban and suburbs. In the work carried out across seven Tangedco divisions, overgrown trees and weeds which interfered with the distribution network at a total of 2,294 locations were removed. Jumpers that connect two transmission lines found with snags were rectified at 238 locations. “This was the largest and synchronised maintenance exercise taken up in recent years involving more than 500 workforces. Most of the snags were rectified, we will complete the required maintenance by this month end,” a senior Tangedco official said. As many as 40 faulty high tension and low tension lines in sagging condition were replaced. “The pending substation maintenance work will be completed in the coming days,” the official added. The department has planned to take up the final spell of maintenance involving power shutdown in several areas of the city and suburbs on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tangedco-trichy-to-finish-maintenance-work-by-month-end/articleshow/83851527.cms||Deepak Karthik

Amid heavy police arrangements, the farmers who had gathered under banner of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) used one side of the road and ended the march at Sector 7-8 roundabout of Panchkula, around 100 meters from Chandigarh-Panchkula borders. ADC to Haryana governor received the memorandum from SKM leaders headed by Yogendera Yadav. While BKU Charuni president Gurnam Singh Charuni submitted the memorandum to the managing director of UHBVN and DHBVN, Shashank Anand, at Shakti Bhawan in Panchkula. Later, interacting with journalists after giving the memorandum, Yadav, Charuni and Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan termed the agitation as a successful, as the farmers restrained themselves from jumping the barricades. Except for Ghahhar bridge where the police had put up double barricading and cemented wall barriers that farmers had to breach, farmers did not violate the route finalised by the police. When a handful of agitators, headed by Jagdeep Singh, wanted to breach Chandigarh barriers, they were persuaded not to by farmer leaders. According to Yadav, Charuni, Sangwan and others, agitation will be intensified in future and the SKM will oppose Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab and other states that are going to polls. “ West Bengal injection was just the first dose for BJP and PM Modi. They need to to be given a complete course, hence SKM will go to all the states going to polls and would campaign against BJP to repeat West Bengal. Everything has mellowed down, except Modi’s arrogance,’’ said Yadav. Among those who addressed the gathering included Sangwan Khap president and Dadri MLA Sombir Sangwan, Raj Kaur, an activist from Chandigarh, Suman Hooda, Satyawan, Yogender Yadav and Gurnam Singh Charuni. “SKM had announced the protest march and submission of our protest letter to governor for President of India. Hence, we never had plans to reach governor houses. Our farmers from Haryana had exercised restraint and proved that they are peace loving and law abiding citizens,” said Yadav. Referring to submission of memorandum to Discom authorities, Charuni said it was a fruitful meeting and officials including MD Shashank Anand, chief engineers of two discoms had assured to take up their issues with government and would discuss the same on July 5. “Pending tubewell connection, release of compensation for installation of pillars and transformers and heavy transmission lines were some of the issues that need to be addressed. We will wait for the response and a delegation will meet again,’’ said Charuni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sigh-of-relief-as-panchkula-march-ends-peacefully/articleshow/83884224.cms||Manvir Saini

A senior health department official said, “The doses which were available today morning (Saturday) were 4.5 lakh, but after today’s vaccination, we are now left with around two lakh doses. Some of the districts have few doses.” The Centre had supplied 3.4 lakh doses on Friday. Officials said that they are not sure if they are going to receive doses on Sunday. “Covid has not vanished yet and we have just two solutions for prevention, either 100% vaccination of people or Covid-appropriate behaviour (use of masks etc). We are putting effort for 100% vaccination, but it depends on the Centre which supplies the vaccines to us. We can vaccinate people as we are receiving the doses from the Centre. We have facilities to vaccinate 15 lakh doses daily,” said Raghu Sharma, health minister. “We have demanded 1.5crore doses from the Centre for July. We have eight crore people and if we vaccinate two doses, we require 16 crore doses. So far, we have vaccinated more than 2.3 crore doses till date,” he said.

Health minister Raghu Sharma, who along with local MLA Rafeek Khan on Saturday inspected the preparations being made for third wave at Satellite Hospital said, “Better medical facilities are being provided by strengthening infrastructure of all children hospitals in the state.”Satellite Hospital will remain a non-Covid hospital and it will provide treatment to patients suffering from diseases other than Covid. The facility has 125 beds out of which 100 are for under-18 children and 25 are for mothers of babies and pregnant women. The hospital has 27-30 beds for critical care including PICU, NICU and SNCU. “In an emergency, the number of beds for critical care can be increased to 125,” said Sharma. An oxygen generation plant with a capacity of 400 litres per minute is being set up at the hospital. The facility has a line of centralised oxygen plant. There will be no shortage of oxygen in the hospital.Adarsh Nagar MLA Rafeek Khan said by making necessary arrangements such as ICUs and ventilators in this hospital, patients need not have to go to big hospitals such as SMS or RUHS and they can be treated at the local level.Since non-Covid patients from JK Lon Hospital may be shifted to Satellite Hospital, the health department is ensuring proper availability of oxygen. “As many as 90 oxygen concentrators have been provided to the hospital, out of which 75 have capacity of 5litres/minute and 15 have capacity of 10 litres per minute,” said Dr Jagdish Singh, hospital superintendent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sethi-colony-hops-strengthens-facilities-for-non-covid-child-patients/articleshow/83879900.cms||---

The incident occurred on June 17. The tiger, who lives in the forests of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Surla and the reserve forest in Karnataka, killed the buffalo at Nandrukiche Mol in Surla. Earlier this year, in the second week of May, a pregnant buffalo belonging to the same Dhangar family had been attacked and injured by a tiger. Over the last four months, the presence of three tigers has been confirmed in Surla through images captured by camera traps. “Two of my buffaloes were attacked by the tiger on June 17. One escaped. The tiger killed the second and ate 50% of its meat. The forest department had assured me immediate compensation,” said Deu Zore. “Along with our officials, a veterinary doctor conducted the postmortem of the killed buffalo. The process of providing necessary compensation to the affected has been initiated,” deputy conservator of wildlife Jebastin Arulraj said. Assistant conservator of wildlife Tejasvini visited the spot along with other forest officials and made attempts to build confidence among the members of the affected family and assured them help. Range forest officer of the sanctuary Narayan Prabhu Desai said, “Our staff have been involved in patrolling the area and regularly monitor the tiger movement.” On June 22, the forest staff found evidences of recent presence of tiger in the area. Last year, in January, four tigers were killed in the forest of Golaulim, Sattari, by poisoning . After this tragedy the presence of three tigers in the sanctuary has ignited hope in wildlifers about the presence of the big cat in the forest of the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhangar-family-in-surla-loses-buffalo-to-second-tiger-attack-in-two-months/articleshow/83881115.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Man gets jail, fine for misleading couple||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has convicted a property buyer to two months jail and two officers of Union Bank of India with Rs 20,000 fine each, for misleading a couple that bought a 300 square yards plot at Boduppal Peerjadiguda of Uppal mandal (now in Medipally mandal) in Medchal district. The couple—S Anuradha and Naga Raju—bought it from their vendors on Sept 4, 2017. Their vendors suppressed the fact that they had already mortgaged the land with the Union Bank of India (UBI) and obtained a loan on it. The couple filed a police complaint with Medipalli police on the fraud. They also requested the bank to allow them to clear the dues lying in the name of the mortgaged plot so that they can take delivery of the plot and papers. The bank said that the vendors of this plot had to clear a loan of Rs 59 lakh. It asked the couple to pay that money. But in the meantime, it went ahead with the auction on Feb 28, 2018, and sold it to the highest bidder, Suttam Devender Reddy, for Rs 80 lakh. Even before he paid all the amount, it gave him the sale confirmation certificate in contravention of norms. He paid the full amount only in January 2019, a year after the auction was held. The bank also allowed the petitioner couple to clear the outstanding dues. They paid Rs 40 lakh to the loan account and were ready with the balance amount too. But on account of the conclusion of auction, the amount did not reach the loan account which was closed by then. Bank officials, by law, should not wait for a year for successful bidder to pay, they have to resell it after forfeiting the amount that was already paid. The bench of Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman gave a finding that two UBI officers, CVN Bhaskar Rao and Rajesh Kumar Singh, intentionally helped Devender Reddy to ensure that he gets the plot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-gets-jail-fine-for-misleading-couple/articleshow/83879948.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Mumbai||Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh skips ED summons, seeks time||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday summoned former state home minister Anil Deshmukh for questioning in connection with its probe into the alleged money laundering case, but Deshmukh did not turn up and sought more time. Late on Friday, the probe agency arrested Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (as reported in TOI’s late edition) and a special court remanded them in ED custody till July 1. In the remand application, the agency said that of the money collected from orchestra bars by dismissed cop Sachin Waze allegedly on Deshmukh’s instructions, Rs 4.7 crore was transferred to the former minister’s Nagpur- based educational trust by his son, who routed it via two hawala operators and showed it as donation. The ED further claimed that Palande and Shinde had played an active role in the money laundering. It said that Palande had coordinated with Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal and ACP Sanjay Patil in allegedly collecting money from orchestra bar owners in Mumbai and Shinde had received the funds. In his statement to the ED, Waze said he had collected Rs 4.7 crore between December 2020 and February 2021 (during the period the government had relaxed Covid lockdown conditions, allowing bars to operate), and handed over the money to Shinde in two instalments. The remand application has mentioned diversion of funds collected from the bar owners by Waze into the account of Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha through a Delhi-based hawala operator. Deshmukh is the president of the trust and his two sons, Salil and Hrishikesh, are trustees. The ED has recorded statements of prominent bar owners in the city who had allegedly collected money from other bar owners known to them for the smooth functioning of their business. They said that in December, 60 orchestra bar owners paid Rs 40 lakh to Waze as “good luck” money and then between January and February all the bar owners had collectively contributed Rs 4.3 crore for Waze, who handed over the entire collection to Deshmukh’s staff. Waze had told the bar owners that the collected money will go to “Number 1” and the crime branch and social service branch of Mumbai police, the remand application said. The ED’s remand plea said Surendra and Virendra Jain, Delhi-based book entry operators, had said that Hrishikesh, through his associate, had approached them requesting an arrangement to take cash from him and transfer the amount to his trust through regular banking transactions as donations. It further said the cash collected from bar owners in Mumbai was transferred to the Jain brothers through a hawala channel who used several Delhi-based paper companies to layer the funds before transferring that into account of the trust. An associate of Hrishikesh, who connected him to the Jain brothers, has also confessed to the entire transaction, the agency said. Meanwhile, Deshmukh on Saturday wrote to the ED expressing his inability to present himself for questioning. He said, “I am sanguine to expose the falsity, hollowness and lack of substance in the allegation levelled against me.” It is learned that the ED may summon Deshmukh for questioning again next week. It had recorded his partial statement at his residence in Worli on Friday after searching the premises along with his two other residences in Mumbai and Nagpur. In their statements to the ED, Bhujbal and Patil said they had instructions from the then home minister’s office to collect Rs 100 crore from orchestra bar owners and others with the help of Waze for Deshmukh. The ED also recorded the statement of Waze in Taloja jail on June 19, where he said that he got instruction directly from Deshmukh at his official bungalow to collect Rs 3 lakh every month from each of the bar owners in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deshmukh-skips-ed-summons-seeks-time/articleshow/83881105.cms||Vijay V Singh

Even Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub Minar and Red Fort are not witnessing large number of visitors. However, there was a tad increase in the footfall at these monuments on the first Sunday (June 20). After the unlock process began, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had issued a notice on June 14 stating that ticketed monuments would reopen from June 16. But the number of visitors at these monuments in the city is still far from reaching that of the pre-Covid times. On Wednesday, the number of visitors at Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub Minar and Red Fort was just 365, 578 and 87, respectively. “These monuments used to witness thousands of people during pre-Covid times. Even on weekdays, the number of daily visitors used to be high. At least 5,000 people used to visit Humayun’s Tomb alone,” said an ASI official. “With the city getting gradually unlocked and Covid cases on the wane, the number of visitors is expected to increase in the next few days. The low footfall could also be because few tourists and people are travelling to Delhi in the wake of the second wave.” Qutub Minar and Humayun’s Tomb received 1,677 and 1,770 visitors, respectively, on Sunday as against 775 and 991 visitors last Saturday. Red Fort saw the footfall jump from 172 to 285.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-first-week-monuments-see-abysmally-low-footfall/articleshow/83880255.cms||Mohammad Ibrar
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Will quit politics if BJP can’t restore OBC quota in four months, says Devendra Fadnavis||NAGPUR: Launching a scathing attack against Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for “failure” to defend OBC reservation in the local body polls, leader of opposition in assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday challenged its ministers to hand over the reins to BJP so that it can restore the quota within four months. “It’s high time the MVA ministers either restore 27% OBC reservation in all local bodies or step down. If we (BJP) fail to restore the reservation, I will retire from politics,” he said while addressing a large number of protestors at Variety Square during launch of BJP’s statewide Chakka Jam over the issue. Fadnavis was later detained by Sitabuldi police and released after some time. On the other hand, Congress leaders under MLC Abhijeet Wanjari staged protests at Dr Ambedkar Square at Wardhaman Nagar against the BJP-led Central government and blamed it for Supreme Court’s decision to cancel the OBC reservation. Wanjari said similar protests were staged in the entire state on the call given by Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Nana Patole. “In the last 5-6 years, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government has ignored our repeated demands for handing over caste-wise Census data. The British had conducted a caste-wise census in 1931. The BJP was in the government from 2014-19 in the state but never made an effort to get the caste-wise OBC data from the centre,” said Wanjari. Fadnavis, accompanied by BJP city chief Pravin Datke and former state minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, charged MVA ministers with doling out false promises and failing to constitute a backward-class commission for the last 15 months. “While the Supreme Court has asked for empirical data, state leaders are misleading the people that census data is needed. Instead of collecting data, they are blaming the centre for their own failures,” said Fadnavis. The former CM added that while OBC reservation is maintained in the entire country, it was cancelled in Maharashtra only due to apathy of the coalition government. “On the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, who sacrificed his life for betterment of all communities, a decisive battle has been launched today across the state by BJP for OBC reservation. We will force this government to restore reservation and till then the BJP would continue its agitation on the streets,” said Fadnavis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/will-quit-politics-if-bjp-cant-restore-obc-quota-in-4-months-fadnavis/articleshow/83879936.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||India||Farmers intensify 7-month stir, agriculture minister Tomar appeals for talks||NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: As their agitation against the new agri laws completed seven months, farmers tried to march to governors' residence in several states on Saturday even as Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar appealed them to end their stir and offered to resume talks on the provisions of the three legislations. Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions protesting at various Delhi border points, claimed that farmers were detained in states like Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana during the protests. Terming Tomar's recent statements as "perplexing and contradictory", it asserted that farmer leaders are not seeking some "meaningless amendments" in the central farm laws which have "fundamental flaws" and urged the people "to punish the BJP". Security was tightened in the national capital and other cities after the SKM said that representatives of farmers will submit memoranda of their demands, addressed to the President, to governors in various states. Hundreds of farmers from interiors of Uttar Pradesh, many of them on tractors, reached Ghazipur on Delhi's borders to mark the completion of seven months of the protest. Led by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, a group of protesters submitted a memorandum of their demands at the office of DCP Northeast Delhi after a virtual meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. The farmers then called off their march to Delhi, BKU media incharge Dharmendra Malik said. "The memorandum included our demands for the withdrawal of the three new farms laws and for enacting a new law to ensure guarantee for MSP," he said. Farmers from several parts of Haryana gathered at Gurdwara Nada Sahib in Haryana's Panchkula and headed towards Haryana Raj Bhavan, forcing their way through a layer of barricades, but were stopped at the Chandigarh-Panchkula border where the state police had deployed water cannon and trucks. "Where was the need to stop the protestors It was only a matter of handing over a memorandum to the Governor and not allowing even this much is a reflection of the undeclared emergency and authoritarian times we are going through," the SKM said in a statement. Police used water cannon to stop agitating farmers from Punjab, coming from the Mohali side, but they succeeded in entering Chandigarh after breaking through barricades. Farmers from several parts of Punjab had assembled at Gurdwara Amb Sahib in Mohali before moving towards the Punjab Governor house. A majority of the protesters were without masks and were not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. "I want to convey through your (media) that farmers should end their agitation. ....Many are in favour of these new laws across the country. Still, some farmers have any issue with provisions of the laws, Government of India is ready to listen and discuss with them," agriculture minister Tomar tweeted. Addressing the protesters at Mohali, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal Rajewal alleged that the central government intended to "hand over farming" to corporate houses. Carrying flags of unions and raising slogans against the BJP-led government, protesters, including women and youths, marched towards Chandigarh on tractors and other vehicles or walked on foot. They were stopped near sector 17 by police where some buses were parked on the road to prevent protesters from heading towards Punjab Raj Bhavan. Gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, who was booked for his alleged involvement in the violence at the Red Fort on Republic Day during a tractor rally, also participated in the farmers' protests.

Terming the action as “harassment”, opposition parties accused the ruling party of trying to intimidate and influence their zila panchayat members in supporting the rival BJP candidate. The action was based on a complaint lodged by a policeman at Sikandarabad police station. He alleged that the suspects were holding a meeting at a local college flouting social distancing norms. All the 21 accused were detained, bundled in a police van and later released. “At the behest of the UP government, zila panchayat members are being threatened and intimidated by the police and local administration. Their families and children are being harassed by police. This is being done to influence the outcome of the zila panchayat president elections,” claimed Arun Chaudhary, RLD's district unit president in Bulandshahr.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/oppn-cries-foul-as-21-zila-panchayat-members-supporters-booked-for-violating-covid-protocol/articleshow/83877816.cms||---

In the wake of dubious vaccination drives held at multiple venues in the city, though, experts have raised concerns over how the biomedical waste generated from these places may have been disposed and said authorities must conduct an audit. Biomedical waste includes infectious material such as syringes, scalpels, broken glass, sanitary napkins, swabs, gloves, face masks and personal protective equipment (PPEs) worn by doctors, health workers, sanitation and solid waste management staff and even community health workers involved in Covid-related works. A civic official said following the second wave, a large quantum of biomedical waste was generated in hospitals or Covid care centres and now more of it is coming out of vaccination centres. “While the increase in biomedical waste from vaccination centres may be meagre, it is important as this waste was not being generated previously. In locations where there are large vaccination drives held over a span of a few days, the local ward is informed about collecting the waste regularly and ensuring there is no pileup,” said the official. Dr Lata Ghanshamnani from the NGO Rnisarg Foundation, who has been working in the waste management space, said, “There should be an audit done of how much waste is generated at the vaccination centres, considering vaccination drives are taking place at numerous places across the city. This was also help ensure that there is no pilferage taking place that could eventually lead to such kind of suspicious vaccination drives.” Meanwhile, Rajkumar Sharma, chairman of the Chembur-based advanced locality management and networking action committee (ALMANAC) and a member of a six-member court-appointed committee to monitor and improve conditions at Deonar dumping ground, also said there are high chances of waste at dubious vaccination drives being mishandled. “Also, there are high chances of biomedical waste like masks getting mixed with regular solid waste. A large number of people were home-quarantined and infected waste like unwashed and unsanitized masks may be added to regular solid waste and reach dumping grounds. Hence, I insist there is a need to vaccinate everyone at the dumping ground,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-biomed-waste-reduces-in-city-as-second-wave-ebbs/articleshow/83881122.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Kochi||Stadiums in Kochi remain eyesores||KOCHI: Sporting and other recreational activities may be resumed once the Covid cases dip, still various stadiums in Kochi have been remaining ill-maintained for the past several months. Though it is an apt time for renovating stadiums and playgrounds, the authorities are not taking any initiative in this regard. As the stadia remain closed for several months due to restrictions as part of Covid control measures, it is easy for the authorities to carry out the renovation works. “Condition of almost all the stadia in the city is very pathetic. Authorities pay least attention for renovating or maintaining playgrounds or stadia,” said former mayor K J Sohan. “As per the town planning norms, there should be at least 15% open space in a city. In the modern cities like Delhi, it is around 25%. At the same time, the extent of open space in Kochi is less than a meagre one percent,” Sohan said. “The authorities fail to maintain even the existing facilities. Ambedkar stadium near KSRTC bus station is one of the playgrounds which could be used by the youth. The condition of the stadium is very pathetic now. Veli stadium and Fort Kochi Parade Ground have been closed for the public for years. Santacruz stadium at Fort Kochi has been reduced to be a place to store the equipment of the contractor who carries out works of a development agency in Kochi,” Sohan said. The government had pumped in crores of rupees for the renovation of Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium at Kaloor, which was the main venue of Fifa U-17 World Cup held in Kerala in 2017. Funds had been allotted for the renovation of practice grounds like Maharaja’s College Stadium, Fort Kochi Veli, Parade ground, KSSC ground at Panampilly Nagar and Ambedkar stadium also. Still, all these stadia or playgrounds are in a dilapidated condition “The turf prepared for Fifa U-17 in Maharaja’s College ground has become a liability for the college now. To water the turf, the college authorities have to shell out Rs 15,000 a month,” said CICC Jayachandran, member of College Development Council. “The synthetic track at the college ground is in a dilapidated condition. Going by a rough estimate, it will require at least Rs 3 crore for renovating the synthetic track,” Jayachandran said. T J Vinod, MLA, said that he has submitted a memorandum to sports minister V Abdurahiman demanding immediate measures to renovate Maharaja’s College ground and Ambedkar stadium. “The hockey ground in Maharaja’s College ground is in very bad condition. When 16 cents was handed over to KMRL for the construction of Metro station years ago, the Metro agency had promised to develop a hockey ground of international standards in Maharaja’s College ground. The land worth crores of rupees was handed for Metro station free of cost. Now, the Metro authorities have backtracked from the promise,” Vinod said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/stadiums-in-kochi-remain-eyesores/articleshow/83878886.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Ranchi||Ranchi admin floats complaint numbers to report arbitrary fee hike by schools||RANCHI: The district administration has set up control room to receive complaints from individuals and associations regarding fee hike by schools in violation of the Jharkhand Education Tribunal (JET) guidelines. The administration issued a landline number — 0651-2213718 — and a mobile phone number —9304306945 and said people can send complaints through e-mails too. The decision was taken after the Jharkhand Parents Association (JPA) voiced its concerns over the fee hike by private schools of Ranchi in violation of JET norms. JET norms mandate schools to form a committee at their level for considering fee hikes. The committee should have representatives from the parents as well. A person can approach the district level committee chaired by the deputy commissioner if he or she has a grievance. Notably, Ranchi district on Friday formed the committee under JET with the deputy commissioner as the chairman, deputy education officer and district superintendent of education (DSE) as member secretaries and district transport officer as member. A chartered accountant and two principals of private schools are also its members. DSE Kamla Singh said, “The entire process of registering complaints and taking follow up action would start working smoothly from Monday. The committee will inquire into the complaints and reach a decision within 60 days.” According to JET rules, schools may be asked to pay fines ranging from Rs 50,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh for first offence. Earlier, JPA had met education secretary Rajesh Sharma and Ranchi DC Chhavi Ranjan and submitted a list of 17 schools which increased their fees in Ranchi. JPA president Ajay Rai said, “We would continue our agitation for formation of committees in other districts as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-admin-floats-complaint-numbers-to-report-arbitrary-fee-hike-by-schools/articleshow/83879307.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Man beats Covid after 85% lung damage, 2-month hospital struggle||RANCHI: Purushottam Kumar, 34, had never thought that he will have to spend more than two months in hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19 on April 22. But as he suffered hard realities, Kumar gave up his thoughts to return to his family where his wife and two young sons are waiting. Doctors at the district hospital here diagnosed him with 85% lung damage and Kumar had experienced near-death experience thrice at the hospital. Now, he is declared Covid-free and discharged from the hospital on Saturday. Thanking the collective effort of the team of doctors at Ranchi sadar hospital, Kumar said if it wasn’t for the support and care of the doctors and medical staff of the hospital, he wouldn’t have made it. “I did not have money to afford a costly and prolonged treatment at a private hospital. In fact, I was not prepared for a situation like this. It is because of the Ranchi district hospital that I have been blessed with a second chance in life.” According to hospital sources Kumar, a native of Nawada in Bihar, was admitted to a city-based private hospital here on April 30 after being referred by doctors from Nawada. His condition was already critical when he reached Ranchi with a CO-RADS (Covid-19 Reporting and Data System) score of 17/25 (The higher the score, the worse is the lung damage). He got a bed at the district hospital on May 2. Kumar was treated by a medical team of doctors, which included anaesthetists Dr Pankaj and Dr Neeraj along with Dr Anshuman, Dr Rajkumar, Dr Pavan and Dr Ajit who monitored his health throughout his stay. “One week after Kumar’s admission, we had come across a situation where he had started gasping for breath in the early hours and we had to manage him remotely by instructing the duty doctor over the phone,” said one of the doctors who treated him. Talking to TOI, Dr Pavan said, “We discharged the patient only after his CO-RADS score came below 12/25 and after consulting a pulmonologist.” Dr Ajit added, “We started administering him Remdesivir along with other medication. In the meantime, we had to shift him to non-invasive ventilation support as his condition deteriorated. I am very delighted at his recovery and the credit goes to ventilator technicians Nandini, Gunja and Vinita who used to monitor him overnight on several days.” Nandini said: “There were times when we thought that we would lose the patient but it was his will power and co-operation that he survived even after being put on invasive ventilator support thrice. After his situation started improving, we also assisted him in physiotherapy so that he could recover fast.” Professor of the critical care and head of Rims trauma centre, Dr Pradip Bhhatacharya, said the Covid-19 virus damages the lungs immediately after infecting an individual and the path to recovery varies from person to person. “Basically, it is only damage-control process as soon after a patient gets infected The lungs are damaged in the first five days of the infection and we work on rebuilding it with medication as well as various kinds of support like invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Many a time, patients with low immunity succumb to the infection. However, the patient, in this case, was comparatively young and his body responded well to the treatment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/man-beats-cov-after-85-lung-damage-2-mnth-hosp-struggle/articleshow/83879344.cms||Gaurav Pandey

On Saturday, Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), which represents hotels and restaurants, besides the entrepreneurs and traders, wrote to chief minister Hemant Soren to lift the curbs imposed on eateries. At present, dining at eateries is prohibited and only takeaways are allowed and commercial establishments are allowed to operate till 4pm from Monday to Saturday. Urging the CM to extend business hours till 8pm, SCCI functionary Vijay Anand Moonka said, “Seeing how the situation is getting worse for businessmen, we have asked the government to allow banquet halls to host social events. Restaurants should be allowed to entertain customers at 50% capacity and hotels should be allowed to host wedding ceremonies with 100 guests.” The Jamshedpur Hoteliers Association (JHA) questioned the logic behind allowing malls to reopen when hotels are shut. “Treat us at par with other industries,” hotelier and ex-president of JHA Anil Khemka said. He gave the examples of Delhi and Mumbai where hotels were given the green signal to reopen with SOPs intact even though the two cities reported a high number of Covid cases. There are around 100 hotels and 500 plus restaurants in the city, according to industry insiders. Khemka claimed that industry assessment has pegged a loss of over Rs 300 crore in the past 15 months by conservative estimates but the actual loss will be much more. He urged the government to consider waiving property tax and give discounts on the fixed charge on electricity bills to help revive the industry. “Two back-to-back shutdowns forced hundreds of workers associated with the industry to either venture into other sectors to look for jobs or sit at home without any work,” Wave International’s proprietor Raja Singh said. The Confederation of All India Traders’ national secretary, Suresh Sonthalia, said the state government should sympathise with the hotel industry as it reopening eateries will augur well for sectors like business travel, food and beverages and others linked to the industry. “The hotel and restaurant industry doesn’t function in isolation. Until all the components of the travel and tourism sector open up, business is unlikely to improve,” Mithlesh Jha, who is the director of Kannellite Hotel which is a unit of Jharkhand Tourism Development Corporation, said. Jha added that the hospitality sector will flourish when banquet halls are reopened up for social events and when in-demand trains like Steel express, Ispat express and Shatabdi express resume service between Howrah and Tatanagar and corporate travel picks up pace in Steel City. Madhuban hotel’s manager Anurag Chaurasia said SMEs in Adityapur have not resumed production on a large-scale due to which the number of businessmen travelling to the city is low. “Presently, the room occupancy in several hotels in Jamshedpur and Adityapur is not more than 5% of their total capacity,” he said. He added, “Takeaways account for only 20% of the business. In such a situation, how can the hotels survive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-ravaged-eateries-desperate-to-unlock-gates-seek-govt-help/articleshow/83879237.cms||B Sridhar

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: 155 granite quarries booked in Prakasam||VIJAYAWADA: After a month-long inspection of granite mining businesses in Prakasam district, vigilance officials found several irregularities in 155 quarries. Officials found that majority of these quarries have failed to pay royalties to the government, causing a loss of over Rs 1,000 crore to the exchequer. Vigilance officials also raided granite factories and polishing units in the district and found that GSTs and royalties to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore was evaded. So far, a fine of Rs 3,527 crore has been calculated and would be imposed on the 155 businesses. Sources said the role of officials within the mining department is also being investigated. “For each stone that is being sold, the businesses have to give royalty to the government. Most of them have not done so for the past five years, causing huge losses to the exchequer,” a regional vigilance official told TOI. Officials have booked about 100 cases against the owners of the quarry businesses across Chimakurthy, Gundlapalli growth centre, Martur and Ballikurava areas in the district. Prakasam district, which boasts of AP’s largest granite industry, yields Rs 2,000 crore per annum from around 3,000 small and medium-scale industries and affiliated units. Officials said they would prepare a detailed report on the tax evasion and submit necessary recommendations to the vigilance headquarters. On the other hand, business owners say that they too struggled during the Covid-19 pandemic with the production coming to a halt after the construction sector took a hit. They said they had to pay their direct and indirect employees with almost no revenue in hand for several months. Some of the business owners stated that they would move the high court seeking justice. This is not the first time that the state government has acted against granite businesses. Earlier, the granite business licence of Addanki MLA Gottipati Ravi Kumar and former MLA Potula Rama Rao was cancelled citing defects in the operation of quarries in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/155-granite-quarries-booked-in-prakasam/articleshow/83878040.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

The incident took place at the tribal hamlet of Marypadu under Salur mandal in Vizianagaram district on Saturday. The woman, Pottangi Parvathi, developed labour pains early morning Saturday. Owing to the lack of road connectivity to the hamlet where she lived, her family decided to make a stretcher out of clothes and carry her on their shoulders for three kilometres to a vehicle near Tadilova village. From there, the vehicle took Parvathi to the primary health centre (PHC) at Baguvalasa. Parvathi gave birth to a baby boy later in the morning. Both mother and son are doing fine. Parvathi’s husband and other family members said that owing to the lack of roads, they had no other option but to carry her like a bundle. This is not the first time that people have had to be carried in ‘dolis’ to hospitals or PHCs in north Andhra Pradesh. Only a few days ago, a woman named Sukuru Somulamma of Onukonda village in Anantagiri mandal had to be carried in a ‘doli’ for nearly seven kilometres in order to avail treatment. More than 10 such incidents have been reported only over the last few years. CPI(M) leader K Samba Murthy said that successive governments have failed to create basic infrastructure in tribal pockets of northern Andhra. Locals and activists demand that authorities take steps to provide road connectivity to the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pregnant-woman-carried-in-doli-for-3-kms-on-her-way-to-give-birth/articleshow/83878049.cms||Nalla.Babu

It also showed that 1 in 14 students surveyed had used some substance in the preceding month. While overall substance use was around 10.3%, substance wise break-up on use over one year showed that 4% used tobacco, followed by alcohol (3.8%), opioids 2.8% (opium, heroin and pharmaceutical opioids), Cannabis (Bhang, Charas and Ganja) by 2% and inhalants (1.9%). This data is part of a study on substance abuse among school students, conducted by the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, of All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Dr Anju Dhawan, Professor, NDDTC and department of psychiatry AIIMS, said the data show that the prevalence of use of opioids, particularly pharmaceutical opioids, is high. She emphasised that schools have a big role in identifying and referring children to counsellors. The study was done to understand varied concerns and measures required to address the problem. Even younger children need attention as is evident from the data which show the average age of initiation for any substance as 13 years. The age of initiation was lowest for inhalants at 11 years while it was 12 years for pharmaceutical opioids. Sharing some of the findings of the study during an online event to mark the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, observed on June 26, Dr Dhawan said experimentation associated with continued use was seen in a significant number of students who had ever used a substance in the preceding one year. The survey was carried out in Srinagar, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Ranchi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Imphal, Dibrugarh and Delhi. The students surveyed included 52% boys and 48% girls from both government and private schools. The data draw attention to risk factors that increase vulnerability of students. Around 40% of the students surveyed had seen at least one family member using tobacco or alcohol. Around 5% students said they had seen a family member use Cannabis- bhang or ganja and 2% reported that they had seen a family member using heroin. Also nearly 1/4th students surveyed reported conflicts in the family and a similar number reported psychological concerns, ranging from emotional and behaviour-related issues to inattentiveness, hyperactivity and relationships with peers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/study-over-10-of-class-8-12-students-have-used-drugs/articleshow/83885335.cms||Ambika Pandit

More and more people have taken to using cannabis or abusing pharmaceutical drugs. This in turn has driven up drug trafficking in the state and accelerated some trafficking patterns and introducing home delivery of substances such as cannabis in small quantities directly to end-consumers. Mental health experts say that many youngsters have grown addicted to drugs and alcohol due to the pandemic. Speaking to TOI, Dr Uma Mahendra Raj of Green Valley Foundation, which deals with patients addicted to substance abuse, said that the pandemic has created conditions that have made people more susceptible to drug use. Some people who had given up their addictions have relapsed and many people took up drugs in this period. “We observed that some people who had a lot of free time or some who were mourning the death of a loved one, finally opted for drugs. Despite being aware of the consequences of drug abuse, youngsters are taking up such drugs,” she said. According to the Magnitude of Substance Abuse in India (2019) report published by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment, around 0.2% people in Andhra Pradesh use illegal cannabis products. Further, Visakhapatnam emerged as a region that supplied marijuana to every part of the country. Noted psychiatrist NN Raju says that the waves of Covid-19 pandemic have created an atmosphere of fear. People are afraid of losing their loved ones or their livelihoods. Youngsters have more free time to themselves. This has given rise to anxiety and depression and caused people to get addicted to ganja, alcohol and sedative drugs. Mental health professionals further say that more people are approaching them for help than ever before. Most are seeking consultation to deal with deaths in the family and continual stress. Awareness, counselling and strong human relationships can help people overcome drug use, they say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/depression-grief-caused-by-pandemic-make-many-susceptible-to-drug-abuse/articleshow/83878058.cms||Nalla.Babu

Currently, the state-level 104 call centre is working with 100 personnel per shift while district-level call centres are working with 10 personnel per shift. Now, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) and the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) have been directed to establish a five-seater 104 call centre with five executives per shift. The call centres will be required to have two dedicated landline connections, five computers with internet and mobile connections to five executives. Guntur, Rajahmundry, Kurnool and Tirupati municipal corporations have been asked to establish call centres with four executives per shift while other municipal corporations have been asked to run call centres with three executives per shift. All municipalities and mandals have been tasked with running the call centres with two executives per shift. Concerned call centres are required to attend to Covid-19 related requests within their jurisdiction and arrange for admission to Covid-19 hospitals or Covid care centres. Further, if the daily case positivity rate crosses the 5% range, they shall immediately engage vehicles for pickup of patients to admit them into hospitals or CCCs. According to the health officials, the number of daily calls received by the state-level 104 call centre has significantly dropped in the last four weeks. The centre used to receive 15,000 to 18,000 calls a day during the peak of the second wave in May. But the centre got only 1,021 calls on June 25, Friday. Reduced queries could be a clear indicator of the improving situation in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/health-dept-extends-104-services-to-ulbs/articleshow/83878085.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

---||Vijayawada||Bhavani island gets ready for a makeover in Vijayawada||VIJAYAWADA: The state government is planning to develop Bhavani Island located in the middle of river Krishna in the city. The Island, which is spread over 136 acres, gives a beautiful view from Prakasam Barrage and Kanakadurga temple. Successive governments have made several provisions on this land to attract tourists over the years. They have also arranged boating from Bhavanipuram to reach the Island. Though it was planned to give to private in the past, in 1990s, the attempts were thwarted by the political parties. After bifurcation, the government had planned entertainment both in the Island and on the river, which included boat riding. Now, this government has proposed more facilities to entertain visitors, which include joy ride, rope way, besides restaurants. The guest rooms built in the past are not in use now due to neglect by the officials over the years. The floods in 2009 and 2019 have caused severe damage to the infrastructure in the Island, which require immediate restoration. Though rope ways were planned from Gandhi Hill, Kanakadurga Hill and the Sitanagaram Hill, in the past, the proposals could not move out of the papers. The Sitanagaram Hill on Guntur side of the Prakasam Barrage was planned with Buddha project in the past, but was discarded due to change of governments and officers. The state government on Friday, had issued a GO, authorising the Executive Director of the Bhavani Island Tourism Corporation (BITC) to take steps to improve and add facilities to attract tourists. The government had cleared the proposal to have water park, fish aquarium, sky restaurant, elevated toy train and rope way. The government had directed the BITC to call for Expression of Interest (EoI) from interested parties to develop these facilities. “The project would take at least two years to provide the amenities and start entertaining the visitors,” said a senior officer, while responding to the orders issued by the government to float EoI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bhavani-island-gets-ready-for-a-makeover/articleshow/83878170.cms||Gopi Dara

Already, the total tax incidence on import of oranges at present is over 92%, which is very high considering an essential food item, especially during Covid-19.”The association has submitted a memorandum to various authorities including union roads and highways minister Nitin Gadkari, who was instrumental in restarting transport of oranges by railways. Secretary Ramesh Jichkar met Gadkari and highlighted the problem. Jichkar said, “Nagpur and Amravati divisions together produce 7 lakh MT oranges on 1.26 lakh hectares. Of this, Bangladesh alone imports 25% of the produce, and the rest of the stock is supplied to Indian markets. If the import duty is hiked it will put an additional burden of Rs100 crore on traders.”Jichkar added that export of one truckload of orange (25tonnes) to Bangladesh costs Rs8.50 lakh. “It includes the cost of labour, packaging, transport and duties. After the hike in import duty, this cost will go up to Rs10 lakh. During season daily 250 truckloads of oranges are transported to Bangladesh,” said Jichkar.Gadkari has asked railway minister Piyush Goyal, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Vikram Doraiswami to look into the matter.Vice-president of the association, Taj Khan, said, “Warud is the biggest supplier of oranges to Bangladesh and the volume of trade is growing historically. The demand for oranges has increased due to Covid-19 as it is a big source of Vitamin C. The hike in import duty will leave the farmers and traders high and dry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/orange-traders-plead-with-centre-as-bangladesh-hikes-import-duty/articleshow/83880460.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||India||Airbags must for front seat passengers from Dec 1||NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has deferred the mandatory installation of airbags for front seat passengers in the existing car models by four months. Now the car manufacturers will have to comply with the norms from December 31. However, the mandatory condition for new models of cars, which was rolled out this year, has kicked in from April1. Sources said the relaxation has been made considering the pandemic situation since the manufacturers need to make some changes in their production line. In another move, the ministry has allowed increase in the height of heavy goods carrying vehicles to 4.75 metres only for transporting “indivisible load”, which will come as a big relief for transport of steel and glass. However, S P Singh, senior fellow of IFTRT, a Delhi-based think tank on transport issues said: “The definition of indivisible load is vague and this provision can be misused by transporters. On the one hand we are talking about reducing road deaths and on the other we are taking steps which have the potential to compromise road safety.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/airbags-must-for-front-seat-passengers-from-dec-1/articleshow/83885358.cms||Dipak K Dash

Sonekar got injured after jumping from the second floor when the woman raised an alarm. It’s learnt that the woman was alone when Sonekar had gone to the second floor and peeped inside her room. The startled woman had raised an alarm and chased him till the ground floor before intercepting him with the help of neighbours. Sonekar, a labourer who worked at Koradi thermal power station, was warned by the woman and neighbours before let off. Senior inspector Krishna Shinde of Koradi police station said there was no intimation to the police after the first incident. “The FIR was filed immediately after the incident was reported. The accused is recuperating at hospital from injuries sustained while attempting to flee,” he said. It’s learnt that Sonekar, under influence of liquor, had gone back to the woman’s house and barged inside the room as soon as she had opened the door after responding to the doorbell. He had tried to strangle her but she managed to free herself and raise an alarm. Sonekar sneaked out of the room and jumped from the second floor, fracturing his leg and also sustaining injuries.

While the Kanpur police commissioner tendered an apology, President Kovind and his wife, Savita Kovind, have sent condolence messages to the victim’s family. Vandana Mishra (50) died on the way to hospital after her car was stopped for the President’s train. Vandana Mishra (50), the head of the women’s wing of Indian Industries Association (Kanpur chapter), who had recovered from Covid-19 about one-and-a-half months ago, was being rushed to a hospital after she complained of uneasiness on Friday. When their car reached Govindpuri flyover, traffic had been stopped for special train to pass. Her family members claimed that they pleaded with police deployed at the bridge, but they didn’t relent. The car was able to move only after the President’s special train had passed. By then Vandana had become breathless and was declared dead by doctors on reaching hospital. Her last rites were performed on Saturday.DM Alok Tiwari, police commissioner Aseem Kumar Arun and DCP South Raveena Tyagi attended the cremation. Kovind’s wife, Savita Kovind, told administration and police officials that such a situation shouldn’t recur.

---||Kolkata||Dreams crushed, earnings lost as India’s football Mecca falls silent||KOLKATA: Monsoon is the peak season at the Mecca of Indian football, but the grounds across Kolkata Maidan lie vacant, waiting for players to return to the rain-drenched, open fields where the game has been played for more than a century but has now come to a complete Covid-induced halt. With the football season suspended for two successive years, the entire sporting ecosystem of the Maidan has collapsed leaving all stake-holders — players, coaches, referees groundsmen, gardeners and club staffers — without earnings, forcing many to switch to other jobs. Sujoy Oraw (22), who has played for United FC, Pathachakra and Shyamnagar Tarun Sangha, now drives an ambulance, carrying Covid and non-Covid patients. “There have been no major club tournaments. Even the local tournaments have been called off. As a footballer, I would earn around Rs, 10,000 every month. Now, I barely make Rs 6,000 as an ambulance driver,” said Oraw. East Bengal junior team midfielder Bijoy Mondal’s dream of making it to the senior team was shattered when the pandemic hit. Soon after being considered for the senior reserve team, the 22-year-old’s appointment was put on hold. “I have been sitting at home for over a year now. With no income from the game, I have started working at a tannery in Bantala for Rs 2,000 a week,” said Mondal, a Baruipur resident. The story is similar for defender Somnath Dey, who had captained the under-18 United FC team. Since last year he has been stuck at home and has now given up his morning training sessions to work at a fish market. “My mother used to work at a beauty parlour which is shut for two months. I had no option but to start working at the fish market,”said Dey. Across divisions, all football matches were suspended in March 2020 only to resume in the latter half of the year but was suspended again this year when the second wave struck. It has left more than two lakh footballers, 3,000-odd coaches and 250 referees idle. Most have not been paid their fees since last year leaving them struggling to make ends meet. The situation has been tough even for established footballers like Tonmoy Ghosh who has represented the national Under-17 team and senior teams of Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, Mohammedan and TRAU FC for the last 12 years. “I am the sole earning member of the family but with no income for the past several months, I am on the verge of bankruptcy. But I haven’t lost hope yet and am still continuing to practice hoping games would begin soon and I would also get a new signing this season,” said Ghosh. National referee Tanmoy Dhar, who has been officiating in the I-league for nine years and ISL for five years other than officiating at SAAF games matches for India. A resident of Nimta, Dhar, after sitting at home without any games for months, now works part-time at a digital content creation firm and a garments shop in Ultadanga. “I don’t know where my career is heading now. All I know is that I badly need a decent job to sustain my family,” said Dhar. Veteran coach Shiben Sarkar, who has been coaching at the Maidan for the last 22 years and has been the head coach of three clubs in Kolkata is now seeking help from his students and club officials to make ends meet. “The situation is so bad that I don’t know if I will have enough money to buy vegetables tomorrow. I am practically surviving on charities,” said Sarkar, a resident of Belghoria. Although the IFA shield was conducted last year, the Calcutta Football League couldn’t be held. Although the IFA is still confident of doing it this year, it all depends on how the third wave of the pandemic behaves this year. Club officials admit that with the future of the Kolkata tournaments uncertain and players from suburbs finding it difficult to attend coaching sessions in the city due to the suspension of train services, the entire system has got disrupted. “Not only players, everyone associated with the game, from the players, to coaches to the security guards of club tents are feeling the pinch. We are trying to help them in whatever means possible,” said IFA general secretary Joydeep Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dreams-crushed-earnings-lost-as-indias-football-mecca-falls-silent/articleshow/83880203.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Civil Hospital mum over Covid discharge, death figures||AHMEDABAD: The Civil Hospital has remained silent on the aspect of discharges of Covid-19 patients and deaths that occurred since January 2021, when an RTI query sought details on corona patients. The public information officer and medical record officer of the Civil Hospital, Asarwa was to provide the information on how many Covid-19 patients were admitted and discharged since March 2020, when the first patient was admitted in the hospital in Gujarat. In May, a consumer rights activist Suchitra Paul had filed a an application under the provisions of Right to Information Act and sought details about Covid patients in three parts. Paul had sought to know how many Covid-19 patients were admitted between March and December 2020 and what was the figure of admissions since January 2021. She had also questioned about the number of discharges that took place since March 2020 and how many deaths took place. In reply, the PIO replied that there were 20,273 patients admitted in the Civil Hospital for Covid-19 treatment between March and December 2020. There were 10,404 Covid patients who were admitted for treatment between January and April 2021. But the PIL did not disclose the figures of the patients discharged and of those who died during treatment. Instead, the reply reads, “No other information is required to be parted with.” The applicant said that she planned to file an appeal against non-disclosure of figures of discharges and deaths. Two weeks ago, the Institute of Kidney Diseases & Research Centre (IKDRC), located in the Civil Hospital campus, supplied information to an RTI query on admission, discharge and death of patients in three different time periods. The details furnished were curious as it said that IKDRC has cured more patients than those admitted in the centre for treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/civil-hospital-mum-over-covid-discharge-death-figures/articleshow/83879558.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata doctors welcome jab nod for pregnant women||KOLKATA: With a significant number of pregnant women getting Covid pneumonia during the second wave, and an increasing number of them falling prey to the virus, city doctors believe allowing them to take the vaccine will ensure reasonable protection. “We knew this was just a matter of time because we had put up a very strong advocacy on the need to vaccinate these women, citing that the benefits largely outweigh the theoretical risks. We welcome this policy change,” said Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) vice-president Basab Mukherjee, a gynaecologist. FOGSI had been lobbying with the health ministry to allow the jab for pregnant women even though they had not been part of any clinical trial. “The number of pregnant women infected with severe Covid in the second wave has been much higher than in the first wave and there have been some deaths as well. So, when the government said yes to inoculating new mothers, we started looking forward to the inclusion of pregnant women,” said Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society’s Bhaskar Pal. Doctors said it is a challenge to manage a pregnant Covid patient. For example, a 31-year-old whose oxygen saturation level had gone down could not be proned or made to lie on her chest as she was 33 weeks pregnant. She died the day after an emergency C-section and the baby is still in NICU. In another case, a 35-year-old in the 34th week of pregnancy with severe Covid infection died at a private hospital after an emergency C-section. “A pregnant woman is three times more at risk of severe infection than others,” said Mukherjee. The health ministry has also said that each pregnant woman coming to take the shot should be explained the likely adverse reactions and that it has not been established if the vaccine is safe for the foetus. “We have seen mothers with severe Covid pneumonia during the second wave needing emergency C-sections, leading to the birth of preterm babies. Women should take vaccines during the early part of pregnancy under the supervision of a gynaecologist,” said Fortis Hospital paediatrician Rajesh Kumar Singh. Doctors assured that the vaccine is safe for expecting mothers and there is an eagerness among them to take the jab. “We are waiting for written guideline,” said Pal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-doctors-welcome-jab-nod-for-pregnant-women/articleshow/83878620.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||West Bengal government sets down rules for holding offsite Covid vaccination camps||KOLKATA: The state health department has issued an SOP to tighten the vigil on off-site vaccination centres following the busting of a fake camp at Kasba in south Kolkata. The chief medical health officer (CMHO) of Kolkata Municipal Corporation has been directed to monitor all vaccination sites in the city. Also, all vaccination centres of private hospitals holding offsite camps have to submit a joint application along with the organisation it has tied up with to the state health department. “The location, date, time, source of vaccine and its type has to be mentioned in the application,” stated the SOP issued on Saturday. Local clubs/organisations and corporate houses that wish to host vaccination camps with a private hospital will have to apply to the district family welfare officer with a copy of the agreement letter between the two parties. For districts, the application has to be made to the CMOH. An officer will then visit the proposed site and submit the report, based on which the district family welfare officer (DFWO) or CMOH will grant permission for the off-site CVC. Thereafter, permission has to be sought from the local police station and the approval letters displayed at the CVC along with the CoWin authenticated code for the site. Private CVCs will also have to explain how the vials will be transported from their cold chain points to the camp site. While the drive has to be conducted through the Co-Win portal, CVCs have also been asked to use the state government’s recently launched Covid vaccination related app (CVR) for better management at the site. “At the end of the session, a performance report has to be submitted to the local health authority,” the SOP stated. While a private hospital CVC of one district can tie up with a local CVC or an organisation in another district to hold camps, both parties have to jointly submit an application to the state family welfare officer in Kolkata and CMHO elsewhere. Till now, only the hospital needed to apply for permission. Once the nod comes through, Swasthya Bhawan will create the vaccination site on CoWin and share the login ID and password with the private CVC so that entries of those vaccinated can be made in the portal and vaccine certificates can be issued. Private CVCs have been asked to mandatorily assign a nodal officer who will be the point of contact between the CVC and the health department. They must maintain a dynamic inventory of vaccine disclosing the source, mechanism for maintaining clod chain, daily consumption and report this via a Google spreadsheet. Private CVCs must also submit a list of people who have completed the second dose during the week by every Sunday and a lost of those who failed to take their second dose on due time. The private CVCs have also been told to cooperate in case of a visit by health officials to inspect the CVC. In case of non-compliance the department will revoke the permission to run the CVC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-sets-down-rules-for-holding-offsite-covid-vaccination-camps/articleshow/83880220.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The balancing act is leaving the future of the beleaguered country in suspense, even as rampaging Taliban fighters are reported to be overrunning major towns and districts across the country without much of a fight from US-backed Afghan national forces. Some analysts have said all of Afghanistan, including Kabul, could fall to Taliban in less than a year. “Our troops may be leaving but support for Afghanistan is not ending,” Biden said during a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, insisting that the partnership between Kabul and Washington is going to be sustained. Calling for an end to senseless violence, he however said Afghans “are going to have to decide their future, what they want”. Shorn of nuances and platitudes, the meeting’s outcome suggested Biden is not inclined to rethink the decision to complete the American pullout by September 11. But he committed to offer “security assistance, as well as diplomatic and humanitarian aid” to protect US interests, equities, and allies in the country, saying, “we’re going to stick with you and we’re going to do our best to see to it you have the tools you need.” Ghani, on his part, said he respects Biden’s decision to withdraw, while acknowledging that “our course is to manage the consequences and to ensure that the people of Afghanistan rise to the challenge”, a tacit admission that Afghanistan is on its own. “We are satisfied that this decision has been taken in the spirit in which it was offered, which is not abandonment of Afghanistan. This is a new chapter in our relationship,” he said, putting the best spin on the American decision to cut its losses in what the White House acknowledged is not a “winnable war”. Ghani, in fact, invoked the US Civil War to describe the ebb and flow of the struggle in Afghanistan, even as his aides claimed Afghan forces had retaken six districts ceded to Taliban. Afghans, he said, are “rallying to the defence of the republic... It’s a choice of values, the values of an exclusionary system or an inclusionary system. We are determined to have unity, national sense of sacrifice and will not spare anything”, amid reports that Kabul is commandeering pro-government militias to take on Taliban. US will be holding its breath over the next several months to see if its $ 3.3 billion security assistance and a combination of Afghan forces, pro-government militias, and western security contractors is enough to deter Taliban. US’ own assessment is the threat of al-Qaida and the IS — which US sees as a great threat than the distant Taliban, although the latter hosted al-Qaida in the1990s — has been diminished and they are unlikely to be reconstituted soon||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-pledges-sustained-help-to-afghanistan/articleshow/83885503.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

It was the 12th such surgery done by the department within its limited means. The transplant was performed on a 41-year-old Lucknow resident, who was suffering from liver cirrhosis. As he could not have survived without a transplant, the man’s 33-year-old wife agreed to donate the organ. A team of doctors, including surgeons of the surgical gastroenterology department and experts of the anesthesia department, performed the 12-hour operation. Both the donor and recipient are doing fine, said a senior professor part of the team. “The patient came to us six months ago with end stage liver cirrhosis. All the Covid precautions were followed while transplanting the liver,” he added. Normally, a liver transplant costs around Rs 30 lakh at a private hospital, while the expenses at KGMU is around Rs 8 lakh. However, on Saturday, the patient was operated free of cost under ‘Asadhya Rog Yojana’. Doctors also arranged money and drugs for the patients through charity Kin of the patient said the government should extend more support to surgical gastroenterology department of KGMU, which has the potential of developing into a leading facility for underprivileged This was the 12th liver transplant at KGMU since March 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/woman-donates-liver-to-save-hubby-in-lucknow/articleshow/83885528.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||World||Ex-cop Chauvin gets 22.5 years in prison for Floyd’s murder||MINNEAPOLIS: Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced on Friday to 22 1/2 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd, whose dying gasps under Chauvin’s knee led to the biggest outcry against racial injustice in the US in generations. The punishment — which came after Chauvin broke his year-long silence to offer condolences to the Floyd family and express hope that they eventually have “some peace of mind” — is one of the longest prison terms ever imposed on a US police officer in the killing of a black person. Still, Floyd family members and others were disappointed. The sentence fell short of the 30 years prosecutors had requested. And with good behaviour, Chauvin, 45, could get out on parole after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years. “Just because it’s the most time doesn’t mean it’s enough time,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a protest leader. Judge Peter Cahill went beyond the121/2-year sentence prescribed under state guidelines, citing Chauvin’s “abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty” shown to Floyd. Floyd family attorney Ben Crump said the family had gotten “some measure of accountability” but is hoping Chauvin gets the maximum at his upcoming federal civil rights trial. Crump said this was the longest sentence a police officer has ever received in Minnesota. But he added: “Real justice in America will be black men and black women and people of colour who will not have to fear being killed by the police just because the colour of their skin.” Bystander video of Floyd’s arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store prompted protests around the world. On Friday, Chauvin, who did not testify at his trial, removed his mask and turned toward the Floyd family, speaking only briefly because of what he called “some additional legal matters at hand” — an apparent reference to the federal civil rights trial, where his words could be used against him. “I want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There’s going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest. And I hope things will give you some peace of mind,” he said without further explanation.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Defection hits BJP in Raiganj rural body||RAIGANJ: A panchayat in Raiganj, North Dinajpur, went from saffron to green overnight, clearly indicating that the Trinamool Congress’ victory in the assembly polls had prompted a reverse flow in north Bengal where, ironically, the BJP had outdone the TMC in many seats. Pradhan Jamuna Barman of BJP-run Kamalabari gram panchayat, in an affidavit to the BDO on Friday, switched to Trinamool along with two other members — Dasarath Roy and Banifas Kerketta — turning the saffron party into a minority in the rural body. The BJP had bagged nine of the 13 gram panchayat seats while the Trinamool had won four. The recent exits brought down the BJP’s tally to six and raised the TMC’s to seven. The development comes after 200-odd BJP members embraced the Trinamool flag a few days ago. While leaving the BJP, Barman said growth had come to a grinding halt in the panchayat area owing to factional feud within the party. Trinamool leader Manas Ghosh said BJP members were disillusioned because Raiganj MP and Union minister Debasree Chowdhury was doing nothing for her constituency. Former Itahar MLA Amal Acharya, who had joined the BJP ahead of the assembly polls, also expressed his wish to return to the Trinamool. But, a section of local TMC workers are opposed to the same. BJP leader Biswajit Lahiri said the party was not scared of defections. “Our members and workers are being threatened in many places. Trinamool is creating pressure on them in order to make them return,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/defection-hits-bjp-in-raiganj-rural-body/articleshow/83880301.cms||Subhro Maitra

Administrator directed to update,” he said. The governor, however, gave a six-month extension to the present GTA till mid-March 2021, giving it a fresh lease of life. GJM leader Binay Tamang was appointed chairman of GTA in September 2017 and Thapa led the board since 2019. Initially, the Bimal Gurung-led GJM was leading the GTA. Things took a turn on June 8, 2017 when Gurung went on a war path against the state government while CM Mamata Banerjee was holding her cabinet meeting in Darjeeling. GJM supporters led siege to several GTA offices after 2017 and openly set copies of the GTA agreement on fire, demanding Gorkhaland. A senior officer of GTA said that major documents were also set on fire and evidence was destroyed. “The state government had sent an audit team soon after the violence in 2018 but they too had a major problem as files relating to tenders and expenses were burnt,” the official said. Gurung was a fugitive before he surfaced in Kolkata last October and pledged support to Banerjee and Trinamool Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dhankhar-raises-audit-query-for-gta/articleshow/83880663.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Suvendu Adhikari for CBI probe into Kasba vaccine fraud||KOLKATA: Leader of opposition in the Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari has written to the Union health minister demanding a thorough probe by central agencies into the Kasba vaccine fraud. In his letter to Harsh Vardhan, Adhikari held that the fake camps could not have taken place without the complicity of “top civic authorities”. In support of his argument, Adhikari cited several photos of Kolkata civic administrator Firhad Hakim, senior Trinamool Congress minister Subrata Mukherjee, party MP Santanu Sen and MLA Debasish Kumar with accused Debanjan Das at various KMC vaccination camps. “The accused has been seen posing with government files or hosting ‘Duare Sarkar’ camps in KMC ward 66,” he said in his letter. Adhikari also wanted central agencies to find out if the vaccine shots used at these fake camps were indeed Covishield as claimed by the accused. “If they were not Covishield, then there has to be a probe as to what these shots were,” he said. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh complained that Trinamool seniors were trying to pass the blame entirely on the accused. “How could this fake IAS officer move around with ruling party seniors for so long? Now, when he stands exposed, the KMC administrator and other Trinamool seniors have started claiming that they do not know this person. This is untenable. I fear that such fraud vaccine camps have been held elsewhere in the state,” Ghosh said. BJP and Congress supporters on Saturday demonstrated in front of Kasba Police Station against the vaccine fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suvendu-for-cbi-probe-into-kasba-vaccine-fraud/articleshow/83880565.cms||---

What probe will they (BJP) seek (in that)? By a United Nations agency?” Firhad Hakim, senior minister and KMC’s board of administrators’ chairperson, said on Saturday responding to BJP’s demand for a CBI probe into the fake vaccine case. “At CM Mamata Banerjee’s intervention, an SIT probe is on, the guilty will be punished and medical experts are examining every person who went to these fake camps. In Bengal, probes are done neutrally,” he said. Reacting sharply to photographs where he is seen with prime accused Debanjan Deb, Hakim said: “When the PM is clicked with Nirav Modi, there isn’t a whisper. And I commit a big fraud by greeting a person? It is very easy to drag people, who are in public life and work on the streets, by the ear for everything wrong. Was the Taltala plaque installed with my permission? Across Kolkata, there are hundreds of statues and plaques. Can I account for every one of them?” TMC Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen who is also the IMA Bengal chapter secretary, in a two-page note from the association on Saturday, dissociated from Deb, saying that posing as a social worker and without revealing either is intent or identity Deb managed to be present in two photographs in which IMA was donating Covid essentials in a function in which Hakim and CAB president Abhishek Dalmiya were present. On another occasion, Deb was photographed in a function with Sen. The MP on Friday lodged an FIR at Muchipara police station. IMA has clarified Deb had attended these programmes on his own accord and was not invited and IMA had no reason to suspect the genuineness of a person trying to be associated with a noble cause. Senior Trinamool leader Tapas Ray also wrote to police commissioner Soumen Mitra on Friday suggesting any ulterior motive in his name being used in the Taltala plaque. “On February 26, I had never gone there nor was I aware of it. My election for Baranagar was on April 17. I do not know him. There could be an ulterior motive in this,” he said. TMC’s LS MP Kalyan Banerjee saw a BJP hand. “I suspect someone from their party has a hand in this,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-camps-tmc-leaders-deny-links-with-accused/articleshow/83880328.cms||---
---||World||FB rejects talks with publisher in Oz, puts to test content law||SYDNEY: Australia’s competition watchdog is looking into a claim that Facebook refused a publisher’s request to negotiate a licencing deal, the regulator said, setting the stage for the first test of the world’s toughest online content law. Conversation said it asked Facebook to begin talks as required under new legislation that requires the firm and Google to negotiate contentsupply deals with media outlets. FB declined without giving a reason, Conversation said, even though the publisher secured a similar deal with Google. The knockback could present the first test of a controversial mechanism unique to Australia’s effort to claw back advertising dollars from Google and FB: if they refuse to negotiate licence fees with publishers, a government-appointed arbitrator may step in. Facebook’s head of news partnerships, Andrew Hunter, said the firm was “focused on concluding deals with a range of publishers”. He did not answer questions on Conversation, but said FB was planning a separate initiative “to support regional newsrooms and public-interest journalism in the coming months”, without giving details. “If Google’s done a deal with them, I can’t see how FB should argue that they shouldn’t,” Rod Sims, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said. “The question of designation might need to come into play,” he noted, using the term for assigning an arbitrator. “An absolute ‘no’ for an organisation that should be getting a deal is something we’ll look into,” he said.

However, the report from Morabito Consultants doesn’t warn of imminent danger and it is unclear if any of this damage was responsible for the collapse. The report was released by Surfside city as rescuers searched for the159 missing residents. Meanwhile, fire and smoke coming from inside the rubble hampered rescue efforts.

Bangladesh announced that it would impose a new national lockdown from Monday over the variant, with offices shut for a week and only medical-related transport allowed. Sydney’s normally bustling centre was nearly deserted after people were ordered to stay home except for essential trips. New Zealand, citing “multiple outbreaks” in Australia, announced a three-day suspension of its quarantinefree travel arrangement with its neighbour. There is rising concern over Delta, which has now spread to 85 countries. Some European nations are nonetheless easing curbs as vaccinations continue. Spain brought an end to mandatory outdoor mask-wearing on Saturday, although many people in Madrid, where a Covid cluster has been discovered, are keeping faces covered for now. The Netherlands also ended outdoor mask rule, and Switzerland scrapped most of its remaining curbs. In UK, where Delta has delayed its full reopening, anti-lockdown protesters took to London streets to voice frustration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/delta-variant-forces-new-lockdowns-globally-some-eu-nations-ease-curbs/articleshow/83885561.cms||---
---||World||UK and US Hindus call for play mocking Hinduism to be withdrawn from Edinburgh Festival||British and American Hindus are calling for a play that they say denigrates, abuses, trivialises, and mocks Hinduism to be pulled from the Edinburgh International Festival (EIF) in August. "Hindu Times", written by Scottish Indian playwright Jaimini Jethwa, which contains the "F" word, sexual references and foul language, is about the Hindu gods Vishnu and Brahma incarnating on earth as two local Dundee "wide boys", Vince and Barry, to save an Indian woman called "Lakhi, aka Lakshmi". It will have three performances at the Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh on August 20 and 21. A warning on the one hour and 15 minutes play states: "Contains strong language and adult themes." Dundee-based writer Jethwa, a Scot of Ugandan Indian roots whose family hail from Porbandar, wrote in the Guardian: "Hindu Times is my Dundee raga to the Hindu gods." Directed by Caitlin Skinner, the play starts with Lakhi at a party in Dundee that runs out of alcohol and all the shops are shut. Lakha bumps into these two men and tells them to help her get alcohol out of her father’s shop. They then break into the local Spar convenience store where they take blue pills and down vodka. "Locked in a Spar, their epic mission begins to restore balance on Earth and finally reunites Vishnu with his eternal consort, Lakshmi," Jethwa writes in the Guardian. "She has forgotten she’s a goddess. Vishnu, aka Vince, is the consort of Lakshmi through all of time and eternity. Without her, he loses his auspicious strength. Their love is eternal and he’ll go anywhere to save her — even Dundee." Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism in the US, said that Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi were meant to be worshipped in temples and home shrines and "not dragged around through the streets of Dundee looking for booze". "No Hindu scripture mentions their visit to Dundee. Inappropriately reimagining Hindu deities and redefining Hinduism for commercial or other agenda was not okay," he said, urging EIF to send its executives for cultural sensitivity training. "We find this concept of using Hindu names to peddle narratives of adharmic values, normalising abhorrent activities, unethical use scriptures, is totally gross to the point of hate crime. Denigrating the very foundation of Sanatan Vedic dharma is not acceptable," said Trupti Patel, president of the Hindu Forum of Britain. "Appropriate ritual imbues images with authentic divine presence. The play is an extremely inappropriate representation of the Hindu deities and faith. Although modern movies explore the transformation of different gods on modern earth they do not make fun or misrepresent the belief," said Rajnish Kashyap, general secretary at the Hindu Council UK. Nandini Singh, head of social media at REACH India (UK), said: "We politely request EIF to listen to the Hindus and to not show this play. Our values teach us not to disrespect and hurt others." Overseas Friends of BJP UK president Kuldeep Shekhawat said: "We request EIF to withdraw this play if it is making derogatory remarks or using foul language." The Edinburgh International Festival said in a statement: “Every year, the Edinburgh International Festival invites artists from all over the world with a great range of artistic perspectives. The Hindu Times is a work by respected Scottish artists and we continue to support their work in this year's Festival programme.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/uk-us-hindus-ask-edinburgh-festival-to-remove-play/articleshow/83885564.cms||NAOMI CANTON

A total of 143 reports gathered since 2004 remain unexplained, the document said. Of those, 21 reports of unknown phenomena, involving 18 episodes, possibly demonstrate technological capabilities that are unknown to the US objects moving without observable propulsion or with rapid acceleration that is believed to be beyond the capabilities of Russia, China or other nations. There is no evidence that any of the episodes involve secret US weapons programmes, unknown technology from Russia or China or extraterrestrial visitations. But the government report did not rule out those explanations. Instead, officials outlined a plan to develop a better programme to observe data on future unexplained phenomena. The report laid out five categories of possible explanation for the phenomena: tech developed by an adversarial power like Russia and China, classified US tech, a naturally occurring phenomenon, airborne clutter such as weather balloons and a catchall “other” category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-has-no-explanation-for-143-ufo-sightings-but-doesnt-rule-out-aliens/articleshow/83885579.cms||---

While speaking during a virtual launch ceremony of the book ‘Anomalies in Law and Justice’ written by former SC judge R V Raveendran, the CJI said the issue of connectivity figured prominently in the two-day conference of chief justices of high courts and he conveyed the message to the Centre to take remedial action to deal with the problem. Justice Ramana said he recently wrote to the minister of law, communications and information technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, and highlighted these issues and requested him to initiate steps on priority to bridge the digital divide and also to evolve a mechanism to help advocates who have lost livelihood due to pandemic. “I am writing to bring to your kind attention certain issues that emerged during the course of my recent interaction with the chief justices of all high courts which need immediate intervention of the Union Government to strengthen the network and connectivity beyond major urban centres, particularly in rural and tribal areas, as the digital divide is adversely impacting the functioning of the courts in the wake of the pandemic” the letter said. The CJI in the letter also stressed the need to treat people associated with judiciary as frontline workers for the purpose of providing pandemic related relief. He also said the government should take initiatives to provide financial support to advocates, especially the junior advocates, who are struggling to make both ends meet due to loss of work for more than a year since the onset of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-poor-connectivity-hampering-virtual-hearings-in-rural-areas/articleshow/83885597.cms||---

The decision comes close on the heels of CM Himanta Biswa Sarma expressing concern over population growth, particularly among immigrant Muslims in the state. For female sterilisation as per the current family planning programme in aspirational and Mission Parivar Vikas districts, namely Baksa, Barpeta, Darrang, Dhubri, Goalpara, Hailakandi, Karimganj, and Udalguri, the incentive is Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 depending on the type of method (PPS/Minilap/LS). For other districts, the incentive is Rs 1,400 to Rs 2,200. For male sterilisation, the incentive is Rs 3,000 in the aspirational and MPV districts and Rs 2,000 in case of other districts, the NHM said in a statement. “Another focus will be on the home delivery of contraceptives, so that clients can be provided services at the doorstep,” the statement said. It said last year, amid Covid pandemic, Assam performed 835 sterilisations, conducted 20,848 IUCD insertions, while 7,136 Antara injections were administered and 7,02,229 condoms and 4,41,263 oral contraceptives distributed during WPD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-plans-to-home-deliver-contraceptives-in-8-districts/articleshow/83885634.cms||Prabin Kalita

This is an area south of Chennai, just a few kilometres from Tambaram. Activist V Pugalventhan, who has closely tracked such improper waste disposal, on Friday visited the spot after complaints from residents. In photographs and a video taken by him, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, tubes used in RT-PCR test samples and other used medical equipment were seen in the open dumpyard in the area. “Some of this biomedical waste was also a bit charred, indicating that whoever has dumped this has tried to burn it,” Pugalventhan said. The fumes from this were blowing towards nearby residential colonies, he said. According to Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) norms, biomedical waste has to be collected separately by local bodies and given to a TNPCB-identified company which should incinerate it. This is the same spot that the activist had highlighted in an earlier complaint in April, but the Perungalathur panchayat had denied the allegations, stating they send biomedical waste to a governmentnominated company for incineration. Pugalventhan has raised another complaint regarding this issue. This is the latest in a series of instances of biomedical waste being found dumped in various secluded spots on the outskirts of the city. These are found off highways, water-bodies or waste lands. Many locations are near the factories of the companies identified to incinerate the waste. In some cases, expired medicines had labels of pharmacies. Similarly bills of hospitals were found amid the waste. However, no action has been taken by the TNPCB, drug inspectors or local bodies. TNPCB sources said unlike the Greater Chennai Corporation, smaller local bodies don’t have the wherewithal to track dumping of biomedical waste in nondescript areas. During Covid, huge amounts of biomedical waste was being generated and its disposal has become a headache. MLA of Thiruporur constituency and VCK leader S S Balaji has also raised this issue with the TN medical and family welfare minister Ma Subramaniam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-half-burned-biomed-waste-found-near-mudichur-lake/articleshow/83885653.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC order on HCS officer’s selection challenged||CHANDIGARH: The single bench order of the Punjab and Haryana high court directing the Haryana government to appoint Vishwajeet Singh as Haryana Civil Service (executive branch) officer on the basis of his sports gradation certificate has been challenged before the HC. The appellant, Amit Dhanda, working as excise and taxation officer (ETO), has claimed that the Haryana government had first decided to hold an inquiry into Vishwajeet’s gradation through the state vigilance bureau (SVB) but for the reasons not known, it did not wait for its outcome. It has also been stated that even after the decision of the single judge, the Haryana government had initially decided to challenge the said decision by means of filing letter patent appeal (LPA), but this too had been overruled for no valid reasons and it was decided to appoint Vishwajeet as HCS officer. Glaring violations of procedure ignored and condoned: Appellant The glaring violations of procedure and propriety have been ignored and condoned whereas the same called for exemplary action so as to prohibit recurrence of such conduct on the part of the officials and to prevent fraud being played on public employment. In a bizarre turn of events, the state chose to reward the violator and confer the benefit of offering public appointment to the person who has to be investigated about the acts in question which prima facie establish commission of cognizable offence,” the appellant has contended. Appellant has sought directions to set aside the order dated January 29 through which the single bench of the HC had directed Haryana to issue an appointment letter to Vishwajeet Singh as HCS officer. According to the appellant, Vishwajeet has no entitlement to seek appointment to the post of HCS (executive branch) on the basis of the sports gradation certificate. “There is no presumption in the said policy notified by the state to assume the existence of the organizing authority being recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It is required to be established,” the appellant has stated in his appeal. Regarding his locus to challenge the single bench order, the appellant has submitted that on account of the sports gradation certificate issued to the Vishwajeet, which was inappropriate, his (Vishwajeet) name has been recommended in the category of HCS (executive branch) whereas the name of the appellant was recommended against the post of ETO...“In the event of recommendation of the Vishwajeet Singh being held as illegal and in violation of the notified sports policy in issuing the gradation certificate to Vishwajeet, the name of the appellant shall be recommended against the post in the HCS (executive branch) cadre being higher in the order or merit,” Dhanda has contended in his plea. The appeal is expected to come up for hearing next week when the HC would open after vacations||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-order-on-hcs-officers-selection-challenged/articleshow/83885696.cms||Ajay Sura

Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, on the occasion of ‘International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking’ on Saturday, honoured Bey by appointing him as a police constable for his honesty. Bey had failed to pass the Assam police recruitment test thrice earlier. “We all know how much salary home guards get. But Borsing Bey displayed exemplary guts and honesty to refuse a huge amount of bribe and went ahead to seize the drugs,” Sarma said at Bey’s felicitation and appointment ceremony. Bey, who gets a monthly salary of Rs 9,000 as a home guard, said: “On June 21, when I was checking a bus, I found the drugs concealed inside the engine compartment. They (carriers) offered me a huge bribe but I did not want to put a blot on my uniform. Ignoring the money on offer, I seized the drugs.” He added, “If you do your duty honestly, you are bound to achieve your goals.” Bey’s appointment as a regular constable in Assam police was cleared by the cabinet and the government decided to ceremonially hand over the appointment letter to him with a view to sending a positive message to society. Stating that society has a moral duty to safeguard the younger generation from the menace of drugs, Sarma said the present state government, after coming back to office, continued its unrelenting fight against drugs dealers. He added that due to zero-tolerance attitude adopted by the government, drugs worth Rs 35 crore were seized from different parts of Assam in the last 45 days. The CM further said that Assam was earlier used as a transit route by drugs dealers, but in course of time, a big market was gradually developing (in the state). “That is why the Assam government has given top priority to weed out the menace of drugs from the state so that the new generation could be saved from its ill effects,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-hails-home-guard-who-refused-drug-mafias-bribe/articleshow/83885687.cms||Prabin Kalita

He was arrested in 2010 on accusations of recruiting Muslim youths to send them to Pakistan for training and spread terrorist activities in India. Baba had come to Gujarat from Srinagar in February 2010 for a training with the Gujarat Cleft & Craniofacial Research Institute in Ahmedabad. He was arrested on March 13 from Anand when he had gone to meet an acquaintance. He was booked under UAPA and for criminal conspiracy to spread terrorism as a member of a banned Hizb-ul-Mujahideen. Additional sessions judge S A Nakum rejected the Anti-Terrorism Squad’s case that Baba was associated with Hizbul terrorists. The judge said that no evidence was found that he was in touch with terrorist elements through electronic gadgets. The court observed that the prosecution relied on emotional argument and a person cannot be held guilty merely on its fear of anarchy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/11-years-on-gujarat-court-clears-kashmiri-man-of-uapa-charges/articleshow/83885714.cms||---

The meeting deliberated on political and governance issues linked to these states while the leaders also reviewed the state of ongoing welfare schemes initiated amidst the pandemic. Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Smriti Irani, Mansukh Mandavia, Kiren Rijiju, party general secretaries Arun Singh, Bhupender Yadav and CT Ravi and its vice president Baijyant Jay Panda also attended the meeting. Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa are slated for early next year. Except Punjab, BJP is in office in all these states. At the meeting, the party leaders took stock of various development work in these states as the leadership has often stressed on the need for coordination among different ministries and the party as part of a feedback mechanism, sources said. Uttar Pradesh is especially crucial to BJP’s political fortunes as the party stormed to power in the most populous state with a massive landslide in 2017, three years after Narendra Modi took over as the Prime Minister. National general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh and state in-charge Radhamohan Singh have visited Uttar Pradesh twice in the past few days during which they held a series of meetings. Sources said there is a concern in the party about the current pandemic for which it feels an assertive message should be conveyed about the government’s initiatives like free ration and free vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shah-top-bjp-netas-discuss-plan-for-22-polls-in-5-states/articleshow/83885738.cms||---

He will be the party’s face in the polls,” Singh said while talking to reporters on Saturday. Asked about the lunch hosted by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya for Yogi following his (Maurya) June 16 statement that ‘BJP Parliamentary Board and its national leadership will decide under whom the next assembly elections will be fought in the state’, Singh said, “Everyone knows that marriage of deputy CM’s son had taken place recently. The CM was invited to bless the newlywed couple.” On BJP’s prospects and SP’s bid to utilise West Bengal poll slogans like ‘Khela Hobe’ in the forthcoming state assembly polls, Singh said “the game will definitely happen but it will be played by BJP with the blessings of the people of the state”. The minister said that the state government had won the battle against the first wave of Covid-19 and put an effective check on the second wave. “Now, we are preparing for the third wave and the state government will ensure all steps to combat any variant of the virus,” he added. Asked about the farmers’ agitation, Singh said: “The farmers should not worry as the state government has ensured record purchase of wheat on minimum support price (MSP) from them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-will-be-cm-face-and-lead-bjp-to-win-says-up-minister/articleshow/83885745.cms||---

The special investigation team of the forest department to probe the scam estimates that these include1,600 cubic metres of teak wood and 300 cubic metres of rosewood. The final report of the investigation team, submitted to the principal forest secretary on Friday, has also accused the revenue department of not taking timely action against officials who colluded with the accused in the scam. A senior forest department official in Thiruvananthapuram said the revenue department should share details of the assigned land and the list of reserved trees on such land with them to prevent further illegal felling of trees in future. The forest department has confiscated timber worth around Rs 8.5 crore till date. “The revenue department failed to seize the timber or file theft case under the Land Conservancy Act. The village officer can register a case under Section 10 (3) of the Land Conservancy Act against those felling trees belonging to the government. It attracts imprisonment or fine or both but no case has been registered by the revenue department so far. They haven't recovered any timber either," the official said. According to SIT, 1,600 cu.m teak wood and 300 cu.m rosewood were illegally cut using the revenue department order Report includes key suggestionsHe pointed out that the assigned land belongs to the revenue department. “It is the responsibility of revenue officials to ensure that there is no violation of rules on the assigned land and the owner protects ‘scheduled species’ like teak and rosewood,’’ he said. The report, submitted after a two-week probe, includes some key recommendations also. “All amendments to the assignment rules stipulate that Section 10 (3) A of the Land Assignment Rules, 1964 ensuring protection of four scheduled species — teak, rosewood, sandalwood and ebony — will prevail on the assigned land. Instead of issuing an opaque executive order to fell trees on assigned land, they should have brought an amendment to the rules,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sit-scheduled-timber-worth-rs-14-crore-cut-from-assigned-land-across-kerala/articleshow/83885737.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Chandigarh||Farmer storm hits Tricity||CHANDIGARH: Thousands of farmers muscled their way into the city from Mohali, breaking barricades and braving water cannons and mild lathicharge to submit a memorandum at Raj Bhawan to repeal the three controversial agri-marketing laws. The scenes were slightly similar to the ones witnessed seven months back when farmers were stopped from proceeding to Delhi. But this time, no untoward incident was reported with the protesters restraining themselves and not resorting to any violence. It all started around 10am, when farm activists began gathering at Gurdwara Amb Sahib in Sector 62, Mohali. Functionaries of farm unions aligned with Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) — including Balbir Singh Rajewal, Mansa Singh Ruldu, and local organiser Satnam Singh Tanda of Kisan Ekta (Chandigarh) —gave speeches. The protesters left the shrine around12noon. Farmers reached YPS chowk in 15 minutes and crossed the barricades without much effort. Mohali had deployed around 500 cops to manage the protest. Senior superintendent of police Satinder Singh, sub-divisional magistrate Jagdeep Sehgal, SP Harvinder Singh Virk and SP Harbir Singh Atwal were present at the YPS crossing. About 300 metres from YPS chowk, the protesters reached the first barricade set up by Chandigarh Police on the road dividing sectors 51 and 52. Police used water cannon but could not stop farmers from pushing aside the barricades and marching into the city by1pm. Police tried to hold back the protesters again on the road dividing sectors 43 and 44, and then on the road dividing sectors 34 and 35, but failed. The next flashpoint was at the Aroma light point. Police parked PCR vehicles in the middle of the road and resorted to a mild lathicharge, measures that did not work. Police were able to stop a majority of the protesters only with a desperate attempt in which they parked CTU buses in middle of the road at government press chowk (sectors 8, 9, 17, 18 light point). Here too, police resorted to a mild lathicharge. Deputy commissioner Mandip Brar accepted the memorandum on behalf of the governor from representatives of farm groups. A group of activists still managed to reach the roundabout between sectors 4, 5, 8 and 9, which is 1km away from Raj Bhawan. They were, however, called back by the organisers. By 3pm, the farmers started to return.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmer-storm-hits-tricity/articleshow/83885739.cms||Siddarth Banerjee

A total of 50 random samples of Chandigarh residents for May and June were sent to NCDC laboratory, New Delhi on June 4 for whole genomic sequencing. Variants of concern were detected in 35 samples — one Alpha variant, 33 Delta variant and one Delta plus variant. Samples of a 35-year-old resident of Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran, who had tested positive for Covid on May 22, was detected with Delta plus variant. Samples of four direct high-risk family contacts who had tested positive in May were sent to NCDC on Saturday. The 35 year old and all family members, which included two elderly and a small child, had mild Covid. None of them were hospitalised and all have fully recovered. None of them was vaccinated. Also, 29 samples for June have been sent to NCDC on June 22. The results are awaited. “In view of circulation of more transmissible variants, residents are advised to follow Covid-appropriate behavior. These include wearing masks, following social distancing, hand hygiene and sanitisation,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, UT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-as-protesters-forget-covid-delta-checks-in/articleshow/83885805.cms||Shimona Kanwar

But the industry has tempered its expectations because of the experience of the past year. The business has seen an uptick since June 21, with popular resorts, lodges and homestays in all districts, barring Kodagu, reopening with 50 per cent capacity. Jungle Lodges and Resorts (JLR), an entity of the state government, is set to reopen its doors to tourists from Monday. JLR chairman MA Appanna told STOI that visitors would be provided only food and accommodation and only 50 per cent of the facilities would be used because of Covid protocols. “Visitors can stay in lodges inside forested areas and relax,” he said. There will be no safari till the government grants permission, he added. The forest department has restarted jungle safari at Dandeli in Uttara Kannada and MM Hills in Chamarajanagar. Monsoon is driving the tourist rush towards cascades and hill stations. Resorts and homestays are receiving enquiries in Dandeli, Chikmagalur, Sakleshpur, Hampi and a few other destinations. The department plans to promote lesser-known waterfalls as it believes many people are interested in exploring destinations that are not very crowded. Heritage sites are also set to welcome visitors. Water sports, a major attraction of Dandeli, will gear up in a few days. Rahul Bavaji, an owner of a homestay here, said that many people had made enquiries in the past week. Suresh Chengappa, who owns Honey Valley and Chingara Homestays in Kodagu, said that since June 15, he had received about 10 calls, mostly from researchers. “We will start hosting guests once the district administration grants permission. Waterfalls are a major attraction here, apart from the natural scenery,” he said. Innayath Khan, a tours and travels operator, said from July 1, Chikkamagaluru would see visitors with further relaxation of restrictions. In the past15 days, his agency has received several calls from people interested in seeing waterfalls, trekking and staying in the forest. He said that business would reach normal levels only after temples in the region were reopened for devotees. Tourism activities in all five tiger reserves in Karnataka continue to remain shut, while Madhya Pradesh resumed them three weeks ago. The National Tiger Conservation Authority has allowed reserves and parks to open after consultation with local authorities. SR Natesh, director of the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and National Park, said that it had been closed since April 28 because of Covid curbs. Bandipur, spread over parts of Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts, normally sees an annual footfall of nearly 2 lakh. Mysuru was unlocked with other districts earlier this month as it had a weekly positivity rate of over 5 per cent. Last year, tourism suffered estimated losses of Rs 5,000 crore every month during the pandemic-induced lockdown starting March. The state government mentioned this in its economic survey for 2020-21. This year, the impact may be bigger, fear officials. Tourism minister CP Yogeeshwar said he was confident that the industry would bounce back in two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/karnataka-tourism-sector-sees-hope-as-homestays-resorts-get-calls/articleshow/83885795.cms||---

SR Natesh, director of the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and National Park, said that it had been closed since April 28 because of Covid curbs. Bandipur, spread over parts of Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts, normally sees an annual footfall of nearly 2 lakh. Mysuru was unlocked with other districts earlier this month as it had a weekly positivity rate of over 5 per cent. Last year, tourism suffered estimated losses of Rs 5,000 crore every month during the pandemic-induced lockdown starting March. The state government mentioned this in its economic survey for 2020-21. This year, the impact may be bigger, fear officials. Tourism minister CP Yogeeshwar said he was confident that the industry would bounce back in two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-tourism-sector-sees-hope-as-homestays-resorts-get-calls/articleshow/83885817.cms||---

Although slabs of the additional maintenance fee are uniform across BDA layouts, the impact on site owners differs as property tax varies. For instance, a 30ft x 40ft site owner in Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout who paid Rs 838 as property tax in 2020 must pay Rs 3,233 this year, a whopping 286% increase. Ditto with a 40ft x 60ft site owner in Anjanapura Layout - she now pays Rs 6,016 as tax whereas it was Rs 3,616 last year. Scores of owners of large plots called STOI to complain about the hike. The BDA, BBMP and other public agencies usually raise rates by maximum 15%. The BDA added new 'maintenance charges' to property tax, sparking anger because it's yet to build roads in some layouts or has ignored upkeep in others. In new layouts, for example, allottees have been pleading with BDA, RERA and the government for basic amenities like roads, footpaths, sanitary pipelines and drinking water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bangalore-development-authority-doubles-property-tax-move-hits-1-lakh-owners/articleshow/83885850.cms||Kiran Parashar

The Centre, in its submissions, said, “ADB has also proposed a new Technical Assistance (TA) concept for promoting disaster risk transfer, including insurance in India. ADB through its TA is looking forward to developing disaster risk financing solutions for Indian states.” “In this regard, a meeting was also held on April 5 between ADB and NDMA. During the meeting, ADB proposed a hybrid insurance solution — combination of parametric insurance and indemnity insurance — and requested for a joint meeting between NDMA, Department of Financial Services (DFS) and the ministry of home affairs (MHA),” it said. The meeting was scheduled for April 12, but was postponed because of the severity of the second wave of the pandemic. However, the Centre said it would be difficult for it to grant ex gratia from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) or for the states from SDRF as “ex gratia payment under SDRF/NDRF is available to persons who have died on account of 12 notified disasters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/adb-mulling-ex-gratia-payment-for-covid-victims/articleshow/83885818.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

As many as 157 IIT students and 165 faculty members have been infected in the 15 months of the pandemic, it says. The RTI query was filed by an activist from MP’s Neemuch, Chandra Shekhar Gaur, who wanted to know how many boarders of IITs and NITs have been infected by Covid-19 or died of it. The department of higher education, Government of India, gave the numbers till May 20 this year in its reply, but there was no break-up of the data to show which campus had how many infections and deaths. The 23 IITs in the country have around 15,000 to 20,000 students. “This data shows there is no alternative to vaccination. Vaccination should be increased, especially among bright and talented youth. The virus spares no one, and the young must take the shot. The government should carry out a drive to vaccinate students in hostels and other such places,” Gaur told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/eleven-iit-students-two-teachers-have-died-of-covid-19/articleshow/83885821.cms||Amarjeet Singh

As vaccination against Covid-19 picks up pace and restrictions are gradually being lifted with many planning a trip abroad, the government has introduced a provision allowing individuals to update their vaccination certificate with passport number. One can login to the CoWin portal and raise an issue. This will provide the passport option. Once the passport number is entered and submitted, the new vaccination certificate will be generated within seconds with passport number on it, the government tweeted. The facility has been provided with a view that once international travel picks up, vaccination certificates will be asked for by many countries even though testing still continues to be the primary global requirement approved by WHO for international travel, an official said. India has administered over 31.62 crore doses of Covid vaccines till Saturday 8 pm and aims to cover all adults above18 years of age by end of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-link-your-vax-certificate-with-passport-through-cowin/articleshow/83885825.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Ramp up steps to curb Delta+: Centre to Karnataka||BENGALURU: The Centre on Saturday directed Karnataka to redouble containment and testing efforts and increase vaccination coverage where the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 has been detected. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to Karnataka chief secretary P Ravi Kumar about it on June 25. Two cases of Delta Plus with mild symptoms have been detected in Mysuru and Bengaluru. According to health minister K Sudhakar, patients have been isolated and are under treatment. Their swab samples have been sent for analysis. Bhusan wrote: "The state has to be more focused and stringent by taking up measures like preventing crowds, intermingling of people, widespread testing, and prompt tracing." He asked the state to ensure that adequate samples of positive cases be sent to designated laboratories of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) promptly so that clinical epidemiological correlations can be established. He suggested similar measures to seven other states. According to INSACOG, the Delta Plus variant has characteristics like increased transmissibility, stronger binding to receptors of lung cells, and potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response. On Friday, CM BS Yediyurappa met health experts and officials and instructed them to maintain a vigil for the Delta Plus variant, especially in border districts. The government also proposed setting up genome sequencing labs in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Hubballi, Mangaluru and Vijayapura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ramp-up-steps-to-curb-delta-centre-to-karnataka/articleshow/83885868.cms||---

These guidelines will be effective from Monday. The principal bench of the high court in Bengaluru will hear cases under a hybrid model, i.e. physical and online proceedings, in both sessions. But physical presence of people associated with cases won’t be allowed; they will have to appear through the online mode. Lawyers have also been urged to follow this. District and trial courts have been advised to list 30 cases per day (15 per session) to reduce the footfall of lawyers. Courts are permitted to record evidence of a maximum of five witnesses per day. They can also conduct this process by physically calling witnesses in the open court. At all the places, people permitted to enter will be subjected to thermal screening. Masks and social distancing are mandatory. Bar association offices and canteens or any other food outlet within trial court precincts will remain closed. The attendance relaxation given to staff members has been withdrawn and they will have to attend regular duties. Up to 50 per cent of machine operators and job typists will be allowed on the premises, provided they are fully vaccinated. Parties-in-person can enter the court complex only for the purpose of physical filing, and not any other activity. But this restriction will not apply to those appearing in family and labour courts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-high-court-to-hear-cases-in-hybrid-mode/articleshow/83885841.cms||---
