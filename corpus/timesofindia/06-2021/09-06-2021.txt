Amazon founder Jeff Bezos paid no income tax in 2007 and 2011. Tesla founder Elon Musk's income tax bill was zero in 2018. And financier George Soros went three straight years without paying federal income tax, according to a report Tuesday from the nonprofit investigative journalism organization ProPublica. Overall, the richest 25 Americans pay less in tax — an average of 15.8% of adjusted gross income — than many ordinary workers do, once you include taxes for Social Security and Medicare, ProPublica found. Its findings are likely to heighten a national debate over the vast and widening inequality between the very wealthiest Americans and everyone else. An anonymous source delivered to ProPublica reams of Internal Revenue Service data on the country's wealthiest people, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg. ProPublica compared the tax data it received with information available from other sources. It reported that "in every instance we were able to check — involving tax filings by more than 50 separate people — the details provided to ProPublica matched the information from other sources." Using perfectly legal tax strategies, many of the uber-rich are able to shrink their federal tax bills to nothing or close to it. A spokesman for Soros, who has supported higher taxes on the rich, told ProPublica that the billionaire had lost money on his investments from 2016 to 2018 and so did not owe federal income tax for those years. Musk responded to ProPublica's initial request for comment with a punctuation mark — "?" — and did not answer detailed follow-up questions. The federal tax code is meant to be progressive — that is, the rich pay a steadily higher tax rate on their income as it rises. And ProPublica found, in fact, that people earning between $2 million and $5 million a year paid an average of 27.5%, the highest of any group of taxpayers. Above $5 million in income, though, tax rates fell: The top .001% of taxpayers — 1,400 people who reported income above $69 million — paid 23%. And the 25 very richest people paid still less. The wealthy can reduce their tax bills through the use of charitable donations or by avoiding wage income (which can be taxed at up to 37%) and benefiting instead mainly from investment income (usually taxed at 20%). President Joe Biden, in seeking revenue to finance his spending plans, has proposed higher taxes on the wealthy. Biden wants to raise the top tax rate to 39.6% for people earning $400,000 a year or more in taxable income, estimated to be fewer than 2% of US households. The top tax rate that workers pay on salaries and wages now is 37%. Biden is proposing to nearly double the tax rate that high-earning Americans pay on profits from stocks and other investments. In addition, under his proposals, inherited capital gains would no longer be tax-free. The president, whose proposals must be approved by Congress, would also raise taxes on corporations, which would affect wealthy investors who own corporate stocks. ProPublica reported that the tax bills of the rich are especially low when compared with their soaring wealth — the value of their investment portfolios, real estate and other assets. Using calculations by Forbes magazine, ProPublica noted that the wealth of the 25 richest Americans collectively jumped by $401 billion from 2014 to 2018. They paid $13.6 billion in federal income taxes over those years — equal to just 3.4% of the increase in their wealth. Chuck Marr, a senior director at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, suggested that Biden's proposals, which face fierce opposition from Republicans in Congress and from businesses, are "modest" given how much the wealthy have benefited in recent years and how comparatively little tax many of them pay. "It always seems like the solutions are cast as radical when there's less focus on the current situation being radical," Marr said. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, among others, have proposed taxing the wealth of the richest Americans, not just their income. On Tuesday, Warren tweeted in response to the ProPublica report: "Our tax system is rigged for billionaires who don't make their fortunes through income, like working families do. The evidence is abundantly clear: it is time for a (hash)WealthTax in America to make the ultra-rich finally pay their fair share.? ProPublica's data "reveals that the country's wealthiest, who have profited handsomely during the pandemic, have not been paying their fair share of taxes," Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who leads the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, said at the start of a hearing Tuesday on the IRS' budget with Commissioner Charles Rettig. Wyden has proposed legislation that would tighten enforcement of tax collection against wealthy individuals and corporations that use artifices and loopholes to skirt paying taxes. For his part, Rettig said that the IRS is investigating the leak of the tax data to ProPublica and that any violations of law would be prosecuted. (ProPublica reported that it doesn't know the identity of the source who provided the data.) "We will find out about the ProPublica article," Rettig said. "We have turned it over to the appropriate investigators, both external and internal." Now controlling the White House and Congress, Democrats are focusing on the tax gap — the hundreds of billions of dollars' difference between what Americans owe the government in taxes and what they pay — and its connection to economic inequality. The top 10% of earners have accounted for most of that gap, experts say, by underreporting their liabilities, intentionally or not, as tax avoidance or as outright evasion. The tax gap is under a spotlight as a potential source for recouping some revenue to help pay for Biden's proposed spending on infrastructure, families and education. Democrats have been pushing the IRS to invigorate its enforcement of tax collection and make it fairer, by pursuing the big corporations and wealthy individuals who manage to game the system. At Tuesday's hearing, Wyden told Rettig that it's wrong "how the wealthy always seem to skip out on their obligations." "You have a better chance of being struck by lightning than being audited if you're a partner in a partnership," Wyden said. Rettig responded, "We are outgunned." Democrats have argued that the tax gap has widened mainly because big US corporations have parked revenue overseas and wealthy individuals have failed to pay their fair share. They assert that the IRS, long understaffed and underfunded, has tended to pursue taxpayers of modest means more aggressively than high-powered businesspeople and corporations. Taxpayers with annual incomes under $25,000 are audited at a higher rate (0.69%) than those with incomes up to $500,000 (0.53%), according to IRS data. Taxpayers who receive the earned-income tax credit, which applies mainly to low-income workers with children, are audited at a higher rate than all but the very wealthiest tax filers. The audit rate for millionaires fell from 8.4% in 2010 to 2.4% in 2019. The agency's funding has been slashed about 20% since 2010. Biden's new spending proposals include an extra $80 billion over 10 years to bolster IRS audits of upper-income individuals and corporations, with an eye toward recovering an estimated $700 billion. Much of the gap comes from the use of overseas havens. The government loses between an estimated $40 billion and $120 billion a year from offshore tax evasion. Biden's tax plan includes measures to stop corporations from stashing profits in countries with low tax rates. Last weekend, the Group of Seven wealthy democracies, which includes the United States, agreed to support a global minimum corporate tax of at least 15% to deter multinational companies from avoiding taxes by stashing profits in low-rate countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/propublica-many-of-the-uber-rich-pay-next-to-no-income-tax/articleshow/83350010.cms||---

---||World||Justin Trudeau denounces truck attack that targeted Muslim family||TORONTO: A pickup truck attack that killed four members of an immigrant family has shaken Canada, a country where immigrants are largely accepted, and drew denunciations Tuesday from Canada's prime minister, who called it a hate crime directed at Muslims.  The victims - two parents, two children and a grandmother - were on an evening walk when the driver of the truck struck them at an intersection in London, Ontario. The sole survivor was a nine-year-old boy, who was hospitalized.  "This was a terrorist attack, motivated by hatred, in the heart of one of our communities," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Parliament. "If anyone thinks racism and hatred don't exist in this country, I want to say this: How do we explain such violence to a child in a hospital? How can we look families in the eye and say 'Islamophobia isn't real?'"  The victims' extended family issued a statement identifying the dead as Salman Afzal, 46; his wife Madiha, 44; their daughter Yumna, 15; and a 74-year-old grandmother whose name was withheld. The hospitalized boy was identified as the couple's son, Fayez. Friends said the family immigrated to Canada 14 years ago.  Many Canadians have been enjoying evening walks to get fresh air after long days at home during the pandemic, Trudeau said.  "But unlike every other night, this family never made it home," Trudeau said. "Their lives were taken in a brutal, cowardly and brazen act of violence. This killing was no accident. ... Canadians are outraged by what happened on Sunday. And many Muslim Canadians are scared."  Trudeau said words matter and in part blamed rhetoric, disinformation and extremism online and in politics.  "They can be a seed that grows into an ugly, pervasive trend. And sometimes, they lead to real violence," the prime minister said. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Twitter that the attack revealed the growing Islamophobia in Western countries.  A 20-year-old suspect, Nathaniel Veltman, was arrested in the parking lot of a nearby mall. He was facing four counts of first-degree murder. Police were inside the suspect's London apartment on Tuesday.  Police said Veltman did not know the victims. Detective Supt. Paul Waight said it was not clear if he belonged to any specific hate group, but that local police were working with federal authorities to investigate potential terrorism charges. He said the attack was planned.  Everyone who knew the Afzal family knew "the model family they were as Muslims, Canadians and Pakistanis," the statement from the extended family said. "They worked extremely hard in their fields and excelled. Their children were top students in their school and connected strongly with their spiritual identity."  A fundraising webpage said the father was a physiotherapist and cricket enthusiast and his wife was working on a doctorate in civil engineering at Western University in London. Their daughter was finishing ninth grade, and the grandmother was a "pillar" of the family, the page said.  The family statement urged the public to stand against hate and Islamophobia.  "This young man who committed this act of terror was influenced by a group that he associated with, and the rest of the community must take a strong stand against this, from the highest levels in our government to every member of the community," the statement said.  Flowers were placed around a light pole and a tree where the truck crossed onto the sidewalk. A vigil was scheduled for Tuesday night at the mosque the family attended. Trudeau and other federal political party leaders were scheduled to attend. Pandemic restrictions were eased to allow mourners to attend the vigil.  Rauf Ahmad and three friends watched the growing tribute on the corner.  "I didn't think there was racism in Canada, and I felt very safe when I came here two years ago, but I do not feel safe now," Ahmad said. "Humanity is first. We should not care about whether someone is a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian."  Zahid Khan, a family friend, said the family belonged to the London Muslim Mosque.  "They were just out for their walk that they would go out for every day," Khan said through tears near the site of the crash. "I just wanted to see."  Mayor Ed Holder said flags would be lowered for three days in London, which he said has 30,000 to 40,000 Muslims among its more than 400,000 residents.  Canada is generally welcoming toward immigrants and all religions, but in 2017 a French Canadian man known for far-right, nationalist views went on a shooting rampage at a Quebec City mosque that killed six people.  "Canada is not immune to the kind of intolerance and division we have seen elsewhere in the world," Trudeau said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/justin-trudeau-denounces-truck-attack-that-targeted-muslim-family/articleshow/83351238.cms||---
---||World||Man charged with murder of boy in road-rage shooting||SANTA ANA: A Southern California man was charged Tuesday with murder in a road rage shooting that killed a 6-year-old boy on a local freeway last month.  Prosecutors in Orange County, California charged Marcus Anthony Eriz, 24, with murder in the death of Aiden Leos. Eriz was also charged with shooting at an occupied vehicle and with sentencing enhancements.  Eriz's girlfriend, Wynne Lee, was charged with being an accessory after the fact and illegally carrying a concealed firearm.  Both were expected to appear in court on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear whether they had attorneys who could speak on their behalf.  Authorities said they believe Lee was driving the car and Eriz fired the shot that killed Leos while his mother was driving the boy to kindergarten on May 21 in Orange County, southeast of Los Angeles.  According to accounts from the mother and witnesses who stopped to help her, another car cut her off and she responded with a hand gesture and the car slipped in behind her and someone inside fired a shot through the rear of her car. California Highway Patrol officials have said that the road rage violence stemmed from "a perceived unsafe lane change."  The case drew widespread outrage in the county of 3 million people. At least $500,000 in rewards had been offered from around the U.S. for information leading to an arrest in the case.  Authorities said they received hundreds of tips. The couple was arrested on Sunday in the city of Costa Mesa.  Authorities said the car, described as a white Volkswagen Golf SportWagen, was relatively rare and that helped investigators who examined surveillance footage. It was found at Eriz's grandmother's house in Whittier, but she is not implicated in the crime, the Orange County Register reported.  The gun was discovered at Eriz's workplace in San Bernardino County, officials said.  Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer on Monday noted that boy was buried by the family only hours before he held a news conference announcing the arrests.  "I do want to promise today, when Aiden was put below ground, that we will get justice for him," Spitzer said. "We have to promise him that."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/man-charged-with-murder-of-boy-in-road-rage-shooting/articleshow/83351721.cms||---
---||World||Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic loses genocide appeal||THE HAGUE: Ratko Mladic, the military chief known as the "Butcher of Bosnia" for orchestrating genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Balkan nation's 1992-95 war, lost his final legal battle Tuesday when UN judges rejected his appeals and affirmed his life sentence.  The ruling involving his 2017 convictions and sentence closed a grim chapter in European history that included the continent's first genocide since World War II - the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys.  The now-frail Mladic, often belligerent at his court appearances in The Hague, showed no reaction other than a scowl as Presiding Judge Prisca Matimba Nyambe of Zambia said the panel had dismissed, by a vote of 4-1, his appeals of convictions for crimes including genocide, murder, extermination and terror for atrocities throughout the war that killed more than 100,000 and left millions homeless.  The 79-year-old former general is the last major figure to face justice from the conflict that ended more than a quarter century ago.  His former political chief, ex-Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, already is serving a life sentence after being convicted for the same crimes. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who was accused of fomenting the ethnic conflicts that tore apart the Balkans in the 1990s, died in a UN cell in 2006 before judges at his trial could reach verdicts.  Serge Brammertz, the prosecutor who finally brought both Karadzic and Mladic to justice, said Mladic "ranks among the most notorious war criminals in modern history" who abused his position of power to commit crimes including genocide.  "Mladic should be condemned by all responsible officials in the former Yugoslavia and around the world," Brammertz said. "His name should be consigned to the list of history's most depraved and barbarous figures."  US President Joe Biden said the "historic judgment shows that those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. It also reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world."  "My thoughts today are with all the surviving families of the many victims of Mladic's atrocities. We can never erase the tragedy of their deaths, but I hope today's judgment provides some solace to all those who are grieving," a statement from Biden said.  The court also rejected an appeal by prosecutors of Mladic's acquittal on one other count of genocide linked to ethnic purges early in the war.  As commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, the once-swaggering Mladic led troops responsible for atrocities ranging from "ethnic cleansing" campaigns to the siege of Sarajevo and the war's bloody climax in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.  In Sarajevo, applause broke out among those watching the proceedings. Mayor Benjamina Karic called it "a day of justice" for Sarajevo, Bosnia and innocent victims of the war.  Mladic's toxic legacy continues to divide Bosnia and his dark shadow has spread far beyond the Balkans.  To Serbs in Bosnia, he is a war hero who fought to protect his people. To Bosniaks, mostly Muslims, he will always be a villain responsible for their wartime suffering and losses.  Nedziba Salihovic, who lost her son and husband in the bloodshed, watched the court hearing on a large screen in Srebrenica.  "This means a lot to me, my heart is racing," she said. "He was punished. It is not important where he'll end up (to serve his sentence). Like mothers of Srebrenica, he'll spend the rest of his life without his family."  Bosnian Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik blasted the final verdict as "selective justice" and "satanization of Serbs" which will only deepen the existing ethnic divide in Bosnia so many years after the war.  "The court did not prove Mladic's direct guilt," Dodik said. "It is clear that genocide in Srebrenica never happened."  Mladic's son, Darko, who was part of his defense team, said in The Hague: ''This traveling circus (the tribunal) has finished its job like it started. The general had no chance of a fair trial."  Mladic was first indicted in July 1995. After the war in Bosnia ended, he went into hiding and was finally arrested in 2011 and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia by the then-ruling pro-Western government of Serbia.  The judgment was welcomed as "an important affirmation of the rule of law" by Kathryne Bomberger, director-general of the International Commission on Missing Persons that helped locate and identify victims of atrocities in Bosnia.  "Ramifications of the judgment in case of Mladic and in previous cases, such as that of Radovan Karadzic, go beyond the Western Balkans. This gives hope to survivors of atrocity, including families of the missing and disappeared persons around the world, that justice can be delivered," Bomberger said.  Amnesty International's Europe Director Nils Muižniek said the ruling "sends a powerful message around the world that impunity cannot, and will not, be tolerated."  Nedzad Avdic, who survived a mass execution in Srebrenica, said he was satisfied "even though nothing can erase what we've been through nor bring back our dead."  The judgment "will make denying the crimes more difficult. This and other verdicts will be the starting point for anyone who cares about truth," he added.  The shadow of Mladic and Karadzic has spread far beyond the Balkans. They have been revered by foreign far-right supporters for their bloody wartime campaigns.  The Australian who shot dead dozens of Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 was believed to be inspired by the wartime Bosnian Serb leaders, as was Anders Breivik, the Norwegian white supremacist who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011.  The U.N. tribunal that initially indicted Mladic has since shut its doors. His appeal and other legal issues left over from the tribunal were being dealt with by the U.N.'s International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, which is housed in the same building as the now-defunct court for the former Yugoslavia.  Outside the court, another mother from Srebrenica, Munira Subasic had a message for young people in Serbia and the Serb part of Bosnia.  She urged them to study the court's judgments and indictments, and "stop hating and create a better future for themselves and our children."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/bosnian-serb-commander-ratko-mladic-loses-genocide-appeal/articleshow/83352248.cms||---

"When you own the railroad or the electric company or the cellphone tower, you have to treat everyone the same and give everybody access," Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement.  The lawsuit, which estimates that Google is used for nearly 90% of internet searches and has 95% of the search share on mobile devices, accuses Google of responding to certain search requests in a way that prioritizes Google's products even if other responses would give better answers.  "Google uses its dominance of internet search to steer Ohioans to Google's own products - that's discriminatory and anti-competitive," Yost said.  A Google spokesperson said the company would defend itself in court.  "Google Search is designed to provide people with the most relevant and helpful results. ... Ohioans simply don't want the government to run Google like a gas or electric company. This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law," the spokesperson's statement said.  The lawsuit seeks no monetary damages but asks the court to require Google to refrain from prioritizing its own products. It alleges that nearly two-thirds of Google searches in 2020 were done without leaving Google's platform.  "It often features Google products and services in attractive formats at the top of the Results page above organic search results. Additionally, Google often presents Google products in enhanced ways in the search results that are designed to capture more clicks," the lawsuit states.  The lawsuit was filed in the common pleas court, Delaware County, in Ohio. It is one of several filed by the federal government and state attorneys general against big tech platforms Google and Facebook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ohio-sues-to-have-google-declared-a-public-utility/articleshow/83352556.cms||---
---||World||UK urges EU to show 'common sense' in post-Brexit talks||LONDON: The UK's chief negotiator called on the European Union to show "pragmatism and common sense," instead of threatening to retaliate, as the two sides meet to resolve differences over the deal that was supposed to keep trade flowing after Brexit.  David Frost made the comments after his EU counterpart said the bloc was ready to act "firmly and resolutely" if the UK fails to honor its commitments under the divorce agreement. The two men are scheduled to meet Wednesday in London amid rising tensions over implementation of the deal in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK that shares a land border with the bloc.  Central to the talks are provisions of the deal that effectively created a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, angering many pro-British residents of the island. While Britain has called for compromise, the EU says the new rules are needed to protect the bloc's single market.  Both sides fear the tensions could fuel a return to violence in Northern Ireland.  "Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won't make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can't buy their favorite product," Frost said, referring to a town in Northern Ireland. "What is needed is pragmatism and common sense solutions to resolve the issues as they are before us. This work is important, and it is ever more urgent."  The divorce deal, which took effect on Jan. 1, included a number of grace periods that gave Britain time to put in place new systems to check a variety of goods coming into Northern Ireland to ensure they comply with EU rules. Those grace periods are now ending, causing headaches for businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland.  The UK angered Brussels earlier this year when it unilaterally extended the grace period covering many supermarket items, delaying the required inspections for six months. The EU has threatened legal action over that decision.  The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, reported Tuesday that the UK may also extend the grace period covering chilled meats such as sausages and ground beef, which is scheduled to end at the end of this month.  Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief negotiator, cautioned against such action, saying the two sides should strive to achieve "mutually agreed compliance paths."  "If this does not happen, and if the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations," Sefcovic wrote Tuesday in the Telegraph.  While Sefcovic didn't specify what those actions might be, the Times of London quoted an unidentified EU official as saying the bloc was ready to impose trade sanctions and retaliatory tariffs.  Sefcovic described the so-called Northern Ireland protocol as an opportunity that will give the region access to more than 500 million customers in both the UK and European Union.  But Frost said compromise is needed to make this a reality. The UK has sent 10 papers to the EU offering solutions to many of the issues that divide the two sides, but has received no written responses from the bloc, he said.  "When I meet Maros Sefcovic later today my message will be clear: time is short and practical solutions are needed now to make the Protocol work," Frost said.  Britain accused the EU of taking an unnecessarily "purist approach" to the new rules.  "There's no case whatsoever for preventing chilled meats from being sold in Northern Ireland," said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman, Max Blain. "We are working very hard to try and resolve these issues consensually,"  "Time is starting to run out and solutions are urgently needed," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-urges-eu-to-show-common-sense-in-post-brexit-talks/articleshow/83352755.cms||---

The fugitive businessman — who lived in a lavish villa, flew in private jets, sported Rolex and drove a Silver Toyota Mark X car — is now down to washing his clothes in prison. Meanwhile, the Choksi kidnap drama continues to unfold in mysterious ways, with new revelations establishing that the Indian jeweller was in fact honey-trapped and kidnapped. What has added to the mystery is the involvement of several suspicious figures who were allegedly involved in the abduction plot.

TOI is in possession of the report as also the one filed by Choksi himself before the Dominica police on June 2.

He has also alleged that the mystery woman Barbara Jabarica, with whom he had developed "friendly terms," was in connivance with the“I was not even given a change of clothes for the first few days (of his arrest in Dominica),” the fugitive diamantaire lamented in his five-page submission. “After 2-3 days, they gave me some clothes but even then I would have to clean them myself and hang them out to dry. I was taken to a holding cell at a police station in Roseau. This holding cell did not even have the basic necessities of a mattress and was barely 20 square feet in size,” he noted. Choksi claimed that he was denied proper medical treatment and was not given the meals he had specifically requested for. “My only source of interaction (in the police custody), was limited to a local official who asked what I would like to have, and upon answering that I would like to have fruits, I was denied the same,” he said. Choksi claimed that Barbara Jabarica, Narender Singh/Arminder Singh and Gurmit Singh were behind the abduction plot and would not have "thought twice before killing him". “Looking back I have no doubts that the agents if given enough reason and opportunity, would not have thought twice before killing me. They seemed detached from the realm of law and procedure. I would further like to place on record that the only way those agents could have had access to some private information regarding my household and schedule, would have been through the assistance of co-conspirator Ms Barbara Jabarica, who was instrumental in my landing up in this present predicament.” The police report also mentions Barbara, the mystery woman about whom much has been written. Curiously enough, the police report also mentions a mystery man, who arrived in Antigua a few days prior to the abduction and flew out two hours after Choksi was picked up. Inspector Henry’s report reads: “Investigation has revealed a series of suspicious activities leading up to Choksi’s disappearance. Gurdip Bath travelling on a Kittitian diplomatic passport checked in to Cocobay hotel (in Jolly Harbour) on May 19. He checked out May 21. He later returned and checked for an additional day. Bath was seen in the company of Barbara. Bath flew out of Antigua at 7.25 pm, two hours after Choksi went missing.” About Gurmit, the police say: “Gurmit Singh arrived in Antigua on April 10 by sea. Police have found him to be one of the passengers of Calliope of Arne, the vessel that ferried Choksi to Dominica.” The report said the vessel in which Choksi was taken was berthed in a way that a wheelchair could roll into it. “On May 19, Calliope of Arne a St Lucian registered vessel captained by Foster Haynes, requested to be berthed sideways so that they could accommodate a passenger who is wheelchair-bound. Permission was granted. Following day, the board left the dock,” the report said. Choksi was kidnapped on a wheelchair. The abduction came to light after Choksi’s wife, Priti Kothari, noted that he had not seen her WhatsApp message for four hours and his phone was switched off. At 11.55pm on Sunday, she reported to the police that her husband was missing since 5.12pm. He had told her he was going to Sheer Rocks restaurant to watch the sunset. However, he resurfaced only by the sunrise in neighbouring Dominica.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-angles-emerge-as-police-report-sheds-light-on-mehul-choksi-abduction-drama/articleshow/83351677.cms||Vijay Tagore

The guidelines for the revised vaccination policy announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, where the Centre will procure vaccines for eligible adults above 18, state that the priority categorisation will apply to vaccines it procures but states may decide their own prioritisation factoring in supply schedules. According to a government release, private hospitals will charge a maximum of Rs 780 for a shot of Covishield, Rs 1,410 for Covaxin and Rs 1,145 for Sputnik V.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Coronavirus: Live updatesThe NHA's role is to ensure small and remote private hospitals get timely and equitable access to vaccines and states are to aid the process by aggregating demand keeping in mind regional balance and size of establishments. The formula for the Centre's allocation to states is largely unchanged, going by caseload, population and negative marks for wastage. Under the new policy that restores the Centre's role in procuring vaccines for all states, barring a 25% quota of domestic production for private hospitals, the government will make all efforts to provide a 15-day advance schedule of supplies. The Centre will provide, as well as foot the bill, for free vaccinations for all over 18 at government facilities. Importantly, all government and private vaccination centres will provide walk-in registration facility for individuals as well as groups of people. "All citizens irrespective of their income status are entitled to free vaccination. Those who have the ability to pay are encouraged to use a private hospital’s vaccination centre," the guidelines said. There will also be non-transferable electronic vouchers to encourage people to help with vaccination of the economically weaker section. These vouchers can be redeemed only at private vaccination centres. "The revised programme provides states with additional central government support across funding, procurement and logistics. It also facilitates scientific prioritisation, wider access, harnessing of private sector capacity and flexibility at the state and local level," the health ministry said.

Steven Brandenburg, 46, of Grafton, pleaded guilty in February to two felony counts of attempting to tamper with a consumer product. He had admitted to intentionally removing the doses manufactured by Moderna from a refrigerator for hours at Aurora Medical Center in Grafton, located just north of Milwaukee.  In a statement before receiving his sentence, Brandenburg said he felt "great shame" and accepted responsibility for his actions. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported he apologized to his co-workers, family and the community.  Aurora destroyed most of the tampered doses, but not before 57 people received inoculations from the supply. Those doses are believed to have still been effective, but weeks of uncertainty created a storm of anger, anxiety and anguish among the recipients, according to court documents.  Prosecutors asked for a sentence of three years and five months. Brandenburg faced a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment at $250,000 in fines for each felony count.  Brandenburg is an admitted conspiracy theorist who believes he is a prophet and vaccines are a product of the devil. He also professed a belief that the Earth is flat and the 9/11 terrorist attacks were faked.  Brandenburg also secretly substituted saline for flu vaccine that he was mandated to receive and persuaded several co-workers to secretly swap saline for their flu vaccine as well, according to court filings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ex-wisconsin-pharmacist-gets-prison-for-ruining-vaccine/articleshow/83353184.cms||---

A study of contribution reports of various electoral trusts for FY20 shows BJP walked away with donations worth Rs 276.45 crore, including Rs 217.75 crore from Prudent, Rs 45.95 crore from Jankalyan Electoral Trust, Rs 9 crore from A B General Electoral Trust and Rs 3.75 crore from Samaj Electoral Trust. Congress got Rs 58 crore donations, of which Rs 31 crore came from Prudent Electoral Trust, Rs 25 crore from Jankalyan Electoral Trust and Rs 2 crore from Samaj Electoral Trust. Read AlsoCongress income fell by 25% in FY20, expenditure doubledCongress's income in 2019-20 declined by 25% to Rs 682 crore as compared to 2018-19, while its expenditure more than doubled to Rs 998 crore from Rs 470 crore over this period, according to its annual audit report for 2019-20 submitted to the EC.​The party's receipts worth Rs 682 crore in the yearAmong 35 recognised state parties that submitted their annual audit reports for 2019-20 to the Election Comission so far, TRS has reported the highest income at 130.46 crore, followed by Shiv Sena with total receipts of Rs 111.4 crore, YSRCP with Rs 92.7 crore, BJD with Rs 90.35 crore, AIADMK Rs 89.6 crore, DMK Rs 64.90 crore and AAP Rs 49.65 crore. The incomes of parties reported include all sources, including donations recieved through electoral trusts. Congress’s overall income was Rs 682 crore for 2019-20, which was a fall of 25% over the previous year. The trend of electoral bonds contributing a good chunk of income of various regional parties in 2019-20 continues, with TRS declaring Rs 89.15 crore through this route, YSRCP Rs 74.35 crore, BJD Rs 50.5 crore, DMK Rs 45.5 crore, Shiv Sena Rs 40.98 crore and AAP Rs 17.76 crore.

The so-called Telegraph Fire, straddling two counties, has burned 112 square miles (290 square kilometers) and is at zero containment. The blaze was first reported Friday south of Superior in Pinal County, about 60 miles (96.6 kilometers) east of Phoenix.  Residents in neighboring Gila County, which includes Globe, Miami and smaller communities, have been in various stages of the evacuation process. The town of Miami is among those under an evacuation order.  At least 2,500 homes in Gila County have been evacuated, said Carl Melford, the county emergency manager. He estimated that there are twice as many households who are in "set" mode with bags packed just in case.  "Over the past three years, we've had some pretty extreme fire seasons," said Melford, who has bags at his front door. "We've become very familiar with the process with what it takes to evacuate a community. But this is the largest evacuation to date."  Becky Stephenson, 37, whose Globe home sits on a hill near the US Highway 60, is feet away from a zone under "set" status. Still, she decided to have essentials including her pet parrot, Buddy, and his travel cage ready to go.  Watching flames climb trees Monday night from her home as the fire made its way into the Pinal Mountains and create an eerie orange glow was surreal, Stephenson said.  "Honestly, it just makes me feel like I can't wait till they get it under control and I can go out and start helping them revegetate," said Stephenson, who is a plant biologist. "It's just really sad to think about all of the torched plants and all of animals that lost their habitat during breeding season."  Meanwhile, Superior residents remain in "set" mode. But about 400 people in nearby Top-Of-The-World have been evacuated, said Lauren Reimer, a Pinal County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman.  Officials with the American Red Cross say 90 residents in total stayed Monday at shelters in Globe and Mesa.  The fire was human-caused. But fire officials have not shared further details.  Several miles east of the wildfire, the smaller Mescal Fire was at 23% containment Tuesday. Fire officials lifted evacuation orders for residents of the community of San Carlos and in the areas of Soda Canyon and Coyote Flats. But the community of East El Capitan was still on mandatory evacuation.  The fire has burned nearly 105 square miles (13 square kilometers) - mostly desert brush, oak and grass. It was first reported June 2 southeast of Globe.  The cause is still under investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rural-arizona-residents-wait-as-wildfire-spreads-uncontained/articleshow/83353253.cms||---
---||World||Senate aims to boost tech industry in competition with China||WASHINGTON: The Senate was on pace to approve legislation Tuesday that aims to boost US semiconductor production and the development of artificial intelligence and other technology in the face of growing competition internationally, most notably from China. The centerpiece of the bill is a $50 billion emergency allotment to the Commerce Department to stand up semiconductor development and manufacturing through research and incentive programs previously authorized by Congress. The bill's overall cost would increase spending by about $250 billion with most of the spending occurring in the first five years. Supporters described it as the biggest investment in scientific research that the country has seen in decades. It comes as the nation's share of semiconductor manufacturing globally has steadily eroded from 37% in 1990 to about 12% now, and as a chip shortage has exposed vulnerabilities in the US supply chain. The support for the bill demonstrates how confronting China economically is a mission that unites both parties in Congress. That's a rarity in an era of division as pressure grows on Democrats to change Senate rules to push past obstruction and gridlock. “The premise is simple, if we want American workers and American companies to keep leading the world, the federal government must invest in science, basic research and innovation, just as we did decades after the Second World War,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “Whoever wins the race to the technologies of the future is going to be the global economic leader with profound consequences for foreign policy and national security as well.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the bill was incomplete because it did not incorporate more Republican-sponsored amendments. He nonetheless supported it. “Needless to say, final passage of this legislation cannot be the Senate's final word on our competition with China," he said. “It certainly won't be mine.” Senators slogged through days of debates and amendments leading up to Tuesday's final vote. Schumer's office said 18 Republican amendments will have received votes before the expected final passage of the bill. It also said the Senate this year has already held as many roll call votes on amendments than it did in the last Congress, when the Senate was under Republican control. While the bill enjoys bipartisan support, a core group of GOP senators has reservations about its costs. One of the bill's provisions would create a new directorate focused on artificial intelligence and quantum science with the National Science Foundation. The bill would authorize up to $29 billion over five years for the new branch within the foundation with an additional $52 billion for its programs. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Congress should be cutting the foundation's budget, not increasing it. He called the agency “the king of wasteful spending." The agency finances about a quarter of all federally supported research conducted by America's colleges and universities. Senators have tried to strike a balance when calling attention to China's growing influence. They want to avoid fanning divisive anti-Asian rhetoric when hate crimes against Asian Americans have spiked during the coronavirus pandemic. Other measures spell out national security concerns and target money-laundering schemes or cyberattacks by entities on behalf of the Chinese government. There are also “buy America” provisions for infrastructure projects in the US Senators added provisions that reflect shifting attitudes toward China's handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. One would prevent federal money for the Wuhan Institute of Virology as fresh investigations proceed into the origins of the virus and possible connections to the lab's research. The city registered some of the first coronavirus cases. It's unclear whether the measure will find support in the Democratic-led House, where the Science Committee is expected to soon consider that chamber's version. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who has been working with Schumer for two years on legislation that's included in the bill, called it the biggest investment in science and technology since the Apollo spaceflight program a half century ago. “I'm quite certain we will get a really good product on the president's desk," Schumer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-aims-to-boost-tech-industry-in-competition-with-china/articleshow/83353214.cms||---
---||India||Anup Chandra Pandey appointed election commissioner||NEW DELHI: The President of India on Tuesday appointed retired IAS officer and former chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh Anup Chandra Pandey as the election commissioner. One post of election commissioner in the three-member EC was vacant since the Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora’s tenure ended in mid-April and Sushil Chandra was elevated as CEC. A gazette notification said that the appointment of Pandey, who belonged to the 1984 batch of IAS, would take effect from the date he assumes office. Pandey’s appointment in the EC comes months ahead of next round of assembly polls due in 2022. While the term of the state assemblies in Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur is expiring in March 2022, the UP assembly term ends in May 2022. Interestingly, both CEC Sushil Chandra and election commissioner Rajiv Kumar hail from UP. While Chandra is a retired IRS officer, Kumar was a 1984 batch IAS officer from Jharkhand cadre. With Pandey, who retired as UP chief secretary in August 2019, now joining the EC, all three members of poll body have a UP link and will be overseeing conduct of polls in the politically-crucial state next year. If the convention of elevating the seniormost election commissioner as CEC is adhered to, Kumar will be CEC when Chandra retires in May next year and shall hold the top post until he turns 65 in February 2025. Incidentally, Pandey who is elder to Kumar, will be completing his tenure in EC after attaining 65 years of age in August 2024.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/anup-chandra-pandey-appointed-election-commissioner/articleshow/83353275.cms||Bharti Jain

Casey Garcia, 30, was arrested on one count each of criminal trespass and tampering with government records, El Paso County Sheriff's Office officials said. She also was arrested on an unrelated traffic warrant. Deputies were notified June 1 by San Elizario Independent School District officials of Garcia trespassing on school grounds and posing as a student, the sheriff's department said. Several posts on social media showing her pretending to be a student led to an investigation, the El Paso Times reported. She was arrested at her home in San Elizario. In a YouTube video titled, "Why I posed as my 13 year old daughter. A raw but real answer,'' she says she dyed her hair and used skin tanner. Garcia said she did it "for a social experiment." Garcia made it to seven out of eight classes before being recognized by a teacher. She says she was only asked for her identification number before she was allowed inside the school building, and teachers and staff were more concerned about her phone being out than in who she actually was. "I exposed the dangers of our schools and I am trying to protect my children and yours," she said, noting that she didn't do this for any other reason except to prove a point. "Are you more concerned that I, a parent, was sitting next to your child or do we really want to wait for the next person taking their Second Amendment right to the extreme?" she said. Garcia was booked on Friday into the El Paso County Jail on bonds totaling $7,908. A jail log shows she was released later that day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/texas-mom-says-she-posed-as-student-to-push-for-security/articleshow/83353319.cms||---

If that sounds difficult, Uttar Pradesh will need to achieve a nine-fold jump in daily vaccination, Bihar more than eight-fold and Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Assam about seven-fold. How have we arrived at these numbers? TOI looked at the 18-plus population in states for 2021 as estimated by the Census office. That gave us a number for how many doses each state must administer to reach the year-end target. We then looked at how much has been done so far and what the average per day over the 143 days of the vaccination campaign so far has been. Since we know how much has been done, we know how much remains to be done. Starting Tuesday, there were 207 days left in the year. That gave us the average needed for the rest of the year for full vaccination of all adults in each state. Read AlsoCovid vaccination drive: Priority for 45+, those needing 2nd jabs; states can tweak normThe vaccination programme will retain priority categorisation for health workers, frontline workers, 45-plus people and those due for second doses followed by the 18-44 age group while also facilitating supply and payment for jabs procured by private hospitals through the National Health Authority'sThe conclusions are sobering. Uttar Pradesh has so far, in a little under five months, given the first shot to less than 12% of its adult population and the second shot to just 2.5% at an average of 1.4 lakh doses a day. That leaves it needing to administer 13.2 lakh doses a day to meet the target, which is a nine-fold jump. Similarly, Bihar, which has given first shots to 12.6% and second shots to 2.5%, will need to raise its daily vaccination from 78,000 doses a day to 6.6 lakh a day, or 8.4 times. At the other end of the spectrum, Himachal Pradesh has vaccinated 38.1% of its adult population and fully vaccinated 7.9%. It will have to raise its average daily vaccination from about 18,000 a day to 41,000 a day, a little more than double. Kerala, which has vaccinated 31% and fully vaccinated 8.1% of its adult population, will need to raise daily vaccination levels a relatively modest 2.8 times to meet the December 31 target. Five of the country’s six most populous states in terms of 18-plus population face the task of raising the daily vaccination levels five-fold or more. These are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. The exception is Maharashtra, which has the second largest population of adults after UP, and needs to raise its daily vaccination 4.5 times. The others states in the top 10 in terms of adult populations – Rajasthan, Karnataka, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh in that order, will need to raise average daily vaccinations about three to four-fold, not an easy task but far less than daunting than what UP and Bihar need to do.

Federal prosecutors said Joshua Hall, 22, raised thousands of dollars by falsely claiming that Trump's family backed his work for a political group supporting a second term for Trump.  The group did not exist, and Hall spent money he raised on personal expenses, prosecutors said.  Hall, of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, was arrested on Tuesday and charged with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted.  A federal public defender representing Hall did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Prosecutors said Hall styled himself on social media as a strong Trump supporter with close ties to Trump's family, and attracted more than 100,000 followers.  In one alleged impersonation by Hall last August, Trump's then 14-year-old son Barron appeared to describe Hall as his "friend and partner" and said, "Josh is an amazing patriot who is doing tremendous things for our great country. He has my COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT!"  Last December, Hall told The New York Times he was surprised when Donald Trump tweeted thanks to his sister Elizabeth Trump Grau after an article said she had joined Twitter to support his effort to overturn the 2020 election results. The newspaper said the Twitter account that prompted the article was Hall's.  "I was like, 'Oh, my goodness. He actually thinks it's his sister,'" Hall told the newspaper.  Hall also said there was "no nefarious intention" behind the deception, and he was simply trying to rally Trump supporters and "have fun."  Prosecutors said a crowdfunding website that hosted Hall's bogus political group closed his account after he failed to show where money he raised was going.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-accuses-man-of-fraud-for-posing-as-trump-family-members/articleshow/83353370.cms||---

Barbara claimed Choksi aggressively wooed her over the past year with presents of diamond bracelets and rings that turned out to be fake, as well as offering to help her start an online diamond trading business and, when the original pitch did not work, a real estate project. She rejected the charge levelled by Choksi’s wife Priti that she was part of a spy ring, or connived with Indian agents to abduct him and whisk him out of Antigua on May 23, torturing him all through the yacht trip. Meanwhile, the Dominica high court has adjourned the bail hearing of fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi till June 11, local media reports stated on Wednesday. Choksi had approached the high court after the magistrate rejected his bail petition. "I had hundreds of opportunities driving alone with him on the island and walking with him. If I wanted to abduct him, why would I do it at my home at busy daytime hours when everyone was there on the street, walking," she said, an assertion which undercuts the plank of Choksi's legal team that their client was kidnapped and dumped on the beach of Dominica.

---||Business||Explained: Why top US websites went offline for an hour||NEW DELHI: An outage at a little-known firm that speeds up access to websites knocked a lot of top internet destinations offline on Tuesday. The hour-long Fastly outage disrupted business and leisure for untold millions globally. The problem was quickly resolved. The company blamed a configuration error in its technology. Here's what happened and how ...The failure at Fastly sent vast swaths of the web offline on Tuesday. News websites including CNN, the New York Times and Bloomberg News, services such as Amazon.com Shopify and Stripe, plus sites as large as Spotify and Reddit all went offline. UK government digital services were also unavailable for a period. Major sites began reporting problems around 10:30 am UK time on Tuesday, according to Downdetector, which tracks service interruptions. What is Fastly?Fastly, based in San Francisco, isn't a household name, but its "edge server" computing technology is used by many of the world's most popular websites. Even the British government is one of the clients. The company provides what's called a content delivery network - an arrangement that allows customer websites to store data such as images and videos on various mirror servers across 26 countries so that the data is closer to users, and thus shows up faster. Many of Fastly's customers are news sites that use its technology to update their websites with breaking news. Buzzfeed, for example, used Fastly to cut the time its users took to reach the site by half. Fastly had $290.9 million in revenues last year. What was the issue?Fastly identified the issue with its content delivery network and announced that it was rolling out a fix just 46 minutes after acknowledging there was a problem. Sites began to spring back to life soon afterward. "We identified a service configuration that triggered disruptions across our POPs globally and have disabled that configuration. Our global network is coming back online," it said. However, the incident led to Fastly's traffic dropping 75% for about an hour just as the US East Coast was beginning to stir. Are other parts of the internet similarly vulnerable?Like the content distribution network world, cloud computing - when computing services are entrusted to a remote provider - is dominated by just a few major players led by Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft. Amazon, the biggest cloud provider, periodically has brief outages, which are a big deal for customers. "And if it became a major outage of, say, more than six, eight hours - but days - it could put companies out of business," said Josh Cheesman, an analyst with the tech market researcher Gartner Inc. The question is: What could cause such a serious outage that might destroy customer data? A major cyberattack is one possibility. Another is fire or catastrophic natural disaster. These businesses, after all, are based in datacenters. In March, a fire at a datacenter in Strasbourg, France, owned by a major cloud computing firm knocked out service to millions of websites. Was this a hack?There is no evidence to suggest Fastly’s issues on Tuesday were the result of a malicious cyberattack. But widespread outages are often the result of hackers, and are not always the fault of the companies hosting content. For instance, in 2016, millions of internet users lost access to some of the world’s most popular websites after hackers compromised Domain Name System service provider Dyn Inc.. That knocked offline sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and The New York Times. Users often see no difference between a distributed-denial-of-service attack or a content delivery network failure. Each can mean the user sees a “server not found” error or a blank page, leaving them unable to access the site. More malicious hacks hijack websites in an attempt to extort users with ransomware.

---||World||Senate report details broad failures around January 6 attack||WASHINGTON: A Senate investigation of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol found a broad intelligence breakdown across multiple agencies, along with widespread law enforcement and military failures that led to the violent attack.  There were clear warnings and tips that supporters of former President Donald Trump, including right-wing extremist groups, were planning to "storm the Capitol" with weapons and possibly infiltrate the tunnel system underneath the building. But that intelligence never made it up to top leadership.  The result was chaos. A Senate report released Tuesday details how officers on the front lines suffered chemical burns, brain injuries and broken bones, among other injuries, after fighting the attackers, who quickly overwhelmed them and broke into the building. Officers told the Senate investigators they were left with no leadership or direction when command systems broke down.  The Senate report is the first - and could be the last - bipartisan review of how hundreds of Trump supporters were able to push violently past security lines and break into the Capitol that day, interrupting the certification of Joe Biden's presidential election victory. The failures detailed in the report highlighted how, almost 20 years after the Sept. 11 attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies are still beset by a fundamental issue: a failure of imagination.  The report recommends immediate changes to give the Capitol Police chief more authority, to provide better planning and equipment for law enforcement and to streamline intelligence gathering among federal agencies.  But as a bipartisan effort, the report does not delve into the root causes of the attack, including Trump's role as he called for his supporters to "fight like hell" to overturn his election defeat that day. It does not call the attack an insurrection, even though it was. And it comes two weeks after Republicans blocked a bipartisan, independent commission that would investigate the insurrection more broadly.  "This report is important in the fact that it allows us to make some immediate improvements to the security situation here in the Capitol," said Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, the chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which conducted the probe along with the Senate Rules Committee. "But it does not answer some of the bigger questions that we need to face, quite frankly, as a country and as a democracy."  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that the findings show an even greater need for a bipartisan commission to investigate the root causes of the attack, referring to Trump's unfounded claims about the 2020 election.  "As the 'big lie' continues to spread, as faith in our elections continues to decline, it is crucial - crucial - that we establish a trusted, independent record of what transpired," said Schumer, D-N.Y.  But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who led the blockade against such a commission, said he's confident the ongoing reviews by lawmakers and law enforcement will be sufficient.  The House in May passed legislation to create a commission that would be modeled after a panel that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told colleagues in a letter Tuesday that if the Senate fails to approve the commission, her chamber will launch its own investigations.  The top Republican on the rules panel, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, has opposed the commission, arguing that investigation would take too long. He said the recommendations made in the Senate can be implemented faster, such as legislation that he and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the rules committee chair, intend to introduce soon that would give the chief of Capitol Police more authority to request assistance from the National Guard.  The Senate report recounts how the Guard was delayed for hours Jan. 6 as officials in multiple agencies took bureaucratic steps to release the troops. It details hours of calls between officials in the Capitol and the Pentagon and as the then-chief of the Capitol Police, Steven Sund, begged for help.  It finds that the Pentagon spent hours "mission planning" and seeking multiple layers of approvals as Capitol Police were being overwhelmed and brutally beaten by the attackers. It also says the Defense Department's hesitant response was influenced by criticism of its heavy-handed response to protests in the summer of 2020 after the killing of George Floyd in police custody.  The senators are heavily critical of the Capitol Police Board, a three-member panel made up of the heads of security for the House and Senate and the Architect of the Capitol. The board now is required to approve requests by the police chief, even in urgent situations. The report recommends that its members "regularly review the policies and procedures" after senators found that the three board members on Jan. 6 did not understand their own authority and could not detail the statutory requirements for requesting National Guard assistance.  Two of the three board members, the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, were pushed out in the days after the attack. Sund, the Capitol Police chief, resigned under pressure.  The report recommends a consolidated intelligence unit within the Capitol Police after widespread failures from multiple agencies that did not predict the attack even though insurrectionists were planning it openly on the internet.  The police intelligence unit "knew about social media posts calling for violence at the Capitol on January 6, including a plot to breach the Capitol, the online sharing of maps of the Capitol Complex's tunnel systems, and other specific threats of violence," the report says, but agents did not properly inform leaders of everything they had found.  On Dec. 28, for example, the report notes that someone emailed a public Capitol Police account and warned about "countless tweets from Trump supporters saying they will be armed on January 6th" and "tweets from people organizing to 'storm the Capitol.'" There were also internal warnings of an uptick in posts on various websites that showed maps of the Capitol, including its underground tunnels. But those specifics were never disseminated widely.  In a response to the report, the Capitol Police acknowledged the need for improvements and said some are already being made. "Law enforcement agencies across the country rely on intelligence, and the quality of that intelligence can mean the difference between life and death," the statement said.  During the attack, the report says, Capitol Police were compromised by bad intelligence, poor planning, faulty equipment and a lack of leadership. The force's incident command system "broke down during the attack," leaving officers on the front lines without orders. There were no functional incident commanders, and some senior officers were fighting instead of giving orders. Capitol Police "leadership never took control of the radio system to communicate orders to front-line officers," the investigation found.  "I was horrified that NO deputy chief or above was on the radio or helping us," one officer told the committee in an anonymous statement. "For hours the screams on the radio were horrific(,) the sights were unimaginable and there was a complete loss of control. ... For hours NO Chief or above took command and control. Officers were begging and pleading for help for medical triage."  The acting chief, Yogananda Pittman, who replaced Sund after his resignation, told the committees that the lack of communication resulted from "incident commanders being overwhelmed and engaging with rioters, rather than issuing orders over the radio."  The committee's interviews with police officers detail "absolutely brutal" abuse from Trump's supporters as they ran over them and broke into the building. The officers described hearing racial slurs and seeing Nazi salutes. One officer trying to evacuate the Senate said he had stopped several men in full tactical gear, one of whom said, "You better get out of our way, boy, or we'll go through you to get (the senators).'"  The insurrectionists told police officers they would kill them, then members of Congress.  At the same time, the senators acknowledge the officers' bravery, noting that one officer told them, "The officers inside all behaved admirably and heroically and, even outnumbered, went on the offensive and took the Capitol back."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senate-report-details-broad-failures-around-january-6-attack/articleshow/83353963.cms||---

Ease in compliance for the taxpayer should be our priority,” the minister tweeted hours after the launch of the portal on Monday evening. TIMES VIEWIncome tax portals are vital public utility things. Millions engage with them regularly and rely on them for tax-related work. Regular glitches in such facilities is a matter of concern and must be remedied urgently. Technology is meant to make things smoother, not become a problem itself.While Infosys did not comment on it, Nilekani replied on Twitter, assuring the government of full support. “The new e-filing portal will ease the filing process and enhance end user experience. @nsitharaman ji, we have observed some technical issues on day one, and are working to resolve them. @Infosys regrets these initial glitches and expects the system to stabilise during the week,” he said. A large number of users complained of their inability to log in, while others said that the site had crashed.

Almost immediately, memes surfaced on social media platforms. There were questions over the government taking up the issue on Twitter instead of resolving it with the company, tax department officials said that the Centre’s experience with the company in implementing the GST platform as well as upgrading the ministry of corporate affairs’ MCA 21 project may have played a part. In fact, with repeated complaints, Nilekani had to appear before the GST Council to address the concerns of the union and the state finance ministers. It came after a group of ministers headed by then Bihar deputy CM Sushil Modi had identified the problems and asked Infosys to fix them. Income tax authorities remained evasive on the reasons for the failure of the much-awaited portal, which had been pitched by the finance ministry as a major initiative. Tax department officials said that a part of the problem could have been due to the rush of visitors to the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fm-nirmala-sitharaman-flags-tax-portal-woes-to-infosys-online/articleshow/83354036.cms||---

Speaking at the start of their bilateral meeting at the Mexican national palace, Harris emphasized the longstanding "interdependence and interconnection" of the two nations.  Joined by her top foreign policy aides for the region, the two leaders met for over an hour in an elegant conference room at the palace, seated across from each other under a grand crystal chandelier.  Just prior to the meeting, Harris and Lopez Obrador watched as the Mexican foreign affairs secretary and the charge d'affaires of the US Embassy in Mexico signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at greater cooperation between the two countries on development programs in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.  Harris was slated to meet with female entrepreneurs and labor leaders in Mexico before heading back to Washington Tuesday night.  The visit to Mexico capped Harris' first foreign trip as vice president, a brief foray focused on dealing with the root causes of migration that brought her first to Guatemala on Monday. While in Guatemala, she met President Alejandro Giammattei. To coincide with their meeting, the Biden administration announced a number of new commitments to combat trafficking, smuggling, and corruption, as well as investments in economic development in the country.  Her visit to Mexico didn't yield any clear and concrete agreements; instead she emphasized the importance of the relationship.  Lopez Obrador remains a key but complicated ally in the Biden administration's efforts to curb the spike in migration at the US border.  While Lopez Obrador committed in a previous virtual meeting with Harris that the US can "count on us" to help address irregular migration, the Mexican president has in the past blamed President Joe Biden for the increase in migration at the border. And he was chummy with Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, despite that president's hardline border policies.  In May, he also accused the US of violating Mexico's sovereignty for giving money to non-governmental organizations that were critical of his government. Harris was looking to strengthen diplomatic relations with Mexico while addressing the core reasons why so many people from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras as well as Mexico are compelled to try to flee to the US.  The memorandum of understanding, according to special envoy Ricardo Zuniga, who traveled with Harris on the trip, marks a new level of cooperation between two countries that have "some of the same issues" concerning migration.  "It's very important to show that the United States and Mexico are collaborating and trying to improve conditions on the ground among our neighbors, because of the importance that other countries in Central America have for both of us," he told reporters traveling with Harris.  Some Democrats criticized the vice president Monday when she delivered a direct message to those considering leaving their homes and making the often dangerous trek to the U.S. border: "Do not come."  Her comments echoed those made by past US officials as they've tried to dissuade migrants from seeking to cross the border, as the U.S. faces unprecedented numbers of attempted border crossings. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called her comments "disappointing" and noted that it is legal to seek asylum.  Harris declined to respond directly to the criticism when reporters asked, saying only: "I'm really clear: we have to deal with the root causes and that is my hope. Period."  The administration said the meeting produced an agreement to have an economic dialogue in September on trade, telecommunications and supply chains.  As well, the US will devote $130 million over the next three years for labor reforms in Mexico and provide loans to bolster southern Mexico's economy. The two countries will also partner on human trafficking and economic programs addressing why people leave El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras for the US.  Her meeting with Lopez Obrador followed Mexico's midterm elections, which appeared to deliver a mixed result for the president's party in initial results.  Harris was not expected to address the results during her meeting with the president, but fallout from the bloody campaign loomed over the meeting. Nearly three dozen candidates or prospective candidates were killed as drug cartels sought to protect their interests.  The Mexican government's inability to provide security in parts of the country is of interest to the US in an immigration context, both for the people who are displaced by violence and the impact it has on a severely weakened economy trying to reemerge from the pandemic.  The increase in migration at the border has become one of the major challenges confronting Biden in the early months of his first term, with Republicans seizing on an issue they see as politically advantageous. Polls suggest Americans are less favorable toward Biden's approach to immigration than they are toward his policies on the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic.  They've tried to make Harris the face of that immigration policy, charging she and Biden are ignoring the issue because both have yet to visit the southern border. Harris told reporters she was focused on "tangible" results "as opposed to grand gestures."  Illegal border crossings have increased steadily since April 2020, after Trump introduced pandemic-related powers to deny migrants the opportunity to seek asylum, but further accelerated under Biden. The new president quickly scrapped many of Trump's hardline border policies - most notably the program that made asylum-seekers wait in Mexico, often in dangerous conditions, for court dates in US immigration court.  US border authorities encountered nearly 19,000 unaccompanied children in March, the highest on record. Overall, more than 170,000 encounters were reported on the border in April, the highest level in more than 20 years.  The numbers aren't directly comparable because getting stopped under pandemic-related authorities carries no legal consequences, resulting in many repeat crossings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/kamala-harris-engages-mexico-on-complexities-of-migration/articleshow/83354160.cms||---

In addition, it will spend around Rs 91,000 crore between May and November in supplying free food grains to more than 80 crore beneficiaries, instead of Rs 26,000 crore estimated for May and June. Put together, the Centre’s spending will rise by around 1.05 lakh crore over the budgeted figures. Although there are several variables on the cost of vaccines, including possible purchase from companies such as Pfizer as well as Biological E shots, government sources said that initial estimates point to an increase and assured that providing funds will not be a problem. Almost all state governments have promised free vaccination against the virus. With the Centre deciding to take up the entire tab, they stand to save money. The Centre has already taken parliamentary approval to spend Rs 35,000 crore on vaccines and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her budget speech that she will provide more funds, if needed. Although the government has made it clear that its priority is to ensure vaccines for all and food to the vulnerable sections, economists said the twin moves will impose additional cost on the exchequer, requiring the Centre to rework its calculations. Economists said the moves will incur an additional cost of 0.4-0.5% of GDP.

The social media platform said it has appointed a nodal contact person and a resident grievance officer “on a contractual basis”, while being in “advanced stages of finalizing” the role of chief compliance officer. The company said that it wants to abide by the IT Regulations, and would brief the government about its compliance within a week. The communication came after a stern warning from the government and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. “The law has already kicked in. It will not go indefinitely unpunished. Certainly, patience is not infinite,” he told TOI on May 31. The micro-blogging site said that Covid-19 made it difficult “as a practical matter to make certain arrangements necessary to comply with the guidelines within the stipulated time-frame”. The company has said that it will continue to have a constructive dialogue with the Indian government, and it “has been and remains deeply committed to India, and serving the vital public conversation taking place on the service.” Twitter and the IT ministry had been at loggerheads since the announcement of the new rules. On May 27, Twitter accused the Indian government of “dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles”. The government had shot back, accusing the company of deliberately subverting the law of the land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/twitter-falls-in-line-blames-covid-for-delay/articleshow/83354648.cms||---
---||World||Biden Asia chief 'relatively confident' on billion vaccine timing despite India crisis||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's policy coordinator for the Indo-Pacific said on Tuesday he was "relatively confident" a target for the production of a billion vaccine doses for the region by the end of 2022 would be met, despite the Covid-19 crisis in India, where they are due to be made. Asked at an online event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank if he expected a delay in the four-nation plan, which was announced at the White House in March with great fanfare, Kurt Campbell said Washington had been in close consultation with India and others involved in the project. "Obviously, this is an extremely difficult period for Indian friends. The United States has tried to stand with Delhi and to bring others, both in the private and public sector, to support them," he said. "Our discussions with both our partners in the private sector, and also in government, suggests that we are - knock on wood - still on track for 2022." "I think we're feeling relatively confident as we head in to 2022," he added, while stressing that across Asia and the world even countries that did well in handling the virus were facing outbreaks due to new strains. "I think we understand, the only way to be effective, to counter this, is through vaccine diplomacy. We're trying to step that up more generally," he said. The United States, India, Japan and Australia, a grouping known as the Quad, agreed at a March summit that Indian drugmaker Biological E Ltd would produce at least a billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022 that would go to Southeast Asian countries, elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, and beyond. India, the world's largest vaccine producer, was subsequently hit by a catastrophic wave of infections and halted vaccine exports amid intense criticism of Prime Minster Narendra Modi for a domestic vaccine rollout that covered less than 5% of his country's estimated adult population of 950 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-asia-chief-relatively-confident-on-billion-vaccine-timing-despite-india-crisis/articleshow/83354011.cms||---

As per the information available, the union government had made the request on June 6. The singer, who has over 1.2 million followers on Twitter, had been frequently tweeting in support of farmers protesting the government's agriculture laws of December 2020. The other prominent account belongs to Sukhdeep Singh Bhogal, a hip hop artist from Australia who goes by the stage name LFresh the Lion. Bhogal has over 5,600 followers. “When we receive a valid legal request, we review it under both the Twitter Rules and local law. If the content violates Twitter’s Rules, the content will be removed from the service. If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter Rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only,” a Twitter spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jazzy-bs-twitter-account-withheld-on-govt-request/articleshow/83354910.cms||Anam Ajmal
---||India||India protests security lapse outside mission in Islamabad||NEW DELHI: India has asked Pakistan to probe an alleged security breach outside the Indian high commission in Islamabad, TOI has learnt. Late last month, it's leant, the Indian mission noticed some strange activities outside the high commission building in the heavily guarded diplomatic enclave, a secure zone that remains out of bounds to general public. People were noticed unloading from a car boxes apparently containing Covid-19 relief items, including PPE kits. One of these people is then said to have clicked photos of others standing alongside the boxes, and with the high commission in the background, even though photography is prohibited in the area. They are also said to have been accompanied by some cops leading to a suspicion that the exercise might have been facilitated by local authorities. An average Pakistani national needs special permission to enter the area. Indian authorities have taken the incident very seriously as it comprises a security breach and have officially asked Pakistan for a probe into it. The motive behind the exercise remains unclear. It may be worth recalling here though that the Indian government has so far not responded to Pakistan's offer of help during India's devastating Covid-19 second wave. Calling it a gesture of solidarity with the people of India in the wake of the second wave, Pakistan had offered to provide relief support to India, including ventilators, on April 24. Islamabad had also called for exploring together ways to mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic. With ample assistance from Europe and the US, and even privately procured equipment from China, the Indian government didn't feel the need to accept Pakistan's offer. While ties between the 2 countries remain downgraded, cases of harassment of diplomats and other staff members have been few and far between in the recent past. India and Pakistan had halved the strengths of their respective missions last year following India's decision to downgrade ties. They have shown an inclination though to prevent the situation from deteriorating further by arriving at an agreement to approve all pending visas for diplomats and other staff members this month, as reported by TOI on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-protests-security-lapse-outside-mission-in-islamabad/articleshow/83355061.cms||Sachin Parashar

As the Covid pandemic continues its Black Swan disruption of the global economy, the vulnerability of organisations to stay afloat is apparent. Many were caught off guard and struggled to focus and organise teams for performance through remote working. But others moved through the maze of uncertainty and restrictions to deliver performance despite the same constraints and challenges of mobility, uncertainty, interdependence, proximity and business continuity. How can organisations remain high-performing despite adversities? What is in the nature of high-performance cultures? What is the secret sauce that enables ‘performance continuity’ even in the face of a crisis? Here are a few pointers: * Leadership matters in high-performance cultures: Leaders are the foundation on which high performance is built. In a high-performance culture, leaders drive goal execution and are a catalyst for team performance. But most of all, leaders set the bar high for performance through their own behaviour and actions. In the face of challenges, they role model all that they expect from teams — optimism, adaptability, flexibility, resilience, ingenuity, collaboration. Leaders motivate employees to do their best by being both their cheerleader and their coach. Tackling the challenges of a constantly turbulent environment calls for up-skilling and re-skilling the teams to be productive and competitive. The servant leadership style is most relevant as it emphasises on developing employees, providing emotional healing and support for communication, while developing savvy leaders for tomorrow who also become servant leaders in turn through the contagion generated. * Creating empowered & engaged employees with high-performance cultures: High-performance cultures enable distributed leadership authority and empowerment of teams. The current adversity has been an accelerator for decision-making moving closer to the challenge. Organisations with high-performance cultures do more than ‘say’, they want their teams to be empowered, they also ensure employees have the skills, knowledge and good judgment in making optimal decisions. High-performance cultures encourage employee voice to work on mistakes and encourage two-way feedback to help transparent and agile execution. * Building the learning organisation: Some organisations alarmingly pulled back on development investment during the crisis. Instead, high-performance organisations recognise the need to constantly upgrade and strengthen their world view, and increase focus on new learning and thought leadership in a crisis. Leaders emerge as coaches and are constantly scouting high performers across levels to create a deep bench of leadership capabilities for sustaining high performance in the future. * Adaptability & openness to change: High-performance organisations need to constantly keep pace with change within their own industries. They re-think strategies and re-invent jobs to pivot as needed. They are not afraid to rethink & recast work practices and internal processes to constantly embrace change, and to drive creative thinking and innovation. * Strong sense of ownership & accountability: This is vital to achieve the goals of the organisation. Working in silos and not sharing information across verticals is frowned upon. Collaboration is considered a key value and behaviour to deliver on promises to customers. They co-create solutions and demonstrate candour for upholding team norms while challenging group think where required. Building an ‘everybody culture’ for feedback is much desired in the knowledge economy, and high-performance cultures place a premium on employee voice. * Using breaks: High-performance cultures in these times of stress, anxiety and fatigue must invariably include creating mindful breaks and breathing spaces for teams to refresh and recharge positive energies for performance. Purposeful pauses supporting check-ins with self are key while role-modelling healthy behaviour and self-care. So, what can you do to start building a high-performing culture within your organisation? With disruption an everyday reality, changing company culture to become more agile, risk-tolerant and experimental is easily the biggest business opportunity you could cultivate. Company culture can seem a fuzzy term. But it can be defined by mindsets, values and behaviour practised within the organisation. It’s like pouring concrete — it takes a while to set and requires work to change. Also, while culture is espoused as incredibly important by leaders, it is often undervalued and mismanaged. The pandemic is an incredible accelerator of change — acting as the vaccine itself, creating antibodies to address many persisting malaises. This is the most opportune time to start driving a positive culture change to sustain future performance. But culture building, especially in an ever-changing business environment where uncertainty and interdependencies are high, needs a shift of focus from practices to principles. Companies with high-performance cultures have embedded these principles of adaptability, resilience, goal-orientation, collaboration, and problem-solving. Additionally, employees are empowered to do their part. Once this leadership work is done, teams become unstoppable on performance.

Their numbers might increase further as the bank’s internal inquiry is still going on, DBGB Bhabhua regional manager Vikash Kumar Bhagat told TOI on Tuesday. Bhagat said Dharmendra, a scale-I officer, would now remain deputed at the branch till the inquiry ends. He also said inquiry would also be conducted in the other branches where the accused manager Dr Ravi Shankar Kumar was posted earlier. Ravi was arrested from his flat in Himgiri Palace on Boring Canal Road in Patna on June 6. Ravi was sent to another branch for audit work and Dharmendra was deputed there as his reliever for a short time. “On May 31, a customer approached him to get his passbook printed. Other bank staff said the printer doesn’t work,” a police officer privy to the investigation said. He said Dharmendra got up to check the printer and somehow got the passbook printed. “Soon, two more customers reached there to get their passbooks updated. After printing, all complained about money transaction from their accounts without knowledge,” he said, adding that Ravi deliberated did not print the passbooks to avoid getting the fraud detected. The officer said Dhamendra contacted Ravi, who asked him not to print passbooks as villagers will start flocking the branch amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Showing his presence of mind, Dharmendra called up the bank’s vigilance section in Patna. Till then, around 100 villagers had surrounded the branch for passbook printing, which had not been done for several months. He kept pacifying the customers by printing their passbooks and assuring that bank will return every single paisa. The vigilance authorities immediately smelt the fraud and Ravi was suspended with instruction to lock the branch immediately to prohibit his entry there,” he said. Police have also come to know that the Reserve Bank of India guidelines were flouted by not carrying out even a single inspection of the Asha Parari branch in the last six months. They said even CCTV cameras were not working there for the last four months. When asked, Bhagat said the last inspection of the branch was carried out in October 2020. “No further inspection could be carried out due to the Covid-19. The manager had not informed us about the CCTV becoming non-functional in the branch,” he said. Police suspect the CCTV cameras were intentionally made non-functional around four months back. “It’s the same estimated period during which money was fraudulently transfrred from the customers’ accounts to Tavi’s kin and other people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/reliever-blew-the-lid-off-rs1-09-crore-fraud/articleshow/83347727.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||NCLT clears Vedanta co’s Rs 3,000cr offer for Videocon||Mumbai: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Rs 3,000-crore offer for the debt-ridden Videocon Group. The offer by Twin Star Technologies, a company owned by Agarwal, is against the more than Rs 46,000-crore debt of the Videocon Group. The transaction, when completed, will be Agarwal’s third asset purchase under the Indian bankruptcy code after Electrosteel Steels and Ferro Alloys Corporation. Lenders of Videocon Group, comprising 13 entities, had sought NCLT’s nod after they accepted Agarwal’s proposal in December last year. In 2019, NCLT had allowed combining multiple bankruptcy proceedings against 13 Videocon Group companies into one. The NCLT nod for Agarwal’s proposal on Tuesday comes with riders. One of these is that payment to the dissenting lenders will have to be a priority. This is the first consolidated group resolution under the bankruptcy route. Videocon Group, with interests in consumer appliances and oil, was pushed into bankruptcy in 2017 after it defaulted on loans. Its erstwhile promoter, the Dhoot family, had offered to clear the loans in a bid to pull the 13 companies out of bankruptcy proceedings. But the lenders turned down the Dhoots’ proposal and chose Twin Star’s bid for Videocon. Agarwal was interested in Videocon as his Vedanta Group holds a 23% stake in the Ravva oil field. And when the Videocon transaction is completed, Vedanta’s stake in the oil field will increase to 48%, thus becoming its largest shareholder. Public sector company ONGC holds 40% in the Ravva oil field. The average output from the Ravva oil field was 14,232 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in fiscal 2020. Interestingly, Vedanta has shown interest in buying Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), in which the government plans to sell its 53% stake. Vedanta’s interest in BPCL is driven from the synergies with its oil & gas business. The more than three-year delay in the debt resolution of Videocon highlights the challenges faced by lenders to recover their money even as the Covid pandemic threatens to add to bad loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-clears-vedanta-cos-rs-3000cr-offer-for-videocon/articleshow/83351607.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Rehabilitation colonies are meant to house 17,000 families. The irrigation, revenue and housing departments are monitoring the situation to put work on fast track as they are left with 30 days to meet the deadline. The diversion of water from the spillway is expected to inundate nearly 115 habitations in 54 villages in both East and West Godavari districts. About 20,870 families have been identified as project displaced families (PDFs) in both the districts and need to be evacuated before the flood season. However, only 3,600 families in 25 habitations have been shifted to relief and rehabilitation (R&R) colonies as the works in the remaining 90 habitations are still under progress. “We have a plan to complete all houses in R&R colonies before August,” said irrigation minister P Anil Kumar Yadav. He said they would complete 21 colonies by June and another 31 by July. “We are hopeful of completing 84 colonies by August and evacuating nearly 16,000 families,” said Anil Kumar. R&B, Education Welfare Infrastructure Development Corporation (EWIDC) and the tribal welfare department have completed nearly 70 per cent of the units allocated to them. The housing department has logged 27 per cent progress. Works related to CC roads and drains are only 15 per cent complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pace-of-work-on-polavaram-rehab-colonies-stepped-up/articleshow/83347917.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||Cautious companies cut loans by Rs 1.7 lakh crore amid Covid||MUMBAI: Large borrowers across several industries have responded to the Covid crisis by repaying loans and reducing their debt. While some companies pulled back from investments in the absence of demand, others have shifted from loans to the capital market. Companies in oil, steel, fertilisers and cement sectors are among those who have reduced their borrowing significantly during the year. According to a research report by SBI, the top 15 sectors, from more than 1,000 listed entities, reported a debt reduction of Rs 1.7 lakh crore during FY21. In percentage terms fertilisers, cement products, consumer durables and capital goods sectors have reduced their dependence on bank loans by more than a fifth during the year. Coronavirus: Live updates“Corporate willingness for new investments remains low currently as the economy is still recovering from the devastating second wave. Investment scenario is tepid as gauged by new investment announcements which saw 67% decline in FY21 as per CMIE,” the report said. It added that companies were taking advantage of a low term structure of interest rates, and reducing their loan liabilities, to facilitate a lower finance cost from capital markets. Also, the top 1,000 companies have increased their cash and bank balance by around 35% in March this year as compared to March 2020, suggesting a conservative approach to save cash during uncertain times. The repayment of loans by corporates has resulted in a sharp slowdown in credit growth in FY21. According to RBI data, the slowdown in credit growth continues well into FY22. As of April 23, non-food credit was down 0.8%. Again this year, the sharpest drop is due to a decline in credit to the petroleum industry (-8.6% year-on-year) and iron & steel (-6.8%). In FY21, bank credit did not slip into negative because of growth in home loans, and loans to agriculture and allied sectors as well as trade finance. Recently in an interview with TOI, SBI chairman Dinesh Khara said that corporates had turned risk-averse. He also said that utilisation of existing capacity was low. “The utilisation of working capital is only 70%, which means that they have headroom to borrow,” he had told this paper. A report published by CRIF with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) said that the total amount of credit availed by the sector as of December 2020 stood at Rs 1.6 lakh crore, which witnessed a Y-o-Y decline of nearly 20%. This is due to the suspension of manufacturing activities in the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdown in March 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cautious-cos-cut-loans-by-rs-1-7l-cr-amid-covid/articleshow/83351692.cms||---

The FIR was lodged by IMA state secretary Dr Sunil Kumar. SHO of Patrakar Nagar police station Manoranjan Bharti said Ramdev was booked under Epidemic Diseases Act-1897, Bihar Epidemic Disease Covid Regulations-2020, Disaster Management Act-2005 and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. IMA national president-elect Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh said about 20 cases against Ramdev have already been lodged in Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and Jharkhand. IMA state acting president Dr Ajay Kumar said all the 105 units of the association working in different districts of Bihar were lodging similar cases either in the police stations or the courts of law. The FIR lodged in Patna complained that Ramdev ridiculed the modern medical science, doctors and even the martyred health professionals at a time when Bihar and other states were fighting against the deadly second wave of the Covid pandemic. Ramdev was charged with spreading unscientific facts and creating a state of confusion and superstitions in the society which affected the ongoing immunisation drive in the state. The IMA complaint further said without the support of scientific tests and certification, Ramdev began publicity of Coronil, claiming that it is effective against the Covid. Dr Sunil said the IMA state branch also mentioned in the FIR the statements issued by Ramdev, describing allopathy as “stupid and bankrupt science”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ima-files-fir-against-ramdev-for-insulting-allopathy-doctors/articleshow/83349593.cms||VK Tripathi

However, the government failed to allocate funds for re-establishment of the RARS, besides carrying out similar alienation of land for the RARS. The government had given orders assigning 50 acres of land on lease for 30 years, which also attracted the ire of the farmers. The government in its orders on June 7, instructed the director of agriculture to allocate 50 acres of land at Thandancha village of Kurnool district for re-establishing the RARS. The registrar of Acharya N G Ranga Agriculture University had written three letters to the state government on September 1 and 23, 2020 and on May 27, 2021, requesting ‘equalling land’ and ‘sufficient funds’ for re-establishing the RARS. The RARS has infrastructure facilities such as an office building, seed godown, seed processing unit, cold storage unit, laboratories, irrigation systems, drainage systems, pump houses, compound wall and other civil structures. However, the government had only given orders for equalling land on lease and remained silent on allocation of funds. Meanwhile, the Rayalaseema Saguneeti Sadhana Samithi and its allied associations have served a legal notice to the state government taking strong objection to the orders alienating RARS lands. They said the Andhra Pradesh High Court had issued orders on February 3, 2021, directing the state government to maintain status quo on the RARS lands and took objection to the government issuing the orders alienating the lands without waiting for the final orders of the court. The farmers have asked the government to cancel the orders and maintain status quo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-issues-orders-alienating-rars-land/articleshow/83347779.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Patna||State govt notifies advisory panels for three-tier panchayati raj institutions||PATNA: In consonance with the ordinance issued by governor Phagu Chauhan, the state panchayati raj department on Tuesday issued the notification constituting the ‘paramarshi samitis’ (advisory committees) for the three-tier panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) and gram kutchehris. The committees would begin functioning from June 16, as the five-year terms of the erstwhile gram panchayats, panchayat samitis and zila parishads as well as gram kutchehris set up after the 2016 elections expire on June 15, the notification says. The advisory committees will perform the same functions as the PRIs had been doing under the relevant Act. The government constituted them because the 2021 elections could not be held due to “technical reasons and also due to the Covid-19 spread”. The ordinance has been called Bihar Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021. Each advisory committee will consist of a chairperson, deputy chairperson and members. The gram panchayat and gram kutcheheri secretaries will be the secretaries of their respective advisory committees. The block development officer (BDO) concerned will be the chief executive officer (CEO) of the advisory committee for the panchayat samiti, while deputy development commissioner (DDC) concerned will be the CEO of the advisory committee for the zila parishad. Further, the allowances payable to the advisory committee members would be as per the rules and norms defined under the Panchayati Raj Act, 2006. All the officials and other personnel concerned will participate in the meetings of the PRIs and gram kutchehris as prescribed by the aforesaid Act. As per the notification, while the outgoing mukhiyas will head the advisory committees concerned, its members would be Lok Sabha MPs and MLAs under whose constituencies the panchayats fall, as well as the Rajya Sabha members and MLCs who are registered as voters in the panchayats concerned. The other members of the panchayats will be the ward members. As to the panchayat samitis, the elected pramukh will head the advisory committee. Its members will be the elected members of the panchyat samitis, as well as the Lok Sabha MPs and MLAs under whose constituencies the panchayat samitis fall partially or wholly. The Rajya Sabha member and MLCs who are registered in the areas falling under the panchayat samitis will also be its members. Similarly, the elected chairperson of the erstwhile zila parishad will also be the chairperson of its advisory committee. Its members will be all the other zila parishad members, as well as the Lok Sabha MPs and MLAs and also the Rajya Sabha member and MLC in accordance with the binding norms pertaining to the two other PRIs. While every member of the advisory committee has to participate in every meeting, anyone found absenting from three meetings continuously would be removed from it. Those violating the rules or showing disobedience to the officials or are convicted in any criminal act will also be removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-govt-notifies-advisory-panels-for-three-tier-panchayati-raj-institutions/articleshow/83347546.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Political parties in Bihar hail govt’s decision to ease restrictions||PATNA: The political parties in the state on Tuesday hailed the government’s decision to unlock the state with certain restrictions. JD(U) state president Umesh Kushwaha described the decision as a right step at an appropriate time. “There has been sharp dip in cases of Covid-19. The ease in lockdown restrictions would boost business activities as shops have been allowed to remain open till 5pm. Moreover, vehicles will no longer need e-passes,” he said. JD(U)’s ally BJP also welcomed the government’s decision. BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said it would help the state’s economy with increased business activities post lockdown. He said the better management and focused endeavour on the part of the state machinery led to remarkable decline in coronavirus cases. “This is a result of the government's endeavour that the state showed remarkable progress in vaccination drive across the country,” he said. RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said that the government should accelerate the process of vaccination and testing to check the spread of the virus. “It’s true that lockdown is not a permanent solution, but vaccination will be a right step in that direction,” he said. He, however, lashed out at the government for not taking the opposition parties into confidence before making an announcement to lift the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/political-parties-in-bihar-hail-govts-decision-to-ease-restrictions/articleshow/83349679.cms||Ramashankar

It also alleged that the process adopted to give management control to the PE major would lead to a Rs 2,000-crore loss to PNB, one of the largest government-run banks. PNB HF, however, said the whole process was done after proper due diligence and will benefit all shareholders. According to the SES report, the proposed preferential issue is against the interest of public shareholders and also shareholders of PNB and the exchequer. It raised several concerns which include if a rights offer was a better proposition and by opting for preferential allotment it sacrificed at least Rs 2,000 crore. It also pointed out that 85% of the shareholders were part of the deal while only the public shareholders were left out. It also said the pricing of the offer was a convenient refuge under Sebi’s capital-raising rules. It also said that one of the resolutions related to fund raising was ‘ultra vires’ Articles of Association of PNB HF. A spokesperson for PNB HF said that the deal for capital raising was arrived at “with appropriate due diligence keeping best interests of all stakeholders in mind”. “The culmination of this deal is a distinct reflection of PNB HF’s ability for retaining the faith and confidence of all of its existing investors.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/carlyle-deal-for-pnb-hsg-unfair-to-small-shareholders/articleshow/83351719.cms||---

Rishika Kumar, all of 14, has understood it at an early age. While others her age are struggling to adjust to living life under the shadow of the pandemic, Mumbai girl Rishika has reached out to inmates of Muzaffarpur prison in Bihar, the home state of her parents. The teenager has arranged two oxygen concentrators for inmates of Shahid Khudiram Bose Central Jail at Muzaffarpur by collecting Rs 70,000 in donations. “I believe that one can be truly happy by bringing happiness in others’ lives. When everybody was scared for their lives and I got to know about prisoners in Muzaffarpur, I thought I should do my bit to ensure their safety in the pandemic,” Rishika told TOI over phone from Mumbai. The Muzaffarpur jail’s superintendent, Rajiv Kumar Singh, said the oxygen concentrators were of much help during the peak of the second wave of Covid pandemic. “Due to sudden surge in the Covid cases and in absence of any oxygen concentrators, the prison required such concentrators in order to be equipped to handle any medical situation requiring oxygen,” Singh said. The jail superintendent said there were approximately 3,000 prisoners in the jail at present. “The prisoners are the most vulnerable section of the society. They are totally dependent on the authorities for their safety and well-being. The two oxygen concentrators (five litres each) arranged by Rishika were received in the jail on May 9 and immediately deployed. The concentrators are being used for treatment of prisoners as well as staff,” Singh said. He added the concentrators donated by Rishika reduced load on the prison hospital and dependency on oxygen cylinders. In Mumbai, Rishika is content with the outcome of her endeavour and also received a letter of appreciation from jail authorities at Muzaffarpur. On being asked about the idea and execution for donating oxygen concentrators at Muzaffarpur jail, Rishika said, “My father is from Gaya and mother from Patna. I overheard them talking about the Covid situation in Bihar. I wanted to help the vulnerable people and decided to do something for prisoners. I approached my relatives, friends, people in my apartment and even opened an account for the cause on a charity fund collection website.” Rishika said she has been teaching underprivileged children in her free time and has also enrolled for an internship in water conservation and sanitation in a reputed institute at Mumbai for doing more social work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-oxygen-concentrators-arranged-by-mumbai-girl-save-muz-prisoners-lives/articleshow/83349125.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh posted 1.6% growth, says minister||AMARAVATI: Industries minister Mekapati Gautham Reddy has claimed that the state has overcome the negative growth in the country thanks to welfare initiatives of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. He said that AP has reported a 1.6 per cent growth rate while India reported a negative GDP. Speaking to the media here on Tuesday, the minister said that AP is the first state to declare an oxygen policy to attract investments into the healthcare industry. He said the department is fully geared to tackle the third wave of Covid-19 and that they would shortly make the state an oxygen surplus one from an oxygen deficit one. “We are implementing a welfare and development agenda with precision and achieving results,” the minister added. The minister said they have set a target of achieving a 10 per cent share in the export volume of the country, adding that they were expecting to complete Bhogapuram international airport by 2023 as well as three major ports and four fishing harbours over the next three years. The minister said they were working with the 2030 agenda in mind to make AP one of the best destination to set up industries. He added that they have readied blueprint to construct three concept cities in the state to boost industrial growth. Plans are afoot to launch the works on Kadapa steel plant, the minister said, pointing out that AP had launched one of the best industrial policies in the country and to attract investments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-posted-1-6-growth-says-min/articleshow/83347831.cms||Samdani MN

With families staying away for fear of catching the infection, remains were stored in gunny bags by keepers of a cremation ground along with a few volunteers of city-based Dukh Bhanjan Seva Society. On Tuesday, society members immersed the remains of over 137 Covid deceased in Neelon canal by the premises of Katani Kala gurdwara, around 25 kms away from the city. “We had ashes and remains of over 137 deceased stocked in the store of our cremation ground. These had been piling up in the last over one year,” they said. Pandit Pankaj Sharma, who has been performing last rites of Covid deceased at Ramgarhia crematorium in Dholewal, one of the six cremation grounds where Covid infected deceased are being taken for cremation, said they had no choice. “Initially, we kept the remains in a designated store, hoping that the relatives would turn up but as many of them did not and some even straight up refused to take the remains, we found it difficult to keep the remains. We tried to reach out to the family members over the phone and through acquaintances but they started giving excuses and refused to take the remains,” he said. There are seven other cremation grounds in the city including Dana Mandi, Daressi, Sannet, Model Town and Jamaalpur. Sharma said things came to such a pass that they had to store remains of three to four deceased in one gunny bag outside the store, which was already filled to capacity. “We discussed the issue with society members and it was decided that the dead should get a respectable final adieu. Today, the remains were immersed in Neelon canal after performing religious rites,” he said. Society members said it was sad and shocking that people still thought Covid-19 could spread from remains of the infected deceased. Society president Ranjodh Singh said there was a need to spread awareness among residents about the spread of infection. “The least one can expect from his kith and kin is a respectable final adieu in the eventuality of death, which is an undeniable truth,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/after-futile-wait-for-kin-remains-of-covid-deceased-immersed-in-neelon-canal/articleshow/83347495.cms||---

While most of them have termed the decision ‘a bit hasty’, others have welcomed it.  IMA state president Dr Ajay Kumar said it would have been better if the lockdown was continued for at least for one more week. “Now, the authorities would have to take greater pains in forcing the people to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour. Vehicles loaded with passengers must not be allowed to move freely on roads and the market crowds must be controlled,” he said. Covid incharge of AIIMS-Patna Dr Sanjeev Kumar said, “Night curfew is of little use in a city like Patna as most people move during day hours. Lockdown forces people to remain inside home as they are afraid of police action and not of infection. The lockdown should have continued for some time more as it has controlled the transmission of virus considerably. If adequate protective measures were not followed, a situation like the second wave may recur soon.” Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC)’s joint director Dr A K Ashu said the government’s decision to end the lockdown may backfire as it is very difficult to control the crowd during day hours. The rate of infection has subsided only because of restrictions imposed on movement of people and once these restrictions are over, it would start rising again. The ‘uneducated’ people of Bihar would hardly adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour and they would start moving in groups from one place to other.  Gynecologist Dr Punam Raman also observed that the lockdown has been lifted a bit early. Once, people hear that the lockdown has been lifted, they start thinking Covid has gone. She further pointed out that Bihar happens to be one of the most densely populated states and a vast majority of the population are yet to be vaccinated. Dr Gangadhar Singh, head of the department of hygiene and yoga, Govt Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Patna, said the lockdown should have been extended at least for a week so that the rate of infection could further slide down. Past experience shows that masses do not follow Covid norms on their own. AIIMS Patna director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh, however, justified the government decision as the situation has come almost under control with the number of positive cases coming down considerably. And, moreover, lockdown can’t be allowed to continue indefinitely as it causes a lot of inconveniences to the people, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lifting-of-lockdown-in-bihar-fails-to-enthuse-doctors/articleshow/83349385.cms||B K Mishra

Authoritative sources said the panchayat election in the state is now set to be held in September. A senior official of the state election commission said on Tuesday that the respective district magistrates have been asked to start communicating with the officials of the states concerned for the supply of EVMs. The authorities in the districts will be responsible for tracking the movement of EVMs from other states and their storage. EVMs will be used in the panchayat polls for the first time in Bihar. Around 1.20 lakh polling booths will be set up for the purpose. Meanwhile, advisory committees have been assigned the task of looking after the ongoing development works in the panchayats till the elections were held and new members elected. Over 2.58 lakh representatives will be elected as mukhiya, ward member, sarpanch, panch, panchayat samiti member and district board member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dms-told-to-procure-evms-for-panchayat-polls-in-state/articleshow/83347624.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||India Inc in ‘wait and watch’ mode for hiring||Chennai: Job creation is likely to be impacted in the July to September period due to the second Covid wave, as fewer employers reported intentions to increase their headcount compared to the previous quarter.6% of the over 1,300 employers surveyed by HR firm ManpowerGroup expect to increase headcount in the July to September quarter compared to 12% who planned to hire in April-June. A large proportion of employers (46%) said they did not know when they were likely to resume regular hiring. Only 3% reported not expecting to go back to pre-pandemic levels of hiring.ManpowerGroup’s Net Employment Outlook (NEO) for the quarter stood at 7% declining by 2 percentage points compared with the previous quarter, but improving by 2 percentage points when compared sequentially.The study estimates a weakened hiring sentiment in four of the seven industry sectors when compared with the previous quarter. The rate of decline is set to be most notable in the mining and construction sector, which will see a 6 percentage point decline in hiring.The finance, insurance and real estate sector reported the weakest labour market since the survey began in 2005, with employers reporting a NEO of just 3%. Hiring prospects declined by 4 percentage points when compared with the previous quarter and by 7 percentage points in comparison with the same period last year in the segment. Transportation and utilities sector will lead the job market with a NEO of 10%, the survey showed.Sandeep Gulati, group MD of ManpowerGroup India said the upcoming quarter is “more of a wait and watch” even as the vaccination drive for the working age population offers optimism to companies. “When organizations start looking at deploying workforce, it is expected to be a long term decision and not for a quarter. Hence recovery will involve job creation with a certain lag of 2-3 months depending on the industry and sector,” he said. “With the background of a third wave expected, industries are taking this quarter as a quarter of caution,” he added. He notes that this quarter has seen companies retain staff, anticipating recovery, unlike last year when more than 10 million people lost their jobs. At 6%, large-size employers (250 or more employees) report the steepest decline of 3 percentage points when compared with the previous quarter. Medium-sized employers reported no change from the previous period, and the outlook for small firms too remained relatively stable. On a regional basis, hiring prospects are expected to weaken by 4 percentage points in the West when compared with the previous quarter, and decline by 2 percentage points in the North. Hiring sentiment remains relatively stable in both the East and the South.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-inc-in-wait-and-watch-mode-for-hiring/articleshow/83350344.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The bench of chairman Naveen Verma and members RB Sinha and Nupur Banerjee made the above recommendation on Monday while hearing a batch of cases against Shine City Infraproject Private Limited, whose directors are believed to have fled to Dubai after allegedly cheating several people and not registering properties in their names despite taking money against a residential project at Naubatpur in Patna. The bench observed that besides Patna, the company has committed the similar offence with flat buyers in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha. The bench has directed all the complainants desirous of lodging FIR to write to state police’s Economic Offences Unit (EOU) SP with all facts and documents related to the company and submit them to RERA, too. The bench urged Bihar DGP for constituting a special investigating team considering the ramification of the case and exploring the possibilities of taking the help of central investigating agencies like Enforcement Directorate for catching the culprits as the activities of the company spans over several states and directors have fled abroad. It has also directed the RERA secretary to send a letter to the DGP with facts of the cases so that FIRs could be registered by investors against the company. The bench has also directed the RERA secretary to take up the matter with the Registrar of Companies in Lucknow for getting details about the company. It has also sought the services of a retired police officer with expertise in handling economic offence cases for inquiring into the complaints of the more than 90 persons, who had paid money for purchasing properties developed by the company at Naubatpur but were never handed over to the allottees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rera-for-separate-team-to-help-buyers/articleshow/83347823.cms||Debashish Karmakar

We had them in May and we have plans in the second half of June again. The increase will be different in different categories in the 2%-3% range,” said Arnab Banerjee, chief operating officer (COO), Ceat. Tyre prices have been firming up since the beginning of the year on account of raw material costs as well as prevailing market conditions.

The court passed the order on a batch of pleas moved by workmen of Nissan and other manufacturing units in Chennai challenging the exemption granted to such units from complete lockdown.When the pleas came up for hearing, the bench said, “there is a temporary arrangement which satisfies the workmen and the production has also resumed.”There is no doubt that the quantum of production may have fallen slightly as a result of the gaps being introduced in the assembly lines, but it is evident that the 3:1 pitch has been put in place upon discussion between the workmen and the management in the presence of officials from the directorate of industrial safety, the court added. This position cannot be changed at the unilateral insistence of the management and without reference to the directorate of industrial safety or the concerns of the workmen, the court said and adjourned the pleas to June 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/inspect-covid-protocol-at-industrial-units/articleshow/83350420.cms||---

The homegrown IT major will succeed Virgin Money and will label it the TCS London Marathon. This will be the seventh marathon in the world for which TCS is the title sponsor. It currently sponsors New York, Amsterdam, Clark Animo (Philippines), Lidingoloppet (Sweden), Mumbai and Bangalore marathons. While TCS did not reveal the sponsorship cost for the London marathon, it runs into millions of pounds for the multi-year contract. The deal will boost the image of TCS in the UK, which is its second-biggest market in terms of revenue. It is also a large recruiter of IT talent in that country. Interestingly, TCS has been a technology partner of the London Marathon since 2016 and the latest move strengthens its association with the event. The IT giant has been sponsoring marathons in India and across the world, with support from its “runner” chairman N Chandrasekaran. The 58-year-old chairman, who started running at the age of 44 following impending health concerns due to family history, has run a dozen marathons in India and abroad, including the one in New York and Sweden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tcs-to-be-london-marathons-title-sponsor/articleshow/83351783.cms||Reeba Zachariah

A day after the US-based Hyatt announced that it would shut its 400-room Mumbai property, a little-known lodging company, Vista Rooms, has offered the beleaguered staff job opportunities. In a LinkedIn post, Vista Rooms co-founder Amit Damani said, “For all those impacted by the closing of Hyatt Regency Mumbai, our hearts go out to you. We at Vista Rooms would like to extend our support by sharing job opportunities across functions, from housekeeping to F&B (food and beverage).” Founded in 2015, Vista Rooms manages a network of 500 luxury villas in India, and is backed by former Google India MD Rajan Anandan and Freshworks CEO Girish Mathrubootham. Early this year, Vista Rooms had raised additional capital of Rs 10 crore from DSG Consumer Partners and Everest Flavours founder Anand Ladsariya. The money, said Vista Partners, is to be used for improving technology, enhancing the network and strengthening the team. Hiring Hyatt Regency Mumbai’s staff would benefit Vista Rooms as it will get skilled and experienced talent from the hospitality industry. Vista Rooms aims to ramp up its network to 1,000 properties over the next two years. The move of making an open job offer to beleaguered employees has been seen whenever a company shuts operations. In 2019, when Jet Airways was grounded, other players like SpiceJet, Vistara and Air India announced plans to acquire the grounded carrier’s staff. India’s hospitality industry has been hit severely by the second wave of Covid, resulting in significant reduction in room occupancies and revenues. Hyatt, which follows a franchise and management contract in India, has announced the closure of the Mumbai property due to a cash-crunch faced by its owner Asian Hotels (West). “The pandemic has battered the hospitality industry but we truly hope we bounce back, faster and stronger,” Damani added in his post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/luxe-villa-co-vista-rooms-offers-jobs-to-hyatt-staff/articleshow/83351741.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19, sluggish overseas markets hit Andhra Pradesh’s seafood business||VISAKHAPATNAM: Covid-19 and sluggish overseas markets are affecting Andhra Pradesh’s seafood industry. The state exported 2,79,992 metric tonne (MT) of marine products, worth Rs 15,831.74 crore, in the 2020-21 fiscal, registering a contraction of over 4.5 per cent in volume from 2019-20 when Andhra Pradesh exported 2,93,314 MT of marine products worth Rs 15,498.64 crore. Despite the pandemic, Andhra’s seafood sector contributed over 38 per cent of total export revenue in 2020-21. While the country exported 11,49,341 MT of marine products worth Rs 43,717.26 crore ($ 5.96 billion), Andhra’s share was nearly Rs 16,000 crore. In 2019-20, India exported 12,89,651 MT of seafood worth Rs 46,662.85 crore (US$ 6.68 billion), marking a decline of 6.31 per cent in rupee terms and 10.81 per cent in dollar value in 2020-21. USA, China and the European Union (EU) were the leading importers. Frozen shrimp retained its position as the major export item followed by frozen fish. The pandemic drastically affected seafood exports from India during the first half of the year, but it revived well in the last quarter of 2020-21. Besides the pandemic impact, several other factors negatively impacted seafood exports during 2020-21, said K S Srinivas, chairman of the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA). On the production side, there were reduced fish landings due to fewer number of fishing days, slow logistic movements and market uncertainties. Scarcity of workers in fishing and processing plants, paucity of containers at seaports, increased air freight charges and limited flight availability also affected exports, they added. MPEDA officials said that the situation in the overseas market was another dampener. In China, container shortage, increased freight charges, and Covid-19 testing on seafood consignments had caused market uncertainties. In the USA, scarcity of containers made it difficult for exporters to execute orders on time. Closure of the hotel, restaurant and café segment also affected demand. In Japan and the EU, Covid-induced lockdowns led to a sluggish retail, restaurant, supermarket and hotel consumption. Andhra Pradesh has been contributing over 45 per cent of the total export revenue in seafood export in the country. The pandemic has dealt a blow to this export by creating a shortage of labour and high freight charges. “We are expecting that the sector will revive in the present fiscal year,” said a seafood exporter from Visakhapatnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/covid-19-sluggish-overseas-markets-hit-aps-seafood-biz/articleshow/83347753.cms||Nalla.Babu

The Dindori police arrested her following a complaint by her husband. Meanwhile, the victim is undergoing treatment at the Nashik civil hospital and his condition is said to be stable. The incident took place in the Pade village, 25km from Nashik. The police said that around noon on Monday, the victim was playing with his one-and-a-half-years-old stepbrother on the bed at their home. While playing, the older boy pushed the toddler, who then fell off the bed. The baby’s mother was infuriated and beat up the diasbaled boy. She later heated up a household steel chapati flipper on the stove and burned the private part of the boy with the same. The neighbours were alerted by the boy’s cries. A relative of the family, who lives in the neighbourhood, then called the boy’s father who works in a private firm. The man rushed home and took his son to the Nashik civil hospital. Additional civil surgeon Kishor Srivas said that the boy has suffered 20% burns in the lower abdomen and private parts. The boy is now stable and his private parts have not been damaged. Anant Targe, the PI of the Dindori police station, said the woman has been arrested under sections 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code and other sections of the Juvenile Justice Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso). PSI Kalpesh Kumar Chavan is investigating the case. The accused woman is the maternal aunt of the victim. Four years ago, the boy’s father had divorced his mother and had married his aunt. The child has speech difficulties, said PSI Chavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/woman-held-for-burning-pvt-parts-of-10-year-old-stepson/articleshow/83344881.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh ready to inoculate 10-12 lakh people per day from July, says CM Yogi Adityanath||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has led UP’s battle from the front against two waves of Covid-19. In an exclusive interview with TOI, he shares experiences in dealing with the ‘deadliest virus of the century’ and strategy to combat an impending third wave. He is confident of inoculating more than 10 lakh people per day to achieve the target of 10 crore jabs in 3 months… UP government announced ‘Operation 10 crore’ on Sunday to administer 10 crore vaccines in three months. It is a huge leap. How would this be rolled out?The world and the country are suffering under the Covid-19 pandemic for more than one year and UP, being the largest state in the country, has also been affected. However, there were certain apprehensions about the state which we have managed to prove baseless in both the first wave and second wave. The result is before everyone to see. When the first case was reported in UP on March 2, 2020, we had no facility for testing and we sent the sample to Pune. Today, we have the capacity to carry out 3.5-4 lakh tests a day. UP is the only state to record 5.16 crore tests. Initially we had no beds. There were 36 districts where there were no ventilators. In the remaining districts, the staff was not trained for Covid. Today, we have 80,000 ICU and isolation beds which are provided to everyone without bias, even if they are not from UP. In the matter of vaccines, people may feel that we have not vaccinated sufficient people in relation to our population. We have administered 2.31 crore doses so far but our target is based on availability of vaccines. In June, we are looking at a target of 1 crore but in July and August there will be lots of vaccines available. The Centre is looking at a target of vaccinating 1 crore people a day and if there are 30 crore doses available in a month, UP believes that we will be able to get a significant number of doses. We have been saying that UP should be allocated doses in relation to its population, not as per infection rate. Till now, the vaccine distribution was as per level of infection. In Maharashtra, the positivity rate was high and they were given more doses. UP was also given doses but there has never been a gap in UP’s roll out. We have managed to vaccinate 31 lakh youth till now. We have started vaccinating different categories of people. In April, when the Centre wanted to see the capacity of all states to administer vaccines, UP gave 6 lakh shots on a single day. We have set a target that if we get sufficient vaccines, we would be able to give 10-12 lakh doses. In this way, we will be able to vaccinate 10 crore people in three months. There are two vaccines in India and they have been distributed among states according to positivity rate and active cases. We have now demanded that the population should be kept in mind when distributing vaccines. The Centre has agreed to this. We have started training people and arranging for syringes. We will be training secondand third-year nursing and pharmacy students to administer the vaccine as well. Do you think the Centre’s policy of allowing states to procure vaccines on their own led to a shortage of vaccines in May?From May 1, vaccination was opened up to those above 18 years and at this time many states said that they would like to purchase vaccines directly. The Centre agreed to this. When no manufacturer agreed to give to states, then the Centre changed its policy and today, all states are being given vaccines. What will the role of the private sector be in helping the government achieve this target of 10 crore vaccinations in three months. Does the government have a plan to regulate prices in the private sector?There are several companies entering the market and I presume that five to six vaccines will be available in the market in July and August. Private companies will also have access to these vaccines and be able to administer. If this happens, we will be able to roll out the programmes more smoothly. The price of vaccines will be determined by demand and supply. When there will be more players in the field and the vaccine availability goes up, the prices will automatically come down. In the first wave, an RTPCR test cost Rs 4,500. Now, it has come down to Rs 700 in a private lab. Same will happen with vaccines. When there were fewer players and less vaccines, then prices were naturally higher. Once all players enter the market, the cost will fall automatically. We will not have to regulate it. ‘Digital divide’ and ‘vaccine hesitancy’ are two factors which might adversely hit vaccination drive. What is your government doing to overcome them?In UP, and also in India, when the vaccination drive began on January 16, some people in responsible positions started making misleading and negligent statements about the campaign such as ‘this is BJP’s vaccine’ and they will not take ‘Modi Vaccine’. A good number of people have lived in a state of confusion on account of such things. In fact, in May when I travelled to 40 districts of the state, I went to villages and met locals who had been harbouring strange fears… Many of them were hesitant to even get tested for coronavirus. Our health teams counselled them saying that testing was in their interest, the process was simple and required no blood extraction and that the report will be available in 15 minutes. Likewise, those irresponsible statements strengthened vaccine hesitancy. But now, with our efforts, a number of clerics and other religious heads have joined the state government in fighting myths around the vaccine. As a result, a surge in self-motivated persons willing to take the vaccine has been seen. Also, the state is rolling out a massive campaign to fight vaccine hesitancy across 97,000 revenue villages. In this, posters of local vaccinated people like village heads, teachers, women, youth, elderly next door and prominent residents will be put up to encourage people to shun their fears and come forward to take the Covid-19 vaccine. Taglines like ‘maine bhi lagaya jeet ka teeka’, ‘ye hai corona se bachav ka kavach’ are being used to get rid of hesitancy. But I admit that more needs to be done. Therefore, nigrani samitis are still in action in villages. Reaching out to every household in the district, the samitis are reiterating the importance of vaccination and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Training of staff is also being done accordingly. There has been a lot of discussion about testing in UP. You have emphasised that testing has been the mainstay of UP’s Covid control strategy. What did the state do to ensure that no patient was missed?UP is India’s most populous state. When panchayat elections were on, a number of people said that the state’s coronavirus cases graph went up only because of the elections and levelled all kinds of baseless accusations on us. But there were no elections in Delhi, Maharashtra or Rajasthan. We have a system for testing. The state increased its testing capacity incrementally. You will be surprised to know that since the pandemic hit us, I have reviewed the Covid-19 situation in the state every single day—in person if I have been in Lucknow and virtually when travelling. I have the data of cases, recoveries, deaths, testing with break-up, etc, on fingertips. I also undertake death audits for districts. The testing data of every person is available with the integrated Covid-19 command and control centre. Not only this, a team of 1,500 qualified persons working under UP CM helpline took random feedback from the districts on various parameters of the Covid-19 situation like testing, home isolation, etc. Also, when cases declined, many states reduced testing, but not UP. We continued to undertake more than three lakh tests per day. It is on account of our strategy that the second wave has been tamed. Otherwise, I remember the predictions made by various organisations, including the NITI Aayog that UP would be worst hit by the pandemic and will surpass Maharashtra by mid-May. Niti Aayog had also said that UP would be home to 30 lakh active cases in May. But such predictions have been proven wrong. We now have 700 cases daily. Look at Maharashtra’s numbers. It has 50% of UP’s population but the number of daily cases is almost equal to our total active cases. What has been the strategy to contain cases in rural areas?When reports of Covid-19 wreaking havoc in villages came in, I convened a virtual meeting with over 72,000 nigrani samitis, which had been given thermometers, pulse oximeters and sanitizers, to conduct door-to-door surveys. To boost their morale, the state reminded them that they had been vaccinated and being covered under insurance. Therefore, they should actively work to curb the pandemic. In a matter of 15 days, the picture was cleared. Over 68% of our villages had negligent Covid-19 cases; in villages with cases, all symptomatic persons were tested for coronavirus through antigen kits and RT PCR. Thereafter, such patients and their contacts were given preventive medicine kits which nipped the problem in the bud. Villagers also played an important role in containment. Many of them had made arrangements to quarantine people with symptoms and provided them with food and nutrition till they recovered. What has been the impact of lockdown on the state’s economy and what measures are being taken to bring normalcy back?First of all, while other states imposed lockdown, we implemented corona curfew. The difference between the two is that in lockdown, all economic activities come to a standstill but we didn’t go for complete closure. Industries continued to work as usual and offices were allowed to function with one-third staff on a rotation system. Covid help desks were made mandatory for all offices and those with staff of more than 50 were told to set up a Covid-19 care centre with at least two oxygen concentrators for emergency use. All these steps helped in keeping the economy’s wagon moving. Even agricultural activities continued to take place. No one would believe that 119 sugar mills were operational during this time. Record cane dues worth Rs 1,38,000 crore were cleared in 2020-21 despite the pandemic and about 65% of the cane dues for 2021-22 have been cleared. Procurement of wheat did not suffer in any way. State transport buses, flights and rail service were not affected though every passenger was screened. However, industrial production and exports did suffer as the demand and supply metrics had slowed down the pace of economic movement. Still, UP’s economy as of May 2021 is better than what it was in May 2020 and the state has generated higher revenue. Your government has claimed that when Covid-19 cases were rising in the state, incidents of fake news and misinformation were also popping up from different quarters and that such rumours triggered panic buying of medicines and things like oxygen concentrators. Who do you think were behind this and do you sense that such persons had political patronage?There is no doubt that fake news and misinformation were attempted to weaken and derail the efforts being made by the state and Centre to contain the pandemic. And I strongly feel that the Opposition parties of the country have a hand in this and their role in compounding the country’s crisis must be reviewed in detail. I think certain organisations also played a very questionable role in this tough time and they need to introspect. Such behaviour at a time when the world is facing the century’s biggest disaster was uncalled for. The comparisons made between India and countries like the US which have a much better health infrastructure and a much smaller population was demoralising. Irresponsible statements made by some of them added to anxiety in people and triggered panic buying. I would also like to condemn the role of those who took advantage of the crisis through activities like hoarding and escalating prices of common things people needed. You have always said that the state needs to stay two steps ahead of the pandemic virus. But did the continuous fall in numbers till February 2021 lead to a sense of complacency? A number of Covid facilities were closed and hospitals were not instructed to raise their own oxygen supply. Do you think there was a gap in assessing the ferocity of the second wave?In UP, cases started declining after September. Several predictions had also been made at the time of the first wave. But then, they all did not turn true. By mid-February, 2021, only 85 cases were recorded across the state. Then the demand for non-Covid-19 care was also rising and people needed services like tele-consultation. But I don’t think there was any sense of complacency. The fact that the number of Covid-19 tests being conducted till the mid-March was around 1.25 lakh proves my point. There may, however, have been a gap in judging the intensity with which the second wave came. In fact, no one in the world, including experts, had an idea about it. People from all walks of life were gripped by it in no time. How does the government plan to tackle the third wave which experts say may affect children?The second wave is about to flatten in UP. The number of new cases is decreasing each day. The next challenge is certainly the third wave which experts say may hit in September and October. It is the time when a number of vector-borne and water-borne diseases like dengue, encephalitis and malaria come to the fore. We plan to go in for weekend curfew to enable cleanliness and fogging. The state government would keep a strong vigil besides strengthening medical infrastructure like paediatric ICUs and vaccinating people whose children are below 12 years of age. We have also initiated training of nursing and other paramedical staff. The state government will also begin distributing medicine kits for children in every village from June 15. What are the government’s plans to boost the industrial sector which has been dented badly in the wake of the pandemic?We did not order closure of any industry even during the peak of the pandemic. Even during the first wave, the state government allowed them to function during fixed hours. The state has a robust raw material supply chain. It also received supply orders from other states. The state government would provide all possible help to the industries to boost employment and economic growth. There was a huge hue and cry over bodies floating in the river and buried on the banks. While it was said that this was an old tradition, there were allegations that this was done because some people couldn’t afford the cost of cremation despite your government’s Rs 5,000 assistance for last rites of Covid victims. Do you think there was a lapse at the ground level to address these issues?The financial assistance had been announced last year itself after realising that there may be a problem in cremating a person who dies of Covid. In fact, there were instances of people not coming to take the body of a person who succumbed to the virus. Those bodies were cremated with the help of district administration. One needs to take note of the Balrampur incident in which a person is seen throwing a body in a river. The government has repeatedly been urging people to cremate bodies and not throw them in rivers. It was also the result of rumours and misconceptions. Also many people faced financial problems in cremating bodies. We therefore allocated funds from the state finance commission to urban development (in case of urban areas) and rural and panchayati raj departments (in case of villages). People had raised questions over the number of people being cremated and the number of deaths because of Covid. That’s strange because the government was issuing data of only Covid-related deaths. Deaths due to natural and other reasons had not stopped. There were allegations of the government muzzling the voices of people seeking help on social media. Your comment.It is not true. People are making such baseless allegations. We have a CM helpline number which is operated by 500 trained youth to extend all possible help to people facing any problem. Besides, there are integrated Covid control command centres in every district. All these centres have large manpower for management of Covid cases. But there have been attempts to spread rumours and misguide people. It is a crime. These people need to be identified and taken to task. There is sudden political frenzy in Lucknow these days. There are reports of cabinet expansion and another deputy CM. Can you throw some light on it? You might have more information about it. I have said what I had to say. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi has written many letters to you regarding Covid management.We have moved beyond just writing letters. It may have been a practice in times when there was no telephone. Writing letters shows that such leaders are not active on the ground. They are just doing a formality to be in the limelight. People in SP are more technologically advanced. They are tweeting to find space in the media. Where were these people during the first and the second wave? They have never been into service. It is not in their genes. What can you expect from people who have only exploited the country. People are watching them. There are chances that election notification for forthcoming UP assembly elections will come into effect in December. Possibly restrictions will be in place and there won’t be big rallies. How will you be able to reach out to the people?We are ready to face any condition. We won in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 2017 UP assembly elections and recently the 2019 elections. We are not only waging a battle against corona but also against ‘rajnaitik sankraman’ (political infections). We will continue to battle it out under the leadership of PM Modi. BJP will win with 2/3rd majority in 2022. There is a lot of political activity within the BJP. There have been multiple meetings which have been attended by top RSS and BJP leaders in recent times. Is it just a routine political exercise or there is something more to it?(Laughs) Ismein (BJP meetings) kuch naya nahi hai. Usko naya arth diya ja raha hai. Kuch khabarchi is tarah ki khabarein chalate hain aur aap logon ko bhi usmein namak mirch masala laga kar likhne mein maza aata hai. (Such meetings are not new. Some people are interpreting these meetings in a different way and giving a political spin to them which is not true.) BJP is a cadre-based party which does not allow nepotism. Senior leaders meet every two months and hold meetings with state units. Our state in charge (Radha Mohan Singh) comes to UP twice a month. Party president JP Nadda himself visited Lucknow four months ago. As a ruling party, we are into various services to provide relief to people. This is as per the direction by PM Modi and party president JP Nadda, who gave a call for service through ‘seva hi sangathan’. Be it the first wave or the second, BJP and the Sangh karyakartas have been giving their services. They served 40 lakh migrant labourers in UP alone. Other political parties were nowhere in sight. You have been projected as a leader with a national appeal by the BJP over the past few years. In fact, you have campaigned in virtually all pollbound states since you became UP CM in 2017. It’s said that you have national ambitions.I had no ambitions when I was an MP. I have no ambition even today. I am a common soldier of BJP, working under the vision of PM Modi to ensure development, security and prosperity. We are here to bring prosperity in the lives of people through the mantra of good governance given by PM Modi. There cannot be a bigger reason to be happy after considering achievements of the state government in the last four years. There is economic growth and infrastructure development despite the pandemic. UP is no more a state which witnessed riots every week in the past. There is no room for giving priority to caste, community and language. The state will be the number one state in terms of per capita income. Out first target is to equal the national average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-are-ready-to-inoculate-10-12-lakh-people-per-day-from-july-yogi/articleshow/83353230.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui
---||Vijayawada||Include infrastructure in PMAY, Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy requests PM Narendra Modi||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to include provision of infrastructure in the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY). The chief minister said the scheme granted funds for construction of houses for weaker sections, however, most of these houses were not being occupied by beneficiaries as there is no infrastructure such as roads, drains, electricity, drinking water where the houses are being constructed, he said. The chief minister further said provision of infrastructure will be a step towards achieving the “United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.” The chief minister said factors such as sanctioning of house sites to eligible beneficiaries, assisting beneficiaries in construction of pucca houses on their allotted house sites and developing basic infrastructure such as roads, electrification, water supply, drainage facilities, would “contribute to the success” of the PMAY. On this count, the chief minister sought to inform the Prime Minister that the AP government had distributed house sites to 30.76 lakh beneficiaries across the state. The chief minister said the government had proposed to construct 17,005 greenfield colonies for beneficiaries under the PMAY. While house sites were provided to beneficiaries at Rs 23,535 crore, infrastructure would cost another Rs 34,109 crore. Stating that the Centre under PMAY had sanctioned Rs 50,944 crore for construction of houses to these beneficiaries, the chief minister requested the Prime Minister to include infrastructure cost in the project. The chief minister requested the Prime Minister to direct the ministries of rural development and housing and urban affairs to include provision of infrastructure under the PMAY to achieve the UN’s SDGs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/include-infra-in-pmay-jagan-requests-modi/articleshow/83347738.cms||Gopi Dara

Lightning and thunder continued in the city till late hours. Main roads had water pools while drains were overflowing in the heavy spell of rain in the city while electricity supply was disrupted for almost two to four hours across different parts of the city. Few other places in the state received showers. Showers with varying velocity would continue in parts of the state in the next few days, said Met officials. Officials of the meteorological department Bhopal circle said, the pre-monsoon activity would continue in the state due to moisture incursion. Heating in the day leads to activation of the local system that results in showers, officials added. Day temperature in Bhopal on Tuesday was recorded at 39.5 degree Celsius, a degree less than normal mark, while night temperature in the city was 24.5 degree Celsius, two degrees less than normal mark. Highest temperature in the state was recorded in Gwalior at 43.4 degree Celsius.

---||Goa||Goa: Fresh round of public hearings on draft coastal plan from July 8||PANAJI: Based on the directives of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to hold fresh public hearings on the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Goa, the state has announced that the hearing will be conducted from July 8 onwards. Environment minister Nilesh Cabral said that the hearings will continue for any number of days till the time all those who have registered to speak have put forth their representations on the CZMP. As per the NGT’s order to provide a large enough venue for the public hearing to accommodate bigger participation, the state government has announced that the Campal parade grounds in Panaji and the SGPDA grounds in Margao will be the venues for the hearings. The hearings will begin at 10am at both venues on July 8. Those who want to speak at the hearing can either register by email with the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) by June 30 or give their names in writing to the office of both the district collectors by 5pm on June 30. Citizens, who are unable to register themselves to speak at the hearing by June 30, will be allowed to register their names to speak at the venue on the day of the hearing upto 2pm. One can also opt to speak virtually at the hearing, from safety of their homes. Each participant will be provided a maximum of 15 minutes to make their representation, GCZMA has said. “We will allow them to submit their representations at the site. We will allow people to speak virtually at the hearing. We are following the NGT directives in letter and spirit. We want to listen with an open mind and take everyone’s views and we want to address every single view. It may take two days, three days or one day. We will provide for 15% more seating arrangements over and above those who register in advance upto June 30,” said Cabral. Cabral said that waterproof pandals will be set up at the public hearing venues due to the monsoon. “We will have it open air. Waterproof pandals will be set up and we will accommodate more people,” said Cabral. Goa Foundation had approached NGT stating that due processes were not followed during the conduct of the earlier public hearing for the CZMP, based on which the Tribunal ordered fresh hearings to be held. “The speakers who have registered by email or in writing by June 30 will be allowed to speak as per the sequence of receipt of the registration. Speakers registering at venue will be allowed to speak after the speakers who have registered by June 30 complete their submission,” GCZMA has said. Goa Foundation has objected to the limit of 15 minutes imposed on every speaker at the public hearing, warning that it may be challenged if not dropped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fresh-round-of-public-hearings-on-draft-coastal-plan-from-jul-8/articleshow/83352144.cms||---

No one, however, died or was injured in the blast. The sound of the explosion was so loud that people of Navtolia village under Banka Sadar police station area started running helter-skelter amid thick smoke billowing from the madrassa building, local sources said. “Banka SP Arvind Kumar Gupta is at the explosion site and has started investigation,” Bhagalpur zonal DIG Sujeet Kumar said while on way to Navtolia village in the afternoon. When asked about the kind of explosives used in the blast, the DIG said the forensic science laboratory (FSL) experts will investigate whether any explosive was used or not. “So far we have not received information about injury to any person. We are gathering more details,” he said. Banka SP Arvind Kumar Gupta said the FSL team has initiated investigations. “We are investigating the incident with open mind and will come to any conclusion only after the FSL report. Locals are also being interrogated to gather more details,” he said. The locals suspect that the explosion was the result of illegal activities being carried out by some antisocial elements as the madrassa building was stated to be closed for more than a month due to Covid-induced lockdown. Police are, however, tight-lipped about the reason behind the explosion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/blast-damages-madrassa-building-in-banka/articleshow/83349909.cms||Kumar Rajesh

The girls resided around 2.5km from the spot. Both had left home together on Friday, saying they are going for a walk in the forest. When they did not return, their family approached police and filed missing person complaints. On Monday evening, both bodies were found by villagers, who informed Murbad police. Police said they sent the bodies for post-mortem to JJ hospital in Mumbai, which confirmed they died by suicide. Inspector Dattatray Borate said a primary probe revealed that the elder girl was depressed about not getting married, while the other girl was upset with workload at home, including filling water from around 500 metres away from a well in the village daily. There have been similar suicides in Thane district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/2-cousins-die-by-suicide-in-thane-forest/articleshow/83352170.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Mumbai||MVA leaders tell Modi about delay by governor in clearing names for council||MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s delegation comprising CM Uddhav Thackeray, Deputy CM Ajit Pawar and public works minister Ashok Chavan on Tuesday brought to the notice of PM Modi the delay in nominations to 12 seats to the legislative council by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. After the delegation submitted more than a dozen memoranda to the PM on key issues, Ajit Pawar expressed concern over Koshyari’s failure to appoint nominees on the council despite the fact that a list of 12 persons had been submitted to Raj Bhavan on November 7, 2020 after following due procedure. Ajit Pawar sought the PM’s intervention to resolve the issue in a time-bound manner. “We feel that the PM must step in and ask the governor to clear the proposal as early as possible and if there is a dispute, he should sent the file back to the CM,” a senior cabinet member told TOI. On November 7, 2020, a delegation comprising the Shiv Sena’s Anil Parab, NCP’s Nawab Malik and Congress’ Amit Deshmukh had called on Koshyari and submitted a list of “12 eminent persons from different walks of life” for appointment on the legislative council as nominees of the governor. Under the Constitution, the governor has the powers to appoint 12 persons who have special knowledge of literature, science, arts, the cooperative movement and social service on the legislative council. Significantly, while the advice of the council of ministers is binding on the governor, no timeframe has been fixed in the Constitution when it comes to making nominations on the council, and it is purely the governor’s discretion. “We had expected the governor would take a decision in a reasonable period, but there was no response. So it was felt we should knock at the doors of the PM. We expect a decision very soon,” the minister said. In the recent past, RTI activist Anil Galgali was informed the relevant file was not in the Raj Bhavan secretariat. State Congress president Nana Patole had said the governor and Raj Bhavan were not different. “From the reply, it appears the file is not in the Raj Bhavan secretariat but with the governor. It,” Patole had then said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-leaders-tell-modi-about-delay-by-guv-in-clearing-names-for-council/articleshow/83353262.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Frequent incidents of bursting of canals are reported, which affected the water supply to different parts of North Goa. On Monday, a canal burst at Kasarvarne in Pernem taluka, leaving the main road and nearby cashew plantations inundated. “Survey work is going on for the new pipeline. That will take one month. Estimates will then be submitted. By August, the total project will be finalised. Work will start only after monsoon,” said WRD executive engineer M K Prasad. Bardez, Pernem, and Bicholim talukas depend on supply from Tillari. The pipeline will be laid on land already acquired for the Tillari project. Officials said that closed pipeline will carry the water from the Tillari reservoir till Dodamarg, near the Goa border. From here, the water will continue to flow in an open canal within Goa’s border. Until the time the project was approved, WRD officials had said that all incidents of canals bursting had been experienced on the Maharashtra side. This was seen as a challenge in coordinating speedy repair works in case of a canal breach. Officials had maintained that the canals within Goa’s borders were well-maintained. However, on Tuesday, it was proven otherwise when the burst was witnessed within Goa at Kasarvarne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/work-of-new-pipeline-for-tillari-water-to-begin-after-monsoon/articleshow/83352164.cms||---

A special panel formed for suggesting alternate venues has recommended three new sites, including one in front of the main building of the university. Sanjay Nimbalkar, one of the panel members, on Tuesday said the management council would decide the final site during the next meeting scheduled soon. “The campus of the history department and another place near its vicinity are two other shortlisted sites for installing the statue. The other parameters of the project remain the same,” he said. Among different voices of protest, a teachers’ union called Swabhimani Maharashtra Underprivileged Teachers Association and an NGO Eco Needs Foundation were vocal against installation of the statue concerned at the botanical garden over possible damage to different rare species of plants and trees housed there. A section from the botany department maintained they were not consulted before finalising the site, but refused to come on the record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bamu-to-shift-proposed-shivaji-maharaj-statue-site/articleshow/83344974.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Ludhiana: Body wrapped in 4 gunny bags found in Kanganwal||LUDHIANA: Panic gripped Rudra Enclave in Kanganwal after a body wrapped in gunny bags was found at a vacant plot on Tuesday morning. A morning walker raised the alarm and called the police on spotting it. Though the body was wrapped in four gunny bags that were tied up with a rope, a shape that seemed to be of feet made the walker suspicious. On receiving the information, police reached the spot. Sahnewal police station SHO sub-inspector Balwinder Singh said, “Around 7.45am, a passerby noticed the gunny bag and informed us. The bag had the body of a woman, who seemed to be around 40-year-old. Her feet and hands were tied up with ropes. The body has a deep cut on right side of head and a slit throat. After murdering her, the accused had put the body in a gunny bag, wrapped it in three more bags and tried them with a rope.” “The woman appears to be a native of Nepal. There is a tattoo on the right arm which is in Nepalese. There is a market near Kanganwal where Nepalese run eating joints. We are questioning them to identify her. We are also scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed near the spot,” the SHO added. On some area residents saying the body also had acid burns, the SHO said, “There are no acid burns.”  “There are no signs of assault or rape. However, the autopsy report will make things clear. The body has been kept in the mortuary.

The child, Manju, along with her 60-year-old grandmother, Sukhi, was out in the scorching sun at Raniwara in Jalore district on Sunday when the thirsty girl succumbed to heat. The grandmother is recovering at the district hospital. The girl, who was abandoned by her mother following the death of her father, was being taken care of by her grandmother. The child’s death also prompted the Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) to write to the district administration to provide necessary help to the family. Calling it a grave situation, NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma asked the government to provide medical help as well as compensation to the old woman and the minor’s family. The women commission also sought action against officials, who failed to discharge their duties, and asked the government to take steps to prevent such incidents in the future. It also asked for feedback about the steps taken by the government and called for ensuring basic amenities for women and children. Urging for CM’s personal intervention in the matter, the letter further said, “This unfortunate incident and painful news raises serious concerns and doubts about the failure of state government to provide even the basic necessities like water to its people. They are lying and dying on the roads asking for water in the scorching sun.” Sukhi and Manju had left their village to see a family member in Roda village on foot on Sunday afternoon. On the way, they felt thirsty due to the scorching heat. They were not carrying water and failed to find any around as the place was uninhabited and, later, fell unconscious. Somes shepherds spotted the two and informed the sarpanch of the village, who informed the police. Though both were rushed to the hospital, the grandmother survived while the girl was declared dead. Jalore district collector Namrata Vrishni told TOI, “The old woman and the girl stayed alone in village in Jalore and were going to a relative’s place when the incident happened. We received a call but by the time they were taken to hospital, the girl had died. The grandmother is undergoing treatment.” The RSCPCR letter also instructed the district administration to make adequate arrangements for water. A report of the incident as well as the measures taken by the government has to be sent to the child commission within a week’s time.

Illegally-mined stones rolled down dangerously from the hydraulic trolley and blocked the road and the patrolling party had a miraculous escape. In March 2012, IPS officer Narendra Kumar Singh, posted in Morena district, was allegedly killed by members of the mining mafia. Incidentally, he had seized many vehicles carrying illegally-mined stones and sand. “The driver maneuvered the vehicle dexterously or we would have met with a serious accident”, said Shraddha Pandre, the superintendent of the sanctuary. Mining activities are banned in Chambal sanctuary. in Morena district. But the mafia continues to mine sand and stone with impunity, police sources said. The sanctuary, housing endangered gharials and other aquatic life, including dolphins, is severely threatened by the mining activities. The sanctuary superintendent said after instructions of the divisional forest officer (DFO), the sanctuary staff was monitoring the checking points on AB Road. She said that the tractor driver carrying stones did not stop, fearing action and attempted to empty the trolley on the sanctuary vehicle. Pandre said that a police complaint has been filed. The forest department personnel and police had to open fire at the sand mafia in Morena in the wee hours of May 22. The mafia, smuggling sand, tried to run over the staff patrolling near the Chambal river. It is the third such incident in the recent past when the mining mafia tried to run over field staff of the forest department protecting the Chambal gharial sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/stone-mafia-targets-chambal-patrol-staff/articleshow/83349979.cms||Deshdeep Saxena

The three fraudsters, including one woman, accused the medical shop owner of selling expired medicines and extorted Rs 44,000 from him by threatening to suspend his licence. Police arrested Rahul Sarate (27), a resident of Chembur, under IPC sections for cheating and posing as government official and under the Information Technology Act, on Monday. Police said Sarate was produced before the court and remanded to police custody till June 11 as they are looking for his two other associates. Sarate’s lawyer Sunil Pandey, however, told the court that Sarate was wrongly arrested as he was the whistleblower who exposed the medical shop owner selling expired goods. Sarate claims he did not demand any money but police framed him in the case. Police, on the other hand, told the court that they want to arrest two more associates and also want to recover Rs 44,000 which was transferred into his account through google pay. Police said on June 6, the chemist received a call from a man saying he was an FDA inspector and he had learnt that the chemist was selling some expired Bournvita.  Later, two people barged into the shop saying they were from FDA and if he wanted to prevent suspension of his license, he should talk to ‘senior inspector Surekha Patil’, the third imposter. Police said together the three forced the shop owner to transfer around Rs 44,000 to Patil’s google account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-pose-as-fda-officials-dupe-chemist-in-colaba-of-rs-44000/articleshow/83352273.cms||Ahmed Ali

In addition to the complaints, even videos of drivers from other states levelling serious allegations of harassment and extortion by traffic and highway police in the state have been uploaded on various social media platforms in recent days. Jalna superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh told TOI, “We initiated action against these policemen for their unethical as well as unprofessional activities.” The officer said he himself caught three traffic policemen, belonging to the city traffic division, while they were busy stopping heavy vehicles from other states outside their jurisdiction and harassing them. “There is no reason for traffic constables from Jalna city division to go to rural areas and get involved in such unethical practices,” said Deshmukh.The other seven, who have been shunted out to the headquarters, are from traffic rural division. Those who have been shunted out, include assistant sub inspector AD Devkar, constables Digambar Barle, AN Dandge, AP Kanake, Ashok Yedke, PK Golwal, VS Sardar, JK Sundarde, VD Majalkar and driver GD Golde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/10-traffic-cops-shunted-to-hq-in-jalna/articleshow/83345067.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Goa||Goa government trips power works, may as well sit at home: Nilesh Cabral||PANAJI: Three days after chief minister Pramod Sawant rejected his proposal for compulsory pre-marital counselling, power minister Nilesh Cabral on Tuesday came down heavily on his own government and held Sawant’s finance department responsible for the electricity mess in the state by refusing to sanction infrastructure upgradation projects. “Files are being sent back by the finance department with a note that the proposal should be sent after the budget, but no one knows when the complete budget will be passed. I am going to ask CM (who also holds the finance portfolio) whether I should work or sit at home,” Cabral said. He said even after the budget is passed—currently it is only a vote on account that has been taken—the finance department will send another circular curtailing expenditure. The power minister said that it had been decided by the state government to give priority to underground cabling of 33KV and 11KV lines, but the work has not progressed as planned. “I am asked all the time and I keep assuring that the work is being done. I feel ashamed of myself. If we lay underground cables, our people will not be inconvenienced as much. I will ask the CM how works like underground cabling are to be taken up,” Cabral said. He said the issue wasn’t shortage of funds but the indifference of the finance department officials. “I have told the CM that I will get the funds too. There is the Power Finance Commission and other such bodies, and the Centre has given them power to give funds to the states for electricity infrastructure. I have got Rs 1,400 crore sanctioned from them. But they require government guarantee,” he said. Taking a dig at Sawant for his misplaced priorities, Cabral said the focus of the government should be to provide the basics of good water supply, good roads and reliable electricity, but the finance department was creating hindrance in delivering these necessities. “If we cannot give three necessities—water, electricity and roads—then we are not proper. We have to work sincerely and deliver to the people. If I cannot work and deliver, then I should not be part of the political system. I want to tell the CM, and it is for him to decide whether his finance department understands,” he said. Cabral also requested the CM for an urgent meeting with the finance department officials “after the cabinet meet on Wednesday to decide on the electricity infrastructure” issues. The power minister said due to the finance department officials, staffers from his department were left to face the brunt of the citizens. “Work is not being held up by them. It is because of finance,” he said. “If things are going to go like this and if files are going to keep coming back for no fault of the department, then where will the progress take place, and why should my department face the music? There are groups who are holding morchas and dharnas against department staffers. If the government cannot give the administration proper direction, then I do not know,” Cabral said. He said the funds from the Centre for electricity infrastructure upgradation do not have to be paid back in the first three years. “If you provide the electricity, then the people will also pay, and we will be able to recover the expenditure within 5-6 years. I think the CM does not know these issues,” he said. The minister said individual departments did not have the free hand they need to carry out infrastructure works. “When budgets are given, you should give a free hand to departments to do the work. After the budget, we have spent Rs 300 crore, but we are yet to get the money as the budget could not take place and it was only a vote on account,” Cabral said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-trips-power-works-may-as-well-sit-at-home-cabral/articleshow/83352226.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa chief minister rejects health departments plan to buy Rs 10 crore Ivermectin||PANAJI: A day after the Union government dropped Ivermectin from the country’s Covid treatment protocol, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday rejected a file moved by the state health department regarding the purchase of Rs 10 crore worth the drug. “The file was rejected by the CM because the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) decided to drop the drug for Covid treatment,” sources said. On Monday, after the Centre’s revised guidance, Sawant said he would decide on the state’s stance towards the drug. In early May, health minister Vishwajit Rane announced that the state would give all those above 18 years of age Ivermectin tablets as a prophylactic to combat the severity of Covid-19. He said the decision was based on studies conducted in the US and UK. The next day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) stated that the medication can only be prescribed for clinical trials. “Safety and efficacy are important when using any drug for a new indication. @WHO recommends against the use of ivermectin for Covid-19 except within clinical trials,” said WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan. The contentious issue also recently came up before the high court of Bombay at Goa. “As regards the use of Ivermectin, the issue raised by the petitioner concerns mainly its prophylactic use,” the court observed. “As for its therapeutic use, it is nobody’s case that the medicine has not been included by ICMR for Covid-19 treatment protocol. Though the expert committee of the state, in its decision dated 13/05/2021, has recommended even prophylactic use of Ivermectin, from the affidavit filed by the state (through) the additional secretary (health), what emerges is that the state has, for the present, decided that Ivermectin would be given to all suspected and symptomatic patients, and provided in the kit to be supplied to positive patients in home isolation.” “It does not appear that as of now, the state has been promoting the prophylactic use of these medicines,” the court further observed. “In case, however, the state does so in future, it will be open for the petitioners to raise appropriate objections and the matter in that case will be dealt with by this court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-rejects-health-dept-plan-to-buy-rs-10cr-ivermectin/articleshow/83352243.cms||---

A decision to unlock the state was taken at the meeting of the crisis management group (CMG) of the government chaired by CM Nitish Kumar. The fresh orders will remain effective till June 15. The CM said though lockdown was being lifted, night curfew from 7pm to 5am will continue and non-essential shops will have to down their shutters by 5pm. While shops selling essential commodities, health and agriculture products will be allowed to remain open on all days, those falling in other categories will be allowed to open on alternate days based on orders issued by the district administration concerned. There will be no restriction on movement of private vehicles and common people on the roads, except during night curfew hours. Besides, government and private offices will be allowed to open with 50% staff strength. “Lockdown has led to fall in Covid cases. Hence, lockdown is being lifted, but night curfew will remain effective from 7pm to 5am. Government as well as private offices will be allowed to remain open with 50% attendance till 4pm. Shops will be allowed to remain open till 5pm,” Nitish tweeted. The CM further tweeted that online education will be continued and cautioned people against crowding. The state government had enforced lockdown on May 5 in the wake of massive spurt in Covid cases. The lockdown was extended four times with complete restriction on movement of private vehicles. Private offices also remained closed during this period. Over a month since the imposition of lockdown, number of active Covid cases in the state has come down to nearly 8,000, positivity rate reduced to 1% and recovery rate increased to 98.09%. By lifting the lockdown, Bihar has joined the league of states like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, which are opening up in staggered manner through phase-wise unlock measures. Despite lifting of lockdown, all educational institutions, including schools and colleges, religious places, restaurants, cinema halls and shopping malls will remain closed in the state. “We cannot say anything with certainty about opening of schools and colleges at present. All religious places will continue to remain closed. Besides, only 20 people will be allowed in marriages,” chief secretary Tripurai Sharan told reporters after the meeting of the CMG. Additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad said the exceptions in the night curfew would include movement of vehicles for health services, private vehicles on inter-state highways, those issued e-passes and those travelling to and from airports and railway stations with tickets. “Public transport vehicles will be allowed to operate with 50% occupancy. Wearing of face masks will be compulsory for passengers and others. Entry of outsiders will not be allowed in government offices till further orders,” Prasad added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-lifts-lockdown-night-curfew-continues/articleshow/83350079.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Mumbai||Removed 35% more sludge despite lockdown, says BMC||MUMBAI: After BJP allegations that BMC had failed to clean up nullahs ahead of the monsoon, the civic body on Tuesday claimed it had removed around 3.24 lakh tonnes of silt from drains. BMC claimed it had completed 104% of desilting work in the city before the monsoon. Officials said BMC had planned to remove around 3.11 lakh tonnes of silt but it ended up removing 3.24 lakh tonnes. “This was done by the end of May, well within the deadline. This year, the target was to remove 35% more sludge compared to last year. It has been completed by Storm Water Drains (SWD) department. This was done despite Covid-19 lockdown,” said a senior civic official. “It was decided to remove about 4.13 lakh metric tons of sludge from major nullas throughout the year. Of this, it was decided to remove 3 .11 lakh metric tonnes of sludge before the monsoon. By the end of May, 3.24 lakh tonnes has been removed as part of pre-monsoon work. The sludge was transported by over 19,000 truck trips,” the official said. BMC officials said that of the total silt removed, 43,766 tonnes was removed in the city, 1.6 lakh tonnes in eastern suburbs and 1.82 lakh tonnes in western suburbs. It took 11,004 truck trips to transport the silt from drains to sites outside the city. Ruling parties in BMC indulged in ‘hath safai’ instead of ‘nullah safai’, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said on Monday, after ‘inspecting’ desilting work across the city. Shelar led a BJP delegation to inspect pre-monsoon desilting of drains by BMC. “BMC’s claims of having carried out 107% desilting is nothing but a farce. If these claims fail, we will dump silt outside the home of additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu. They are misleading people. There is trash in all nullahs and drains. BMC is only making claims that desilting works is 100% so that it can clear bills of contractors. The administration has failed. We will expose BMC and claims,” Shelar had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-removed-35-more-sludge-despite-lockdown-says-bmc/articleshow/83352255.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Good start’ to ending NDA-oppn bitterness, say parties in Aghadi||MUMBAI: PM Modi’s meeting with a delegation comprising CM Uddhav Thackeray, Deputy CM Ajit Pawar and public works minister Ashok Chavan is being viewed by the opposition as a message to opposition- ruled states that the PM does not believe in confrontation. The NDA government’s relations with opposition-ruled states had been strained, but Tuesday’s meeting appeared to have changed perceptions. “It’s a good beginning. PM Modi has taken the lead in resolving problems faced by state governments,” a Congress leader said. The Congress leader said that after the SC verdict on Maratha reservation, Thackeray had called on Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The CM had then said that he would also call on the PM to press the demand for a Maratha quota. “We never thought the PM will agree to meet so soon, particularly in view of the fact that the state is ruled by Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray. Secondly, even if the PM grants us an appointment, whether he would listen to us patiently was a question. It was a surprise for MVA constituents that he not only granted time but heard them for a long time,” the Congress leader said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik felt it was good that the PM heard the CM of an opposition-ruled state. “We hope that since he has given us a patient hearing, he takes immediate steps for resolving the row over Maratha reservation. If the PM decides, the matter will be resolved in a time-bound manner,” Malik said. Congress’ Ashok Chavan said the MVA delegation had taken issues of public importance and those involving larger public interest. “He heard us at length. We expect he will step in and ensure that Marathas get reservation. We also raised more than a dozen other issues,” Chavan told TOI. Another Congress cabinet member said the PM’s meeting with MVA leaders was being viewed as an attempt at an image makeover. “The NDA government is at loggerheads with the West Bengal and New Delhi governments. In Maharashtra too, it was not a happy situation as over half-a-dozen politicians of Shiv Sena and NCP are under the scrutiny of ED, I-T department and CBI. We hope the situation will improve,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-good-start-to-ending-nda-oppn-bitterness-say-parties-in-aghadi/articleshow/83353267.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that the service would be fully operational from Friday. Speaking to reporters, Godinho said that the transport department has as many as 174 services, and that the department would gradually take them all online. The 16 services which are made available online include new goods carriage permits, new national permit authorisations, new temporary permits, renewal of goods carriage permits, renewal of national permit authorisations, cancellation of goods carriage permits, cancellation of national permit authorisations, cancellation of temporary permits, duplicate goods carriage permits, duplicate national permit authorisations, duplicate temporary permits, and transfer of national permit authorisations. “To avail of these services, people would have to visit the RTO offices, but now, they can sit at home and avail of them,” Godinho said. Meanwhile, the minister also said that 59 people have been paid compensation under the Goa state interim compensation to road accident victims scheme, which was notified in 2013. He also said that the state government is considering providing relaxations to apply under the scheme. As of now, a victim or their family has to apply within six months of an accident. “Even if they apply after one year of the accident, they will get the funds,” he said. Speaking on panchayats, Godinho, who is also panchayats minister, said they have asked the local bodies to take up pre-monsoon work. He also said that panchayats should reach out to people in distress due to the pandemic. “For the first time, we have authorised small panchayats to spend Rs 2 lakh and bigger panchayats to spend as much as Rs 5 lakh to help people during the pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-takes-online-route-for-16-transport-services/articleshow/83352222.cms||---

The necessary data needs to reflect in the SARAL portal of the government and all schools have been asked to comply with the order. The development has not gone down well with many schools as it categorically states completion certificate of uploading a minimum 90% Aadhaar database of students needs to be produced along with pay-bills for the month of June. A school principal said the ZP education department in a way was threatening schools that staff salaries will be withheld in case of non-compliance. “Schools were closed due to pandemic and it is unjust to suddenly ask for submission of Aadhaar data of almost 90% students by the end of June. Such diktat will pose issues before schools as well as parents,” the principal said. Educational activist Prashant Sathe said the order may cause crowding at Aadhaar centres that have resumed functioning from June 7. “The government run-Aadhaar centres were closed for a considerable period due to the restrictions. The post-office and some banks were carrying out a limited amount of Aadhaar work. The parents of students who do not have Aadhaar will have to struggle to get the desired document,” he said. When contacted, ZP authorities said the orders seeking updating the Aadhaar database of students were issued in the past that too on multiple occasions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/give-aadhaar-details-of-students-zp-tells-schools/articleshow/83345127.cms||---

Over a dozen posters put up near Kutchery Chowk and its adjoining localities reportedly by Janshakti Vikash Party (JVP) slammed the MP for remaining incommunicado at the time of crisis. The posters further claimed that the MP had not visited his constituency even once in the last six months. JVP chief Pradip Kumar Singh also announced a reward for tracing Chirag. “The MP is so callous that he doesn’t respond to phone calls of people from his constituency, from where he has been elected to the Lok Sabha twice,” one of the posters read. The JVP chief lashed out at Chirag for leaving people of Jamui to fend for themselves when they required the MP’s assistance the most. “Is the MP not irresponsible? When will he pay the people’s obligations for their support?” he asked. Though Chirag could not be contacted for his comments, his ‘representative’ in the constituency, Prakash Bhagat, said the MP could not visit the constituency as he got infected with coronavirus. “Even then, Chirag tried his best to set up oxygen plant in the constituency. Last year, when the virus hit the people, the MP had not only toured different villages but also provided assistance to the affected people,” Prakash asserted. Moreover, the state government has restricted the movement of people’s representatives in view of rising cases of Covid-19 infection in the state, Bhagat clarified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/posters-put-up-in-jamui-to-trace-missing-chirag/articleshow/83350137.cms||Ramashankar

On Tuesday, the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) uprighted the fallen sentinel by re-planting the massive tree right where it belonged, thus reuniting it with its roots. Members of the Goa Green Brigade noticed the uprooted tree had been lying on the footpath for close to three weeks and had by then developed shoots. “The tree was condemned to be cut into pieces and taken away. After we were informed that the tree was still living, and it can be saved, we called some experts – a team of botanists and horticulturists – to examine the tree and they confirmed that it was living. They advised that it can be replanted in the same spot,” CCP commissioner, Agnelo Fernnades told TOI. He further said that other trees can be saved in Panaji if they are closely examined for signs of life. What followed was the Goa Green Brigade’s efforts to save the tree and CCP took up the task of pruning its branches, erecting it upright and re-planting its trunk into a pit filled with manure. Environmental activist and coordinator in the Goa Green Brigade, Avertino Miranda said that this concept of re-planting can be replicated all over Goa. “In Panaji, the CCP has the manpower, equipment, mud, manure and machines to undertake the task of saving trees. The commissioner has assured us that the uprooted trees will be saved,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/civic-body-uprights-100-yr-old-uprooted-tree-in-panaji/articleshow/83352247.cms||Nida Sayed

The equipment include a lifeline launcher, thermal imaging and victim location cameras. The lifeline launcher can be used to throw ropes and life jacket at a distance of 150 meter to a person who is drowning during a flood. For saving people trapped under debris, the victim location camera can come in handy to search and communicate with them. And the thermal imaging cameras can help locate people trapped in fire-engulfed buildings. “Most of the big civic bodies have such equipment. We had several equipment to choose from, but we chose these three due to the need felt during such disasters. These equipment have been bought from the Rs 18 lakh approved by district planning and development council,” Ranjit Chile, chief fire officer of KMC, said. “The equipment will be in custody of the fire department. The administration has decided to train some of the computer savvy fire staff to use these equipment. Using thermal imaging and victim location cameras require proper training,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapurs-civic-body-gets-advanced-tools-for-rescue-ops/articleshow/83345227.cms||---

If the transport minister Mauvin Godinho is partial to the suggestion of fare hike, then he must ensure that the taxi operators do not get the opportunity to fleece customers like it has been their wont. For this, it is imperative that transport minister insist that all fares be charged against meter readings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/times-view/articleshow/83352304.cms||---

The move came after Rinkle’s brother Mani met the official, seeking transfer of the probe. Mani said, “I met ADCP Pragya Jain and told her that we do not trust ACP Waryam Singh, as earlier, too, he had been biased while investigating Rinkle’s murder. The officer has now marked the inquiry to ACP (North) Gurbinder Singh.”  “Though we had sought probe by an IPS officer, the ADCP has assured us a fair and unbiased investigation. She has directed the official to trace all the people whose names Sunny Nai took in his videos,” he added. The ADCP said, “The family did not want the ACP (Central) to investigate the case. Therefore, the task has been assigned to ACP (North).”  On June 1, Sunny Nai, who is wanted by the police in Rinkle murder case, had released his videos on social media. In these, he narrated the entire incident and said he was roped in to execute the murder on the orders of Congress coucillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu. Sunny had also questioned the SIT, which had given a clean chit to Neetu. Sunny had taken a few more names allegedly involved in the crime. Mani had given a complaint to commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal on June 2, demanding probe by an IPS officer. In September 2018, Rinkle was assaulted to death at his house in Amarpura by a group of miscreants. Rinkle’s family had alleged that he had a rivalry with Congress leader Neetu and he got him killed. In the case, Neetu’s son was also arrested.

According to an official statement, Suresh Kumar Trehan and Sunirmal Ghatak, both senior citizens, were administered the experimental therapy on June 1.  “We conducted RT-PCR test on two Covid-positive patients eight days after developing symptoms and it turned out to a definite negative. They were administered antibodies cocktail therapy within three days of obtaining a Covid-positive report. This is the fastest-ever recovery reported in patients, particularly senior citizens suffering from comorbidities,” Dr Sandeep Nayar, senior director and head of the department of chest and respiratory diseases at the hospital, said. The monoclonal antibody cocktail, which was given to former US President Donald Trump last year when he contracted Covid, was launched in India last month. The therapy in India is priced at Rs 59,750 per dose. “In the light of this development, the monoclonal antibody cocktail can safely be termed as a ‘game-changer’ in the fight against Covid,” Dr Nayar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctor-cocktail-drug-speeds-up-covid-recovery/articleshow/83350167.cms||---
---||Goa||Taxi fares in Goa may be hiked soon, says transport minister||PANAJI: The state is likely to soon see taxi fares soar as transport minister Mauvin Godinho on Tuesday hinted that he would accept the recommendations of the state transport authority (STA) to revise the fares. He said that the STA met last week and is expected to submit its recommendation. “Let us see how much of a hike they recommend, but I, as government, am inclined to accept the higher fare,” Godinho told reporters. “Recently, Maharashtra too approved a hike of Rs 3 per km, and other states have also done so.” The minister also said that installation of taxi meters has not picked up as expected. He also said that taxi operators are using excuses not to fix meters — no tourists, pandemic, and off-season. He said that to protect the local operators, the government has not allowed app-based aggregators to set shop in the state. Godinho said that it is the directive of the high court that within six months, taxis have to install digital meters. “We will ensure that they fix the meter,” he said. “If they don’t fix it, then we will have to take action. If we don’t take action, the HC will take action against us.” Godinho said that since the operators may not be able to pay for it, the government would give them 50% of the money within a month of installation of the meter, and the remaining at the end of the year. “Basically, they are getting the meter free,” Godinho said. “I want them to value what is given free to them. I also want them to value public opinion, which is for fixing digital meters because they want rational fares.” He said that the government has considered “every demand” of the operators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/taxi-fares-in-state-may-be-hiked-soon-says-transport-min/articleshow/83352309.cms||---

Therefore, keeping the applicant with other inmates will cause grave threat to life, safety and security of the applicant and hence, need for a separate cell is of utmost importance.” Kumar said he consumed supplements such as “isolate whey protein, Omega 3 capsules, jointment capsules, pre-workout C4 and hyde, multivitamin GNC” and required a special nutrition diet owing to his profession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/order-on-sushils-special-diet-today/articleshow/83350214.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The court passed the order on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by B Ramkumar Adityan, an advocate, and a resident of Tuticorin district. The petitioner had challenged the GO issued in April which had imposed certain restrictions such as night curfew and complete lockdown on Sundays in the state. He also sought to permit transportation in the state without any restrictions as the Union home ministry in its guidelines has reiterated that there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of people. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi said that a subsequent GO passed on May 22, complete lockdown was imposed in the state. In light of the aforesaid GO, the prayer sought for in the petition has become infructuous. Hence, the judges dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-against-night-curfew/articleshow/83334433.cms||---

The court granted interim custody-bail to Tanha for two weeks to stay at a hotel in the city to study and appear for the exams.

---||Goa||Goa may implement new Motor Vehicles Act with ‘bare minimum fines’||PANAJI: The state cabinet on Wednesday is likely to decide on the implementation of the amended Motor Vehicles Act with “bare minimum” fines for traffic violators. “We have placed the file before the cabinet and it has the least amount of fine for traffic violations,” transport minister Mauvin Godinho told reporters on Tuesday. “I have cleared the file to implement the amended Motor Vehicles Act, and sent it to the chief minister. We should implement it, or the Centre will pull us up.” In April, the state government had notified penalties for violations under the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, 2019, which was to come into force in Goa on May 1. However, after BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade demanded that its implementation be kept in abeyance, the state government put it in cold storage. The new law came into force on September 1, 2019, and all states were expected to implement it. But after some governments, including Gujarat and Uttarakhand, raised concerns about some of the hiked fines, they lowered penalties for certain traffic violations. Later, the Centre announced that no state could lower traffic penalties below the prescribed level, as the Act was a parliamentary legislation and state governments could not pass any law or take executive action unless the President’s assent was obtained to the related state law. The central legislation has since been enforced in other parts of the country, but the Goa government deferred it after members of the general public lashed out over the decrepit condition of roads across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-may-implement-new-mv-act-with-bare-min-fines/articleshow/83352371.cms||---

Aman was behind the sensational murder in outer Delhi last December.The accused and his aides suspected that a man, identified as Rohit KD, was passing information about their whereabouts to Jathedi and his aide Priyavrat. They first opened fire at Priyavrat’s house and then shot KD dead in Katewara village.The murders had led to Jathedi gang members killing one Shashi from Pradhan’s gang in March in Katewara, and another man named Dhole on the instructions of Kathedi and Lawrence Bishnoi.DCP Pramod Kushwaha said: “Aman had a reward of Rs 50,000 on him.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: School built on Tilak’s values turns 100 today||MUMBAI: If you search for Parle Tilak Vidyalaya Association (PTVA) on YouTube, you will stumble upon a sweet-voiced school teacher named Anuradha Gore giving her students two atypical pieces of pre-exam advice in Marathi: “Do not compare yourself to other students” and “Education is a lifelong journey.” Both the messages and the medium of this video on PTVA’s new online channel would surely have pleased the leader whose bust is sporting a fresh garland today inside the Marathi-medium school’s premises in Vile Parle. Exactly a 100 years ago on this day, it was Lokmanya Tilak’s belief in value-based education that had inspired a bunch of his ardent followers—Dadasaheb Pardhi, Vishnu Paranjpe, Krushnaji Agashe, Gopal Phatak, Ganesh Pethe and Bhaskar Bhide—to establish the school after the leader’s passing in August 1920. PTVA began in a room inside Pardhi’s bungalow in Vile Parle (east) with four students on June 9, 1921. Today, it has blossomed into an educational conglomerate that holds under its umbrella six schools and several colleges apart from the PTVA Institute of Management, Centre of Enterprise and Innovation and a sports academy. “When the school began, the teachers would offer their services for free,” says Dr Snehlata Deshmukh, a member of the board at PTVA, adding the sense of duty of many teachers remains untouched by monetary concerns. In line with Tilak’s prescription for national progress—embracing modernity without sacrificing tradition—the school, whose products include filmmaker Sandeep Sawant of ‘Shwaas’ fame and noted writer P L Deshpande among other stalwarts, now boasts an Internet connection, a projector and computers as well as a monthly Sanskrit programme that was started on the school’s YouTube channel last year.  Efforts are now on to offer additional courses such as law at the management institute and to make the colleges autonomous. “The advantage of autonomy is the freedom to frame your own curriculum,” says Dr Deshmukh. Tilak, who swore by Swarajya, would approve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-school-built-on-tilaks-values-turns-100-today/articleshow/83352406.cms||---

Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan launched the service at an online event where he dedicated to the nation 201 CNG stations countrywide, including 54 set up by IGL across Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Jointly developed by IGL and the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation, each mobile refuelling unit carries 1,500 kg of CNG and can refuel 100-150 vehicles at an average of 10kg each, company executives said. The service kicked off with one such unit deployed in Vasant Kunj area, which has a paucity of CNG stations. Pradhan said the future of fuel retail lay in mobile dispensing and advised IGL to target shopping malls, office complexes and housing societies so that CNG car owners or taxi operators could refuel without having to waste time and fuel in visiting a filling station. IGL director (commercial) Amit Garg said the mobile dispensing service will enhance customer experience by bringing CNG at the doorstep of consumers and expand coverage in areas where the number of CNG stations is low or non-existent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/igl-kicks-off-mobile-cng-filling-service/articleshow/83350272.cms||---

The study, conducted to evaluate the neutralisation potential of the Covaxin, found a 3-fold and 2.7-fold reduction in neutralisation titres (concentration of neutralising antibodies) against Beta and Delta variants. On the other hand, the study found that the reduction in neutralising titres using sera of Covid-19 recovered cases was 3.3-fold and 4.6-fold against Beta and Delta variants. The researchers concluded that with a lower reduction in neutralisation titre in those vaccinated with Covaxin as compared to naturally infected individuals, the whole-virion inactivated vaccine demonstrated protective response against the two variants of concern. “Our study demonstrated that despite a reduction in neutralization titers with BBV152 vaccines sera against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, its neutralization potential is well established. Lastly, the broad epitope coverage of an inactivated vaccine (BBV152) decreases the magnitude of reduced neutralization against emerging variants,” the researchers said. The study, which was uploaded on bioRxiv that carries preprints of research papers before they are peer-reviewed, was conducted by researchers from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech. The study was conducted by collecting the sera of 20 people after 5-20 weeks of their recovery from Covid-19 infection. This included 17 people that were infected with B.1 and three people infected with B.1.617.1 lineage virus. The researchers also collected sera of 17 people who were vaccinated with Covaxin after 28 days of their getting both the jabs. The study looked at the neutralisation potential of the vaccine against Beta and Delta variants as compared to the prototype B.1 (D614G). With the increasing threat of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is imperative to assess the efficacy of the currently available vaccines against these variants, the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-protects-against-beta-delta-virus-variants/articleshow/83352432.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Officials said there is a need for more buses on the road to reduce the wait time of passengers. The reopening of private offices and other workplaces from Monday had resulted in an increase of 2 lakh commuters in a day and many were frustrated waiting for buses in long queues in Sion and other areas. Officials said that the new buses include 400 AC mini buses, which are being procured in two lots of 200 each on wet lease from a private operator. An additional 100 electric AC buses are being procured, sources said. BEST committee member Babban Kanavje from NCP said that the first lot of 200 AC Mini buses should have arrived in April. “This could have reduced the queues at bus stops on Monday. I am glad that files are expedited and 400 AC Mini buses will hit the roads soon,” he stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/500-new-buses-on-city-roads-soon-waiting-time-to-reduce-in-mumbai/articleshow/83352481.cms||Somit Sen

The fort has several encroachments on it and the department has issued notices to them to clear out immediately. The fort has its historical significance. It was witness to Shivaji Maharaj's great escape from Panhala fort via battleground of Pawankhind. Vilas Vahane, assistant director of the department, “The fort is a protected monument. Our no objection certificate is a must while carrying out any activities on the fort. Fifty dwellers have their own 7/12 on the fort. But due to commercialization, these villagers have expanded their constructions illegally.” Vahane said that they had found “15 dwellers violating the archaeological norms and have been issued notices to remove the permanent structures within fifteen days. If not, we will meet the district collector and insist in joint action of the forest, revenue and archaeological departments. If this doesn’t work, we will go to court to bring down the illegal constructions.” He added that the fort had undergone conservation and repair works two years back and many structures were beautified to bring back the fort’s glory. The committee formed for Vishalgad conservation and anti-encroachment claims that there are more than 100 illegal encroachments. Sunil Ghanvat, head of the committee, said, “Under the Right to Information, we have found out that there are more than hundred illegal establishments on the fort since 1998. There are around 30 historical structures over the fort. Several encroachments have been done on the road leading to Ranmandal hill, Kuwarbaon, Dargah, and Bajiprabhu Samadhi.” The fort is etched in history for the brave battle between Maratha sardar Baji Prabhu Deshpande and Siddi Masud of Bijapur Sultanate, while Shivaji Maharaj was escaping from Panhala fort to safely reach Vishalgad fort. Shivaji Maharaj gave the fort its name ‘Vishalgad’ after conquering it in 1659. The fort covers an area of 1,130mtrs and is located at a height of 3,500 feet above sea level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vishalgad-to-breathe-easy-encroachers-to-be-removed/articleshow/83345361.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Unlock 2.0: People that keep Delhi running trickle in, for work and to meet loved ones||NEW DELHI: With the Covid-19 lockdown being gradually relaxed, migrant workers are beginning to return to the city. At the three inter-state bus terminals at Anand Vihar, Kashmere Gate and Sarai Kale Khan, TOI found migrants arriving again, some for work, some to be reunited with their families. Most of them were handicapped by the unavailability of DTC buses to reach their destinations. At Anand Vihar, bag in hand, Aman, 19, freshly back from Aligarh, was bargaining with autorickshaw drivers for a ride to Karol Bagh. “I had gone home for a wedding but did not come back because of the lockdown. I am a laser mechanic,” said Aman. “Recently, I spoke to my employer, who said things were opening up and that he was more than willing to take me back. So I took the first bus and came here.” Kishan Kanhaiya of Gonda was similarly looking for transport to outer Delhi. Kanhaiya works as a craftsman at furniture shops. “My friends informed me they were returning to Delhi since the lockdown was over and factories had opened. Apart from my work at the furniture factories, I also work with tent houses, so I am hoping to find work quickly,” said a cheerful Kanhaiya. A disappointed Sonu, however, was searching for a ride back home. “I live in Bulandshahr and do jobs like painting, stitching and cooking too. I came to Delhi from Punjab with friends to see if I could find a job to be able to stay close to my family,” said Sonu. “But there's nothing available at the moment. I am returning home and will perhaps try again later.” At Sarai Kale Khan, auto and cab drivers told TOI that in the past three days, many workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had been coming back to Delhi. Saroj had arrived from Mathura to go to her daughter’s home. “She lost her husband and has three children,” said Saroj, who had had to put off this trip till the lockdown was relaxed. “She can now resume work while I will take care of the children.” Brothers Sameer and Armaan had gone back to their sister’s house in Haryana. Sameer said, “Our parents live in Delhi, but we went to Haryana to assist our sister’s family and also because there was no work in Delhi. I help my brother, Sameer, who is a motorcycle mechanic in Seemapuri.” Some workers at Kashmere Gate were looking for buses to other destinations in north India. Shambhu, resident of Begusarai in Bihar, was happy at the lockdown being relaxed. “I pick up jobs in paper mills in Uttar Pradesh cities as and when they come,” smiled Shambhu. “I am glad to be back because it’s difficult to find jobs when you’re sitting at home.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/people-that-keep-city-running-trickle-in-for-work-and-to-meet-loved-ones/articleshow/83350302.cms||---
---||Patna||Patna: Seven escape from Danapur court on denial of bail||PATNA: Seven persons escaped from Danapur sub-divisional court premises in Patna on Tuesday after their bail applications were rejected. They had surrendered before the ACJM-III court in a case registered after scuffle over the electrocution of three buffaloes at Sigori village near Paliganj in western Patna. Those escaped were Sonu Yadav, his brothers Lallu Yadav, Siddhnath Yadav and Upendra Yadav and Siddhnath’s three sons Chandan Kumar, Mukul Kumar and Rajkumar Yadav. The court, through virtual hearing, had rejected their bail petitions and remanded them in judicial custody. An FIR was lodged by court clerk Arvind Kumar with the Danapur police station against the seven persons. Danapur police station SHO Ajeet Kumar Saha said he had never heard of anyone escaping from the court after surrendering and inviting another case. “Police have come to know that all the seven were overconfident about getting bail in the case. When they were denied bail, someone told them to escape instead of going to jail. Then they sneaked out and escaped from the court,” he said, adding an FIR has been registered and raids were on to nab them. Altogether nine persons, including the seven who escaped, were named accused in two FIRs lodged with Sigori police station on May 29. Sigori police station SHO (in-charge) Subodh Thakur said one Shyamdev Singh of Narauli Mathia village had lodged an FIR against them for scuffle and thrashing. “Before him, Kapildev Yadav had lodged an FIR against four persons from Singh’s side with similar allegations,” he said. The SHO said trouble had started after two buffaloes of Sacchu Yadav and one of Vikash Yadav died due to electrocution after a high-voltage wire broke down on them on May 28 night. “Both sides picked up a fight. None were arrested yet in connection with the two FIRs,” he said. Thakur said he received a call from a Danapur court staff that the seven accused in the case had escaped after surrendering and raids should be conducted at their residences to arrest them. “However, none were found when police reached their houses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/7-escape-from-danapur-court-on-denial-of-bail/articleshow/83350368.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Delhi||Delhi: For the poor, it’s long queues and no grain at the end of them||NEW DELHI: This pandemic has wreaked havoc in the lives of the poor in the city. Food has been their biggest struggle.  The lockdown has only worsened the situation by affecting their earnings. On Monday, TOI saw serpentine queues of those who did not have ration cards at Delhi government’s free grain distribution centres. Not everyone returned happy from there because arranging wheat and rice for such big crowds is not easy and the day’s provisions ran out before their turn came. Rajwati, 61, is diabetic, but hunger drove her to the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Nand Nagri in northeast Delhi. She joined the queue at 3am on Monday, but she sadly failed to get a token for the rations being distributed there. “I have come here for three days now,” she said disconsolately. When TOI went inside the school to check why, the distributors said there weren’t enough provisions for everyone and had to deny them tokens. “We have informed a few people that we have very little to give out, but the queue has only been increasing. What can we do?” said a teacher deployed there for distribution duties. “We had received 2,800 kg of wheat and 700 kg of rice, but those are finished. The people outside are threatening to vandalise the premises if we don’t give them rations. At the end of the day, we are just teachers and fear for our safety.” Sheela Devi, 52, too was in the queue at the municipal corporation primary school in Dilshad Garden for three days. The domestic worker has a family of eight to support, her husband being bed-ridden and unable to work. “I have been waiting patiently, but they always ask me to come again the following day,” she grumbled. “Last year, we exhausted our savings during the lockdown and had to beg the local ration shop owners to give us some food, promising them we would pay later. They have been after our lives, but we haven’t been able to clear the dues.” Seeing Devi’s disappointment at being turned away, a teacher explained, “The people don’t realise that we only have so much of provisions per day. They come and yell at us, but we can only give rations to those holding tokens.” Depending on the amount of wheat and rice, the distributors give tokens to those in the queues, the lucky ones being those at the top of the line. Equally disappointed was Munni Devi, 35, at south Delhi’s Nehru Nagar. Munni and her 10-year-old son first reached the distribution centre on Saturday but returned empty handed after waiting from 11am to 4pm. Munni, a domestic worker, said, "The lockdown has severely affected my family of seven. It is frustrating to wait so long in the hot sun and not take home some foodstuff. I will try my luck on Tuesday.” A mother of five children, Munni did household work for five families, but was asked by three not to come when the lockdown started. Her husband, Chavi Ram, a rickshaw puller, has hardly earned anything in the last month. “He goes out daily, but there are no passengers,” she said. “We were earning around Rs 10,000 a month before the lockdown, but are down to Rs 2,000 now. If we can’t make ends meet, we will have to return to our village in Etah in Uttar Pradesh.” Amid similar discontent at Government Co-ed Senior Secondary School in Nehru Nagar, a teacher claimed, “When we opened a sack of rice, we found it unfit for distribution. We cannot give just wheat, so we asked the people to come on Tuesday when we will have more stocks.” Among those who were deprived of foodgrains because of this was Sonu Rawat, 30, a driving school instructor. Almost embarrassed to be seen in the queue, Rawat hesitantly revealed that his monthly income had reduced from Rs 14,000 to nil due to the lockdown, and he was at his wit’s end on how to feed his wife and two children. One could feel sorry for Kamalnath, 80, a migrant from Bihar. He said he was too old to leave the city. As for those who could look after him, he had two granddaughters, but they were reluctant to find jobs. “I asked them to at least line up for the free rations, but they refused. They have lost their parents and I am responsible for their upbringing. I must find some way to give them meals,” the old man sighed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/if-tomorrow-comes-for-the-poor-its-long-queues-and-no-grain-at-the-end-of-them/articleshow/83350338.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Goa||Stimac not worried about giving chances to new players: Chhetri||Panaji: Sunil Chhetri believes it’s not always easy to secure results while playing an attractive brand of football and that too against higher-ranked opponents. Since taking over from Stephen Constantine in the summer of 2019, Igor Stimac has had just two wins in 12 matches, including the clash against Bangladesh in the Fifa World Cup qualifier early this week. “It’s very difficult to maintain balance,” Chhetri told reporters during an online interaction on Wednesday. “I have spoken to our head coach. It’s difficult when you make sure you want to play in a certain way and also want to play against higher-ranked teams. Results are important, but it’s difficult.” Chhetri scored late against a stubborn Bangladesh and then ran into the arms of Stimac, asking him to “delete” from his mind the previous miss from a Brandon Fernandes free-kick. Unmarked, the India captain headed wide from close range but more than made up with two late goals at a time when it seemed like India’s winless run would continue. “I know the results have not been ideal but look at the silver lining. Here is a coach who is not worried about giving chances to anyone. For some years with the national team, there was small criticism that players are not given chances. “Now, if you do well in the I-League, ISL, he will give you a chance. Sometimes I feel he doesn’t care (about fielding youngsters). If you see someone who is good, he will always give the boy a chance,” said Chhetri. A total of 20 footballers have made their international debuts since Stimac took charge of the Indian team as the head coach in the summer of 2019. Popular names like Brandon Fernandes, Rahul Bheke and Sahal Abdul Samad made their debut during the Croatian coach’s first assignment, King’s Cup in Thailand. Since then many others have followed with Glan Martins being the last to debut when he started against Asian champions Qatar in the World Cup qualifier. Chhetri said the team will continue to move ahead in their progression and mentioned that the whole team -- players, coaches and technical staff -- are in sync with one another. “Inside the national camp, we only think of being in sync with the coach. You cannot guarantee results, can’t say what will happen in six months. We are in sync with what the coach wants and what we can deliver. “You need a little bit of training, matches (to get results). I have been told that there is a backlash and sadness that we are not passing enough. I am one of the fans who want to see the team passing more. “I like the passing and moving then any other system. It means you run less and you get more one versus one. A lot of players are capable of doing that. The base part of everyone being fit, we are covering that. The tactical part will come. I am quite hopeful,” said Chhetri. India are third in group E with six points from seven matches, one above Afghanistan who have a match in hand against Oman on June 11. Should Afghanistan fail to register a win, India will need only a draw in their concluding clash against their South Asian rivals on June 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/stimac-not-worried-about-giving-chances-to-new-players-chhetri/articleshow/83381581.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Delhi||Police hunt for four men in back-to-back robberies, murder||New Delhi: A silver-colour Santro bearing number 7702 kept Delhi Police on its toes as the car’s occupants, at least four, committed two robberies and attempted two more in four districts in the capital within an hour on early Tuesday. Nobody has been arrested.The accused men first shot a truck driver and then robbed him in west Delhi, following which they tried to steal the battery of an e-rickshaw in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh. The gang then targeted a rider on an auto near IP Estate in central Delhi and finally a man near BRT in south Delhi. The gang was unsuccessful in Shalimar Bagh and south Delhi.The accused were desperate for money and attacked whoever came their way, said sources. Near ESI Hospital in west Delhi’s Basai Darapur, the 50-year-old truck driver was shot and the men fled with his phone and Rs 5,000 cash around 3am. A police team rushed Lakhmi Chand, a resident of Palwal, to Guru Gobind Singh Hospital where he was declared dead. “A case of murder was registered and medical examinations revealed he had been shot in the waist,” said Urvija Goel, DCP (west). The police team questioned the truck’s helper, who said three-four men approached Chand in a Santro. Two of them came out of the car and shot Chand dead before robbing him. The accused soon entered interior lanes of Shalimar Bagh and tried to steal the battery of an e-rickshaw, but the owner woke up due to the commotion. The accused fired and fled. Luckily the bullet did not hit anybody. The police control room then received a call from a man who was going home in an auto after returning from Himachal Pradesh. The men waylaid the auto and, as two men threatened the victim, he gave them his wallet, mobile phone and laptop. The gang’s next target was a vehicle on BRT near Defence Colony, but the beacon light of a patrolling vehicle scared them and they fled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-hunt-for-four-men-in-back-to-back-robberies-murder/articleshow/83350350.cms||---
---||Mumbai||MahaRera tells builders to give flat buyers permission details||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) has directed builders to henceforth inform flat purchasers to what extent they have received construction permissions. Currently, builders only declare that they have received the “commencement certificate” or the CC for the building without specifying anything further. For example, the civic authority issues only stage-by-stage permission to the developer. The CC can only be restricted for plinth level or for only the first five floors of a skyscraper. “The flat buyer is under the impression that the CC is for the entire building. This may not be so in most projects,” said a RERA source. On Monday, RERA chief Ajoy Mehta’s office issued a circular, stating builders must now specify the details of the CC they have received. “It is observed that layout approvals although obtained for the entire project, many a times other approvals are obtained in stages, including the commencement certificate up to a plinth/zero FSI/or commencement certificate up to a particular floor level. Flat buyers are unaware of the stage wise approvals. Therefore, it has been decided to prescribe a declaration by the promoter (builder) to certify the exact stage of the commencement certificate, so that flat buyers will be aware of the same,’’ said the circular. Builders will now have to file a declaration form and upload it along with the CC while registering the project. In another recent order, RERA asked builders to give more clarity to buyers about flat transactions. “To avoid multiple transactions of flats/pIots, it is necessary to provide the information as soon as sale is concluded or booking is made,” it said. Mehta had earlier also ordered builders to meticulously submit the list of all their flat buyers along with their signatures in a proper format when seeking various permissions. Earlier, they would get away with sketchy details or shoddy paperwork when they registered their projects. The builder will require the consent of at least 51% of the allottees if he wants extension of the completion date of the project. The consent will now be required with their names, flat numbers and signatures. The circular has also specified that in case developers want to change the floor plan, design or make any major alterations in the sanctioned plans, they will require the consent of two-third of the people who have booked flats in the project. Each of them will have to sign with their names and flat numbers on the promoter’s letterhead. The consent application will clearly mention the earlier building plans and the new alterations sought by the developer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-maharera-tells-builders-to-give-flat-buyers-permission-details/articleshow/83347765.cms||Nauzer Bharucha

While most family members above 45 years have got the jab, those belonging to the 18-44 age group are not on the priority list of the government and need to pay to get vaccinated. “When a HCW goes back home from the hospital there is a chance of them carrying the virus, putting the family members at risk. Hence all eligible dependents of HCWs should be vaccinated on priority basis,” said surgery professor Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors (AHSD), West Bengal. Organisations like AHSD and West Bengal Doctors’ Forum (WBDF) have already approached the health officials for including family members and dependents of HCWs in the priority list. Even as doctor organisations like Protect the Warrior have arranged few camps to vaccinate such family members, these are paid inoculation after tying up with private hospitals. “I see a number of patients with symptoms of the infection. I would have felt much at ease back home if my family members too were vaccinated,” said Purulia Medical College ENT head Atish Haldar. “It is high time the government should include eligible family members of healthcare workers in the 18-44 bracket,” said Punyabrata Gun, convenor WBDF..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-want-family-members-on-vaccine-priority-list/articleshow/83350328.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Delhi||Corpn to rope in school principals to check crowding at foodgrain centres||New Delhi: To ensure there is no crowding at its free foodgrain distribution centres, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to rope in nodal officers, in addition to the school principals who are supposed to look after the management of these 28 centres.EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain asked for assigning nodal officers to help and supervise the centres at a high-level meeting with other representatives and officials. “From our side, we want to give a trouble-free experience to needy people visiting the centres for ration distribution. At the same time, however, implementing Covid protocol is important to minimise the chances of infection, which is why I also gave instructions to allow people in queues at centres, avoid chaos and give entry in rooms to only those whose coupons are generated for delivery of grains. For visitors, we are arranging for a facility of drinking water, etc,” the mayor explained.Jain added that over 200 staff members, including four-five teachers are engaged at each centre for online data entry, recording Aadhaar details, checking duplication and generating coupons after incorporating the mobile number of the beneficiary.“Workforce at each school includes two or three Grade D staff at each centre for loading and unloading of ration, which is distributed under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana from June 5 on the direction of Delhi government’s department of food and supplies. The district administration has also provided sufficient civil defence guards for crowd management,” the mayor added.As per the government’s scheme, schools are distributing 4 kg wheat and one kg rice to each person every month after updating his/her Aadhaar details and verifying that the person is a non-ration card holder.In north Delhi, ration is being distributed at 40 primary schools in addition to Delhi government schools.North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said they have received some complaints regarding crowding, lack of management and people unable to get ration. “I will visit some of these centres soon, speak to visitors and try to resolve their issues even if that would require additional placement of staff,” said Jai Prakash.South Delhi Municipal Corporation, meanwhile, is distributing ration at its 31 primary schools in its jurisdiction. “The entire scheme is being looked after by the district administration, including management of crowd. Our teachers are communicating the status to the authorities for necessary action,” leader of the House, Narendra Chawla, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpn-to-rope-in-school-principals-to-check-crowding-at-foodgrain-centres/articleshow/83350389.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Delhi||Delhi govt says more orders placed, cites heavy demand||New Delhi: Delhi government has placed orders with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for more foodgrains amid shortage due to the high demand from people without ration cards for free essential items. The government last week started distributing free ration at 280 government schools to help people who need free ration due to the livelihood crisis brought about by the Covid lockdown.On complaints regarding people without ration cards facing difficulties in availing ration items, food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said on Tuesday, “A large number of people turned up at several centres in excess of what was expected. But people should not be concerned. We have placed orders with FCI for more foodgrains, which will arrive soon.”Apart from the shortage, many distribution centres are also facing server issues. “We have taken note of all types of grievances. We assure that things will be further streamlined in the coming days to make the entire process smooth and hassle-free. The AAP government believes that ration is the right of people,” Hussain said.Due to the lockdown, thousands of people without a steady source of income are battling hunger because of the loss of livelihood at a massive scale and many of them do not even have ration cards. The majority of them are hawkers, street vendors, those engaged in weekly markets, and daily wage labourers in various markets. From Saturday, Delhi government started distributing free ration kits for such people between 10am and 4pm on all days except Sundays. The recipients need to submit an identity card and those without identity cards only need to submit an undertaking for maintenance of records. Each individual without a ration card under the public distribution system is entitled to 4kg wheat and 1kg rice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-says-more-orders-placed-cites-heavy-demand/articleshow/83350372.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Currently, out of total 25,000 Covid-19 beds in government hospitals. The future plan is to provide single oxygen supply to another 10,000 beds,” said a top health department official. Another 5,000 beds will be given three-line oxygen supply including ventilator facility. “There is a need to set up local oxygen plant in every major government hospital, and providing oxygen supply to 3/4 beds from the plant” said a source. Plans are also afoot on setting up 200 tonnes capacity liquid oxygen supply plant which will serve the needs of state always. The state has availability of 23 tankers to bring oxygen from other states. “We need to increase the number of tankers too but manufacturing of tankers does not happen domestically. If needed, we will import tankers also from countries,” the source privy to the plans said. There are proposals to increase ICU beds in all government teaching hospitals. The government also proposed to set up seven medical colleges, each with 150 medical seats and 12 nursing colleges. “If all these are set up, we will improve our medical facilities not just for third wave but also for regular needs...,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-plans-to-shore-up-o2-supply-to-hosps/articleshow/83352485.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The health officials stated that the fatalities would come down in the next few weeks. Central TN recorded 3,073 fresh cases on Monday. The number of active cases also dropped to 34,600.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cases-drop-in-south-tn-death-toll-remain-high-in-central-dists/articleshow/83334493.cms||---
---||Noida||PHC officials in Aligarh may have shared Co-WIN password||Noida: A day after five organisers of a vaccine camp at a Greater Noida housing society were booked for allegedly sourcing Covaxin doses meant for a health centre in Aligarh, a second FIR has been registered against unknown persons for pilfering the vials out of the health facility. Police said officials of the primary health centre in Aligarh’s Naurangabad, including its in-charge, were being questioned about how the Covaxin vials made their way to the vaccine camps in Jaypee Greens, around 100km away. The second FIR was lodged in Aligarh on Tuesday under sections 381 (theft by a clerk or servant of property in possession of master) and 414 (assisting in concealment of stolen property) of the IPC following a complaint by the district’s deputy immunisation officer, Sharad Gupta. Two vaccine camps had been organised without permission at Jaypee Greens on May 21 and 27, when a total of 187 residents had taken shots from the vials meant for the Aligarh facility. The vaccine certificates of all these recipients mention the Naurangabad health centre as their session site. Investigators have also learnt that a third camp had been organised with due permission from the authorities at the housing society on May 26, when Covishield doses were being given. However, several residents had demanded that they be administered Covaxin only. The police are now probing if the demand for Covaxin led to the vials being stolen from the health centre. Officers pointed out that since all the 187 recipients had Naurangabad mentioned in their certificates, it meant that those who made the data entries had access to the ID and password of the Co-WIN account of the health centre. It could also mean that officials of the health centre who allegedly pilfered the vials might have shared the ID and password with the organisers. In Aligarh, a two-member committee formed by the chief medical officer, BPS Kalyani, questioned the health centre in-charge, Dr Ramya Pillai, and a few other officials. Dr Pillai, however, claimed she was unaware how the vials made their way to the Greater Noida highrise. “We have recipients from different areas. They come here, register themselves and get documented automatically. We work all across the state. We don’t keep personal details of the recipients,” she said. On Monday, a contractual staff nurse at the centre was relieved of all duties by the CMO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/phc-officials-in-aligarh-may-have-shared-co-win-password/articleshow/83352482.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Two-lane tunnel project announced for Mussoorie||DEHRADUN/MUSSOORIE: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday announced a two-lane tunnel project worth Rs 700 crore which has a stated objective of reducing the traffic congestion in the hill town. The announcement comes soon after CM Tirath Singh Rawat had recently met the Union minister in New Delhi. The contract for building the two-lane tunnel has been awarded to Project Management Consultancy (PMC), Union minister Gadkari announced in a tweet on Tuesday. The tunnel, he announced, would be “2.74-km long and would provide easier and congestion-free connectivity to Mussoorie town, Mall Road and LBSNAA (IAS Academy).” Chairman of Mussoorie Municipal Council (MMC)Anuj Gupta termed it ‘a positive step.’ “The tunnel would be a long-term solution to traffic bottlenecks in the town. We thank the Union minister for taking this decision .” In a similar vein, Sandeep Sahni, president ofUttarakhand Hotel Association, said,“This is a welcome step. We witness terrible traffic jams at Gandhi Chowk during summers. Once constructed, this tunnel should help ease traffic congestion as the vehicles passing through the tunnel and going towards Gangotri-Yamunotri, Uttarkashi and Kempty falls can be diverted.”  Meanwhile,veteran Mussoorie resident and noted travel writer Hugh Gantzer expressed concern at the move. “This is a dangerous step taken in haste, considering the fact that we are in a seismically-active zone and the tunnel could pose grave risks to our hills. Also, what was the pressing need to announce such a project in the midst of a pandemic without due consultations? I urge the government to conduct proper geological survey before proceeding further with the project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/two-lane-tunnel-project-announced-for-mussoorie/articleshow/83347766.cms||Kautilya Singh

My father has taken the jab and that is why I am confident. Only if elders like you take the vaccine, we (children) can be safe,” says 11-year-old Punitha from Tuticorin as she wears a mask to conclude the awareness video that lasts just 22 seconds.This is one of the 25 short yet high-impact Covid-19 awareness videos that the Tuticorin district administration has planned to release this week. The administration has teamed up with local social media influencers and volunteers for the cost-free project.A team comprising a handful of officials headed by district collector Dr K Senthil Raj and assistant collector Srutanjay Narayanan discussed the themes for the videos spanning about 20 to 30 seconds each and finalised the script along with the influencers and volunteers who shoot the videos. “Covid-19 cases are coming down. But only vaccination and caution can prevent further spread. The video of Punitha is aimed at helping the rural populace overcome inhibitions in taking the vaccine. Since vaccines are not administered for children, the only way to protect them is by ensuring that elders take the jab,” Senthil Raj told TOI.Focus is on local influencers and they convey the message in the local dialect better than celebrities, officials said. Around 10 videos are ready and the rest will be formally launched next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tuticorin-district-officials-rope-in-influencers-for-videos-on-vax-drive/articleshow/83334488.cms||M K Ananth
---||India||If we get shots, will target 10-12L doses/day: Yogi Adityanath||UP CM Yogi Adityanath talks about his experiences in dealing with the ‘deadliest virus of the century’, the state’s vaccination strategy, and a range of other issues, including allegations of attempts to muzzle people who sought help through social media during an interaction with Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui, Neha Lalchandani, Pankaj Shah, Shailvee Sharda. Excerpts: The UP government has announced ‘Operation 10 crore’ — a mission to inoculate 10 crore people in three months. How do you plan to go about this mammoth task? People may feel we have not vaccinated sufficient people in relation to our population. We have administered 2.3 crore doses so far but our target is based on availability of vaccines. We are looking at a target of vaccinating one crore in June. But there will be a lot of vaccines available in July and August. The Centre is targetting one crore people a day and if there are 30 crore doses available in a month, UP will be able to get a significant number of doses. We have been saying that UP should be allocated doses as per its population, not as per infection rate. Till now the vaccine distribution was as per level of infection. In Maharashtra, the positivity rate was high and hence they were allocated more doses. In April, when the Centre wanted to assess the capacity of states in administering vaccines, UP gave 6 lakh shots on a single day. If we get sufficient vaccines, we will target 10-12 lakh doses a day. This way, we will be able to vaccinate 10 crore people in three months. Vaccines are distributed among states according to positivity rate and number of active cases. The Centre has now agreed to our demand that population should be kept in mind while distributing vaccines. We have begun training, arranging for syringes. We will be training second and third-year nursing and pharmacy students to administer vaccines as well. When I travelled to villages last month, I found people harbouring strange fears. We will soon roll out a campaign to fight vaccine hesitancy across 97,000 villages of the state. Your govt has claimed that when Covid cases were rising in the state, there was fake news and misinformation doing the rounds.Spreading of fake news and misinformation was an attempt to weaken and derail the efforts being made by state and Centre to contain the pandemic. I strongly feel opposition parties in the country have a hand in this and their role in the country’s crisis must be reviewed. Certain organisations also played a questionable role in these tough times and they need to introspect. Irresponsible statements and misleading information on various platforms added to the anxiety in people and triggered panic-buying. There were allegations of the government muzzling voices of people seeking help on social media … This is not true. We have a CM helpline number which is operated by 500 trained youth which extends all possible help to people facing any problem. Besides, there are integrated Covid control command centres in every district. All these centres have large manpower for management of Covid cases. But there have been attempts to spread rumours and misguide people. It is a crime. These people need to be identified and taken to task. There has been a lot of discussion about Covid testing in UP? Since the pandemic hit us, I have reviewed the Covid-19 situation in the state every single day — in person if I have been in Lucknow and virtually when travelling. I have the data of cases, recoveries, deaths, testing with break-up like RTPCR and private etc on my fingertips. I also undertake death audits for districts. The testing data of every person is available with the integrated Covid-19 command and control centre. Not only this, a team of 1,500 qualified persons working under UP CM helpline took random feedbacks from the districts on various parameters like testing, home isolation etc. When cases declined, many states reduced the testing too, but not UP. We continued to undertake more than three lakh tests per day. It is on account of our strategy that the second wave has been tamed. I remember predictions by many organisations, including Niti Aayog, that UP would be worst hit by the pandemic and would surpass Maharashtra by mid-May. The Aayog had also said that UP would be home to 30 lakh active cases in May. But such predictions have been proved wrong. There was a hue and cry over bodies floating in the river and buried on the banks. There were allegations that people dumped bodies instead of cremating them despite your government providing assistance of Rs 5,000 for last rites of Covid victims. Was there a lapse at the ground level to address these issues? The financial assistance had been announced last year. There were instances of people not coming to collect bodies of those who succumbed. The government has been urging people to cremate bodies and not throw them in rivers. The incident of a person throwing a body in a river in Balrampur district is an example. Many of these cases are a result of rumours and misconceptions. Also, many faced financial problems in cremating dead bodies. We therefore allocated funds from the state finance commission. People had raised a question over the number of people being cremated and the number of deaths because of Covid. That’s strange, because the government was issuing data only of Covid related deaths. Death due to natural and other reasons had not stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/if-we-get-shots-will-target-10-12l-doses/day-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/83355807.cms||Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui
---||Kolkata||Sputnik V debuts in Kolkata, 150 get jabs||KOLKATA: The much awaited made-in-Russia shots arrived in Kolkata on Tuesday afternoon. Vials of Sputnik V vaccines landed in the city all the way from Hyderabad. Russia’s vaccine made its debut in Kolkata in the form of a soft launch under a pilot project at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences where 150 recipients got the shot. “The vials have come for a pilot soft launch for a few registered healthcare volunteers and not for commercial launch. We have got very limited doses for this special purpose. We expect to get our consignment for commercial launch by the end of third week in June,” said Narayana Health zonal director (East) R Venkatesh.The vials arrived in Kolkata airport around 1 pm on Tuesday. The consignment was rushed to the hospital in Mukundapur where the storage space with freezers below minus 20 degree Celsius was kept ready. The pilot inoculation drive began around 3pm. “Since this vaccine is very much temperature sensitive we ensured the required temperature at our cold chain points and other storage criteria,” added Venkatesh. The pilot project will go on for two more days. Sputnik V got the emergency use authorisation in India in April. The first consignment of the Russian jab arrived in India in May first week. Yet to be commercially launched, the doses currently are being administered on pilot projects. After debuting in Hyderabad in mid-May in the form of a special pilot project the city got its brush with the Russia-made vaccine. In Hyderabad the doses were administered on employees of Dr Reddy’s Laboratory. The Hyderabad-based organisation that had partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund for the vaccines for its clinical trial in India. Developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Russia, Dr. Reddy’s so far has the sole distribution rights in India. The imported doses of the vaccine are currently priced as Rs 948 without GST. “It is great that the city has got its share of the vials even if in limited doses for a pilot project. With an efficacy of 91.6% the second dose has to be taken 21 days apart. But the only issue is the vaccine is temperature sensitive and has to be stored below minus 20 degree Celsius. We hope a stability study is conducted for storing the vaccine in between 2 to eight 8 degrees so that the people in districts can have access to the vaccine,” said Peerless Hospitals director (clinical research & academics) Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, who was the principal investigator during Sputnik V’s phase 3 clinical trial at the hospital. Some hospitals in the city including RTIICS, Woodlands and AMRI have already initiated the procedure of procuring Sputnik V vials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sputnik-v-debuts-in-kol-150-get-jabs/articleshow/83350426.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Members of the CPM made a representation to the Madurai South MLA M Bhoominathan in this regard. Even though the department claimed that the centre medians are being constructed as per the road rules, in many areas, the rules have been ignored. In Kamarajar Salai, at the Sivaganga road stretch from the Melamadai signal to inner ring road junction, it has been constructed without considering that it would narrow the road. Kamarajar Street stretch is used for parking, as it has many shops, marriage halls, schools, small scale industries, and houses. The removal of the entire median would help in easy movement of traffic after the lockdown is relaxed. However, for now, the members of the CPM, including the Madurai urban district secretary R Vijayarajan, J Lenin, DMK 52nd block secretary Ramesh, and MDMK’s Pandi demanded that the median be removed at least near the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Indian Overseas Bank building on this road. Not less than 1,000 vehicles of educational institutes use this stretch in the morning and evening. Due to this median, traffic movement would be affected when schools and colleges start functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cpm-remove-centre-median-choking-traffic-movement/articleshow/83334500.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: CCF seeks report on illegal mining||JAIPUR: The chief conservator of forests (CCF), Kota, has sought a factual report on illegal mining inside Dabi range of newly proposed tiger reserve Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary. The report will be submitted to the Head Of Forest Forces (HoFF). After TOI highlighted the issue that mining mafias were brazenly excavating sandstones for export from mines situated on forest land, the forest department has swung into action. CCF Manoj Parashar said, “The factual report has been sought from the officials on illegal mining. The issue will be examined and action will be taken on the mafais.” Sources said a team of forest officials also reached Dabi and seized vehicles and machines invloved in illegal mining on forest land. At the sanctuary, there are illegal sandstone mines operational on forest land in Dhorela Gararda, Dasalia, Lambha Koh, Palanka and Dhaneshwar forest blocks of Dabi range. Official sources at forest said the mining was prevalent in the region in absence of support from higher authorities. “The post of the ranger, where illegal mining is rampantly occurring, was vacant for the six months after he was put on awaited posted order (APO) for alleged involvement in mining. The same ranger was posted in the region,” said an official source. Green activists demanded the state government to intervene before its too late. It is alleged that between 2019 and 2020, more than 95,000sqm of forest area has been ravaged. The mining mafia is not just carrying illegal excavation, they are also dumping the waste on forest land disturbing the ecology. The natural corridor connects Ranthambore National Park with Jawahar Sagar forest via Mukundra Hill Tiger Reserve. Tapeshwar Singh Bhati, president of Kota-based Mukundra Hills Environment and Wildlife Society said, “The government had recently approached the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to develop a sanctuary in Bundi as the fourth tiger national park. Ramgarh Sanctuary is a fresh hope to accommodate the ‘extra’ Ranthambore tigers. The state government should intervene and save it from mining mafias.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ccf-seeks-report-on-illegal-mining/articleshow/83352510.cms||---

An FIR too has been registered at Mulund police station. An MSEDCL statement said: “The project, Zircon cooperative housing society, was being developed by Nirmal Lifestyle in Mulund. When our officials went for routine check recently, they found that electricity was being pilfered from a BMC outgoing switch (connection) and there was no meter.” A statement by sources close to Nirmal Lifestyle said: “Nirmal Lifestyle had handed over the premises for a parking lot in the year 2013 and the same is being managed by the parking contractor who runs the premises since more than five years. There is no question of any wrongdoing by the Zircon society or Nirmal Lifestyle and the builder/developer’s legal team is examining the issue.” Deputy police commissioner Prashant Kadam said it was a serious offence as the BMC meter was tampered with. “We have questioned a few people and are seeking help from BMC’s T Ward in the inquiry. We may make arrests in the case if there is strong evidence,” added Kadam. MSEDCL officials said they conducted a thorough probe. “The officials issued notices for recovery of Rs 63.2 lakh from the builder/developer. On failing to pay the money (which also included penalty), officials approached the police and an FIR was registered on June 4 under Section 135 of Electricity Act, 2003,” said a spokesperson from MSEDCL’s Bhandup division. TOI has a copy of the FIR. The pilferage was detected by executive engineer Dattatray Bhange under the supervision of Bhandup zone chief engineer Suresh Ganeshkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fir-lodged-in-case-of-rs-63l-power-theft-in-highrise/articleshow/83347875.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to challenge Banking Act amendment in court||MUMBAI: A day after the state government appointed a 13-member committee headed by cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil to study the impact of the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act on urban cooperative banks in the state, the panel, in its first meeting itself, decided to challenge the amendment in court. “We fear the urban cooperative banking sector will collapse following the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act,” Patil told TOI. “We have decided to challenge it in court. Whether to move the high court or Supreme Court will be decided after seeking legal opinion of the advocate general.” A fortnight ago, NCP president Sharad Pawar had asked the state government to study the adverse impact of the amendment on urban cooperative banks in the state. Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, minister of state Vishwajeet Kadam, rural development minister Hasan Mushrif, MSC Bank administrator Vidyadhar Anaskar, and banking expert Vishwas Thakur were present in the meeting. Ansakar made a comprehensive presentation on the pros and cons of the amendment. As per the presentation, the amendment gives massive powers to the RBI for regulating urban cooperative banks, which have been directly or indirectly controlled by the NCP and Congress. Now, the NDA government has decided to regulate recruitments, including the appointment of MDs, their salaries and eligibility, the RBI will decide the eligibility of 50% of the directors and the director’s tenure will not extend beyond eight years. The amendment also aprovides for removal of directors who do not confirm to RBI norms and those removed will not be eligible for appointment on any bank in any capacity. The new chairman will be appointed with RBI permission. The panel was informed that two Tamil Nadu-based urban cooperative banks have challenged the amendment before the Madras high court. The petitions were to be heard on December 3, 2020, but owing to the pandemic situation, there was no hearing. The contention of most of the members was that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the RBI to interfere in the non-banking activities of urban cooperative banks. “If we are changing the location of the bank, why should the RBI examine our decision,” a senior cabinet member said. Thorat said it appears that the RBI amended the law to end the urban cooperative network in the state. “Our cooperative banks are the backbone of the rural economy, now the RBI aims at destroying it. We will oppose the amendment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-challenge-banking-act-amendment-in-court/articleshow/83352567.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

While six suspects ran away, two jumped into a nearby nullah to avoid getting arrested. The desperate escape bid of the two suspects was recorded by some locals. The policemen were seen requesting the two men to come out of the nullah, but in vain. A team from City Chowk police station raided the city-based crematorium on Monday evening. The arrested suspects have been identified as Shaikh Irfan, Avinash Landge, Chetan Dehade and Sandip Dabhade. The policemen waited for the two suspects to come out of the nullah, but they stayed put. Eventually, the police team left the spot with only four suspects. City Chowk police station inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, “Our team arrested four people who were gambling at the crematorium.” The officer also confirmed that some suspects managed to give them a slip. “We are trying to ascertain their identity from the suspects who have been arrested. We will soon arrest them,” he added. He justified the cops’ action of stepping back from forcibly arresting the suspects who had jumped into the nullah by stating that it had started raining and had the police team stayed there, the possibility of the two men getting swept away in the water could not have been ruled out.

This will be the first time the budget carrier will be operating a flight from the island nation though other operators fly to Maldives from other airports. “Some people from the Tamil community in Maldives ran a survey on social media on those willing to fly home and found that about 200 people were ready with their passport details. Following this, they represented to the AIE which decided to operate a flight,” said Senthil Kumar who works in Maldives. According to him, schools are closed in Maldives from June 24 and if a flight is operated then, many could reach various parts of Tamil Nadu from Trichy. Though Vande Bharat Mission flights were operated last year to bring back stranded citizens, they were operated from other parts of India. A few of those who wanted to return to Tamil Nadu had to book a chartered flight. There are roughly 10,000 Tamils in Maldives, mostly teachers and those working in resorts. “With no flights to Tamil Nadu now, we need to either go to Trivandrum or Bengaluru to reach our destinations,” said Senthil Kumar. The flight to Male on June 24 will take cargo and bring back passengers as that country too has restricted arrival of Indians in the wake of the second wave of Covid. AIE sources said they have received advance cargo booking of over 16 tonnes. “It is a historic moment for AIE to operate a flight from Male to Trichy. Trichy international airport will be adding yet another destination which remained unexplored so far,” said S Dharmaraj, airport director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aie-to-operate-special-flight-from-male-to-trichy-dist/articleshow/83350451.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Patna||Edu min: NITI Aayog should take a balanced approach for SDG index||PATNA: State education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Tuesday questioned the ranking of states in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index 2021 released by NITI Aayog on June 3. Bihar has been adjudged as the ‘worst performer state’ in the ranking. Choudhary alleged that the methodology of collection of data, its assessment and presentation is ‘unbalanced for developing economies’. “The correct picture has not been represented in the report released on June 3. The condition of Bihar has improved on many parameters as compared to previous years. If we talk about composite figures, Bihar’s performance has improved every year since 2018. Even as per NITI Aayog parameters, Bihar has come out from ‘aspirational’ to ‘performer’ category,” he said. As per the SDG India Index 2021, Bihar scored 52 out of 100 marks on different parameters and came under “performer” category (with scores in the range of 50-64). “Bihar is in the ‘frontrunner’ category on five parameters. It has scored 91 points in sanitation and clean water category, which is eight points higher than the national average and two points above Kerala. As per the SDG dashboard, Bihar’s performance has improved in hunger, health and well-being, education, gender equality, water and sanitation, cities and communities and justice and institutions,” he said. “The state has made remarkable achievement in good health and well-being (SDG3). Entire country knows the works done in Bihar for gender equality (SGD5), including promotional schemes for girl students and parallel reservation for women among others. We are also very close to reaching cent percent score in quality education (SGD4),” Choudhary claimed. The categories in which state’s performance have been the lowest include poverty, hunger, gender equality, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduction of inequalities and climate action. The minister, however, claimed that the SDG Index figures should not “demoralise” states. “The state’s performance should be shown overtime. Rather than present situation, it is more than important that where we are going. The data collected by NITI Aayog should be presented in the correct perspective, so that correct picture of achievement of the states is shown to the people,” he said. Sudhanshu Kumar of Centre for Economic Policy and Public Finance, Patna, said the various statistical indicators do have their limitations and so is true with the SDG India Index. Therefore, the development narrative cannot be solely around these identified indicators. “There is always a scope for improvement as far as methodology is concerned. For example, the individual indicators reflect the policy priority of a particular state and, therefore, one of the limitations in these composite indices is the aggregation bias. At the same time, NITI Aayog needs to work further beyond releasing data and should suggest the way forward for the states based on rigorous research. We need to realise that the policy decisions that can yield better results on these identified development indicators need more fiscal space. Also, some of the initiatives taken by the governments will reflect as improvement in the indicators with a long time lag,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/edu-min-niti-aayog-should-take-a-balanced-approach-for-sdg-index/articleshow/83350472.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Some shopkeepers said that they did not expect a complete relaxation in Madurai and hence they did not have sufficient stock. “We thought they would allow us to be open for a few hours and therefore was not prepared for a whole day’s sale,” said S Pandi, a shopkeeper, who had tied a rope two feet away from the counter at his small shop in Avaniapuram. Vegetables were what he had been able to purchase on Monday morning, but there were not many takers for the same. Similarly, some residents associations sent out warning messages to its residents about the positive cases being reported in some of the streets in their region and asked them to ensure that they did not come into contact with positive persons. The Nelpettai market which would have otherwise witnessed a huge crowd remained closed and as the collector has said no to retail sale of meat and fish shops in the city. Ulavar Sandhai had traders setting shop outside the market premises, hence there were no crowds in the market. These shops too saw less crowds as the sale of vegetables through vehicles continues in the city. “People who came to the shops also wore masks, most of them double masks, and waited in line for their turn without crowding as shopkeepers advised the same. The lack of crowds in shops seems to indicate that the people of Madurai, have become cautious as the second wave was more devastating than the first wave,” said A Asokan of Makkal Sakthi Iyakkam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shops-unlock-in-dists-after-intense-lockdown/articleshow/83334519.cms||---

The panel headed by leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, also held a meeting on Tuesday to finalise its report and suggest measures to handle the situation, so the party could unite to fight the state assembly elections scheduled early next year. The panel, also comprising AICC general secretary in-charge for Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former president of Congress in Delhi JP Aggarwal, had met Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, all party MPs and MLAs of Punjab, besides some other party leaders to take their inputs for five days last week. It remains to be seen as to what the panel is going to recommend to placate cricketer-turned-politician and party MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu, who had been continuously attacking the chief minister last month on unfulfilled promises of the Congress government in the state. There is also a possibility that the panel might recommend the change of Sunil Jakhar as Punjab Congress president with a Hindu face where school education minister Vijay Inder Singla might get a chance since he enjoys the chief minister’s backing. There is also a possibility of a change in the state council of ministers, but the final decision has to be taken by the Congress high command.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kharge-panel-likely-to-submit-report-on-punjab-congress-today/articleshow/83355206.cms||---

M Chokkalingam of Anna Nagar, who has a two-wheeler workshop, said he had been receiving calls from customers throughout the last two weeks. They mostly called regarding spark plug issues, battery drain and wiring issues, as vehicles parked without use for over two weeks had been infested by mice in some cases. “Though I was ready to help, there were problems in sourcing spare parts and as soon as the government said we could operate, I received more than 25 calls in the morning,” he said. Like him, many mechanics had to tell their eager callers that it would take a couple of days, as they could service only about five vehicles per day. Meanwhile, vehicle showrooms also saw many vehicle owners who visited them for technical snags and battery drain. Petrol bunks in some places like Melamadai had displayed prominent sign boards that said vehicle batteries could be recharged. People should ensure that they start their vehicle, atleast once a day, and also clean it to avoid pests settling on the engine box and other places, said K Senthilkumaran, a mechanic in Teppakulam. During the first lockdown he had attended to two peculiar problems, a scooter in which a squirrel had nested and littered and another bullet bike which had a litter of mice in its gear box.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/high-demand-for-servicing-vehicles/articleshow/83334549.cms||---

But even if dry fish come alive, Sasikala cannot become even a basic member of the AIADMK,” Shanmugam said in Villupuram on Monday. Addressing reporters, the former law minister said that the AIADMK is a strong movement that is not dependent on anyone but for the cadres. “After MGR, many senior leaders said that they are AIADMK but have vanished into thin air. That is what AIADMK has seen. Sasikala was nowhere in the history of AIADMK. She came in as Amma’s (Jayalalithaa’s) helper,” he added. In Tuticorin, former minister and Kovilpatti MLA Kadambur C Raju told reporters on Monday that Sasikala was not in favour of the party even during the recent assembly elections, and that all the cadres of the party are aware of this. Raju said the decision taken by party coordinator OPS and joint coordinator EPS will be final in this regard and will be accepted by everyone. He also said it would be inappropriate to comment on the DMK government that is just a month old. The former minister said that the AIADMK government did a commendable job in bring Covid-19 under control. “We are ready to work along with the ruling party in a similar manner,” he said. Welcoming the government’s efforts to have inclusiveness by involving all the parties, he said that the AIADMK MLAs are participating in events chaired by DMK ministers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sasikala-cannot-make-comeback-to-party-ex-mins/articleshow/83334537.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fatal immune response seen in patients after 12-15 days in hospital||MUMBAI: A delayed cytokine storm or an immune response in which the body attacks its own cells has been responsible for some Covid deaths in the city lately, especially among patients hospitalised for 12 to 15 days.Daily Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai have significantly declined in the past three weeks. The first week of May, for instance, saw an average of 75 every day. It dropped to 64 in the second, 54 in the third and 40 in the last week of May. In the first week of June, the daily average dropped to 23. However, Dr Niteen Karnik, head of medicine at Sion Hospital and a member of the state Covid taskforce, said in quite a few cases now, delayed cytokine storms contribute to deaths. The cytokine storm is an immune response caused when the body starts to attack its own cells and tissues rather than fighting the virus. “We have had cases where a delayed cytokine storm was seen from day 12 to day 15. The progression was rapid after that. Patients who were on 2litre oxygen in the morning went on to need five times more by evening,” he said, adding it has been seen in younger patients too. Deaths now are mostly in those who have spent more than 10-14 days at the hospitals, he said. Dr Rajesh Bhadade, medical ICU in charge, BYL Nair Hospital, agreed with the assessment. “We have seen deaths in patients with a HRCT scan score of 10, while those with scores above 20 have gone home. Besides cytokine, post Covid complications are also responsible for deaths now,” he said. The hospital recently had a case where a patient recovered and was sent to a ward one notch below the ICU. However, a few days later, the patient passed away. “Without an autopsy one can’t be sure. It could be a cardiac arrest or pulmonary embolism, but we have to be mindful of these complications,” Bhadade added. In the first wave, doctors said they would typically see signs of cytokine storms in which inflammatory levels would increase, mostly by the eighth or tenth day. This had prompted experts to stress on closer monitoring in the second week of the infection. An official said severity analysis shows most have not taken treatment or undergone a Covid test till the seventh or eighth day. “Importantly, deaths in patients with comorbidities have dropped under 60% which means there is a corresponding increase in deaths among healthy individuals probably due to late hospitalisation,” he added .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fatal-immune-response-seen-in-patients-after-12-15-days-in-hospital/articleshow/83352578.cms||---

In a series of five tweets, Gehlot informed that CS Niranjan Arya on June 7 shot a letter to his counterpart in Punjab urging them not to release untreated water from its industries into IGNP, which is leading to the flow of contaminated water in Rajasthan. The move came following reports of the release of black water from the tanneries in Punjab in IGNP making it unfit for use. The problem of untreated water continues for the past several years, becoming a bone of contention between the two states. The letter reprimands the Punjab government of the National Green Tribunal order dated January 22, 2021 warning of strict action to Punjab for not taking steps to prevent the scarce water resources from being polluted. “The tribunal has directed the Punjab government to discharge its constitutional responsibility by developing a monitoring system for the water resources,” read the tweet. The letter further asks the neighbouring state to develop a sewage treatment plant and to ensure that water should be treated at the plant before it is released into the canal. Gehlot further informed that at present the executive engineer PHED Rajasthan Canal and Ferozpur has been deputed at Harrika Head to monitor the situation. “The report on water quality samples taken from Harrika Head and Gangnahar in Rajasthan on Tuesday shows improvement in the water quality. The water samples received from Punjab are being sent to Sri Ganganagar for quality checks,” read the tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cm-asks-punjab-to-stop-releasing-dirty-water-into-indira-canal/articleshow/83352560.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||DRDO-developed Covid drug 2-DG to cost Rs 990 per sachet||HYDERABAD: Contrary to promises that the indigenously developed Covid-19 drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) would be priced affordably to ensure it reaches as many patients as possible, the wonder drug has been priced at a steep Rs 990 per sachet. The drug was developed by scientists at Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a Defence Research & Defence Organisation lab, and is being commercialised by pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. What makes the pricing a surprise is that Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had, last month, issued a statement that the pricing of the drug was “being determined with a view to making it accessible and affordable to as many patients as possible”. INMAS-DRDO had also said that being a generic molecule and an analogue of (similar to) glucose, 2-DG can be easily produced and made available in plenty in the country. The pricing of 2-DG was announced by a top Dr Reddy’s Labs at an interactive session organised by Telangana’s apex trade and industry body Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) on Tuesday. While announcing the price tag, Deepak Sapra, CEO, API & Services, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, said: “The goal at Dr Reddy’s is to maximise production and make it accessible as much as possible to patients all over the country in as short a time-frame as possible.” Sapra said that the months of June and July were extremely important for ramp-up of 2-DG production and ensure it reaches the last mile and ensure that every patient that needs it has access to it. He did not mention any production quantum details. The drug comes in a powder form in a sachet and has to be taken orally by dissolving it in water. It works by accumulating in the virus infected cells and prevents growth of the virus by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. It is an inhibitor of glucose transport and glycolysis and was originally being developed for cancer as it cuts the supply of glucose molecules to cancer cells, which require higher glucose than normal cells to survive, thereby killing them. DRDO had said clinical trials conducted on Covid-19 patients had showed that 2-DG helped in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduced their dependence on supplemental oxygen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drdo-developed-covid-drug-2-dg-to-cost-rs-990-per-sachet/articleshow/83352558.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

A group of traders had met state government spokesperson and cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal asking for more shops to be allowed to open after which the decision was taken. Residents meanwhile flocked to markets, with busy areas of Doon like Paltan Bazaar returning to life.  Sudhir Kishore, a retired government servant, said “I could finally get my spectacles repaired after a long time. I hope that shops are allowed to be open in the coming days as well.” Shopkeepers and business owners have been pressing the government to allow markets to be open now that the Covid situation is coming under control. Traders had also warned of protests if no action is taken by the government. Bipin Budiyal, a business owner, said, “Markets must be allowed to open daily, even if it is for limited hours. In addition to the economy, customers also get affected if the shops are closed for too long at a stretch.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/markets-reopen-after-almost-a-month-in-ukhand/articleshow/83347909.cms||---

Sources in the civic body said discussions were underway to consider reopening the parks for three hours in the morning, possibly from 5am to 8am. The parks have been shut since early April when Covid cases began to rise. At the time, there were protests against the decision as people felt the parks were the safest place citizens, particularly the elderly, could go to. The demand had become muted when cases spiked towards April-end, prompting the state government to announce restrictions. With Covid cases now on the wane, there is a renewed demand for reopening of the parks. “We are getting frequent requests from citizens to open parks located close to their neighbourhoods as they now want to resume their morning walk. We have taken up the matter with senior officials at the headquarters seeking their advice before taking any steps in this direction,” said a KMC borough official. Samrat Chatterjee, a retired government officer and a resident of Monoharpukur, lamented that parks in the locality were out of bounds. “I have been a regular visitor to Deshapriya Park for the past two decades. I was delighted when the KMC opened the gates of the parks in November last year after keeping them shut for over seven months. Now again I am confined at home. It takes a toll on my health,” Chatterjee said. Bonani Kakkar of PUBLIC, an NGO that works for improvement in the environment, welcomed the KMC proposal. “The pandemic has affected people’s mental health. Remaining confined to home is leading to depression. If we can walk under the sky and see trees around us, it can be a great healer,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-ponders-reopening-of-parks-after-demand-from-morning-walkers/articleshow/83350527.cms||Saikat Ray

As on June 6, the district had 1,430 vaccine doses in hand, including 280 doses in the Madurai Medical College, 20 in the government hospitals, 630 doses in the primary health centres (PHCs) and another 500 doses in the regional vaccine centre. Total 3,71,679 people have received vaccines in the district. Though the statistics showed that the district had less than 1,500 vaccine doses for Monday, the Elango Corporation Higher Secondary School, where the free vaccination camp is being conducted, saw a large turnout. While some people have been showing preference for Covishield, they were told that this vaccine was not available for the first dose. More doses of Covaxin were available on Monday. Srikumar, who had come from Karupayoorani, said that he prefers Covishield but had decided to take Covaxin as only it was available. Meanwhile, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing that the Union government would procure the vaccines and offer it free of cost to the state governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vaccine-centres-with-less-doses-still-see-large-turnouts/articleshow/83334564.cms||---

These centres would offer option to people to get their first and second vaccine shots. Illuminated with blue light and set up with separate attractive cubicles, the HPA became an attraction for people passing through the road. District magistrate Dr Chandrasekhar Singh visited both the centres and interacted with the beneficiaries for getting feedback. The DM said, “Another new feature in these immunisation centres is the ‘drive-in’ facility under which people of any category would have an option to get the vaccine shots in their cars and wait for 30 minutes for observation by the medical teams deputed there.” The DM also felicitated Krishna Singh of Hanuman Nagar and Mahavir Prasad Singh of Ara with bouquets for getting their first and second shots at the Pataliputra Sports Complex vaccination centre. Chandrasekhar said people usually remain occupied with their works in today’s fast urban life and that is why these two round the clock vaccination centres were set up for their convenience. For 18-44 age group, pre-registration could be made from 9am to 5pm after which they would have to turn up as per their slots. However, on the spot registration and vaccination facility for people in 45-59 age group would be available from 5pm to 9am. “Immunisation is the only and most effective way to get protection from Covid infection. Both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines are available in sufficient numbers at the two centres,” the DM said. Three data entry operators and four medical teams were assigned duty at each immunisation centre. Separate rooms were marked for registration, vaccination and observation. There was a festive scene at both the centres at the time of launch of the 24x7 immunisation drive. Several students, working men and women, workers and even senior citizens interacted with the DM and other officials and hailed the initiative. Adequate number of policemen with magistrates was deployed at both the centres. The DM directed senior officers of the district administration to keep visiting these centres for ensuring their proper functioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-24x7-drive-in-vaccination-centres-open/articleshow/83350564.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Jaipur||Gang that duped people using fake ‘gold’ items busted||Jaisalmer: Jaisalmer police busted an inter-state gang that would dupe people by offering fake gold items during the lockdown and arrested the prime accused. The gang has cheated villagers in many parts of the state and in Gujarat. Police are collecting more information in the matter. SP Ajay Singh said that on May 17, 2021, one Murlidhar Daeeya, a resident of Dabla, filed an FIR that two persons came to him and said they were stuck during the lockdown and did not have money. They offered to sell off their mother’s ‘gold necklace’ and quoted the price as Rs 10 lakh saying it weighed 1kg. They even gave him a piece from the necklace to get it checked with a goldsmith, which on checking was found to be real gold. Thus, by trusting the persons, the complainant bought the necklace for Rs 1.20 lakh. Murlidhar later went to the goldsmith with the necklace and found that it was fake, and so he lodged an FIR and SHO Madho Singh started the investigation. He said that the gang targets innocent people by giving emotional reasons like their mother is ill or their brother needs to be treated etc. The culprits had even got a fake Aadhaar card made, given their mobile number and fake ID, due to which people would believe them. They also keep moving to avoid being nabbed. The mobile SIMs are fake and that of Gujarat. The culprits also keep some pure gold along with the fake one, so that on getting it checked, people do not suspect them. The SP said he directed Jaisalmer Sadar police SHO Premdan Ratnu to lead a special team including other personnel and solve the case. The technical team detained Vachnaram (29), a resident of Bebalsar in Jalore district and inquired him, on which he confessed to committing the crime and was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gang-that-duped-people-using-fake-gold-items-busted/articleshow/83352576.cms||---

A case has been registered against the 34-year-old constable of the Islapur police station and a manhunt has been launched. When contacted, superintendent of police (ACB) Kalpana Baraokar confirmed the development and said, “We have booked a case against constable Rameshwar Alewad, who allegedly fled with powdered currency notes that he had accepted in the form of a bribe.” ACB officials said a beer bar owner had applied for licence renewal. As part of the procedure, the file had reached the Islapur police station for a detailed police report. The constable allegedly sought Rs 12,000 to file a positive report favouring the licence holder. However, unwilling to grease the palms of a policeman, the bar owner lodged a complaint with the ACB on May 30. During the verification carried out by the ACB, in presence of government witnesses, the demand for the bribe was confirmed on June 1. Not taking any chances, the suspect kept on changing the time and date for accepting the bribe, before he finally decided to accept it on Tuesday afternoon. Soon after accepting the bribe amount, the constable spotted the ACB men who had been posing as civilians. He then fled with the bribe amount he had allegedly accepted in the presence of a government witness. ACB officials maintained that if the constable tries to get rid of the evidence an additional section of IPC 201 will be slapped on him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nanded-cop-flees-with-bribe-cash/articleshow/83345723.cms||Mohammed Akhef

In a media statement, the CID said the seized phone was submitted to the state forensic laboratory (FSL) on May 18 and they have had no access to it since then. The statement comes two days after Raju filed a complaint against CID chief PV Sunil Kumar with the Delhi police, stating that his phone was illegally seized and is being misused. Countering the claims, the CID said the phone was seized by following proper procedure and the seizure memo was prepared in the presence of witnesses on May 15. “The investigating officer made the seizure invoking 102/165 of CrPC which lays down the grounds for seizure by a police officer and the procedure to do the same. The cellphone was an important piece of evidence in the case since it could contain evidence of the preparatory events to the commission of the crime,” the CID statement said. Raju lodged the complaint after he received a tweet from former IAS officer PV Ramesh stating that he and his family members have been receiving WhatsApp messages from an unlisted number +91 90009 11111 purported to be from the MP. Responding to the tweet, he replied that his phone is in the custody of CID and said he has lodged a complaint. The CID statement further said that every development in the case was being reported to the jurisdictional court and that the FSL had already submitted a dump of the phone on May 27 and 31. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cid-denies-misusing-rajus-mobile-phone/articleshow/83318512.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Deaths fall to single digit in Mumbai, lowest in 76 days||MUMBAI: Daily Covid deaths in the city on Tuesday dropped to seven. A single-digit toll was last recorded 76 days ago on March 24 (6). Overall fatalities here crossed the 15,000-mark since the pandemic began in March 2020. But the number of deaths recorded in the state nearly doubled from Monday to 295 on Tuesday, taking the toll to 1,01,172, including 407 past fatalities that the state added on Tuesday. Fortunately, daily cases in the state stayed under 11,000 (10,891) for the second day in a row. In the city, 682 new cases were registered. Over 7 lakh of the city’s 1.3-crore population have now tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus since the pandemic began. “A drop in daily toll was not unexpected since the number of ICU admissions began to drop over 21 days ago,” said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The number of deaths was higher earlier because many patients reported late for ICU admissions. “But the situation has improved in the last month,” he added. The number of critical patients in Mumbai’s hospitals has halved in the last month; as of June 7, 1,149 patients were critical. The positivity rate for the second day in a row in Mumbai was below 3%, the recovery rate at 75%, the virus’s growth rate was 0.12% and the doubling rate was 543 days—up from 30 on some days in April. The active cases in the state dropped to 1.6 lakh, of which 17,642 were in Mumbai. In BMC-run Sion Hospital, where at the height of the second wave in April, extra oxygen-support benches were put up apart from the 365 oxygen-supported beds to accommodate the patient rush, barely three or four new admissions take place. “We have roughly 100 patients admitted right now and there are no deaths on most days,” said dean Dr Mohan Joshi. Officials said the state too should report a further decline in deaths as critical cases are reducing. “We are expecting that the fatalities in the state will drop further by next week,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deaths-fall-to-single-digit-in-city-lowest-in-76-days/articleshow/83352583.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand to open 37 ‘disaster management cells’ to tackle mishaps||DEHRADUN: The forest department has decided to develop 37 ‘model crew stations’, spacious facilities in remote, disaster-prone areas which rescue forces can access quickly to tackle forest fires, wildlife attacks or natural disasters. The model crew stations have been selected based on their accessibility, connectivity and space available for camping and storage (for convenience of rescue personnel). “These are basically modern disaster management centres of the forest department. The idea is to let all departments: police, disaster management, fire-fighting units as well as panchayati raj work under the same roof, in synergy, to save maximum lives and natural resources in case of any mishap. These centres will also be used as camping sites for the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), if they are deployed,” Bhartari said. “We have already allotted around Rs 1.19 cr for purchasing equipment. The centres will be run on standard codes and guidelines,” he added. The state disaster management department has also promised funds to the forest department for setting up these units as it aims to minimise the impact of disasters. During rescue operations, lack of space and proper equipment act as hindrances, especially in the wake of the tough hilly topography of Uttarakhand.“We often encounter the issue of space while conducting massive rescue operations when dealing with fires, human-wildlife conflict or natural disasters like floods. Our frontline staff get crippled at some places due to insufficient mobility, internet connection, camping, parking and storage facility etc.,” Bhartari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-open-37-disaster-management-cells-to-tackle-mishaps/articleshow/83347934.cms||Shivani Azad

Academicians have urged the university to increase the number of subjects in which the examination is conducted. While there are only 26 subjects covering science, commerce and humanities disciplines, it gives limited scope for students of science. An MSc graduate in analytical chemistry for instance, needs to write TN SET in chemical sciences to become eligible for teaching in colleges. However, students from 12 other disciplines will also be appearing for the common chemical science subject. “A candidate who clears TN SET in chemical sciences will be eligible to teach only the subject in which he or she has done post-graduation in. Therefore, it is illogical to make a candidate study other disciplines for the exam,” said Prof S Parthasarathy of Bharathidasan University. Speaking to TOI, TN SET coordinator from Annamalai University A Ragupathy said the same format is being used in other states and it has been followed for several years. He said there are possibilities of increasing the subjects if they receive grievances from the candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/increase-number-of-subjects-for-tn-set/articleshow/83334583.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: CBI not to seek documents till Friday||MUMBAI: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday extended till June 11 its assurance of not pursuing its requests to the state to hand over certain documents, including a phone-tap report submitted by former commissioner (SID) Rashmi Shukla, in connection with its probe into an FIR against former state home minister, Anil Deshmukh. The CBI made this statement through solicitor general Tushar Mehta before the Bombay high court bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar. The HC adjourned a petition by the state to June 11. The state has sought quashing of two paras from the CBI’s FIR against Deshmukh. The FIR was registered after its preliminary enquiry into charges against Deshmukh by former police chief Param Bir Singh. The paras it wants deleted seek probe into reinstatement of API Sachin Waze and Deshmukh’s alleged ‘exercise of undue influence’ over police transfers and postings. A lawyer whose police complaint had led to the CBI’s preliminary enquiry sought to intervene as well as have the matters filed by Deshmukh and the state tagged. Advocate Jaishri Patil, at the virtual hearing, alleged she felt “insulted” by a bench headed by Justice Shinde when it had first heard her plea for a probe into Singh’s letter. Justice Shinde said, “If you have been hurt by my statements, I express regret.” She said she was “grateful” and that she would withdraw her complaint against him. Justice Shinde said to the lawyers present, including senior counsel Rafiq Dada and Darius Khambata representing the state, “We, the judges and lawyers, are like family.

Most students are to fly out by the third week of August and be on their foreign campuses by the end of that month, fully vaccinated. Students have started to book vaccine appointments by June-end. “They will have to show proof of admission abroad and we will give them their second jabs, as per rules. We are yet to receive a formal communication,” said Kunal Khilani, who runs three Apollo Clinics. While a large number of ISC and CBSE XII students are preparing to join undergraduate courses abroad, many PG students, who had returned home from foreign institutes last year, are also set to fly back. Most foreign campuses are now preparing to resume physical classes and suspend online classes. Most of these students took their first dose of Covishield —among the vaccine being administered in India, foreign universities have accepted only Covishield so far—in the last week of May. Going by the rule book, the students would have had to wait till August-end for the second shot. Many had decided to fly to Mumbai, Pune or Kerala for their 2nd jabs as these states had requested to relax rules for foreign-bound students. “The second jab on August 23 would have coincided with the day I am supposed to leave Kolkata. I was thinking of going to Kerala for it,” said Aishani Chatterjee, a Class XII student at La Martiniere for Girls, who has got admission at University of Michigan to study neurosciences. Darsh Chopra, a Birla High School student who has got admission to the University of Purdue to study maths and statistics, said, “I would have otherwise gone to Pune, for my second jab as I could not wait for 84 days.” Arvind Kumar, a PG student of Public Policy at King’s College, London University, has to go back to the UK. “I am so happy the Centre has thought about our predicament. I was discussing how to negotiate the problem,” Arvind said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/foreign-bound-students-relieved-after-shot-gap-reduced-to-28-days/articleshow/83350606.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Chandigarh||‘Complacency sets in as cases fall, stay alert’||Besides treating Covid patients, Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) is also providing inputs on the pandemic to the state government. Head of the department of social and preventive medicines and CMCH vice-principal Dr Clarence Samuel talks to TOI’s Shariq Majeed on issues related to Covid management in Punjab and in Ludhiana. How do you see the current Covid scenario in Ludhiana? Daily cases stand at around 200 and it is expected to remain the same for some time. We don’t have data on urban and rural cases but daily cases are expected to remain the same for at least a week or so and then they may fall. After cases decrease, what should be done to check the disease? Greater vigilance is required after cases decrease. More emphasis should be laid on the public health system, increasing vaccination coverage, testing and very strict contact tracing. After opening of domestic and international air travel, we need to have real time data as we would have variants of concern coming from other states and countries. In Punjab, we have a very high number of NRIs and people coming from outside, so that population will have to be checked very closely. If there is one method of screening at the airport itself, that monitoring system needs to be strengthened. When is third wave expected as per mathematical projection? It can come within six months from March, which is around September or October, but if people are not careful, it can come next month also. Is the third wave expected to be more severe than the second? We haven’t worked on that model as yet but everywhere else it is not as bad as the second wave. What has been observed in different countries is that the second wave is worse than the first while the third wave is not as bad as the second and first wave. Again, it depends on how it is dealt with. How to deal with the probable third wave? The focus has to be on increasing vaccination coverage, better methods of detecting cases and people coming forward to get tested. Rapid diagnosis and treatment is most important. Do you think we will have sufficient facilities by the time probable third wave comes? This is where emphasis has been misdirected. No other country is saying that children will be affected. Children are part of the system anywhere so there is fear of them being vulnerable as they have not been vaccinated. However generally, they have not fallen very sick even if they have been infected. During the first and second wave (which was in two parts), children have become positive but not fallen sick. Only those with kidney disease and some other condition have fallen sick but generally nothing has happened. The emphasis needs to be on the public health system as a whole. There is resistance in some rural areas to testing and vaccination, how to motivate them? What is required is education, cooperation and community ownership. People should realise that this vaccine is beneficial. It helps save lives and we have seen it. Do you think majority of people are following norms and getting vaccinated? That we cannot say, people are still people. As cases are decreasing, people are becoming complacent. In March, our state had started this one hour activity on Saturday where traffic would be stopped and people would remember those who had died of Covid. That sort of thing should continue. It is important that the state keeps reminding people that coronavirus is there. What is your message to the government and people? The government should increase vaccination coverage and try to ensure that people in every area and village get vaccinated. Reaching them requires community ownership. Community ownership is very important, whether it is vaccination, Covid surveillance, or Covid reporting. People should know that doctors and nurses are very tired and have been working for the last one and a half years. Take all precautions, give them a break. We want life to come back to normal and it will come back to normal only when we care about each other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/complacency-sets-in-as-cases-fall-stay-alert/articleshow/83345819.cms||Shariq Majeed

A memorandum detailing damage to crops,fruit trees, houses, marine infrastructure, the fishing industry, roads, electricity and other infrastructure by the storm was submitted to the centre by the state government, an official statement said on Tuesday. Through the memorandum, the state government has sought Rs 9,836 crore according to NDRF norms to carry out various relief, restoration and rehabilitation works in areas hit by Cyclone Tauktae, it said. In addition, the Gujarat government has sought additional assistance of Rs 500 crore for the State Disaster Response Fund from the Centre, the release said. The cyclone had made landfall on the Gujarat coast on the night of May 17 with wind speeds of up to 220kmph. Tauktae was the most powerful cyclone to hit Gujarat in the last 50 years and caused widespread devastation in 23 districts of the state, the release said. The cyclone remained active over Gujarat for 28 hours before it weakened and moved towards Rajasthan, the state government said in the memorandum. It caused large-scale damage in Amreli, Gir-Somnath, Bhavnagar and Junagadh districts, the government said. In the memorandum, the state government has given details about the loss of human lives, cattle, damage to houses as well as other infrastructure, the release said. In all, the state government said it needs Rs 9,836 crore as financial assistance from the NDRF to carry out relief, rehabilitation and restoration works in the affected regions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 19 had approved assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for “immediate relief activities” in Gujarat after an aerial survey of the areas ravaged by the cyclone. He had also announced that Gujarat would get additional assistance after an inter-ministerial central team submits report on assessment of the damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-seeks-rs-9836cr-as-cyclone-aid-from-centre/articleshow/83352587.cms||---

Already behind schedule in production, the export units have raised apprehension of losing global orders if it is not streamlined. Export textile activities in Karur district came to a grinding halt from May 17 after Karur textile manufacturer exporters association announced complete closure considering the increasing Covid-19 positive cases. “There are roughly 400 units in Karur district which stopped production for the last 14 days. This has adversely impacted the production. Reviving the work is a good sign but there are challenges ahead,” said Nachimuthu, president of the association. “Even if we are allowed to operate with 100% staff from next week, we will be able to revive production only up to 50% due to shortage of staff. While many guest workers have returned to their native places, Covid-19 infection has affected a section of local workers from getting back to work,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/karur-textile-units-starts-operations-with-10-staff/articleshow/83334612.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was here to review the preparedness for kuruvai cultivation in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts.District secretary of Thanjavur district Cauvery Farmers’ Protection Association S Vimalanathan condemned the unscrupulous remarks of the minister. “It was unbecoming of a minister.

---||Kolkata||Vaccination drive at private hospitals to continue across Kolkata||KOLKATA: Covid vaccination centres at private facilities across the city will continue to conduct the inoculation drive despite the Centre’s capping on the service charge. But many private hospitals hope the Centre would reconsider the limiting of service charge to Rs 150 per dose, and also lower the vaccine price supplied to private players. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announced that vaccines to all government centres would be free and that private facilities could charge Rs 150 extra for administering a dose. “The Prime Minister has capped the service charge, which was open earlier. We welcome the move. But it would have been better if private hospitals could also procure vaccines at the same cost as that of the government. This would have made vaccines more affordable for people going to private CVCs,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO at AMRI Hospitals. Currently, private facilities charge Rs 200 to Rs 300 for administering a dose. Hospitals said they would wait for a guideline on the capped price. “We will continue to work on the vaccination of all categories of people and try protecting as many people as we can. We also appeal to the government to increase the service charge cap as this will not be enough to cover all expenses,” said Rupali Basu, managing director, Woodlands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vax-drive-at-pvt-hosps-to-continue/articleshow/83350674.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: ‘Covid Capital’ braces for oxygen demand surge||AHMEDABAD: At its peak, Ahmedabad city had 9,971 Covid patients under hospitalization on May 3. On that day, the demand for oxygen shot up to 280 metric tons (MT) against average requirement of 40-50 MT reported during post-Diwali surge. With Ahmedabad city leading the daily tally in terms of active cases and daily new cases, the city is bracing for three times higher demand for oxygen during the third wave. Sources at Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) said that in other countries, the third surge reported about 2.5 to 3 times higher oxygen demand compared to the second wave. To tackle this, the city is creating a capacity to generate about 900 MT of oxygen. “Plans are afoot to meet this requirement. On one hand, we are creating 33 MT liquid refilling stations. On the other, about 250 PSA plants are being installed under various schemes. At every AMC-run hospital like SVP Hospital, LG Hospital, and Shardaben Hospital, PSA plants will have the capacity to generate 1,000 litres of oxygen every minute,” said a senior official. AMC recently carried out a meeting with office-bearers of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA) to chalk out plans for third wave. Sources close to the development said that the overall estimates needed for preparation were given by AHNA officials. AHNA has also increased capacity of its oxygen bank — one of the first such initiatives in India — to about 100 cylinders. “The central repository will help all private hospitals to get oxygen in any contingency scenario,” said a senior AHNA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-capital-braces-for-o2-demand-surge/articleshow/83352606.cms||Himanshu Kaushik
---||Delhi||Green boundary wall for Delhi: Master plan to incentivise outer areas for green development||NEW DELHI: The outskirts of Delhi and low-density villages are likely to play a key role in the future of the capital, with the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041’s green development area policy envisaging the creation and utilisation of green belts not only to act as a natural buffer to pollution and dust, but also provide economic benefits as green entertainment hubs, weekend destinations and theme parks. Such spaces will also create green jobs by encouraging production of food and other natural produce, horticulture and forestry, floriculture, solar fields and smriti vans. Non-polluting cyber and knowledge-related industries can also be allowed to develop in green development areas (GDA). According to the draft plan, GDA areas will be characterised by significantly lower floor-area ratio, with a large chunk wooded and under green cover. The policy states low-density residential areas that have a concentration of farmhouses and stretches along Delhi’s border could be used to create such hubs. These will largely use reused wastewater, have a 100% decentralised waste facility and 30% of the on-site energy requirement will be met through renewable energy. The policy will, however, not be applicable to land in unauthorised colonies, under litigation or those in Lal Dora areas and notified forests. The draft MPD41 says GDA aims to provide environmentally sustainable development options to enable land-owners to achieve the economic value of lands, with provision of connectivity and infrastructure for physical and functional integration of these areas with the main city. At present, three grades of development are permitted within GDA, with Grade 1 consisting of plots of a minimum area of 600 sq metres, Grade 2 area of 4000 sq m or higher and Grade 3, 10,000 sq m or higher. In Grade1, activities such as agriculture, horticulture, smriti vans, burial grounds, crematoriums, waste-water treatment facilities, composting facility and solar fields are permitted, while zoological parks, open-air mandis, sports facilities, primary and secondary education facilities, green houses, resorts, motels and clubs will be permitted in Grade 2. Grade-3 areas include spaces for amusement parks, concert spaces, green houses, convention and exhibition centres and non-polluting work centres like knowledge and the cyber industry. Grade1 does not require mandatory wooded areas, but Grade 2 has to have 15% of the plot area wooded and Grade 3, 45%. “All developments shall adhere to prescribed green ratings and any violation of these norms shall be penalised,” the plan says. Experts question how the policy would effectively create recreational hubs on the outskirts of Delhi. “It sounds good on paper, but you have to provide a significant value to the farmer to give up his land. In order to encourage people to go to such areas, access needs to be improved too,” said Paras Tyagi, co-founder of NGO Cycle-India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-boundary-wall-for-delhi/articleshow/83381976.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Fire in Park St high-rise, employees evacuated||KOLKATA: A fire broke out on the fifth floor of Apeejay House on Park Street — a landmark building in central Kolkata that has witnessed multiple fire incidents in the past few years — triggering panic in the area. The ongoing enhanced safety restrictions ensured that most of the offices were shut and there were not many employees at the building when the fire was spotted around 2.40pm. By the time firemen reached the spot and started dousing the fire, every one inside the building could be safely evacuated. The nine-storey building, spread over three blocks, houses around two dozen offices. On Tuesday, the fire had broken out at the office of a pharmaceutical firm, next to a private bank on the fifth floor of Block C. Although the office was closed, there were some bank employees who were evacuated immediately after the fire alarm rang and the security guards alerted the employees. There were some employees at a private office in the commercial building as well, who had reportedly come for an in-office vaccination drive but fire or police officials couldn’t confirm it. “The fire started inside a closed office of the pharma company. However, firemen reached the building fast and contained the fire within the office itself. The fire was doused in less than two hours,” said Firhad Hakim, chairman of the board of administrators at Kolkata Municipal Corporation. To control the fire, firemen had to break down the glass window panes and sprayed water from inside as well as outside the building. State fire minister Sujit Bose also visited the spot, overseeing the fire-fighting operations as firemen on 12 fire tenders and a hydraulic ladder doused the flames by 4.15pm. “I was at my store when there was a sudden commotion and people started running out of the building. I also came out and saw thick black smoke billowing out of a fifth floor window. The sight was scary,” said Samir Sadhukhan, who works at a confectionery unit on the ground floor of the building. Incidentally, there was a fire on the sixth floor of the same building in 2012 while another fire had broken out on the fifth floor in 2018. “We will conduct an inquiry into Tuesday’s fire to find out the seat of blaze and will also expand the scope of investigation to find out the reason behind multiple instances of fire at this building,” said a senior official of the fire and emergency services department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fire-in-park-st-high-rise-employees-evacuated/articleshow/83350638.cms||Subhojyoti Kanjilal

Markets were teeming with customers; many roads, which wore deserted look even recently, saw vehicular traffic reminiscent of pre-lockdown times. Tea shacks alongside important roads like M I Road, Mahesh Nagar, Tonk Road and Chandpol were brimming with customers. Several shopkeepers made elaborate arrangements to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. Akshay Agarwal, owner of a tile and pipe shop in Mansarovar, said business was limping back to normal, but soaring heat deterred many people from venturing out. Shops open in Walled City in Jaipur on the first day of staggered unlocking on Tuesday“Curbs and restrictions kept people indoors. Now gradually lockdown is being eased but footfall has not increased much due to debilitating heat," he said, adding he was hopeful of customers returning in coming weeks. Small kiosks and bakeries selling cold coffee and milkshakes at Ashok Nagar and Yudishthir Marg near C-Scheme and around Statue Circle were teeming with customers waiting for their takeaway orders. Many bookshops in Chaura Rasta and Barkat Nagar saw students queueing up to buy books after a wait of over one month. "We had been getting a lot of calls from students who wanted to buy books for different entrance tests for law and business schools. Passbooks and course books for college and university examinations are selling quickly," said Govind Daga, a bookseller near Chaura Rasta. He added that business has not returned to the pre-Covid level yet as enforcing social distancing in small areas remains an uphill task. The city police also said that traffic increased on Tuesday after businesses and offices opened. "We have formed over 60 teams. They have fanned out across the city to check places where Covid-19 appropriate behavior is not followed," said additional commissioner of police (law and order), Rahul Prakash. At other places, barricades were cleared so that traffic could resume seamlessly. By evening, however, police personnel brought them back to enforce the evening curfew.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hustle-bustle-back-in-markets-traders-bullish/articleshow/83352593.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Trial on for ‘kidnapping’ tenant’s wife||AHMEDABAD: Anamitra Parikh of Naroda will have to stand a trial for eloping with his tenant’s wife eight years ago, as a city sessions court refused to discharge him from charges of abducting the woman with intent to compel her to marry him. In 2013, after Parikh eloped with the 29-year-old woman, who took one of her two children along, her husband lodged an FIR against Parikh that his landlord’s son had eloped with his wife. He was booked under Section 366 of the IPC for kidnapping, abducting or inducing a woman to compel her to marry. Parikh filed a discharge plea in the city sessions court, stating that the woman involved had nowhere said in her statement that she had been kidnapped. The woman had gone from her house with him. They visited different places but she never claimed that he had induced or compelled her to marry him. She also did not say that there was any physical relationship between them. It was also submitted that the woman was 29 years old and married and had two children. She was able to understand right and wrong and had left her husband’s house on her own. Hence, her statement falsified the Section 366 charge and he should be discharged from the case. However, the court opined that the possibilities or probabilities of conviction or acquittal are not to be seen by the court at the stage of framing of charges. However, the court is not a mere post office that it will frame charges without any application of mind. It further said that there is sufficient material on record to frame the charge against him. “The prosecution must be given an opportunity to bring oral evidence and to prove the documentary evidence against the accused persons. Without evaluating the entire evidence, the accused/applicant can not be given the benefit of doubt at this stage,” the court said, and ordered Parikh to remain present in court on the next date to be fixed for framing of charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/trial-on-for-kidnapping-tenants-wife/articleshow/83352591.cms||---

Unlike a zoological park where animals are in captivity and come under human contact, the possibility is remote in sanctuaries and therefore the chances of infection are unlikely. The sanctuary is home for about 800-900 black bucks besides 200 odd spotted deer. Nine lionesses died a couple of days ago due to suspected coronavirus at the Arignar Anna Zoological Park (AAZP) in Chennai, while nine more lions are infected with coronavirus. The animals are closely monitored, and it is suspected that the virus could have been transmitted through workers at the park. “But the case is not the same with Point Calimere,” explains S Ramasubramanian, chief conservator of forests, in-charge of Trichy forest circle. The sanctuary is a free run area where human interference is limited to a negligible extent. This was unlike in AAZP though it was out of bound for common people during Covid-19 lockdown. “In Point Calimere, water is the only input that goes from outside. Even that is done through an automated process where the water is filled in the turfs created inside the sanctuary through underground pipelines. Point Calimere is also a secluded area unlike a few sanctuaries having tribal settlements,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/covid-spread-among-animals-remote-say-tn-forest-officials/articleshow/83334623.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Unlock & heat power peak demand to season’s high||NEW DELHI: With the city unlocking further, Delhi recorded its peak power demand of the season on Tuesday at 5,808MW. Data also shows that the peak power demand in the first eight days of June has been 33% higher than the same period last year. The discoms state that with temperature rising further and the city gradually unlocking, Delhi’s peak power consumption could touch anywhere between 7,000MW and 7,400MW this year. The peak demands in the areas under BSES Rajdhani (BRPL), BSES Yamuna (BYPL) and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL) on Tuesday were 2,484MW, 1,267MW and 1,696MW, respectively, around 3.45pm. On Monday, the day Unlock 2.0 began, the demand crossed 5,000MW for the first time this season and touched 5,559MW around 11.19pm. Besides the unlocking, the peak power demand was also triggered by the fact that Tuesday was Delhi’s warmest day of the season so far, with the mercury touching 41.7 degrees Celsius at Safdarjung, the city’s base station. Prior to this, the warmest day was May 5, when a high of 41.6 degrees was recorded. “The increase in power demand corresponds with the gradual unlocking in Delhi and the weather, which was slightly better after rain and thundershowers over the past few days,” said a discom official. The peak power demand was nearly 33% higher in the first eight days of June as against the same period last year. The data showed the peak power demand in the same period last year was 4,611MW on June 8. Due to the lockdown, Delhi’s peak power demand recorded last year was 6,314MW, which was recorded on June 29. This was significantly lower than Delhi’s all-time high peak power demand of 7,409MW recorded on July 2, 2019. “With the restrictions gradually being removed and the temperature rising, Delhi’s peak power demand is expected to be in the range of 7,000MW to 7,400MW. The original estimates were, however, around 7,900MW,” an official said. Despite the lockdown being in place since April 19, Delhi’s peak power demands this April and May have been higher than the corresponding peak power demands in 2020. In May, the highest peak power demand was 4,959MW, which was recorded on its last day, with western disturbances and rain largely providing a relatively cooler month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unlock-heat-power-peak-demand-to-seasons-high/articleshow/83350785.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Multiplexes, gym owners get property tax relief||AHMEDABAD: Multiplexes and cinema halls are barely opened since the pandemic began and shut down due to restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. In a major relief to the owners of multiplexes, cinema-halls and gyms, the state government on Tuesday announced a complete waiver of property tax to these businesses for the financial year 2021-22. The core committee appointed by the state government also decided that these businesses will also be given waivers on fixed electricity charges for the year. Manubhai Patel, president of the Gujarat Multiplex Owners’ Association, said, “The decision is good as business has been reeling from losses and most industry players were compelled to put in money from their pocket to keep the businesses running for the little time it was allowed.” Industry players also feel they should have been given this relief for two years instead of one. The state government, a day ago, also extended this relief to restaurateurs, amusement and water parks, and hotels. “The government decision is welcome. However, we expect that gyms be now allowed to start operations as we have been getting a lot of inquiries. We have rent and bills to pay and the employment of a lot of people is dependent on this sectors,”said a gym owner, who asked not to be named. Travel agents demand relief In a meeting between Jawahar Chawda, the minister of state for tourism, and travel agents and tour operators on Tuesday, industry players sought measures to enable the their survival and revival. Apart from relief in property tax, electricity bills and GST dues, the Gujarat chapter of the Travel Agents’ Association of India (TAAI), asked that measures be taken to revive tourism. They also asked for waivers of RTO tax for bus and taxi operators and interest-free working capital loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/multiplexes-gym-owners-get-property-tax-relief/articleshow/83352603.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: As private vax drive widens, 18-44 age group get 70% of doses||MUMBAI: Vaccination in the 18-44 age group has far exceeded shots given to those above 45 years over the past week. Younger cohorts accounted for up to 70% of shots in the first week of June. The more vulnerable age group of 45-59 got 19% of doses and senior citizens received barely 9%, BMC data showed.  If the average doses administered daily is considered, almost 50,000 in the 18-44 category got vaccinated as opposed to 13,000 from 45-59 and 6,100 among the 60-plus population.  This trend comes at a time when the private sector is largely driving the vaccine programme in the city. Some experts say cost in private facilities (Rs 900-Rs 1,450) could be deterring a section of the target population. While 18-44 can only get vaccinated in the private sector, those above 45 can get vaccinated both at free and paid centres. But covid immunization in Mumbai in the last ten days has been concentrated in the private sector largely due to a shortage of doses in public centres. Of the 3.56 lakh doses administered from June 1-7 in Mumbai, 2.76 lakh were given in the private sector and 80,261 in the public centres. Among recipients, more than 2.50lakh were in the 18-44 group and less than a lakh were 45 years and above. Experts called the age disparity in vaccination “worrying” as people above 45 continue to make up for the largest number of deaths and critical illnesses. In May, 93% of deaths were in groups above 40, including 60% in senior citizens in the city. Since upto 81% of senior citizens have taken one dose and 32% both doses, it could explain why people above 60 years are not getting vaccinated in big numbers in private. “Most have taken the first dose and remaining may not be eligible for their second dose yet as per the 12-16 weeks gap,” a civic official said. However, the coverage in people between 44-45 years has been just 55% with one dose and 8% with both. Dr Sheela Jagtap, head of civic immunisation, said it was a mystery why the 45-59 group was not turning up in higher numbers both in public and private. “We are allowing walk-ins too on the first three days of the week in public vaccination centres, but the response is low,” she said. An expert in vaccination strategies Dr Naveen Thacker said this trend was visible in several states now. “We are seeing the same in Gujarat and it’s troubling that vaccination has dropped in people above 45-plus,” he said, adding that it could be hesitancy due to myths about vaccination. The digital divide too can’t be a factor here. “Most cities, including Mumbai, are allowing walk-ins so it can’t be that people above 45 years cannot get vaccinated as they can’t get slots on CoWin,” he said. According to Dr Thacker, trends show that senior citizens have been the most enthusiastic to get vaccinated followed by 18-44. “The government must find out why people from 45-59 are missing from vaccination centres and build effective communication to deal with their apprehensions,” he added.  The affordability factor cannot be underestimated either, according to public policy expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. “A vaccine dose doesn’t come cheap in the private sector. Since the public sector is otherwise giving free vaccination to people above 45 years, many may prefer to wait and take it in a public centre whenever stocks arrive,” he said. At the centre of the problem is vaccine equity once again, said Dr Lahariya, adding that while only 4% of vaccination centres in India are private, they being allocated 25% of doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-pvt-vax-drive-widens-18-44-age-group-get-70-of-doses/articleshow/83352635.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Ahmedabad||From 1,200MT to 9,900MT: Can we breathe easy in 3rd wave?||GANDHINAGAR/AHMEDABAD: The images of the patients gasping for that one precious breath in the queues outside the Covid hospitals across the state is still fresh in minds of the citizens. For many hospitals, management of oxygen became as important as patient management and procurement of medicines. So needless to say, oxygen management is top priority for the state preparing for the anticipated third wave. Top government sources indicate at three-fold rise in demand with two-fold rise in daily cases. “As we had seen in the second wave, a very high number of patients needed high-flow oxygen support. Thus, if we had seen peak daily demand at 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen, we must prepare for about 3,500-3,600MT,” said a senior official. However, government officials are preparing for about three times that figure. Jai Prakash Shivahare, state health commissioner, said that CM Vijay Rupani has asked all 33 districts to set up minimum 300MT capacity PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plants that can generate oxygen from ambient air. “We are covering all medical college hospitals, district headquarters with oxygen plants,” he said. In Ahmedabad, four oxygen generators are installed or being installed at Civil Hospital in addition to 20MT liquid oxygen plant. Civil medical superintendent J P Modi said they have got 300 oxygen concentrators. “We have converted all possible beds into oxygen beds. We can also convert some of the buildings to Covid facilities at short notice,” he said. Private hospitals are also gearing up for the oxygen demand spike. Sources close to development said that several mid-level hospitals are in talks with the firms to install liquid oxygen tanks or PSA plants to reduce dependency on cylinder-based oxygen supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/from-1200mt-to-9900mt-can-we-breathe-easy-in-3rd-wave/articleshow/83352610.cms||Kapil Dave

During searches, the agency also seized Rs 32 lakh cash, 200 grams of gold ornaments and 650 grams of silver from the house of the accused. The ACB also found that the accused had invested nearly Rs 48 lakh in fixed deposits and life insurance. The medical college was in news allegedly for the black marketing of oxygen cylinder and remdesivir injections. “We received a complaint that KK Goyal was demanding 1 per cent commission in lieu of the total bill of the complainant’s company providing oxygen cylinders. He had asked the complainant to pay a sum of Rs 65,000 and later settled for Rs 50,000. After the complainant approached us, we verified the complaint and laid a trap in which Goyal was arrested while accepting the bribe,” Soni told TOI. During the second wave, the complainant, who is owner of Jagdamba Industries, had supplied oxygen cylinders of nearly Rs 64 lakh. “Thus for the payment of the bills, the accused was demanding commission,” said Bajrang Singh, additional SP, ACB. ACB in the evening conducted massive searches at the residence of the accused and found cash and documents of moveable and immovable properties. “So far have recovered Rs 32.50 lakh cash, gold ornaments weight 200 grams, silver ornaments weight 650 grams and have found documents showing investments of Rs 48 lakhs in fixed deposits and life insurance. Also our team has seized papers related to shares, debentures and registration papers of two land plots. He also has a locker in the bank that would be searched on Wednesday,” Soni added. After seeing huge amount of money, the sleuths of ACB got the currency counting machine. “Apart from the regular case under appropriate sections of Prevention of Corruption Act, we will also try to find out if we can also have a separate case of disproportionate assets against the accused,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bikaner-med-college-officer-arrested-for-accepting-bribe/articleshow/83352615.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: More arrests likely in goat slaughter racket||JAIPUR: Senior officers of the ACB investigating the bribery case related to slaughter house on Tuesday said the arrests so far in the case were just the tip of the iceberg as they have got concrete clues on the involvement of other officers in the deep-rooted racket. Authorities said they were working on various other evidence and would investigate further. The agency on Monday arrested a livestock assistant and a fourth class employee posted at Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Greater for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 4,500 in lieu of renewing the license of the meat shop of the complainant. Two others including a lower division clerk and a contractor were also arrested for their involvement in the racket. DG ACB BL Soni said, “In the investigation so far, it was found that there are irregularities and misrepresentation of facts in connection to the procedure adopted by the JMC officials related to the slaughtering of goats. They are supposed to get Rs 5 per goat for slaughtering at Chainpura and give a receipt to the meat shop owner. On the contrary, they were actually getting Rs 50 per goat without receipt for allowing the meat shop owners to slaughter the goat as per their convenience.” When contacted, ASP ACB Bajrang Singh said, “Rs 5 per goat is the official revenue of the JMC in lieu of every slaughtering. It was found that they had receipts of only 50 to 60 goats per day and that is next to impossible as Jaipur has more than 1,500 licensed meat shops. So, we are working on various other clues and will try to make more arrests in this connection.” ACB authorities added it was mandatory that slaughtering of goat should be done at Chainpura abbatoir. But the JMC officials were allowing meat shop owners to slaughter goats as per their convenience and were charging Rs 50 per goat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/more-arrests-likely-in-goat-slaughter-racket/articleshow/83352598.cms||---

After coming to power, Trinamool government, keeping in mind Bengal’s undying love for football, is launching the “Khela Hobe” programme, through which the sports department will distribute footballs to registered clubs. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had promised to distribute footballs to the clubs and school students during campaigns. From July the new Khela Hobe scheme will be launched. The CM was seen throwing footballs towards the crowd as part of the popularising the campaign ‘Khela Hobe’. Even the slogan had touched Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was heard saying “Khela Hobe Unnayaner.” The CM had earlier inaugurated football tournaments for the youths of Jangalmahal and Sunderbans and employed the winning team members as civic volunteers or as junior constables. The CM said during the campaigns that the state government would be distributing 50,000 “Joyee” brand footballs to the clubs. The sports and youths affairs department’s additional secretary, Uttam Kumar Patra, has written to the district youth officers that “All the registered clubs will be given football of Joyee brand under Khela Hobe programme to encourage the youths to play the game and thereby develop sports activities in the state.” Patra said that the distribution of footballs will start from the first week of July. The district youth officers have been asked to prepare a list of the registered clubs in the blocks and the municipalities by June 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-clubs-to-get-footballs-as-khela-goes-on-after-elections/articleshow/83350699.cms||Debasish Konar

Police have scheduled the release of the vehicles in a phased manner. The process will continue till June 22. On the first day of the unlocking, city police led by the commissioner of police, A Arun, released 238 vehicles including one autorickshaw and a car from the Armed Reserve police force ground at KK Nagar in Trichy. The vehicles were released on the production of notice issued by the police during the seizure, the original documents of the vehicle, the identity cards of the owner or the person authorised by the owner of the vehicle. Police had already informed the owners of the vehicles seized from May 15 to May18 to get their vehicles released on June 7 on priority basis. A senior police officer said that maximum of 250 vehicles can be released in a day to avoid crowding. The vehicles were released after checking whether they were involved in any criminal cases. Till June 6, the city police seized 5,443 vehicles including 105 auto-rickshaws and 44 four-wheelers for violating the lockdown norms. On Monday, the city police seized four vehicles for the violations while 257 vehicles were seized on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-city-police-releases-impounded-vehicles-as-lockdown-norms-relaxed/articleshow/83334689.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Only 24% auto drivers apply for state’s Rs1,500 aid||Nagpur: Only 24% autorickshaw drivers in the city have applied for the state government’s one-time relief package of Rs1,500 announced when the lockdown-like restrictions were imposed in April. According to regional transport office data, there are at least 7.15 lakh autorickshaw permit holders across the state. Of the 18,491 autorickshaw drivers (from deputy RTO east and city office), only 4,540 have applied for the government dole so far. Of these, only 3,880 three-wheeler drivers have received Rs1,500 in their respective bank accounts. From the city RTO office, the transport department has received 1,980 applications, while 1,840 autorickshaw drivers have already received the amount in their bank account. The east office received 2,560 online applications of which 2,040 have been cleared and relief amount disbursed. Deputy RTO Vinod Jadhav said that autorickshaw drivers having valid permits and driving licences will definitely receive the relief package. But they have to apply online and ensure they provide authenticate details. Autorickshaw union leaders admitted the response was not satisfactory. They blamed on the meagre relief amount being offered. Besides this, the procedure to avail the scheme is also very tedious for many, they pointed out. Autorickshaw driver Rafique Sheikh said that they had been demanding compensation of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 a month since the first lockdown which was imposed in March 2020. “The state government’s one-time relief of Rs1,500 is nothing but peanuts,” he said. Most autorickshaw drivers claimed that they will not claim the relief package. “It is nothing but rubbing salt to our injury,” said another autorickshaw driver Chandu Gadge. Vilas Bhalekar, founder president of Vidarbha Autorickshaw Chalak Federation, said the main reason for poor response is that most auto drivers haven’t linked their mobile numbers to Aadhaar card, which is mandatory to avail the relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-24-auto-drivers-apply-for-states-rs1500-aid/articleshow/83342778.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The 30-year-old had come to his brother’s residence in Palanpur in April. He contracted Covid infection and had to be hospitalization for 10 days. Once he was out of hospital, he complained of severe pain on left side of his forehead. A medical examination revealed the issue to be mucormycosis infection. He was shifted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad, where he was operated upon and treated with amphotericin B. “The doctors suggested removing his eyeball as Alok had already lost vision. The family approached Civil Hospital for a second opinion. The doctors took the challenge of saving his eye even though he had already lost vision,” said a Civil Hospital official, adding that the treatment was possible as the fungal infection had not reached the brain. After treatment, Alok is ready to go back home. “The family’s biggest worry was disfigurement due to removal of eye. While Alok has lost his vision, the fungal infection is overall cured,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/docs-save-mm-patients-eye/articleshow/83352639.cms||---

Many of the promoters of the units TOI spoke with said that the social and business cost of an employee getting infected is far higher than the vaccine price they are paying to the private hospitals. In the past few weeks, companies like JCB, regional offices of scheduled banks, local companies Mayur Uniquoters, IT service provider ACTS and companies in exports business have vaccinated their staff. “By vaccinating the whole workforce, we cut out many risks. More than that the employees are free from anxiety and fear and are in a better mental framework to work. We are also giving them additional leaves to overcome any physical uneasiness that comes with vaccination,” said Sanjul Vaish, MD of ATCS, which employees over 600 people.Even as the factories continued to operate during the lockdown as per the government relaxation, the risks of the virus was always there. Younger people, up to 44 years, make up for the larger portion of the shop floor operation. Deepak Shetty, CEO and MD, JCB India, said, “We have initiated various vaccination drives across all our factory locations in India. At our Jaipur facility alone we have conducted three vaccination drives till date and have vaccinated almost 650 eligible employees at the cost of the company. We will be conducting more such drives with the aim to vaccinate all our employees at JCB Jaipur and their families.”Hospitals are getting frequent calls from industrial units for vaccination camps. But they don’t have enough vaccines to cater to the requirements of large number of companies.Pallavi Mishra, financial director of NIIMs University said, “Many companies are coming forward to vaccinate their employees. We have held camps for some vaccinating their employees. But vaccine availability is an issue.”Some hospitals said there is demand from residential societies to vaccinate and they have held camps there but it would be more frequent when the vaccine supply improves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cos-line-up-at-hosps-to-vaccinate-workers/articleshow/83352642.cms||---

One of the reasons is the animal birth control drive that has been suspended by the corporation since 2019. The civic body said that the lockdown and surge in Covid-19 infection has shifted their focus away from the issue. “We have identified a Madurai-based NGO for relaunching the sterilisation drive. A few paperwork is pending, we will launch the process this week,” corporation commissioner S Sivasubramanian said. “While returning from a pharmacy late night, a pack of stray dogs chased and I almost slipped from my bike. We are deprived of sleep as packs of stray dogs aggressively fights every night,” said Vignesh K, a resident of Ponnagar. Almost all the 65 wards here have similar complaints.

---||Nagpur||Vidarbha districts conducting more tests, reducing their positivity rate||NAGPUR: As test positivity rate (TPR) has become the most important indicator to upgrade the level of unlocking, almost every district in Vidarbha has started conducting more and more tests now. Despite the number of new cases declining constantly, more than 37,500 tests were conducted in the 11 districts of Vidarbha in last 24 hours. This shows that district administrations are focusing on contact tracing, which is necessary to control Covid-19. Districts like Bhandara and Gondia have less than 0.5% TPR, while Nagpur too reported only 81 positives out of more than 8,000 tests on Tuesday, which means less than 1% test positivity. On Friday, the TPR will be reviewed and the fate of districts will be decided. As on Tuesday, almost every district in Vidarbha has less than 5% TPR. If this continues for the next three days, all districts will get entry in level 1 and life in Vidarbha will move towards normalcy very fast. On Tuesday, only 791 new cases were reported. On the other hand, the number of recoveries — 1,853 patients — was more than double of it. Now, 10,54,771 out of the 10,90,246 cases till date have recovered and Vidarbha’s overall recovery rate has increased to 96.7%. The number of under-treatment patients has reduced to 14,081 now, which is not even 1.3% of the total cases reported. This indicates that a large number of hospital beds are vacant, which is another important criterion in unlocking guidelines. The death toll is also reducing daily, but Amravati and Wardha continue to be the districts to watch out for. In all, 22 deaths were reported in Vidarbha on Tuesday. Wardha reported 4 deaths and Amravati 5. Both districts share borders and many cases and deaths are still coming from the border areas. Bhandara: Out of 1,679 tests done in the last 24 hours, only 9 tested positive, which means the test positivity rate is around 0.5%. This indicates a sharp drop in weekly TPR of the district, which may upgrade Bhandara into level 1 of unlocking this Friday. There were 98 recoveries and no death was reported for the 4th day in a row. Bhandara now has only 645 patients under treatment. Gondia: With 13 patients testing positive out of 2,733 tests conducted in last 24 hours, Gondia’s TPR is less than 0.5% now. Gondia is already in level 1 of unlock. With 41 patients recovering in a day and one death, the district now has 40,960 cases, 39,962 recoveries and 694 deaths. Only 304 patients are under treatment here and 248 of them are in home isolation. Gondia’s recovery rate is 97.5%. Gadchiroli: The district conducted 1,072 tests in last 24 hours and 57 of them were found positive. Two deaths were reported on Tuesday. Now, Gadchiroli’s caseload is at 29,721 and death toll at 729. There were 62 recoveries, taking the total count to 28,577. This takes Gadchiroli’s recovery rate to 96.15%. Only 415 patients are under treatment now. Akola: The district conducted more than 2,000 tests and 100 of them were positive, which took the Covid tally to 56,804. On the other hand, 284 patients recovered. Now, 53,376 patients have recovered in the district. A 54-year-old man from Murtizapur died during treatment, taking the toll to 1,105. Akola still has 2,323 patients under treatment. Buldhana: Only 90 out of nearly 4,000 tests done in last 24 hours in Buldhana were positive, which is a good news for the district. With 129 patients recovering, now the district has 85,709 total cases, 84,242 recoveries and 635 deaths, including 2 deaths reported on Tuesday. Now, 832 patients are under treatment. Washim: On Tuesday there were 71 new cases and 108 recoveries in Washim. No death was reported. Now, the district has a casetally of 40,743, with 39,306 of them recovered and 591 deaths. Now, 845 patients are under treatment. Wardha: There were 30 new cases, 4 deaths and 147 recoveries on Tuesday, taking the caseload to 48,858, total recoveries to 46,900 and toll to 1,309.

Amravati: An addition 201 cases and five deaths on Tuesday indicated that the district was slowly but surely tiding over the second wave of coronavirus. Though the caseload reached 94,490, the day's 409 recoveries took the total to 90,008, implying a recovery rate of 95.3%. The toll reached 1,511, leaving 2,971 patients under treatment. Yavatmal: The district recorded one death on Tuesday, which took the toll to 1,782. The administration received 2,918 test reports, of which 33 (21 men and 12 women) were found positive.

Mohit Singh was kidnapped from a busy market in BB Nagar area of Bulandshahr district on May 29. He was returning from a grocery store when a few unidentified men forcibly whisked him away in a car. Police have arrested five persons including main suspect Saurav Singh for the alleged abduction and murder. They are said to be Mohit’s political rivals. Mohit’s body was dumped in Ganga river in Garhmukteshwar. “Some of the accused involved in the conspiracy were initially arrested and sent to jail. There were two CCTV cameras in the vicinity and its footage analysis helped us in getting to the bottom of the case,” Santosh Kumar, senior superintendent of police of Bulandshahr said. “In the footage, Mohit was seen arguing with the car driver. A brawl ensued and one of the accused pulled out a gun. The accused forcibly bundled Mohit into the car and sped away from the spot,” SSP said.

The owner of the house, Mohd Shakir, fled the spot, but his wife, Razia, has been detained by the police. Police raided the premises after getting a tip-off that meat was being illegally sold at the shop. As the sale of meat is banned in Mathura, a raid was conducted, police said. About two quintals of meat has been seized from the shop, said circle officer Varun Kumar, adding that prima facie it appears that the shop was selling beef. Samples of the seized meat have been sent for testing to the Veterinary College, Mathura. When contacted, Shakir’s relative, Raees, claimed that the former had got the meat for a delivery order and it was not for his family’s consumption. “I don’t know where Shakir is but he was very scared when he fled,” he said. Kumar said an FIR has been registered against three people, including Shakir, under IPC sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease), besides provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act at Highway police station, Mathura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-quintals-of-meat-seized-from-mathura-shop/articleshow/83348150.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Master Plan: Urban areas to break free from old mould||NEW DELHI: Parts of Delhi may see faster growth if the draft MPD 2041 projections come to fruition. Many areas in Delhi developed in 1940-1970 have old-built stock, and MPD41 outlines a policy to regenerate the dilapidated areas by incentivising residential development through the amalgamation of plots, additional floor area ratio and other incentives. The draft states that in planned residential areas, the regeneration will be primarily led by the private sector through plot amalgamation and FAR incentives and group housing given preference. The draft also talks about redevelopment of unauthorised colonies, urban villages, the Walled City, JJ clusters and unplanned industrial hubs. The urban regeneration policy, regulations for which will be prepared by DDA within six months of the notification of MPD41, will apply to all existing developed areas except restricted areas like Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone, land-pooling areas and green development areas. Three proposals have been made for reconstruction at the plot-level. Very small sized plots will be allowed to amalgamate to a maximum combined area of 64 sq metres. In the mixed land use/commercial streets category, linear amalgamation of plots along the street length will be permitted provided that individual plots are at least 500 sq m. In such a case, continuous frontage will have to be maintained along the street and parking requirements will have to be accommodated within the plot. For much larger areas of a minimum of 3,000 sq m, DDA will prepare specific regeneration schemes. While the draft MPD41 talks about redevelopment of Shahjahanabad, MPD21 also had provisions for rejuvenating the Walled City and special areas, but these never materialised. Several policy formulations and projects for redeveloping unplanned areas like unauthorised colonies and in-situ slum redevelopment are already under various stages of approval. MPD-2041 attempts to build on these efforts. For unauthorised colonies, four categories of regeneration schemes have been proposed for consolidated areas measuring 2,000-3,000 sq m, 3,000-5 000 sq m, 5,000-10,000 sq m and above 10,000 sq m. The draft MPD2041 has also directed DDA to come up with specific regulations for development and regeneration of urban villages within two years of notification. Urban villages, or lal dora abadis, have emerged as islands of unplanned growth in the city and are major hubs of rental housing. “Many of the urban villages are also of heritage importance and will need a mix of regeneration and conservation strategies,” the plan states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/urban-areas-to-break-free-from-old-mould/articleshow/83382061.cms||Paras Singh
---||Mumbai||No doorstep vax, drive taken ‘near to home’, GOI tells Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (Negvac) has unanimously decided shots cannot be given to the elderly or specially abled at home “at this time in India’’ due to risks cited by an expert panel, the Centre told the Bombay high court through an affidavit. Opposing door-to-door vaccination on the basis of “scientific facts” like difficulty in timely and effective management of possible adverse reactions and maintaining the cold chain for the vaccines, Negvac has, however, approved a “near to home” policy since May 27. It is “flexible, people-centric and follows a community-based approach’’ keeping in mind the mobility concerns of the elderly and bed-ridden. So vaccines will be given at school premises, old age homes, housing complexes and community centres, panchayat ghar, etc, the affidavit said. “If you give reasons based on scientific basis, we will not interfere,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, hearing a PIL by two advocates seeking home vaccination for the house-bound, and said the authorities could find a “workable” way to ensure no one is left out. It posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday. The bench, however, questioned the Centre’s reliance in its opposition to home vaccination on two grounds: “exposure to healthcare and frontline health workers to undue pressure from community and security issues in the community’’ and “risk of getting Covid infection among vaccinators and mobilisers”. “These concerns raised by the expert committee... can be overcome if the government wishes to,” it said. Advocate Dhruti Kapadia, one of the petitioners, pointed out that the percentage of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) was very low compared to the delivery of 24 crore jabs. The Union health ministry said there were 25,309 AEFI cases till May 28, of which 1,186 were serious and there were 475 deaths following vaccination. “Which other country has been able to do so with so much population? The government can do this too. You need to find your own way,” the CJ-led bench said. It asked “where will you find societies in slums or as said earlier by us, there are narrow bylanes (where even a stretcher cannot fit)”? Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said: “We are practically reaching the doorstep. We are vaccinating in residential societies as well. The policy is for the time being and may be changed later.” On May 20, the HC had given Negvac time till June 2 to examine the possibility of a doorstep policy. The Centre had sought time till June 8, saying as a policy, it has to be uniform, but added that with the situation being “dynamic”, changes would be made with expert advice. It sought to assure the HC that “no stone is being left unturned to vaccinate as many people as possible and to reach out to as many of them, being conscious of the fact that time is of essence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-doorstep-vax-drive-taken-near-to-home-goi-tells-bombay-hc/articleshow/83352704.cms||---

---||Meerut||Meerut varsity to introduce traditional games like gilli danda, marbles, stapoo as part of undergraduate programme||MEERUT: In an attempt to spark interest in fast-disappearing traditional outdoor games, Chaudhary Charan Singh University (CCSU) in Meerut is set to roll out games like gilli danda, marbles and stapoo (hopscotch) for students pursuing their bachelors in physical education from this academic session. The games will be part of a new subject -The Traditional Games of India - under the BA (Physical Education) degree. The traditional games will be revived under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, according to the university. A meeting of the Board of Studies for physical education at CCSU has decided to introduce the traditional games in the curriculum. At present, students of physical education are taught up to 25 games such as volleyball, wrestling, swimming, cricket, basketball etc. Talking to TOI, assistant professor at the physical education department of CCSU, KK Pandey said, “This will provide recognition to games that we all loved as children but which are now getting lost. With the new subject, our students and future physical training instructors (PTIs) will be equipped to train schoolchildren on such games.” According to Pandey, the games are also meant to build strength. "One of the games that will be taught in the course is called kai danda which is generally played in west UP and is known as ‘aam dali' in Madhya Pradesh. It prompts children to climb a mango tree while one player chases and catches them. This game not only strengthens muscles in a child but also helps them to concentrate. Marbles also enhance focus while making a child do squats. We hope that the introduction of these games in CCSU will go a long way in their revival and practical application."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-varsity-to-introduce-traditional-games-like-gilli-danda-marbles-stapoo-as-part-of-undergrad-programme/articleshow/83348121.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Goa||Decision to merge must be of party, not any MLA: Congress||PANAJI: Challenging assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar’s decision, which upheld the ‘merger’ of 10 Congress MLA into BJP, Congress submitted to the high court of Bombay at Goa that the speaker failed to consider the documentary evidence while deciding on the disqualification petition. During the hearing, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, who appeared for the petitioner state Congress president Girish Chodankar, argued that there is an urgency in the matter considering the term of the assembly is getting over by March 2022. In the petition, Chodankar stated that the decision to merge must be of the political party and not the decision of any member of the legislative assembly. Since the para 4 of the Tenth Schedule contemplates merger of only the “original political party” and not “legislative party”, it is abundantly clear that there was no valid merger, Congress stated. “It is also essential to bear in mind the objects for enacting the defection law. Despite defection, a member cannot be permitted to get away with it without facing the consequences of such defection,” the party submitted to the high court. Alleging bias and malice by the speaker in deciding the matter, Congress said, “The speaker deliberately delayed the proceedings pending before him since August 2019 and finally passed the order in the matter after an inordinate delay of 20 months of filing of the disqualification petition, that too after Supreme Court intervention.” Justice M S Sonak recused from the case stating that he has appeared for some of the respondents in the case. Counsel Abhijit Gosawi said the matter is likely to be listed before the special division bench next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/decision-to-merge-must-be-of-party-not-any-mla-cong/articleshow/83352707.cms||---

A delegation of Punjab Tent Dealers Welfare Association (PTDWA) met deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma on Tuesday and sent a memorandum to the chief minister through him. Their demands included a government job for the family of persons employed in the hospitality industry, who lost their lives due to Covid-19. Association general secretary Shiv Shankar Rai said, “The hospitality industry has been the worst sufferer of the Coronavirus and lockdown as there have been record number of closures and job losses in our industry as compared to any other sector. Be it hotels, restaurants, marriage palaces, tent house owners, or caterers, event managers, florists and decorators, everyone has suffered unprecedented losses. Savings of businessmen and their employees have been exhausted and bank loans on hospitality units have increased manifold. In days to come, a large number of people attached with our industry are likely to go bankrupt.” He added that the hospitality industry is the first to be closed in lockdown and the last to be opened up. “Even now, whenever other trade and industry units are running almost normally, we are still facing huge restrictions, like capping of 20 persons for each function,” he said. S S Makkar, president, PTWDWA said, “We want to urge the government to introduce some relief package for us before people in our industry start dying of hunger. “Some of the immediate steps which the government can take at the earliest include waiving off power charges for the lockdown period and reducing the rate of per unit of power for hotels, marriage palaces and restaurants. The government should also urge landlords who have rented or leased property for use as hotels, restaurants, etc to waive off rent for at least three months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hospitality-sector-needs-urgent-help-to-stay-afloat-tent-dealers/articleshow/83346071.cms||---

As multiple roads have been dug up and closed for maintenance work, police haplessly watched the spurt in the crowd in commercial hubs. The maintenance work on arterial roads like Varaganeri, Palakkarai, Marakkadai and Salai road hampered vehicular movement resulting in traffic snarls. While the enforcement was lacking to make people and business establishments conform to standard operating procedures, authorities appealed to the public to show voluntary responsibility as large-scale monitoring is an uphill task. People were seen commuting on their two-wheelers to grocery stores, vegetable and meat outlets which were permitted to open from Monday. According to police, vehicular movement was at a peak between 9am and 11am. Hardware, electrical and automobile spare stores too opened for business due to which there was significant demand. Though residents were insisted on stepping out only for essential needs, many were spotted with their children. Facemask adherence was almost 100%, but social distancing was not followed. “We couldn’t do much as traffic diversions due to maintenance work was creating chaos. Almost all main roads in market localities were closed or partially closed, forcing us to suspend vehicular inspection,” a traffic police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/crowds-back-on-streets-road-work-adds-to-woes-in-trichy/articleshow/83334732.cms||---

Owner of Shri Paras hospital, Arinjay Jain, was caught on camera saying that on the morning of April 26 he got the oxygen supply of 106 critical patients snapped for five minutes “as an experiment to know who all are going to survive”. “Twenty-two patients started gasping for breath, they began turning blue. So we became sure that they will not survive,” Jain was heard saying in the video clip. The hospital and local administration later said that just "four" Covid-19 patients had died that day. (TOI spoke to six families on Tuesday who said they lost their kin on the night of April 26-27.) There was no word on how many "suspected" Covid-19 patients died along with the other, confirmed ones. In the FIR filed by the health department, Jain was named as an accused. Jain had told TOI on Monday that his statement has been “misconstrued”.

The woman in her complaint to Shastri Nagar police station alleged that she was in the hospital when sometime in the early hours of Monday; the accused, part of the nursing staff, forcefully took her to a deserted room in the facility and raped her. “The accused has been identified as one Murari, the nursing contractor of the hospital. He is currently on the run. But we are making efforts to arrest him,” said Shastri Nagar SHO Dilip Singh. The accused, who is believed to be in his early 30s, had been working in the hospital for the past three months. “The accused had taken the contract for nursing operations of the hospital. The complainant had joined the hospital around a month ago,” Singh said. The woman in her complaint alleged that when she resisted, the accused beat her up and threatened to kill her. Soon after the incident, the accused fled. The nurse quickly approached the Shastri Nagar police station and filed a complaint in which she narrated her ordeal. Police said the medical examination was completed and an investigation was underway based on her statement. An FIR under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC was registered, along with other relevant sections. Police said the accused was an immediate supervisor to the complainant. “As the main nursing contractor, he oversaw the daily functions of the nursing staff. He had also in the past allegedly troubled her in some manner. We are trying to trace the location of the accused. He had got the whiff of the complaint against him and fled,” an official told TOI.

The forum had met in Gandhinagar on Monday and Tuesday and resolved that their efforts and work are not considered at par with other medical workers. The forum highlighted the issues of a 40% increase in stipends for doctors in the medical, dental and physiotherapy sections, but a similar demand from the nursing union side was not heeded. The increasing dependence on temporary staff and delays by the government in recruiting permanent staff members have been long-standing problems for the nurses. The forum had earlier raised the issues of long duty hours, friction between doctors and nursing staff, saying they need immediate redress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nurses-warn-of-strike-from-june-14-if-demands-not-met/articleshow/83352724.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Teachers want open-book tests at home to mark Higher Secondary candidates||KOLKATA: School teachers want an open-book assessment, albeit at home, before a final grade card is prepared for the Class XII candidates of the Higher Secondary examinations, especially since the students have not appeared for a pen-and-paper or online test since March 2020. But going by the plan so far, after announcing the cancellation of the board exams of classes X and XII, West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education will mark the Class XII candidates based on their Class XI annual exams, which was left half-way when the pandemic broke out last year. Their annual practical exams were held in March. “Neither the council nor the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has any data of marks obtained by HS or Madhyamik candidates from any internal evaluation, except the 10 marks for each of the seven compulsory Madhyamik subjects and 30 marks for the lab-based and 20 marks for non lab-based subjects in HS. But it’s not tenable that students be marked on their performance in an exam held for another level with a different syllabus,” said general secretary of West Bengal Government School Teachers’ Association Saugata Basu. Times ViewNow that all boards seem to be following the same no-exam principle, the challenge would be to ensure that the parameters for evaluating students remain uniform. What happened last year — the lack of a level playing field — needs to be avoided.Basu said without a home assignment, class X and XII candidates would not be graded rationally. “In 2020, the deluge of marks had created a problem for college admission. A large of number of students scored over 90% but could not get a seat in their desired college,” said a college principal. Among the proposals on evaluation, the six-member expert committee had suggested home assignment or an open-book exam, the answer scripts for which could be posted to schools. For Class XII, the committee had proposed to draft integrated question paper or a set of smaller papers to be sent to students’ homes. But the council said it would not be possible to send the papers to 12.5 lakh students’ homes. “In case of Madhyamik, the board is going to prepare mark sheets on the scores of their last summative test, which was their Class IX annual exams. Though chief minister Mamata Banerjee instructed to award 70% weightage to the students’ performance in Class X, how can it be done? They attended classes only in February and March, when no test was held,” said a teacher. “No selection test was held. The only assessment available are practical and project marks for classes X and XII.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/teachers-want-open-book-tests-at-home-to-mark-hs-candidates/articleshow/83350879.cms||Somdatta Basu
---||Agra||TOI talks to kin of those dead in Agra hospital where oxygen was ‘cut off’ as ‘mock drill’||AGRA: Everything about the death of head constable Ashok Kumar Singh's wife had been inexplicable. She was admitted to the general ward of Shri Paras Hospital in Agra with Covid-19 symptoms. She needed oxygen but was not critical when he last saw her. Hours later, he was told she had died. It was not until he saw the viral video of the hospital owner’s “experiment” to “cut off oxygen supply” which may have killed 22, that he understood what had transpired. The district has ordered a probe, the hospital has been sealed but officials haven’t said how many died that day. So, TOI went over obituaries around the time this happened, April 26, and identified six families who lost their loved ones to the “mock drill”. “I was there. The oxygen supply from the general ward was diverted to the VIP rooms and the ICU. There were reserve oxygen cylinders in the basement. But caretakers of patients in the general ward were asked to take their patient away or get oxygen cylinders,” Singh told TOI. “They gave no reason for my wife’s death and handed me a bill of Rs 80,000 for a day’s hospitalisation. They ruined my life.” Retired revenue department official Nathi Lal Tyagi, too, lost his wife that day. “She had been admitted on April 15. On April 26, the hospital asked us to get oxygen cylinders or take the patient away. I managed to get one in the morning but the hospital demanded another. While we were trying to get that, my wife passed away,” he said. “They had stopped oxygen supply for general patients. The reserves were for VIPs.” Like Singh, Puneet Verma was not given any reason for his aunt’s death. “My aunt (62) was talking to us and eating till April 25, when she was moved to the Covid ward. She didn’t have severe symptoms. The following evening, a hospital official told me she died but didn’t say how,” he said. A fourth "victim of circumstances", Vishal Sharma, added, “The hospital shut down CCTV cameras of the Covid ward on April 26. In the evening, two hospital staffers told me my mother (68) had died.” None of the families TOI spoke to had received death certificates at the time of filing the report. At least three families have filed police complaints against the hospital at the New Agra police station after the TOI report on the deaths. “I have filed a complaint against the hospital owner … My brother-in-law was admitted on April 19 and died on April 26,” said Raju Yadav. Another complainant, Ashok Chawla, said, “I lost my father that day … It is shocking to see the hospital owner narrating his inhuman act. It is murder.” In the video where the hospital owner talks about this, he speaks of 22 people who “would not survive”. Jain had told TOI that his statements in the video had been “misconstrued” and that four patients had died that day. Of the families TOI spoke to, Raju said he had seen 20-odd bodies that day, Puneet said he had seen 12 more bodies and Vishal six. Agra chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey said a team has been set up to investigate the deaths and “suitable action will be taken on the basis of its report,” but added, “No patient died of oxygen scarcity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/toi-talks-to-kin-of-those-dead-in-agra-hosp-where-oxygen-was-cut-off-as-mock-drill/articleshow/83348183.cms||Deepak Lavania

Interstate travellers instead of heading home directly are preferring paid isolation to ensure the safety of the family members. This has increased the demand for hotels that allocated a portion of their rooms for quarantining. The hotels have also tied up with city doctors to offer teleconsultation for guests and provide post-Covid care including body vitals monitoring. Senior citizens who have pregnant women and family members with comorbidities were among the most to utilise the paid facility. Apart from providing food and refreshments in the room, along with television and Wi-Fi, the hotels shall alert the doctors if the guest develops any complications during the stay. “To monitor symptoms travellers returning from other states and vulnerable districts, we are suggesting to people who can afford it. They may spread the infection to family members if they visit their homes directly,” said Dr A Mohamed Hakkim, emergency physician. Hotels have earmarked an entire floor for post-Covid care and the room service staff have been vaccinated and provided with PPE kits. “We are allowing people to use our rooms only if they have a suggestion letter from doctors. The demand for rooms is gradually increasing in recent days but we are allowing only recovered persons to stay,” said Mahesh Dilieep, general manager, Plazza hotels. Hoteliers say they are offering rooms for single occupancy for a period of one to two weeks based on the doctor’s advice. With the tourism sector completely hit, they said they managing post-Covid care service to stay afloat. Although the need for paid isolation is high, only a few hotels offer the service. Recovered patients have pitched for even budget hotels to offer the service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/demand-for-hotel-quarantine-up-in-trichy/articleshow/83334764.cms||Deepak Karthik

This is the highest bid for a single plot that AMC has been able garner in an e-auction. Senior AMC officials said that a developer firm Shresht Infrastructure group, had bagged the deal. Earlier on May 7, a nearby plot admeasuring 3,569 square metres was sold to a developer group for Rs 77.04 crore. As per an AMC press release, Shreshth had bid Rs 1.88 lakh per square metre for the Bodakdev plot and paid Rs 24.18 lakh more than the base price set by the AMC for the entire plot. “There were two bidders for the plot,” says the senior AMC estate department official. “These are commercial plots for sale. In fact there are 13 more plots which will be auctioned on July 1,” says the senior AMC official. “In these pandemic times when we have to raise money for infrastructure such strategic sales are vital. We have been successful in auctioning two of the 16 plots and we are hopeful that the 13 others will find takers,” says a senior AMC estate department official. Last year on February 7, the AMC had aimed to raise more than Rs 700 crore through the e-auctioning of five plots in the city. But it could manage to raise just Rs 306 crore back then. “In the February auction last year we auctioned off two plots, one on Sola Road and another in Nikol. The Sola Road plot was sold to Avenue Supermarkets, of Thane, which operates the D-Mart brand,” says a senior AMC estate department official. Avenue supermarkets had bid Rs 64.69 crore or Rs 1.08 lakh per sq m, against the base price of Rs 51.37 crore or Rs 86,000 per sq m. The plot in Nikol was auctioned to A V Builders for Rs 28.23 crore or Rs 77,700 per sq m, against the base price of Rs 20.75 crore or Rs 57,120 per sq m. Two plots went unsold at e-auctions on Friday. A 13,222 sq m plot off the posh Sindhu Bhavan Road — where commercial plots have sold for prices between Rs 1.7 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh per sq m last year — did not get any bids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amcs-bodakdev-plot-auctioned-for-rs-151-cr/articleshow/83351127.cms||---

A city that never sleeps||NEW DELHI: Delhiites often complain about the lack of well-maintained and safe public spaces, blaming the poor planning and unplanned growth in the city for this. By introducing concepts like 24-hour city, night-time economy and city-level public space circuits, the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 lays down a vision for improving existing public spaces and developing new ones. If things go as per MPD41, Delhi will have nightlife circuits to encourage a night-time economy with improved safety, reduced congestion through the staggering of activities and utilisation of spaces for different activities. Streets with a high concentration of heritage areas and the central business districts will be prioritised for these circuits, which will be identified by the local bodies and Delhi government’s tourism department. These areas will be permitted extended timings for hotels, restaurants, socio-cultural activities and entertainment and they will have access to special Delhi Metro connectivity and bus services. Besides improved public transport connectivity, civic agencies will also ensure adequate illumination and security in such areas while collaborations with artists, cultural groups, youth groups, market and vendors’ associations and weekly markets will firmed to organise cultural festivals and themed night walks, according to the the draft MPD41, which pushes the concept of a ’24-hour city’. Delhi will also create city-level public spaces and circuits in the form of public waterfronts along the Yamuna river and other waterbodies, urban woodlands in forest areas, transit hotspots like airports and cultural hotspots like the Central Vista, India Gate lawns, Hauz Khas complex and the Lodhi Colony art precinct. During the plan implementation period, reclamation of sites such as quarries, landfills and ash dykes will be carried out to develop parks and natural habitats that will serve as interactive zones for Delhi’s citizens. The draft plan also proposes creation of city-level circuits as public space networks by creating green corridors, heritage and cultural circuits and festival circuits. The improvement of infrastructure, public facilities will be carried out in these corridors. Seven such potential circuits have been proposed in the plan and these are Coronation Park-Shahjahanabad circuit, Red Fort-Humayun's Tomb, Safdarjung Tomb-Mehrauli, Tughlaqabad-Jahanpanah-Mehrauli, among others. The policy document also talks about encouraging local street-level public plazas by recession of plotlines and use of street corners for spillover commercial and social use. Three types of plazas will be encouraged in the city as standalone plazas, corner plazas and mid-street plazas by recessing plot lines or building edges along a street. The MPD41 document states that floor area ratio used for this purpose will be compensated for in the rest of the plot area. “The plazas will be planned as part of all transit station projects,” the plan specifies. The draft MPD41 also promotes privately-owned public spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-the-works-a-city-that-never-sleeps/articleshow/83382148.cms||Paras Singh

The court was told as on June 7 there were 6,287 mucormycosis cases in Maharashtra. Advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that globally the number varies from 0.005 to 1.7 per million population and it is 80 times higher in India. “India is the second most populous country and we also have a large number of diabetic patients. So we have more cases,” he said. When the judges quizzed about the protocol to identify and treat patients, the AG said the Centre has issued guidelines. “These are measures to let people know that if you take precautions, there is less chance of infection,” the CJ remarked. Advocate Atharva Dandekar said mucormycosis prognosis is quick and patients have no warning. “It spreads to the eye and within weeks to the brain. There is a need for early detection,” he said, adding there must be a campaign on automated calls, voicemails and billboards. The judges agreed with him. “You (the state) need to tell people how to avoid this disease. The dos and don’ts have to be scrupulously followed,’’ said the CJ, pointing out (from the Centre’s guidelines) that “toothache is also one of the symptoms”. The judges also enquired about Covid-19 prevention measures in children in view of an expected third wave. “Going by the old saying ‘prevention is better than cure’, you have to find out. We have to tell parents so that their children should not do a particular thing or go to places where they can get infected,” the CJ said. Earlier, the AG said, the state expected to get the first batch of 40,000 vials of amphotericin- B for mucormycosis from Haffkine on June 10. The judges batted for “equitable allocation” of amphotericin-B, saying “on an average, one-fourth of the total production should come to Maharashtra where the situation is more severe”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-state-have-you-made-people-aware-of-prevention-of-black-fungus/articleshow/83348234.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Ahmedabad||Oxygen shortage in Gujarat: April was the cruellest month||AHMEDABAD: The second Covid wave, intensified by the dominant double mutant Covid Delta virus, had driven the Gujarat government to the edge. Data has revealed that in 27 days of April, beginning April 1, Gujarat’s medical oxygen consumption for Covid patients had shot up from 115 MT/day to 1,179 MT/day. The state had provisioned for a maximum of 1,270 MT/day. It was a period gusting with anxiety for the oxygen task force that consisted of officials from the state health department, Food and Drugs Control Administration, Gujarat Pollution Control Board, and the urban local bodies. “The double mutant virus was detected on February 2 in Gujarat,” said a senior health department official. “If cases peaked across Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, and Rajkot simultaneously or with a difference of a day or two, there was no way we could have prevented crises at hospitals.” The official added: “That was our greatest worry.” When severe cases of Covid had peaked in Ahmedabad between May 3 and May 6, oxygen demand rose to 253 MT/day. In Surat, the number of patients requiring oxygen had peaked between April 19 and April 23. In Vadodara, severe cases had peaked between April 29 and May 4. In Rajkot, the number of patients requiring oxygen beds had been rising between April 25 and May 4. The official said that during the three peaks in 2020, oxygen demand in the state had consistently hovered between 214 MT/day and 244 MT/day. But after the new Covid double mutant virus struck Gujarat on February 2, the demand surged from a low of 80 MT/day on February 2 to 1,179 MT/day on April 27. This clearly indicated that the double mutant had made a significant number of patients gasp for breath. Gujarat’s total readiness for oxygen was 1,100 MT/day on April 25. “Many oxygen refillers were working overtime in the state which helped in the logistics greatly as different cities peaked at different times,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/oxygen-shortage-april-was-the-cruellest-month/articleshow/83352731.cms||Paul John

Apart from the non-refundable upfront payment, Ocugen will also make a milestone payment of $10 million to Bharat Biotech within 30 days of the first commercial sale of Covaxin in Canada, Ocugen said in a regulatory filing to the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). Earlier this month, Bharat Biotech and Ocugen had announced that they had amended the exclusive agreement inked earlier for the US market to include the Canadian market as well. Just like the deal for the US market, apart from the upfront payment and milestone payment upon first commercial sale, Ocugen would be retaining 45% of the profits from Covaxin sales in Canada, while Bharat Biotech would get 55% share of the profits. “As we work towards the submission of the emergency use application in the US, we will simultaneously seek authorisation under interim order for emergency use in Canada. We believe Covaxin has the potential to play a key role in saving lives from Covid-19 in the US and Canada, as well as across the globe, due to the strong immune response it generates against multiple antigens,” Dr Shankar Musunuri, chairman of the board, CEO and co-founder, Ocugen, had said while announcing the amended deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ocugen-pays-15m-to-bb-for-canada-rights-of-vax/articleshow/83352714.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

It had initially said only three cases could be confirmed. The teachers’ union had given a list of 1.621 teachers including shiksha mitras and contractual teachers to the state government claiming that they all died because of rural election work. Apart from the 1,248 teachers, BSAs (basic siksha adhikaris) have included six block education officers, 47 class IV employees, 172 shiksha mitras/contractual teachers and one class one officer "who contracted Covid during election duty". The list also names 812 employees under the non-Covid category who died during this period but the reason could not be ascertained as they had possibly either not got their Covid tests done or were unable to for some reason. Meanwhile, the teachers’ union leaders said they would continue their fight for every teacher left out by the government as many had died during treatment at home and didn’t have Covid-positive certificates. DGSE Vijay Kiran Anand told TOI, “We have received names of the employees from all the districts and this is the final list. It includes names of people who died of Covid after verification. There are 812 employees who died due to other reasons. The list has been submitted to the additional chief secretary (basic education) of the state. The final decision on compensation will be taken by the state. As per the guidelines, we have also provided jobs to the kin of 254 employees. The status of 2,032 is still pending.” Prathmik Shikshak Sangh president Dinesh Chandra Sharma said, “From three, they are now claiming 1,248 teachers have died. Still, there is no clarity on the 812 others. Our fight is to ensure that compensation is provided to everyone who performed panchayat election duty whether he or she tested positive for Covid or not. We know that testing was not possible when Covid was at its peak and government reports were coming after a long delay. In rural areas, the testing facility was not good and several teachers died after developing fever.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/edu-dept-revises-figure-from-3-teachers-dead-to-1248-due-to-civid-during-up-rural-poll-duty/articleshow/83348276.cms||---

The deaths also spurred S Anand, SSP of Shahjahanpur, to launch a helpline number, 7839872922, in the district to enable the public to immediately report if they are harassed by a moneylender. Akhilesh Gupta (42), a wholesale supplier of medicines, his wife and two minor children were found hanging inside their house on Monday. In a suicide note, Gupta had held Avinash Vajpai alias Akash, a money lender, responsible for this extreme step. Vajpai was arrested from Allahaganj area in Shahjahanpur's border while he was trying to flee to a neighbouring district. He was booked under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide) by police. Giving details, SSP Anand told TOI that Gupta was a resident of Faridpur area of Bareilly district and had settled in Shahjahanpur to expand his business. He moved into his own house from a rented one and was settling down when he met Vajpai, the money lender. He said, “Vajpai had helped Gupta in getting an undisclosed amount of money on interest. Akhilesh failed to return the money and Vajpai forced him to transfer the ownership of his house. Gupta was living in his own house as a tenant and recently, Vajpai sent a legal notice to him to vacate the house. Gupta was quite tense after getting the eviction notice and that probably made him kill himself and his family. We have sent Vajpai to jail for abetment of suicide.” The SSP said the autopsy of the bodies confirmed death by hanging. “We didn’t find any evidence of foul play. We will submit an investigation report before the court soon,” said SSP Anand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/moneylender-arrested-in-trader-family-suicide-case/articleshow/83348245.cms||---

Speaking to reporters after submitting a petition to collector S Nagarajan in the city on Tuesday, former minister and Thondamuthur MLA SP Velumani said, “We allowed everyone including opposition parties to do public work when we were in power.” “But now, when our party MLAs do public work, police officials are causing hindrances to it. DMK is instigating it,” he added. The petition, signed by 10 MLAs said, “DMK cadres have upper hands in the distribution of tokens at ration shops and vaccination camps. People who were waiting to get inoculated had arguments with DMK cadres at Kavundampalayam, Saravanampatti, Peelamedu, Singanallur and Podhanur. But even for these instances, police have filed fake cases against AIADMK cadres. The district administration and police department should take steps to prevent such instances in future.” Alleging that disinfection works are not carried out properly in the district despite several complaints, he said the district administration should intensify the containment measures and take necessary precautionary measures before the third wave. The MLAs handed over 25 oxygen concentrators to the district collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/aiadmk-mlas-petition-against-cops-dmk-cadres/articleshow/83350954.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Annulment of Devasthanam Board not on cards: Tourism minister||DEHRADUN: Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj on Tuesday said that there will be no review or revision of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board decision, much to the dismay of Char Dham priests, who have been demanding annulment of the board since it was created in 2019, saying it takes away the centuries-old right of the priests to manage the shrines. Priests at Gangotri and Yamunotri shrines held protests against the statement, with effigies of the minister being burnt in Gangotri town and Kharsali village. Maharaj also dismissed rumours of the Char Dham yatra starting for pilgrims from June 15, saying, “It is not possible in the present scenario.” When contacted, Maharaj told TOI, “Till now, we have not received any direction from the chief minister about any review or reconsideration of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act. We will follow whatever the CM tells us. However, I can assure that at present, we are neither reviewing nor reconsidering the Devasthanam Board decision. Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath will continue to function under the ambit of the board.” Rajesh Semwal, joint secretary of Gangotri temple committee, said, “After taking charge, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had promised to reconsider the Devasthanam Board decision. But now the tourism minister is denying this. It is a pity that a senior minister, who is also involved in religious activities, has no respect for the sentiments of the priest community. The time has come for the government to clear its stand on the annulment of the Devasthanam Board – will they do it or not? We will vote accordingly in the upcoming assembly elections.” Purushottam Uniyal, a priest at Yamunotri, said, “The priests’ community will be forced to intensify the protest if the government does not fulfill this long-awaited demand of abolishing the Devasthanam board.” About the Char Dham yatra being opened for pilgrims, the minister said, “I have said that we will start the yatra after the lockdown is over and after we review the situation. We had received the suggestion that the yatra may be opened for fully vaccinated pilgrims but fully vaccinated people can still be carriers. This time, Covid-19 cases are being reported even from the villages in hill districts, so we cannot take any chances. We will resume the yatra only when it is safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/annulment-of-devasthanam-board-not-on-cards-tourism-minister/articleshow/83348274.cms||Kautilya Singh

The health department had paid more than Rs 100 crore for the vaccines for procuring 30,57,720 lakh doses, but received 17,87,720 doses of vaccines worth Rs 60 crore so far. “Vaccines worth Rs 40 crore was yet to be supplied to the state. We are expecting the supply on June 9. After receiving, we will restart vaccinations for the 18+ category that will continue till June 21, till the Centre takes over the drive,” said Sharma. From June 21, the state government has demanded time-bound supply of the vaccines from the Centre. “We hope the Centre will supply the vaccines in a time-bound manner as we have sufficient storage capacity,” said the minister. For the 45-plus age group, the Centre has supplied 1.83 crore doses till date, out of which 2.15 lakh have been provided to the army while 1.79 crore doses have been distributed to the districts of which 1.56 crore doses have been administered in the form of first dose and second dose to beneficiaries till date across the state. Sharma said from May 1, the state government was assigned the job to vaccinate above 18 to 44-year age category, for which the state government has paid money in advance. “We have received the doses from Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech but still one lot of vaccines was yet to reach the state,”said Sharma. On the decision of the Centre providing free vaccines to the above 18+ category, Sharma said vaccination was the responsibility of the Centre. Several states had knocked on the doors of Supreme Court on the issue. “The Supreme Court has asked a serious question to the Centre about the vaccination. Amid mounting pressure from across the country, the Centre finally decided to take the responsibility of free universal vaccination,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-vax-drive-for-18-group-likely-to-resume-from-today/articleshow/83352716.cms||---

Tension between the Pilot and Ashok Gehlot camps began simmering since then. Though the Gudamalani MLA from Barmer district had not cited any reason for his resignation from the assembly, political observers say the marginalising of those loyal to the Pilot faction could have been the possible reason. The assembly Speaker had issued notice to the MLA to be personally present and explain the reasons before accepting his resignation. Recently, Pilot had reportedly expressed his disappointment over the failure of the party high command to deliver on the promises which ended the stalemate following which 18 of his MLAs staged a rebellion against chief minister Gehlot. The Congress high command formed a committee under the new AICC general secretary in charge of the state Ajay Maken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rift-in-rajasthan-congress-as-pilot-faction-says-it-is-yet-to-get-its-due/articleshow/83356833.cms||---

She thanked the Congress government for making her the officiating mayor. However, Dhabai mentioned that she will work closely with the BJP. On the other hand, just two BJP MLAs from Jaipur, Narpat Singh Rajvi and Satish Poonia, reached BJP office to protest against the suspension of Somya Gurjar as JMC- Greater mayor, on Tuesday. This has indicated that the BJP is internally divided with most MLAs not supporting Gurjar. Even, Rajvi reached office when BJP members were leaving for the Governor’s office at 12.30pm. Thanking Congress and BJP both, to support her after giving her the opportunity of becoming a mayor, Dhabai said she will work with BJP and will remain loyal to the party. Meanwhile, state BJP president Satish Poonia termed the suspension of Gurjar as injustice and said that the entire party was working together to fight for her. “We are united as a party and will take this fight further,” said Poonia. Supporting the narrative of Poonia, Rajvi said that state government has set a bad precedent by targeting a mayor. He said, “This is sheer injustice of suspending a mayor. Never in the history of urban local bodies has this occur. Congress government has opened gates for other government’s in future to do the same.” Other MLAs, however, gave excuses of not being present in the city. Ashok Lahoty in one line said that he was out of Jaipur on Tuesday. “On Monday, we burnt the effigy of Congress party. I had informed the party officials of not being in town, but I support the protest,” said Lahoty. Whereas Kalicharan Saraf immediately hung up the phone after stating that he was busy with some personal work. Sources in the corporation said that MLAs in the city are not happy with the working of Gurjar. “She doesn’t listen to their advice and there have been complaints of her becoming more arrogant. Even Poonia, is not happy with her work but being the BJP state head have to be present at the event,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-a-divided-house-over-support-for-somya-gurjar/articleshow/83352758.cms||---

The corporation has set up five control rooms –at the main and zonal offices - to attend to the inquiries on the lockdown and pandemic, and two consultation rooms to provide tele-counselling to the patients, the minister said. “Officials have collected Rs8.71 lakh as penalty from the people violating the lockdown norms.” When asked about the vaccine shortage, Nehru said they had distributed all the doses in stock and another round supply was expected to reach the state in a week. “The vaccination drive will resume once the state receives its share of vaccine.” The minister has also instructed the corporation officials to speed up works on the multi-level car parking, construction of bus stand, drinking water and underground drainage projects. Meanwhile, revenue department officials sealed an export apparel company on Angeripalayam Road near Chettipalayam in Tirupur on the day for violation of the lockdown restrictions. “The state government has allowed the export units to function only with 10% workforce. The unit was with 81 of the 250 employees,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/infection-rate-down-to-8-from-54-in-tirupur-says-min/articleshow/83351041.cms||---

The app, “Power Bank”, which was available on Google Play store until May 12, got people to invest money using several lucrative schemes. A team of STF arrested Pawan Kumar Pandey from Noida, sector 99. He is one of the directors in a shell company used by primary investors —believed to be from China — for siphoning off people’s monehy to foreign countries through cryptocurrency. “The preliminary investigation has revealed that this fraud is worth over Rs 250 crore. Portions of the money deposited in different schemes through Power Bank application was routed to foreign countries through cryptocurrency,” said Ajay Singh, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) STF. The gang used Indian registered companies as shell companies for money laundering. The technical analysis found that the entire amount was being sent to different bank accounts through different payment gateways. STF also recovered 19 laptops, five mobile phones and 592 SIM cards from the possession of Pawan Kumar Pandey.  Seeing as the crime involves foreign suspects, Uttarakhand Police has also sought help from Intelligence Bureau and Enforcement Directorate in the investigation, according to Abhinav Kumar, additional director general (ADG) of Uttarakhand Police. “The investigation in the matter was started after we received a series of complaints of fraud against the Power Bank application. During an investigation that went for more than 15 days, we found out the sheer scale of the scam,” said Singh. In all, Uttarakhand Police had received 20 complaints, including two filed with the cyber police station in Dehradun. A case was also registered under section 420 (cheating) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 66(c) and 66(d) of IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cyber-fraud-worth-rs-250-cr-busted-by-uttarakhand-stf-kingpin-arrested-from-noida-role-of-foreign-criminals-suspected/articleshow/83348328.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Coastal Projects directors Garapati Harihara Rao, Sridhar Chandrasekharan Nivarthi and Sharad Kumar along with its chairman Sabbineni Surendra were named accused by CBI for defrauding banks to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore. In fact, the judge had on April 27 asked them to surrender before the CBI court within 15 days. Though Surendra appeared before the trial court, furnished sureties, and obtained anticipatory bail from the trial court, the three directors could not do so. Their counsel Vikram Poosarla informed the court that they could not surrender before the trial court and obtain anticipatory bail as was directed by the high court on account of the ongoing lockdown. Extending the time limit for two more weeks, the judge said: “You must surrender before the CBI court by June 21”. They were asked to furnish personal bonds and two sureties worth Rs 5 lakh each. CBI suspects diversion of funds by the CMD and directors in this case. The aggrieved banks have already dragged the company to NCLT and were in the process of getting it liquidated.

---||Delhi||Delhi: No extra space, rejig of existing resources to clear parking maze||NEW DELHI: The draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 emphasises rationalising parking in the city. Unlike MPD 21, which stressed on creating more parking spaces, including multi-level parking lots, the draft for 2041 suggests maximising the utility of existing parking spaces through reorganisation of the facilities, using concepts like rating/indexing areas on the basis of public transport accessibility level and regulating on-street parking. MPD 41 also strongly supports congestion pricing, variable parking rates and staggered peak hours for different uses to manage parking demand and to increase parking revenue. The draft plan has received mixed reaction from experts. While some defined the suggestions as “progressive”, others pointed out how there were no provisions for incentivising parking projects and increasing floor area ratio, without which problems were certain to arise in the future. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, appreciated the effort of Delhi Development Authority to rationalise parking supply and promote the users pay principle. “The draft plan is dynamic and based on the public transport accessibility of a locality rather than have a uniform plan for the whole city as in the earlier MPD,” said Chowdhury. “The Public Transport Accessibility Index (PTAI) concept rates/indexes neighbourhoods on the basis of access to public transport. This concept has also been related to the transit-oriented development (TOD) policy. We also welcome DDA’s Parking Area Management Policy.” Chowdhury was also part of the PAMP project. She added, “To reduce street parking, the emphasis is on using multilevel/ stack parking lots to full capacity. The draft MPD also talks about development of PAMP by RWAs in residential areas.” Talking of PAMP in Lajpat Nagar III, among the first residential areas in the city where the concept was implemented in 2019, the residents’ welfare association’s president, S B Singh, said, “It’s difficult to implement such plans fully because people are reluctant to park their vehicles far from their homes. But yes, even if 50% of the plan is implemented, residents benefit in the long term.” Some civic officials, however, felt the draft MPD offered nothing new in terms of increased parking space in Delhi. “It only talks about discouraging use of private vehicles and regulating existing parking spaces through the PTAI scheme, which is a hypothetical situation,” said one official. “The plan does not even lay down the steps to be taken in case of violation of norms. The draft MPD also suggests linking registration of new vehicles to availability of owner parking facilities in order to regulate street parking. But who is going to physically check the availability of parking space at the applicant’s same site or that it is not being used by some other person already?” Another civic official said, “Demand for parking can’t be saturated overnight. In MPD 21, at least 24 sites were specified for developing multi-level parking lots, but not even 10 have been constructed due to objections. The draft MPD 41 doesn’t permit use of parks or vacant sites for developing new parking lots or encourages investment through relaxation in floor area ratio.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-extra-space-rejig-of-existing-resources-to-clear-parking-maze/articleshow/83382178.cms||Vibha Sharma

We were requesting for this to commissioner but he termed it to be abusive language. How is this said to be abusive language,” said Gurjar. She claimed to have full support of MLAs. Reacting on the appointment of Sheel Dabhai as the officiating mayor, Gurjar said Congress government was aware that decision of appointing their own councillor will backfire on them. Hence, they chose to play safe. When asked, does she expect Dhabai to vacate the position if she gets a clean chit from court, Gurjar responds, “This is a democratic set up.

Though police’s efforts remained hidden, a gruesome video of one of the two youngsters, 18-year-old Kalpesh Raba, holding the knife stuck to his stomach had gone viral on social media triggering fear among citizens. Raba’s close friend, Kunal Waghmare, too was attacked with knife in the same incident. He had a knife stuck on his back. While Waghmare rushed to Mayo hospital with knife on his back from the ground near Mhada colony where the two were attacked, Raba landed at the Kapil Nagar police station where his video was filmed. From Kapil Nagar police station Raba was taken to Mayo hospital in a cops’ van which was summoned from patrolling duty. Senior inspector Amol Deshmukh, who was having weekly off, reached Mayo hospital at 11.30pm followed by Zonal DCP Neelotpal and ACP Roshan Pandit. “The doctors at the casualty were just providing some initial treatment but the youngsters needed surgery to relieve them of the knives stuck into their body. No surgeon was available. We, including DCP (Neelotpal), requested the chief medical officer (CMO) to summon a surgeon at the earliest,” said Deshmukh. “We also had offered to shift the youngsters to some other hospital to save their life but the doctors assured they would do their best. Senior officers had to relentlessly pursue with senior doctors of the Mayo including the dean,” he said. City police chief Amitesh Kumar too was being kept informed about the developments at the hospital. Deshmukh said that police ensured the pre-surgery examinations like getting CT Scan, X- Ray and sonography were done while the preparation for conducting the surgeries were being made. “We deputed two constables with each youngster to ensure the technicians were conducting the process speedily,” said Deshmukh. “Meanwhile, police had to co-ordinate with the victims’ friends and family members to arrange for medicines. Some family members had to be also counselled as they were crying inconsolably,” he said. Deshmukh said Waghmare was taken for surgery first as his wound was deeper. “Police waited outside the operation theatre till both boys were operated upon and their knives had been safely taken out,” said the senior inspector adding another team at the police station registered the FIR and began rounding up the goons who had stabbed them. In all, almost a dozen were taken into custody,” he said. “Police left the hospital only after the operations were done and the injured shifted to ICU,” said Deshmukh.

The company was on strike for four days during which more than 5,000 tonnes of garbage was lying on the roads. Only after a settlement with the state government did the company call off the strike. At present, 320 vehicles for garbage collection are going to the wards, but councillors said that this is also not enough. Rajat Bishnoi, councillor of ward 9 in JMC-Heritage said that only two out of four vehicles are coming to his ward. “Garbage collection is still not being done properly in my ward. I am getting complaints regularly from residents even after the strike has been called off and the company told us that it will take time to get back all the vehicles,” said Bishnoi. Lalita Jaiswal, councillor of ward 72, from JMC-Heritage said, “Just an hour back, I spoke to corporation officials regarding it. There are a few lanes in my ward where the vehicles are not going at all.” “There are areas where the vehicles haven’t visited in 20 days. We have to complain many times to get the work done. But still the vehicles only come in 15 days,” said Singh. Replying to the allegations, Om Prakash, manager at the garbage collection firm, said that these are baseless allegations. He said, “Any councillor who has any problem should come and complain. We will resolve their problem. Vehicles are going in every lane and after the strike was called off, we have cleared more than 2,800 tonnes of garbage from the city. We will look into the problem.” In many areas of Jhotwara and Sanganer, the situation is the same, with many places still waiting for the vehicles even after the strike is called off. Some councillors told TOI that only one vehicle is allotted to the ward where the requirement is for four.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/doorstep-waste-collection-yet-to-be-normal-in-the-city/articleshow/83352763.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid vaccination for 18-44 years starts in Delhi after 2-week pause||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Covid-19 vaccination centre at a government school in Lancer Road on Wednesday to monitor the vaccination campaign for people aged above 45, ‘Jahan Vote, Wahan Vaccination’. He encouraged people to visit their nearest polling booths, which have been converted into vaccination centres, for the jab. Meanwhile, the registration for free vaccination for the 18-44 age group has been started. AAP MLA Atishi said that after 15 days of vaccination for the 18-44 age group being on hold due to vaccination shortage, 1.25 lakh doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin had been supplied to Delhi. Kejriwal stated that the campaign was receiving a thunderous response and that the government was also arranging e-rickshaw for people to travel to vaccination centres. “In Delhi, there are about 57 lakh people above the age of 45 years. Around 30 lakh people are left to be vaccinated. But we were observing that not many people were turning up to the vaccination centres. We thought that we had to invite people from their homes and make them aware. This is a new initiative wherein you get vaccinated where you vote,” the CM said. He talked to some people at the vaccination centre and found them to be happy. Booth level officers are addressing apprehensions of people regarding vaccination. “Those who do not show up, the BLOs will go for a second round. Again, their apprehensions will be removed. BLOs will be going to the house of each and every person. If we had the vaccines for 18-44 years then they could have also been vaccinated the same way,” said Kejriwal. Kejriwal welcomed the Centre’s decision to provide vaccines to Delhi starting June 21. “If we get the vaccines, we will start vaccinating everyone under this scheme. We are very thankful to the Supreme Court, it was only after their pressure that it was questioned that why the people between 18-44 years were being charged, while it was free for the other and why the private hospitals were allowed to charge such exorbitant costs. But whatever happened was for the good of the country and I hope that the vaccination drive runs smoothly. If availability improves, I think the entire country can be vaccinated in 2-3 months,” Kejriwal stated. “For 45+ group, Delhi has received 30,000 doses of Covaxin. For 18-44, Delhi has Covaxin available for the second dose and eight days of Covishield. For 45+, we have two days of Covaxin and 27 days of Covishield available,” Atishi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vaccination-for-18-44-yrs-starts-after-2-week-pause/articleshow/83382187.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Jaipur||Former Rajasthan CM Vasundhara Raje missing from poster outside BJP headquarters||JAIPUR: Former CM Vasundhara Raje is missing from the new poster put outside the BJP state headquarters here giving further rise to speculations that power struggle continues in the brass of the saffron party in the state. Old banners had Raje along with BJP state president Satish Poonia, leader of opposition Gulabchand Kataria, deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore on one side while PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah on the other. The posters were replaced on April 6. BJP office bearers have downplayed the issue by saying the posters were changed since Karni Sena activists while protesting the comments of Kataria on Maharana Pratap in an election rally in Rajsamand in April had defaced his picture. “It was very embarrassing for a party to continue with the defaced poster,” said a BJP functionary while explaining the reason for the same. Sources told TOI that the poster was meant to be changed long ago but the pandemic and announcement of bypolls prevented the leadership to place new ones fearing controversy. “Timings in politics is very important. It would have caused unnecessary controversy had a photo of Raje was dropped during the polls. It is comparatively safer at the moment to change it as it is not clashing with any political event,” said a BJP leader who was aware of the development. Another poster has two images—Deendayal Upadhyay and SP Mukherjee, as a tribute to the party’s stalwarts, leaving no space for any additional poster. Raje’s two independent initiatives — a helpline on Twitter ‘Office of Vasundhara Raje’ helping people in need since April 2021 and ‘Vasundhara Jan Rasoi’ providing free food to the poor — have caught the eyeballs of the state and central leadership. “Both the initiatives are Raje centric at a time when the entire BJP was doing relief work as one unit is to remind of her popularity in the state,” said BJP leader. Around her initiatives, her loyalists continue to project her as a leader of the masses. On Tuesday, former minister in Raje’s government Rohitashva Sharma in Alwar said out of 10 people, nine see Raje as the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/former-cm-raje-missing-from-poster-outside-bjp-headquarters/articleshow/83352779.cms||---

The woman breathed her last at the SRN Hospital on Tuesday morning. Heavy police force was deployed on SRN Hospital campus to deal with any untoward incident. Meanwhile, a delegation of Residents Doctors' Association, MLN Medical College, Prayagraj on Tuesday afternoon handed over a memorandum to the inspector general of police (Prayagraj range) K P Singh demanding action against a group of people, including some leaders of a political party, for making abortive attempt to tarnish the image of doctors and SRN Hospital through social media regarding the charges levelled by the family of the girl recently. The IG assured the delegation to conduct a detailed probe into the incident. The delegation in its letter submitted to IG wrote that the patient hailing from Mirzapur was admitted to SRN hospital on May 29 following an ailment of the intestines. The doctors operated upon her in the night on May 31. Later, on June 2, a close relative of the patient alleged through social media that his cousin sister was gang raped while she was being taken for an operation of her intestines. Following the allegation, two separate committees were set up by MLN Medical College authorities and chief medical officer (CMO) Prayagraj separately and both the committees found the allegation baseless.The committees questioned all the doctors and medical staff present during the operation and found the allegations do not hold any ground.

---||Hyderabad||Restore Op Chabutra, police patrol in Old City, say residents||Hyderabad: With increasing number of youngsters defying the lockdown in the evening hours and venturing out on bikes and often engaging in brawls, residents of the Old City have requested the police to kickstart 'Operation Chabutra' again. The demand comes after a recent street-fight claimed a youth’s life in Old City. Mohammed Adnan, 18, a resident of Farhat Nagar, succumbed to his injuries at a hospital after he was beaten up by a group of youths on Sunday night. “My son had left home around 7:30 pm and later we were informed about his hospitalisation. I do not know why my son was beaten up and who are behind his killing. I request the police to do justice,” Adnan’s father told reporters. The south zone police had launched ‘Operation Chabutra’ to catch youngsters moving on the streets under suspicious circumstances late at night. Gajarao Bhupal, DCP, south zone, said that the victim was beaten up by a group of youngsters over a petty issue and that five accused, including two minors, have been arrested. Following the incident, senior citizens in Old City sought immediate police intervention and requested the police to patrol all areas. The residents told TOI that drug addicts are creating trouble in the localities. “The incident is very shocking and the menace of drugs must be checked," said a relative of the victim. "Unemployment is the biggest issue we are facing in Old City. Frustration among youth is growing and youngsters staying out late at night are creating many problems,” said Mohammed Haji Mastan, a resident of Khilwat, adding that the police must patrol the Old City areas, especially lanes, to curb such incidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/restore-op-chabutra-police-patrol-in-old-city-say-residents/articleshow/83351109.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Attribute deaths to Covid-19, not to other causes: EPS||Former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami urged the state government to attribute the death of Covid patients to coronavirus. In a statement issued on Tuesday, he alleged that death certificates of Covid patients are issued without mentioning the cause of death as Covid-19. “Instead, other causes are mentioned,” he said. This would render children who lost their parents to Covid ineligible to get compensation announced by state and central governments, he said. “There are complaints from across the state for the past few weeks that death certificates issued for people who died of coronavirus does not mention the cause of death as Covid-19,” he alleged. Children of the victims are denied government compensation because of this. “I would like to point out that the Supreme Court has directed the government to enumerate number of children who have lost their parents to Covid and submit a report,” he said. “Hence, I request the state government to mention the right cause of death in the death certificates of Covid patients who die in government and private hospitals,” EPS said adding that the government should also ensure that their children get the compensation. Besides, when the cause of death is not mentioned as Covid, the protocol mandated for cremation of bodies of Covid victims is not followed. The body is handed over to the relatives, which is taken to their houses for funeral rites where several people participate. Exactly a year ago, EPS was defending the state authorities when similar complaints of fudging of death data was levelled against him. “If anyone dies of Covid and if their details do not figure in the government list of Covid fatalities, their relatives would immediately approach the media and expose it,” he had said on June 11 last year in Salem. “Many people die of other health complications. We should not attribute those deaths to Covid,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/attribute-deaths-to-covid-19-not-to-other-causes-eps/articleshow/83351130.cms||---

The petition filed by her lawyer Asish Sharma said the government had not given sufficient opportunity to the mayor to explain on the complaint filed by the commissioner against her and other BJP councillors. Somya was suspended along with three BJP councillors on Sunday evening on charges of physical assault on commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh Deo. The suspended mayor said the director of local bodies issued a notice seeking her explanation by 3pm on June 5 but she received it only after 3pm. The request for more time to file the reply had been treated as her reply and no opportunity was given to her to explain what happened. Government action followed an inquiry by an RAS officer on a compliant by an IAS officer, which is not appropriate as the junior officer could not conduct a fair probe. The government had suspended her pending a judicial probe on the alleged complaint of manhandling the commissioner on June 6, but so far no probe has been ordered. The action of the government smacks of political vendetta, the mayor alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gurjar-moves-hc-over-suspension/articleshow/83352791.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Government job aspirants cheated, 5 held||AHMEDABAD: Gandhinagar police nabbed five persons, including a woman, for cheating Gujarat Gaun Sewa Pasandagi Mandal or Gujarat Subsidiary Service Selection Board (GSSSB) aspirants by posing as government officers and luring them with a government job. Interestingly, the woman Hetvi Patel — main accused of the case — was herself preparing for Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) and GSSSB exams. She had appeared in various such exams in the past, said officers of Infocity police. Fake ID of one of the accusedAn officer of Infocity police said that Patel along with her boyfriend Niraj Garasia and two others — Bansilal Patel and Kunal Mehta — lured at least 80 GPSC aspirants from December 2020 with jobs and duped them with lakhs of rupees. A police officer said that they got an input that Hetvi and three others stayed at a hotel in Sargasan village of Gandhinagar posing as government officers. Cops reached the hotel and found that Hetvi had introduced herself as deputy collector of Valsad and Garasia had mentioned himself as deputy revenue officer of Gujarat government in the hotel register. Two others, Mehta and Bansilal, had introduced themselves as peons of Shah and Garasia. Police called them outside their rooms and enquired about their designations, but they could not give any satisfactory answers and did not even provide their identity cards. A police officer said that Hetvi told them that she could make the cops talk with a secretary in the state government. But when the cops told them to make them talk with the government secretary, they started to fumble and later confessed that they were fake government officers. The cops said that they checked their rooms and found fake identity cards. Hetvi had two identity cards which includes a card showing her as deputy collector and another showing her as additional health commissioner. The accused told that they got those cards from a printing press owner Pranav Patel from Gandhinagar who was also caught by Infocity police in this case. An officer of Infocity police said that Hetvi was preparing for government exams and meanwhile she saw aspirants desperately giving money to agents to secure a job. While preparing for the exams, she decided to cheat other aspirants and earn money swiftly. In this conspiracy, she took help of her boyfriend who came with an idea of keeping two aides whom they introduced as peons so that Hetvi and her boyfriend looked like a class-1 officer. Police booked them under charges of cheating, forgery, impersonation and abetment and began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-job-aspirants-cheated-5-held/articleshow/83351167.cms||---

Despite the lifting of restrictions since June 1, there are still very few visitors who arrive at Sangam, leaving the boatmen community in a fix. President of Navik Sangh of Prayagraj district, Pappu Nishad, told TOI on Monday, “Although the district authorities have allowed plying of boats while ensuring adherence to Covid protocol since June 1, the boatmen community are still reeling under a financial crisis in the absence of visitors.” He added, “Due to the Covid scare, devotees from neighbouring states and southern states, who used to visit Sangam every year, are nowhere to be seen. The livelihoods of the boatmen of Prayagraj solely depended on them.” “The strength of Sangam visitors won’t rise until trains start running to religious spots like Prayagraj. Apart from being debt-ridden, the boatmen at Sangam might reach the verge of starvation if the situation remains the same,” said Nishad. Around 1,500 boats have permission to ply on Sangam, and at least two boatmen work on a single boat. As per the Covid protocol, only five people are allowed to sit on a single boat, and use of mask and sanitizer as well as following social distancing are mandatory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/in-absence-of-pilgrims-boatmen-of-sangam-reeling-under-financial-crisis/articleshow/83352807.cms||Kapil Dixit

---||Delhi||Chetan Kumar Cheetah fights back again, taken off ventilator after nine days||NEW DELHI: Chetan Kumar Cheetah, a CRPF commandant who sustained multiple bullet injuries in a gun battle with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017 and survived, has fought back again. The officer was put on ventilator support at AIIMS Jhajjar on May 30 after developing serious complication due to Covid-19. Then, the doctors said they were not too confident about the outcome, but, in a rare success, his condition has improved, and he has been weaned off the ventilator and put on high-flow oxygen. Dr Sushma Bhatnagar, chairperson of Covid services at National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jhajjar, Haryana, which is run by AIIMS, told TOI that the Kirti Chakra awardee officer was conscious, able to communicate and taking semi-solid food orally. “If he remains stable, our next step will be to provide counselling and focus on his nursing care so he can recover fully,” the doctor added. Cheetah was the commanding officer of CRPF’s 45th battalion in Kashmir Valley in February 2017, when he suffered multiple bullet injuries in the brain, right eye, abdomen, both arms, left hand and in the buttock region. The doctors at AIIMS Trauma Centre had performed multiple surgeries to save him then. They first stabilised him and then different teams operated separately — ophthalmologists took care of the wound in the left eye, but the right one couldn’t be repaired, orthopaedics worked on the fracture in the limbs, while critical care experts planned antibiotic therapy to prevent infection. He was discharged in April 2017, and in 2018 he was back on duty. “Only a few patients who require ventilator support after suffering from severe Covid-19 recover fully. It is the fighting spirit of Cheetah and the efforts of nurses and doctors that has made the recovery possible. If there is no serious complication, he may well be discharged soon,” said a doctor. Cheetah was rushed to AIIMS on May 9 with complaints of low oxygen saturation after testing Covid-positive. Initially, he was kept in the ICU on oxygen support. The doctors said his condition improved with anti-viral therapy, but there was a sudden deterioration necessitating ventilator support.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cheetah-fights-back-again-taken-off-ventilator-after-nine-days/articleshow/83382207.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Kochi||Ernakulam: 75 babies surrendered by mothers to child welfare committee in two years||KOCHI: The city is witnessing a shocking trend of a large number of unwed mothers, mostly educated and working, voluntarily surrendering or abandoning their babies with the child welfare committee (CWC), a quasi-judicial authority, to move on in their life. Ernakulam CWC has given shelter to 75 babies who were surrendered by their mothers between March 2019 and June 5, 2021. According to authorities, in 90% cases, mothers are inconsolable while surrendering their newborns, and the rest 10% are impassive. Changing social scenarios might be the reason for surrendering babies in large numbers by unwed mothers. “Any woman can come and surrender babies with us if they don’t want to take care of the child. We give unwed mothers shelter and medical help for delivery without leaking their identity. As Ernakulam is a commercial city, many come here and work. Even married women come here for work and some get into a relationship and get pregnant. Some give birth at their friend’s house and surrender the baby with us and go back,” said Ernakulam CWC chairperson Bitty KJoseph. It has also been noted that some unwed mothers come forward to reclaim their babies they surrendered or abandoned soon after giving birth.As per the judicial act, a mother can reclaim the baby within 60 days of surrendering or abandoning the baby with the CWC. If the mother wants to reclaim the baby after the 60 days of reconsideration period, she will have to approach the special court hearing children cases to get back the baby. “Many parents of unwed mothers approach us requesting to pressurize the woman not to reclaim the baby and give her counselling. If the mother is not an adult-,we take care of the child till she turns 18 years old. A young unwed mother had surrendered her baby with us. She was a minor and was in a relationship with a man. She approached us later demanding to return the baby. She turned 18 and currently lives in the house of her boyfriend, who is facing a Pocso case. Whenever she wants to see the child, we arrange video calls to help her to meet the baby,” said Bitty Joseph. CWC has taken a decision to return the child to her. In another case, a woman got into a relationship with a Kottayam native man and got pregnant and gave birth to a baby. The woman surrendered the baby with CWC before 2019. Later,the man and woman together approached the CWC to reclaim the baby and the committee asked them to provide details to prove that they are the biological parents of the child. While on the way to submit the documents with the committee, the couple met with an accident and the mother died. “Our committee had found the father and we made arrangements to undergo his DNA test, which showed he is the biological father of the child. We have also asked the father to submit some documents from the local body, which he did,” said Joseph. Covid restrictions are preventing young parents from getting their children back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/75-babies-surrendered-by-mothers-to-cwc-in-2-years/articleshow/83348458.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Delhi||Open book exams: DU to crack down as answers shared over message apps||New Delhi: A link sent by an anonymous sender to Delhi University’s dean of examination exposed the unfair means adopted by the students appearing for the ongoing online open book examinations. The university said action would be taken against the students and assured of stricter monitoring. Apparently, a group had been created on WhatsApp and Telegram in which the answers to the OBE questions were shared. Since June 7, the university has been conducting examinations for the final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students of its colleges, the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board and the School of Open Learning. A notice issued by dean D S Rawat on Tuesday said, “It has come to the notice of the examination branch that a WhatsApp/Telegram group has been created to take help for examination. Students are advised not to subscribe to any such groups. We have identified those students, and all these cases will come under unfair means and action will be taken as per university rules.” Elaborating, Rawat said, “There was a link forwarded to me by an anonymous person. It was a Telegram group and there were around 114 students who were part of it. Taking details from Delhi University Computer Centre (DUCC), we have found the details of these students and are looking into it to see if they are appearing for the exams.” After realising such a thing was taking place, Rawat sent an email to the examinations nodal officer of each college asking them to advise students not to join such groups. Rawat added, “When they learnt of the circular, some serious students started calling the principals and teachers about these groups. I have assured them that action will be taken against only those who are part of these groups. We are also setting up a system so that action can be taken against students indulging in this form of cheating.” One of the teachers revealed that this illegal method was used recently. The teachers claimed, “It has been happening since the last two exams. While evaluating the answers, I was surprised to see exactly the same answers in almost all the scripts from various colleges.” The unscrupulous effort has given many a chance to fire a broadside at the OBE. As one teacher said, “The dean’s notice is tacit acceptance by the DU administration that online OBE is a farce. It is impossible, especially with the kind of resources DU has, to curb such acts.” The closure forced by the Covid pandemic has forced DU to resort to online OBE, in which students are permitted to refer to textbooks while writing the answers online. Close to two lakh students are appearing for the OBE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/open-book-exams-du-to-crack-down-as-answers-shared-over-message-apps/articleshow/83351243.cms||Shradha Chettri

Though KCZMA had asked local bodies to reach out to citizens to study the map, it has not been possible for many as officials have been caught up with dealing with the Covid crisis in their panchayats. Kadamakudy development forum (KDF), Kothad, has sent a memorandum to KCZMA secretary seeking extension of the earlier deadline in May. “Stakeholder agencies, associations and registered nongovernmental organizations have been asked to respond in 15 days. While KCZMA is asking to give wide publicity, no effort has been made to do so. We have not been able to submit our remarks,” said Jerald M V of KDF, Kothad. The forum said that the district has Kochi corporation, six municipalities and 25 coastal panchayats affected by the CRZ notification. So there should be 32 local-level maps required for smooth implementation. The draft should be prepared in consultation with the local bodies. There is no word in the draft CZMP about integrated island management plan (IIMP) and without IIMP in CZMP, the whole public consultation process will be of no use. Pokkali Land is classified under CRZ IB as an ecological sensitive area. These areas should be completely exempted considering the same as agricultural lands (wetland). Similarly, in the inland small canals (thodu) maintained by local bodies to drain out rain water should be exempted from CRZ areas. CRZ IIIA and CRZ IIIB areas should be marked after the density of each panchayat. “Maradu falls under CRZII. But the CZMP draft shows that Maradu falls under backwater island category. But there is no definition in CRZ notification on how backwaters and backwaters islands are determined. Without a clear definition, KCZMA cannot fix Maradu under backwater island category,” said Ebenezer C, a resident of Cheranelloor. He said that the saltwater PPT measurements listed in the draft have no clarity and are very difficult for the common man to digest. “Our first demand is that the CZMP draft, which has been published in English, should be published in Malayalam,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ngos-islanders-seek-more-time-to-discuss-draft-czmp/articleshow/83348508.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

The number of active cases also fell by 8.5% to 26,751 on the day from 29,268 on Monday, with 4,917 patients getting discharged from various treatment centres. This had an impact on the recovery rate, which has improved to 85.3%. As per the available data, 1,64,710 of the 1.93 lakh positive cases have recovered in the district so far. The Covid-19 toll swelled to 1,576, with the state including 44 more fatalities that occurred in the district in the bulletin. Among the deceased were a 39-year-old man who died 18 days after hospitalization and a 29-year-old woman who died four days after admission to a private hospital. The remaining victims were aged between 40 and 90 years. Now that the lockdown has been relaxed, allowing wholesalers, meat, grocery and standalone shops to function till 5pm, people were seen crowding RG Street and Town Hall. “We have warned to close the shops down, if they don’t ensure social distancing among the customers and people are found milling around unnecessarily without following Covid-19 norms,” a health department official said. Officials have also begun cordoning off entire lanes in residential areas with more than three positive cases. A small lane at Nambialaganpalayam was cordoned off on Sunday after more than 20 people tested positive for the virus in the area. M A Siddiq, district monitoring officer, said, “We have decided to be more stringent with the containment measures in rural areas, which now account for 44% of the cases. The test positivity rate is also high in rural areas. So, we have decided to conduct more fever camps and door-to-door surveys there.” At 51, Karamadai has the most number of containment zones in rural areas, followed by Thudiyalur (43).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/active-cases-drop-by-8-in-a-day/articleshow/83351231.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||‘If Covid-19 persists, will start next session without exams’||Q. I am a third-year student and like me, many are worried about colleges not conducting exams. Students who want to pursue their masters are losing out on applying to the best universities because the deadlines are approaching. Can something be done about this? -- Anshu Jain A. As you are aware that due to the second wave of Covid-19 and keeping in mind the safety of students, colleges were closed on March 23. Further a lockdown was imposed May 12 onwards, which is being relaxed in a phased manner as cases are dropping. Though online teaching is going on, universities have not been able to conduct semester examinations. They are keeping a watch on the situation and based on the UGC guidelines and instructions of the Telangana government, the concerned universities will decide the examination schedule. The top priority is to conduct the final year examination to enable students to get admissions in higher education institutions. The universities are also ready with online examinations or other methods of evaluation, in case the situation warrants, as per the UGC guidelines. Q. After Covid-19 cases started to rise, degree exams were postponed in all the universities. When can we expect the degree exams to be held now? – Irfan Khan A. As I mentioned, universities have not been able to conduct the semester examinations. They are keeping a watch on the situation and based on UGC guidelines and instructions of the Telangana government, the concerned universities will decide the exam schedule. In case the situation does not improve quickly, for other than final year, the next academic session will start, and the examinations will be conducted later like it was done last year. Q. Now that class 12 CBSE exams have been cancelled and even the Telangana board of intermediate education is likely to follow suit, when can we expect degree admissions to commence? – Vemula Pallavi A. Based on the decision taken by the government of Telangana on conducting intermediate examinations in the state, the schedule of admission will be drawn out. In the last few years, the notification of Degree Online Services Telangana (DOST), which is the common admissions portal of Telangana for degree colleges, is given on the day the inter results are announced. We are likely to follow the same this year also. Q. Are there any plans to vaccinate students before we appear for the examinations, including entrance exams? – Vinod Rao A. Everybody above the age of 18, including students, are already eligible for vaccinations. In all government vaccination centres, the vaccine is provided free of cost. You can approach your nearest vaccination center after registering on CoWin and get yourself vaccinated. Q. Some engineering colleges are asking us to pay transportation and infrastructure fees despite us not using the facilities. Is there a grievance cell where students can submit an official complaint against such colleges while maintaining anonymity? – J Sairam A. Your question is very pertinent. The heads of technical institutions have an onerous responsibility of safeguarding the health and associated interests of all stakeholders of respective colleges /institutions. Due to the complaints from students/parents that some of the institutions are charging hostel/transport fees during Covid-19 pandemic whereas these facilities are not availed by the students, the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the national regulatory body for the technical institutions has already advised all AICTE-approved Institutions in the country to charge the fees commensurate with the facilities that they are providing during pandemic and not charge fees for those portions which are not accessible to students, failing which action will be taken as per the prevailing rules. The same has been communicated by the Commissioner of Technical Education, Telangana to all the institutions for compliance. In the circumstances, affected students can submit a complaint to the Student Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC) consisting of the principal, three senior faculty and student’s representative of the institution concerned. Further, a complaint/appeal may also be submitted to the Ombudsperson of the institution concerned. In case the matter is not resolved at the institution level, a representation may be given to the respective Commissioner of Technical Education, Telangana at the email commr-te@telangana.gov.in with proper particulars for enquiry and redressal of the grievance. Q. I am a final year commerce student looking to pursue an internship and subsequently get placed. However, I do not have any support from the college management. Is there any platform that can help students like me? – Vaibhav Yadagiri A. There are particularly good job openings for commerce students. Final year students can pursue internship for six months to one year and subsequently get placed in eCommerce companies, corporate hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and distributors, corporate colleges and chartered accountancy companies, manufacturing sector, automobile dealers, malls and shopping centers, banking sector, entertainment sector etc. In fact, almost every sector has a need for commerce graduates. In all these companies/organizations, commerce students are given practical exposure to billing software, auditing and preparation of relevant documents, IT returns and refund preparation, inventory/stock entry and record, fee master preparation and maintenance, employee salary and expenses documentation etc. The Telangana Academy of Skills and Knowledge (TASK) is providing internships to registered students of BCom through the platform of Internshala. At the national level, there is National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme under Skill India and you can get details and register on the website www.apprenticeshipindia.org. Industry bodies like CII and FICCI also assist commerce students with internships. Q. I'm looking forward to writing the POLYCET exam this year. A few days ago, I tried to enroll my name, but it was not taking it saying I require a hall ticket number. But because of this pandemic our exams have also been cancelled and we didn't get our hall tickets. So, what’s the alternative? -- Akshitha K A. I don’t think there is any issue with regard to students of Telangana SSC as hall tickets were already given (more than 60,000 students have already registered as of today). For CBSE and ICSC, students can obtain the roll number/hall ticket numbers from their schools and enter in the place hall ticket number of the POLYCET application. However, if there is any difficulty, students concerned can enter their Class roll no followed by date of birth in DDMMYYYY (Example: 4503072004 for 45 roll number with DOB: 03-07-2004). At the time of admission, students can update their hall ticket numbers/roll no from their final certificate of passing. Q. I have completed my second year in BIPC this year and want to pursue B Pharmacy. I don't know whether there is any kind of entrance test. Can you help? Also, is there any other medical-related field that I can look? -- Arshad Khan A. In order to seek admission into B Pharmacy, you need to appear for TSEAMCET (AM) - 2021 Entrance Examination. The last date to apply for the test through https://eamcet.tsche.ac.in is June 10, 2021, without late fee. You can also seek admission into bio-technology courses in engineering colleges and doctor of pharmacy (Pharm D) course, (six-year duration) with the rank secured in TSEAMCET. You can also pursue a nursing course or para medical courses available in various colleges. Another option for you can be admission in BSc courses with biotechnology, microbiology, applied nutrition or biochemistry combinations based on inter marks through DOST. Q. Online classes are taking a severe strain, particularly the eyesight, on children (below 18 years). This, especially with private centres conducting classes for six to seven hours. Can we not reduce the timings for their benefit? -- Ujwal Gangarapollu A. The pandemic situation requires unprecedented steps to overcome the situation. Due to the closure of colleges, it is imperative that teaching is conducted through online methods. There are already restrictions imposed for school students as to the number of hours of online teaching. However, such restrictions are not placed on higher education students as the theory workload, without practicals, is not more than four-five hours in the colleges. Q. What is the probable Telangana EAMCET date? Is Telangana going to introduce a BSC course in paramedical field like OT and anesthesia, cardiac technology etc.? -- Ubaid Ullah A. The TSEAMCET-2021 online entrance examination is scheduled from July 5 to July 6 for Agriculture & Medical (AM) ie BiPC and July 7 to July 9 for the engineering ie MPC stream. All change of dates (due to the Covid) situation will be made available on https://eamcet.tsche.ac.in and through the media. Candidates are advised to go through the website periodically. There are no plans to introduce new BSc courses in paramedical fields this year. Q. Is there any provision under which the Telangana government provides fee reimbursement to students from the state who are studying in other states? -- Mohd Usman A. As per the existing guidelines of the government of Telangana, the tuition fee reimbursement is applicable to candidates belonging to Telangana studying in institutions located in the state and also seeking admission in Andhra Pradesh engineering colleges through APEAMCET entrance examination under the unreserved quota under various categories. Further, there are overseas scholarships given by the government for studying in specified countries. .......................................

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad readers’ corner||My terrace is now a vegetable garden By Anubha Lavania We moved into our new house just before this pandemic started. By the time we could settle in with all the essential things and make sure that we were ready to fly with our dreams, the deadly coronavirus hit us. With no scope for socialising or travelling left, I decided to pick up gardening – something I had dreamt of indulging in, many times over, in the past. Since I come from Agra where, unfortunately, monkeys dominate and terrace is mostly inaccessible, the only vegetable I could ever grow the till last year was coriander! (If one can consider that a vegetable, that is). So, here I had to start from scratch. With all the information that I could access online, I started making notes about vegetables that could be grown -- their soil conditions, month in which they grow well, sunlight requirements etc . Finally, I took the plunge and started by ordering my first set of online seeds. The rest, as they say, is history. I am now able to feed my family tomatoes, brinjals, cluster beans, long beans, spinach, malabar spinach, amaranthus, mint, coriander, chillies, lettuce, beet root, gourd, basil, and even decorate my home with large varieties of flowers. My terrace is dedicated to this wide range of vegetables while the balconies have herbs and flowers blossoming. My day under the sun came when my sisters and friends – impressed with what I had managed to do -- picked up this hobby too. Now they call me for guidance. My latest achievement has been to have successfully harvested gourd-creepers, which I had been struggling with until lately. (The writer is a chartered account with an MNC) …......................... Time with family is most precious By Abhinesh Bhat The virus has taken away a lot. But it has also given me something that is very valuable – precious time to spend with family and discover myself. During the first wave, as classes went online, much of our syllabus was reduced. That left a science buff like me with a lot of time to read. It also allowed me to indulge in my hobbies like reading, writing stories and poems, playing the piano and drawing. With the help of my mother, I browsed through the internet to find websites that could help me develop my hobbies and sharpen my skills. I listened to stories for hours and discovered my creative side as I drew characters from cartoons and games. I developed my coding skill on my own; continued playing the piano and started learning songs of my choice by referring to various apps. But just as I thought the Covid-19 wave was ending and I started playing with my friends, with all precautions, the second wave hit us. Again, we went indoors. This time, I have started playing indoor games with my family. Whenever my father is free, we either watch a movie together or make some project from scrap available at home. I also exercise with him every day and attend yoga classes to keep my body fit and flexible. Since both my parents are always busy – dad with office work and mom with household chores – I have also started helping them at home and often make tea for the two of them. As a family, we have started growing vegetables and flowers in our balcony as well. It is wonderful to watch the plants grow. Finally, since I cannot visit my cousins, uncles, aunts and grandparents, because of the pandemic, I keep calling them and chatting with them to strengthen family bonds. Come to think of it, this pandemic has taught me to discover many things and realise that a lot can be learnt even outside the school.

---||Mumbai||Complaints on civic issues drop by 26% in pandemic year in Mumbai: Praja report||MUMBAI: In the Covid year, complaints filed by citizens on civic issues dropped by 26%, while average number of days taken by the BMC to resolve them rose by 30%. Data released by NGO Praja Foundation on the status of civic issues in Mumbai showed that 93,774 complaints were received by the BMC in 2020 as compared to nearly 1.3 lakh in 2019. The average number of days taken to resolve the complaints have gone up from 30 in 2019 to 39 in 2020, according to the ‘report card’. Also, complaints related to major civic depar-tments including roads, drainage, water supply and solid waste management (SWM) have dipped in 2020 (see graphic). The NGO said while the BMC may have been hard pressed for time owing to pandemic management, civic issues cannot be ignored. “As Covid-related activities had to be prioritised, unfortunately it may have increased the time taken to address basic civic complaints. Even so, complaint numbers had decreased in 2020, so the days to resolve them should not have increased,” said Praja. It added that while the BMC claims that 100% door-to-door waste collection is still on, 34% of the SWM complaints in 2020 were related to garbage not being collected. Also only one out of four public toilet seats are for females as of December 2020. On a positive note, Praja said in the wake of BMC’s Covid-19 management, three key areas of success came to light that could be used in post-pandemic rebuilding and further improve services at ward levels. “First being decentralization of various functions at local level for inclusive decision making and better quality of services, like setting up the 24 ward war rooms,” said Nitai Mehta, trustee of Praja Foundation. “This can be achieved through an even more extensive use of technology which BMC has showcased by live streaming budgets and online ward committee meetings. Thirdly, the BMC should collaborate with stakeholders in both public and private sectors to find innovative solutions to the city’s growth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/complaints-on-civic-issues-drop-by-26-in-pandemic-year-in-mumbai-praja-report/articleshow/83352839.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Dehradun||Not state with worst sex ratio, Uttarakhand tells Centre||NAINITAL: NITI Aayog’s data, placing Uttarakhand last in terms of sex ratio, is "significantly different", Uttarakhand women and child development minister Rekha Arya said on Tuesday. While the central think tank’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index said the state’s child sex ratio at birth is 840, the state government said it is actually 949, just one short of “ideal”, based on its own data. “I will write to the vice-chairman of NITI Aayog Rajiv Kumar (who launched the SDG report last Thursday) and present our own data. We have discussed the matter and don’t know how the figure of 840 came up,” Arya told TOI. “State government data shows six of 13 districts in the state have sex ratio at birth higher than 950. In Bageshwar, 1,012 females were born for every 1,000.” The disparity in NITI Aayog data and state figures goes way back. For 2019, the SDG Index found Uttarakhand’s child sex ratio at birth was 841, while state data pegged it at 938. For the year before that, the SDG Index calculated it at 850 and the state at 922. The SDG report relies on the National Indicator Framework, which is based on data from the Office of the Registrar General of India (responsible for demographic surveys like the Census, Language Survey and the National Register of Citizens). “The state government collects its figures through ASHA workers and ANMs, and hospitals and other establishments where children are born,” Arya told TOI. While the methodology differs, the disparity is huge. “Every survey since the 2011 Census shows Uttarakhand’s sex ratio on the decline. The Sample Registration System report (840 for 2016-18), the National Family Health Survey report (888 in 2015-16) and now the NITI Aayog report have all estimated low figures. There is no way it can jump from 840 to 949,” said Sabu M George, a researcher on girl children for over 35 years who has also worked in remote areas of Uttarakhand. “On the ground, it is evident that the sex ratio is skewed and there is no doubt sex determination is going on. When we travelled to places like Tehri and Uttarkashi, the locals told us where the ultrasound clinics are where they can go for abortion after sex determination. The family composition in these places also shows the gap.” Arya, however, said the state has made significant strides in improving sex ratio. “Uttarakhand received accolades from both the Union health ministry and the Union women and child development ministry for improving sex ratio figures,” she further said. Union minister of women and child development Smriti Irani had in February this year presented sex ratio data in the Lok Sabha in response to a question, which said Uttarakhand had a sex ratio of 949.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/not-state-with-worst-sex-ratio-ukhand-tells-centre/articleshow/83348538.cms||Prashant Jha

Four of her family members including her son had died within a span of few weeks. The woman identified as Chandrakanta Sodhani jumped off the balcony on the 9th floor of her apartment when her husband Dinesh was asleep around 6 am on Monday. Police said that Sodhani had been depressed after her sister passed away earlier this year followed by her nephew and his wife, due to different reasons. About a month ago her son Arun succumbed to Covid-19. “She was shaken after three deaths, but it was her son’s demise with which she was not able to cope with it,” said a police official. He added that Arun was a textile trader and used to live with his parents after his divorce. After Sodhani jumped to death, Dinesh was informed about the incident by other residents of the building. “The woman’s husband was still wailing when we reached there as he too had lost his son and now his wife,” the police official said. Cops have not questioned Dinesh in detail yet as they are waiting for him to gather himself. Police added that the woman had a daughter who is married and lives in Maharashtra.

---||Kochi||After 19 yrs at helm, Kurian steps down today||Kochi: V J Kurian, known for his decisive role in building the Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial) as India’s first public-private partnership (PPP) model airport project, will step down from the post of the managing director on Wednesday as he completes the five-year post-retirement tenure. Ernakulam district collector S Suhas will hold the full additional charge of Cial MD till further orders. Kurian, a 1983 batch IAS officer, has led Cial for a record period of 19 years over three terms in its 27-year history as the managing director, making the airport one of the most successful PPP model projects in the country and revolutionizing airport operation management. Kurian was given a five-year stint as the MD of Cial in 2016 by the Pinarayi Vijayan government on his superannuation from the post of the additional chief secretary. Over the last five years, Cial has invested Rs 2,016 crore for its infrastructure development, which included operationalization of Terminal 3, runway resurfacing, renovation of Terminal 1, implementation of extensive flood mitigation project and the capacity enhancement of solar plants from 14.4 MWp to 40 MWp. It was under Kurian’s leadership that Cial became the world’s first airport fully powered by solar energy. His futuristic idea of sourcing green energy to operate an airport won him many international awards and accolades, the latest being the ‘Champion of the Earth-2018’ by United Nations Environmental Programme. This is the highest environmental prize instituted by the United Nations. The government of India introduced Cial’s solar power project as one of the two flagship ventures at the COP21, the global climate change conference, held at Paris. PM Narendra Modi had praised Cial for contributing to his government’s 2030 target of achieving 350 GW power from alternative energy sources. “After the airport operated by the Indian Navy in Willingdon Island became obsolete, the government asked Kurian, who was the then Ernakulam collector, to find out a solution. Kurian’s proposal of bringing the future beneficiaries of the airport project, viz; non-resident Indians, airlines, common public, high net worth business people, banks and fuelling agencies into a common platform wherein the government machinery could act as a facilitator not only built a world class airport at Kochi but also triggered many huge development projects in both aviation and non-aviation sectors,” said a Cial statement. Kurian had also served as the sub-collector of Muvattupuzha, district collector of Alappuzha and Ernakulam, MD of Oushadhi and roads and bridges corporation, Kerala, and chairman of Spices Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/after-19-yrs-at-helm-kurian-steps-down-today/articleshow/83348553.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed grief and directed the officials to ensure proper treatment of those injured. “CM Yogi Adityanath has deeply expressed his grief over the death of the people in the road accident in Kanpur. He has expressed his condolences to the bereaved families, praying for the peace of departed souls,” the chief minister’s office stated. The chief minister has instructed the officers of the district administration to provide proper treatment to the injured in the accident and wished for their speedy recovery. Senior police and administration officials, including IG range Mohit Agarwal reached the spot. The impact of the collision was such that both the vehicles toppled sideways. While 10 people died on the spot, six succumbed to injuries later, officials said and added, “Rescue operation is underway and the injured have been admitted to a Lala Lajpat Rai hospital.” “The bus was coming from Lucknow and heading towards Delhi and the occupants of tempo were on their way to work in a biscuit factory in the Sachendi area,” said IG (range) while talking to TOI.

---||Vadodara||Corona patients get Rs 50 lakh refund from private hospitals in Vadodara||VADODARA: When a patient from Madhya Pradesh was handed over a hefty bill for Covid-19 treatment at a private hospital in the city, all it needed to rectify the bill was a mention that a complaint would be raised with the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). The bill amount was rectified even without a formal complaint. Vadodara private hospitals, scared of complaint, refunds Covid patients.“We merely obtained a copy of the notification fixing rates for treatment and forwarded it to the lady staffer who had contacted us for payments after we found that the bill was exorbitantly high. When the doctor called us, we told them that we were going to raise a complaint. The bill was immediately reduced by around Rs 70,000,” said a relative of the patient from MP. The VMC had started the special cell after rampant complaints about hospitals overcharging patients. A phone number was publicised as the helpline that patients or relatives could reach if they found that the bills were unjustified. The cell even came across some interesting cases like that of a couple that was kept in the same special room where usually one patient is kept. Both the husband and wife were billed separately for the room charges by the hospital as if each of them had occupied a separate special room. When the husband mentioned this to a friend, he was advised to approach VMC. The man was refunded Rs 67,000 by the hospital. “The complaints have been trickling in over the phone, whatsapp or even in person. The patient or relative needs to provide a bill with a detailed break up. We go through the details and if they are in order forward it to a team that includes a doctor and pharmacist,” said VMC’s IT director Manish Bhatt, who is coordinating efforts and is the person who has to be approached for a complaint. He said that so far VMC has till date ensured refund of over Rs 50 lakh to covid patients of different hospitals. Bhatt said that hospitals usually agree to whatever is found after the scrutiny and issue refunds. “In case, if the hospital wants to discuss the matter, their representatives comes to us and objections are also incorporated if found genuine,” said Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/corona-patients-get-rs-50l-refund-from-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/83346363.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Test positivity rate dips to 26% as Covid control measures pay off||COIMBATORE: The test positivity rate, which was the second highest in the state at 34% during May 28-June 3, has come down to 26% during June 4-8 in the district. Officials attributed this to the 16% drop in the positivity rate that the city corporation limits recorded during the period. The officials said the infectivity rate was high in rural areas, which on certain days record a positivity rate above 30%. Hence, they have intensified door-to-door survey in the rural areas. The positivity rate had crossed 36% in the district during the peak of the second wave, when it used to record 4,000 to 4,700 cases a day. This was mainly because the health department was not tracing all contacts and testing them. Samples tested a day then was just more than 12,000, which were of symptomatic people and their immediate contacts, who were highly likely to be tested positive for the virus. The negative cases were the only people who went for testing for travel and other purposes. However, as officials began adopting aggressive testing measures in rural areas, cases began declining to 2,700-2,500 a day. And the test positivity rate followed suit at 26%. Collector S Nagarajan said, “We have intensified the door-to-door survey in rural areas as well. We have a population of around 3.2 lakh in village panchayats and we are trying to visit them daily.” Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said the volunteers and monitoring teams were convincing the people with symptoms to undergo Covid testing. “If possible, they collect nasal swabs from the symptomatic people immediately and isolate them.” The city corporation has been leading from the front, bringing down the test positivity rate in its limits to 16% from 30% in May third week. Reducing the movement of positive patients in their houses and on the roads had played a major role in this. A corporation official said, “This was achieved by introducing car ambulances, which reduced the burden on the family members to rush a patient to triage centres and hospitals in their vehicles in search of a bed, risking the virus transmission. We also introduced home triages to prevent patients from visiting medical shops to buy their medications. Another effort that paid off was isolating symptomatic people.” The number of people in home isolation has, meanwhile, come down to 19,518 on Tuesday from 26,000 in May last week. “We allow home isolation only if the patient has a separate room in the house, is educated enough to take all precautions and cooperate with our monitoring. Mild symptoms, including fever for less than two days and no cough, are also taken into account,” a health department official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/test-positivity-rate-dips-to-26-as-covid-control-measures-pay-off/articleshow/83351249.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat assembly opposes PIL for live telecast||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat state legislative secretariat has opposed a PIL seeking live telecast of proceedings and regular posting of transcripts, papers that are to be laid, private member’s business, zero-hour, list of questions and their answers, text of debates on assembly’s web portal under the provisions of Right To Information Act. It was submitted on Tuesday that any compulsion on the assembly to disclose documents under section 4 of the RTI Act would amount to breach of assembly’s privilege under Article 194(3) of the Constitution. It was asserted that the assembly is not obliged to disclose all information, upload all documents and proceedings on its portal under RTI laws, and the assembly has powers to regulate publication of its documents. While opposing the demand, deputy secretary Reeta Mehta has stated that right to information is not absolute, and it is the discretion of the Gujarat legislative assembly to determine what information it deems fit to be published. While Article 194 (3) grants discretion to the state assembly to not disclose information that would breach its privilege. And it is the privilege of the state legislature to decide whether disclosure of any information would breach its privilege or not. Courts cannot question its decision to determine which information should be disclosed or not. The officer also cited the exception laid down in section 8(1)(c) of the RTI Act to thwart the argument that the assembly is bound under section 4 of the Act to disclose on its website in Gujarati and English the proceedings that take place on the floor of the house — the way website of the Parliament and some other state assemblies have been regularly disclosing. Petitioner Neeta Hardikar had claimed last year that the state assembly has got its website, but the details are not posted on it the way other state assemblies have been doing. The government rebutted and said that all vital and necessary information has been posted and updated on the web portal. It was also submitted that the state assembly’s website is being upgraded and more information is being uploaded. The petitioner cannot dictate the manner of making information available on website. However, the assembly has made sincere efforts to publish relevant information on its website and telecast significant events like governor’s address and budget speech. “The respondent has published all vital information it deems fit and endeavours to publish all necessary documents as and when required,” the affidavit reads. The state law officer told the HC that more updates on the portal would be given during the next hearing, which is scheduled in the end of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-assembly-opposes-pil-for-live-telecast/articleshow/83351241.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Garbage pile finally cleared out from Rasoolpura colony||HYDERABAD: An entire stretch that was ridden with piles of garbage, lying unattended for many days, on a bridge at Vimannagar in Rasoolpura was cleared after the grievance was aired on TOI’s citizen reporter app. Soon after the grievance was published in these columns, officials of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) swung into action and cleared the garbage. "For a very long time, I have seen that the garbage thrown along the roadside by locals remains unattended for days on end. But recently, I saw that some workers came and cleared the garbage out. Following that, the stretch has remained clean," said Manav Parikh, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. According to locals, the issue of garbage being dumped in the open has persisted for several months before officials took the initiative to clean the stretch. Many other areas of Rasoolpura face the same issue, they complained. "A lane near Khushi Chandrala building at Margadarshi Colony in Rasoolpura is filled with garbage; but no attention is paid to that place. While the garbage collection vehicles come regularly, they never clear the pile completely. They often say that the wet waste needs to be collected by another vehicle due to which the garbage lies unattended," said Harsh Mutta, a resident of Margadarshi Colony in Rasoolpura. Residents stressed that officials must conduct regular inspections in the area to see that the problem does not resurface. Meanwhile, Hyderabad mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi has been taking stock of the garbage situation across the city over past few weeks. She has urged GHMC staff to work effectively and informed them that strict action will be taken against those failing to provide service to the people properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/garbage-pile-finally-cleared-out-from-rasoolpura-colony/articleshow/83351768.cms||---
---||Delhi||Building collapse kills 25-year-old DU student||New Delhi: A 25-year-old Delhi University postgraduate student was killed after a portion of a building where he lived on rent in south Delhi’s Panchsheel Park collapsed on Wednesday afternoon. Police suspect the ongoing construction work of a basement in the adjacent plot to be behind the collapse and have arrested two contractors for the death. The victim, Ishan Sethi, belonged to Mussoorie in Uttarakhand. Police said they received a call at 4.30pm reporting that a building had collapsed, and a man was trapped under the debris. Police and firefighters’ team with three fire tenders were rushed to the spot. Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Service, said, “Our men carried out the rescue operation, and after an hour-long operation, managed to pull out the trapped man and rushed him to a hospital, where the doctors declared him dead.” DCP (South) Atul Thakur said the body was sent for postmortem to AIIMS and Sethi’s family was informed. “It seems like the portion of the building must have collapsed due to the impact of digging work. A case has been registered under relevant sections and the two contractors, Vikas Bhayana and Rahul Bhayana, have been arrested,” Thakur said. Praveen Jain, owner of the house, said Sethi was staying at the staff quarter above the parking lot for a year and was in his room when the incident took place. “At the next door, digging started around 4-5 days ago. Due to the pandemic, we could not visit the place regularly, but it was found that a portion of our building (servant quarter) collapsed due to excess digging work happening next to our boundary wall,” said Jain. A South Delhi Municipal Corporation official, however, confirmed that the construction work started after approval of the plan on May 13. “The owner/architect has also submitted an indemnity bond before starting the work,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/building-collapse-kills-25-year-old-du-student/articleshow/83382226.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Kanjurmarg plot for Metro may cost Rs 3,000 crore||MUMBAI: Rs 3,356 crore. This is the market value of the controversial 102-acre Kanjurmarg plot which the salt department expects the state to pay if it wants to build an integrated Metro rail car shed on it. The January 2020 letter of the deputy salt commissioner (Mumbai), which TOI has accessed, pegs the market rate based on the ready reckoner rate of 2019-20. On Tuesday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met Prime Minister Modi to resolve the Centre-state dispute over the Kanjurmarg plot. In a letter addressed to the salt commissioner in Jaipur, the deputy commissioner said if Rule 17 of the Central policy guidelines (which allow a 15% deduction in the ready reckoner rate) is applied, the market value reduces to Rs 2,852 crore. The Mumbai Metropolitan Development Authority (MMRDA) had earlier agreed to pay for the land, which it requires to build a car shed for three different Metro lines: 3,4 and 6. “The land requested by MMRDA falls under Arthur Salt Works. The land was leased for 99 years, which expired on 14/10/2016. The lease has not been renewed thereafter,” said the deputy salt commissioner’s letter. The lessee, the Garodia family, though, moved court after the lease was terminated by the salt department back in 2004 for alleged violations of lease conditions. “As the lease has already expired, the ex-lessees are not entitled for any compensation. However, as the suit is pending in the court, appropriate decisions regarding compensation may be taken by the competent authority,” said the letter. There have been multiple claimants on this land. When the Shiv Sena-led state government decided to shift the Metro 3 car depot from Aarey to Kanjurmarg in late 2019, the Centre immediately intervened and said the land belonged to it and that the state had no claim over it. Later, the Bombay high court, too, stayed the suburban collector’s decision to hand over the plot to MMRDA for the car shed. Meanwhile, the Garodia family, who claimed control over the land, too moved court to protect its interest.  The Garodias have signed a deal with construction giant Shapoorji Pallonji to develop the Kanjurmarg land for affordable homes. Early this year, MMRDA filed an application before the high court asking for the land, stating it was willing to give all “benefits and compensation” to which the owner or lessee would be entitled under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act. “The full value of all interests in the said land will be protected and made available to the rightful claimants,” it said. A section of the state bureaucracy, though, has questioned MMRDA’s undertaking to pay the market value of the land to the Centre. When asked about MMRDA’s undertaking, a senior state government official told TOI: “There is no basis for it. If such an undertaking has been given, the state government is neither aware nor has it ratified it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kanjurmarg-plot-for-metro-may-cost-rs-3k-cr/articleshow/83347540.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court notices to officials over safety of Iris scanner||HYDERABAD: Is the intelligent retinal imaging system (Iris) currently used at the state-run fair price shops (FPS) to identify beneficiaries turning out to be a superspreader of coronavirus? A PIL filed by Muthyam Prakash and two others of Gajularamaram in Rangareddy district says so. The Telangana high court, which earlier had asked the state government to ascertain the truth in the allegation, was not convinced by the reply given by the state counsel on Tuesday and issued notices to the state civil supplies department’s principal secretary and commissioner of civil supplies to file their counters within two weeks explaining the safety aspects of Iris scanner. A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy asked the state counsel to come clean on the aspect of whether those who are using this at the FPS are maintaining any distance between the scanner and FPS workers while scanning the eyes of the beneficiaries. State counsel Harender Pershad informed the bench that he spoke to the superintendent of Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital in Hyderabad. “He (the superintendent) told me that there is no such possibility of spreading Covid-19 infection through the Iris scanner,” the state counsel said. C Ramachandra Raju, counsel for the petitioners, alleged that workers at the FPS are applying these scanners on the people in such a way that they are touching the eyes of each beneficiary and thereby causing the spread. “Let them use some third person identification methods to identify the beneficiaries and stop using the Iris scanners,” he said. The state counsel could not answer whether the allegation that the scanner is touching the eyes of the beneficiaries. “From what I could gather from the interaction I had with the hospital superintendent is that only certain rays are sent inside to identify a person and the gadget never touches a person,” he said. “About how much distance is maintained between the gadget and the eye, I need to consult the superintendent again,” the state counsel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notices-to-officials-over-safety-of-iris-scanner/articleshow/83351247.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Mercury rising, may touch 43°C today||NEW DELHI: Parts of Delhi crossed the 42 degrees Celsius mark on Tuesday with a thick haze hanging over the city, which pushed the air quality into the “poor” category. Track the pollution level in your city Met official says similar conditions are expected on Wednesday and could see the mercury touching 43 degrees Celsius. According to India Meteorological Department, Safdarjung, which is Delhi’s base station, recorded 41.7 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. Pitampura and Najafgarh were the warmest locations in Delhi at a high of 42.4 degrees Celsius. Mungeshpur in northwest Delhi, too, sizzled at 42 degrees Celsius. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at IMD and head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “Due to clear skies and dry winds, the temperature rose on Tuesday and is expected to rise further on Wednesday. Besides, strong dust-raising winds of 30-35 kmph were recorded. The winds transported dust from Rajasthan to Delhi and led to accumulation of dust particles in the air and deterioration of the air quality.” Met officials said the city recorded the warmest day of the year on April 28 when the mercury touched 42.2 degrees Celsius. The highest maximum temperature recorded in May was 41.6 degrees Celsius. IMD forecast says the mercury level may come down by weekend as there are chances of very light rain, but people may not get much respite. “Very light rain is predicted from June 12 to 14, but as there may be high moisture in the air, it may lead to an uncomfortable weather,” said a Met official. Meanwhile, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 205 in the ‘poor’ category on Tuesday against 180 in the ‘moderate’ range on Monday. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “The wind speed is forecast to stay high for the next two days and high wind speed and high boundary layer height are favourable for dispersion. However, at the same time, there are chances of an increase in local dust emission and long-range transport of dust from the arid regions. It may lead to higher coarser dust concentration (PM10) in the next three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-rising-may-touch-43c-today/articleshow/83351394.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The institutional quarantine order was scheduled to be implemented from June 10. Municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “On Wednesday, we will issue a revised order, which will be more flexible than our earlier order. Even though we would like Covid patients to isolate themselves at institutional quarantine facility, we will not make it mandatory. We will surely try to convince them, but if they are not ready to get admitted to an institutional quarantine facility, we will closely monitor their health.” He said that a few more exceptions would be added in Wednesday’s order. The earlier order issued on May 31 had stated that all Covid patients in the civic limits would be sent to institutional quarantine. The order said that only bedridden citizens, pregnant women, citizens with physical disabilities and single parents would be exempted from institutional quarantine, while others would have to strictly abide by it. According to Patil, elderly couples, terminally-ill patients and children would now be allowed to opt for home isolation. The PCMC in its earlier order had said that the civic administration would set up 32 ward Covid centres to ensure availability of institutional quarantine facility for all Covid patients. Regarding setting up of such centres, Patil said that initially only one centre would be set up in each ward with a minimum bed capacity of 50. Activist Abhijit More welcomed the flexible stand taken by the civic body. This would ensure that people undergo tests and report the cases to the civic body, he said. Earlier, members of housing societies in a meeting with the PCMC municipal commissioner had raised concerns about setting up of institutional facilities in their clubhouses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/institutional-quarantine-pcmc-mulls-flexible-stand/articleshow/83351272.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The primary health centres in the district were getting anywhere between 100 and 300 doses of Covishield and Covaxin and the government hospitals around 400-500 doses daily to inoculate people in the age group of 45 to 60 years. In addition, people in the age group of 18-44 years were getting vaccinated in camps. However, all that came to a grinding halt on Saturday. In total, the district requires 6,000 to 9,000-odd doses a day. Officials confirmed that the district storage unit had run out of vaccines completely. In fact, some primary health centres had a few doses of Covaxin, which they administered to the people aged above 45 as the second dose. Some private hospitals too had a few doses of vaccine in stock and the same was administered to the existing patients. The district has vaccinated 5,27,189 people so far. “We have not received any word from Chennai on when we will get the next shipment of vaccines. We understand that Chennai is expected to receive fresh doses of Covaxin and Covishield on June 10 and 11. We will get our allotment after that,” an official, who didn’t want to be named, said. Considering the demand, officials have requested the health department to at least divert stock of vaccine, in any, from other districts to the industrial camps in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/vaccination-drive-stalled-for-2nd-day/articleshow/83351270.cms||---

---||Chennai||This 70-year-old wants to take Indian education to a new global league||At 70, when most people cozy up to a retired life, K V Ramani is busy running around and working on an audacious project — starting a private university with the best brains from the industry and academia with a challenge to put it in an exclusive global league in 10 years. After co-founding Nasscom, Future Soft and Hughes Software, Ramani is now ready with his next project — Sai University, one of the two private universities approved by the Tamil Nadu government. In an interview with Rajesh Chandramouli he talks about his plans for the institution that is backed by industry stalwarts including N R Narayana Murthy, Anil Kakodkar, Kasturirangan, and has an academic team lead by Jamshed Barucha, former dean of Dartmouth.Are you being too ambitious in an overcrowded space? We are used to creating institutions of global eminence. We have seen it grow from zero in IT, another example is healthcare. Today healthcare has developed so much that foreigners are coming to India to get treatment. You’re getting the same standard of care at a fraction of the cost compared to western countries along with better service. Post-operative patient care in India is better than what you get in developed countries. The same model I’ve to follow here in the education sector. Today, there are no global education universities in India. Even IITs and IIMs are not in the top 100 globally, so I said If I do something under the name of Sai, it has to be the world’s best. Sai University’s vision statement is to become a globally eminent university. What went into your analysis?We hired KPMG to give a detailed report on the scope and background of the project. Then I approached the TN government in January 2018 with the early stages for permission to start a university and also 200 acres of land. By July 2018 the law for setting up private universities in state was passed. Why did you go quiet thereafterAt that time, there was some opposition in the assembly. Vested interest groups who were running education institutions did not want to allow a new private university to come up because they thought it would be a threat to their business. Therefore, we went off the radar for some time. We have now complied with with all conditions for private universities according to the law. We purchased 105 acres of land at Payanur on Old Mahabalipuram Road inside One-Hub Chennai, an Ascendas promoted property, because we wanted it to be away from the city. We have begun construction. What will be the investments and returns?The project size is `700 crore and out of that `300 crore will be funded by the Trust and for the rest of the funds we are going to raise it from other institutions. The university will run as education as service, not as a business. Today engineering institutions, medical colleges and arts and science colleges are charging much more than the costs. The money is collected in several ways from students. We are not here for profit. According to our 10-year plan, we will break even by the sixth year. How expensive will it be to study here?The quality of education will be better than anywhere in this country. We should be in the international league from India. It will be more expensive than Indian schools, but definitely much less than sending kids abroad to study. On the 100-acre campus we are going to build facilities for 20,000 students to be accommodated. To improve the quality of education 50% of our faculty will be from abroad. They will either be taking classes online or offline. We have started our programmes for this year. We are starting undergraduate courses in liberal arts and science and computing data sciences where we operate artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics and law. We are yet to decide on the fees, maybe `6 lakh per year. That shows good quality education is expensive. Are you for the elite?It will be an elite university for education, but not for elite students alone. Our law provides for 35% for TN domiciliary. The state’s reservation policy will be followed, which is 23%. From a social sense we are not elite. It is not for the rich. We will meet the social objectives of the state. In addition, if students cannot afford fees, we will give scholarships from the Trust. How is your admission process?The board of studies will be considering school marks, whatever is available. In addition to that an essay or statement of purpose will be needed. We will consider any standard test like SAT or Pearson. If the student wants, the student will get to write our entrance test. All the courses will be common in the first six months. In the next six months they can attend other courses. A student in computing sciences can take economics and vice-versa. This is inter-disciplinary.and multi-disciplinary education. Don’t you think children will be confused with credits?Today the world is extremely competitive, only the top 90% get opportunities. To be among the best we need to compete and be innovative. You must allow the children to do a double major shift or shift from a major to minor or vice-versa. The present system has a fundamental design mistake. They are selling engineering packages and arts packages. What kind of faculty are you considering?We have an international advisory board, which has been created by our vice-chancellor to bring in the best of global teachers. They can be visiting faculty or online/hybrid. We want 50% of faculty to be from abroad. We have faculty from Stanford and Harvard who will teach students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/this-70-yr-old-wants-to-take-indian-education-to-a-new-global-league/articleshow/83356934.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli
---||Ahmedabad||Kalol blast: PIL seeks FIR, compensation for victims||AHMEDABAD: A PIL in the Gujarat high court is seeking criminal and exemplary civil actions against the persons responsible for the blast that occurred in a housing society in Kalol. The blast was triggered by a leak in an ONGC pipeline and killed three persons in December 2020. The petitioner, Viralgiri Goswami, has also sought compensation for the families of the deceased. Goswami urged the court to order the authorities responsible and the builder to pay fine and to shift Garden City Cooperative Housing Society. The petitioner has urged the HC to direct the authorities to allot land for rebuilding the society which was allegedly illegally constructed on land below which a pipeline ran. Therefore, the plea says, the cost should be borne by the builder, Rajeshkumar Patel. The PIL is demanding Rs 100 crore fine on the responsible because the blast occurred due to their malfeasance in knowingly allowing residential societies to come up on land beneath which ONGC pipelines were passing. There should be disciplinary proceedings against officials involved in the grant of development permission to the developer, the plea says. The PIL filed through advocates Rahul Sharma and Utkarsh Dave demands directions to the ONGC to re-route its pipeline to where there is no habitation in order to make the population safe. For this, the cost should be borne by the ONGC because the NOC was given for construction on land beneath which its pipeline passed, the plea says. The PIL also seeks disciplinary action for the lapses in the process that led to the construction. The PIL is demanding the registration of an FIR against all those found responsible. It says that it is not permissible to construct buildings on land under which oil or gas pipelines pass. The construction of buildings on such land constitutes a criminal act, the plea says. The petitioner asserts, “It is clear from the chain of events leading to the blast that the incident was not a consequence of an Act of God. It has arisen out of intentional human acts of collusive corruption.” The HC is likely to hear this PIL on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kalol-blast-pil-seeks-fir-compensation-for-victims/articleshow/83351298.cms||---

In fact, the caseload saw a steady rise till June 3, when it had recorded 584 cases, compared to 179 on May 10. While the cases dropped by 70 on June 4, the daily caseload continued to hover around 500 and more in the past three days. The test positivity rate too has been on the rise. From 11.7% during the seven-day period from May 7 to 13, the positivity rate had shot up to 24.9% during May28-June 3. The highest-ever daily test positivity rate that the hill retreat had registered was 28% on May 30. The district has also reported 69 Covid-19 deaths in the past one month. Health officials said they were expecting the daily cases to plateau in the district some 10 days ago, but in vain. They said most of the cases were reported from the settlements of Scheduled Caste (SC) people and rural areas, where the awareness about the pandemic was comparatively low. In the second and third weeks of May, collector J Innocent Divya said, the district had seen 1,098 Covid-19 index cases and 4,700 primary contact cases. “When the lockdown was announced, people who had gone to Tirupur, Coimbatore and Erode for work returned home. Residents of SC settlements, most of them were carriers of the virus.” She said the outsiders having houses or guest houses in the Nilgiris had as well moved to the district during the lockdown. According to her, the e-registration system hadn’t helped much to curb the unnecessary travel. “We had conducted a study to find out the cause for the rise in fresh cases after the imposition of the lockdown. And we found that the main transmitters were the local returnees and others who flocked to the hills.” Also, as essential activities, the horticulture and tea sectors were exempted during the lockdown. “People who returned from other districts started working in carrot washing units, tea estates and farmlands. That led to the virus spread and most of the tea estate areas were cordoned off as containment zones,” the collector said. Dr P Balusamy, deputy director of public health, said there were more than 650 containment zones in the Nilgiris. “Large crowds at funerals and marriage functions too contributed to the increase in fresh cases.” The collector, meanwhile, hoped that the district would see a declining trend in the daily caseload in a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/lockdown-fails-to-curb-fresh-cases-in-nilgiris/articleshow/83351301.cms||---

Rajeev K Jalan, co-ordinator Ramaipur mega leather cluster and former chairman, Council for Leather Export (CLE) hoped that all hurdles would be removed within a month and entrepreneurs will be able to start the ground breaking work at their allotted land in 4-6 weeks. Talking to TOI, Jalan said “The project, worth 451 crore, is an ambitious project of the state government which is being monitored by chief minister Yogi Adityanath himself”. He said the CM had deputed Navneet Sehgal, additional principal secretary, micro, small and medium industry and export promotion as an special officer, who is coordinating and making efforts to remove all hurdles coming in the way of the project. All concerning departments, he said, are cooperating in this mega project which will stretch in around 250 acres of land. Industrial development minister Satish Mahana has convened a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the one last hurdle---exchange of land with the government departments concerned. For this project, Mega Leather Cluster Development UP had purchased contiguous 105 acres of land, from UPSIDA, 45 acres land was purchased directly by special purpose vehicle (SPV) from farmers, 85 acres of gram sabha land to be notified by the district magistrate Kanpur Nagar has been purchased by SPV, Jalan said. “The cluster will be developed in Kanpur Sadar tehsil whereas 85 acre land has been purchased at Narval tehsil. Since the land belongs to other tehsil, therefore, land transfer could not take place so far. Because as per rules, land exchange must be done in the same tehsil”, he said and added the exchange would be cleared by the state government. The project would provide direct and indirect employment to about 1.5 lakh people. Most advanced and eco-friendly machinery would be installed in it. There would be around 200 stand alone plots and around 100 factories in the leather cluster which would have its own 20 mld common effluent treatment plant, Jalan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ramaipur-mega-leather-cluster-proj-to-begin-soon/articleshow/83352843.cms||Anant Shekher Misra
---||Chennai||‘Voice’ of megastars of Tamil Nadu politics, K Sornam, falls silent||Thirukkuvalai village in Tiruvarur district may be synonymous with M Karunanidhi, former chief minister. But there were a few others who started their life from that remote village and went on to make a mark. K Sornam, who passed away early on Tuesday at the age of 88 following a brief illness, was one of them. With his roots in Thirukkuvalai, he rose beyond being a relative of Karunanidhi and established himself as a journalist, Tamil film dialogue writer and director. Sornam, whose name appears as Swarnam or Swornam in film credits, had written dialogues for 17 films of MGR including ‘Nam Naadu’ and ‘Adimai Penn’. He had directed a few Tamil films including ‘Ore Raththam’, written by Karunanidhi and released in 1987. The film featured chief minister M K Stalin as an actor. In his condolence message, chief minister M K Stalin said, "As a writer, director, dialogue writer and journalist, he was a multi-faceted personality. He was the editor-in-charge for Ilaya Suriyan, which I launched and managed" His role in as an editor was also invaluable. "While in ‘Murasoli’, he took full responsibility of bringing out ‘Pudhaiyal’, a weekly supplement, and archived Kalaignar’s writings," said Stalin. Sornam was honoured with the Kalaignar Award in 2005. "He was associated with Kalaignar since his school days and went on to become one of the brightest writers to have come from Murasoli," Stalin said. Starting his career from the early days of Murasoli, the DMK organ, Sornam had made his mark right from the days of DMK founder C N Annadurai. ‘Vidai Kodu Thaaye’ (Bid Me Farewell Mother), a revolutionary play written by him to highlight the need for social reforms, not only had a popular run but was a big hit, with Anna himself felicitating Sornam when the play was staged for the 100th time. Sornam went on to head the film institute in Chennai, besides being the secretary of Tamil Eyal Isai Nadaga Manram, a state-owned body. DMK treasurer and Lok Sabha MP T R Baalu remembers Sornam as one of the regular walkers. "He was a regular member of our walking group, led by Kalaignar, at the Arivalayam campus (DMK headquarters) even when the construction was on. We used to assemble early in the morning. Sornam considered himself a student of Kalaignar," Baalu said. He was an editor, who cared for the welfare and wellness of his fellow employees, recalls R Elayaselvan, a journalist with Tamil news magazine ‘Nakkeeran’. "Ilaya Suriyan was started as a magazine in the early 1990s with focus on politics and social justice. Sornam Sir used to be in office prompt at 10am. He guided youngsters in the nuances of journalism; how to grab the attention of the readers, with facts," said Elayaselvan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/voice-of-megastars-of-tamil-nadu-politics-k-sornam-falls-silent/articleshow/83356984.cms||D Govardan

The massive participation of volunteers from Harbour ward, which came first in the challenge, can be attributed to the ward councillor telling his team that if they could get the first prize, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself would be giving them the award and they could take a photo with him. The Rs 25,000 cash prize would be utilized for cleaning activities in the ward. While Kuravankonam ward, the only city ward among the top three, got the second prize, the third prize went to Poonkulam ward. The dry day challenge was organized for all the wards as part of the action plan to eradicate mosquito-borne diseases. Ward-level campaigns were launched to encourage people to destroy the source of mosquitoes and observe dry day on Sunday. As many as 4,083 houses from Harbour ward took part in the campaign. Ward councillor Nizamudeen said that they planned a strategy similar to election work. “We decided to form booth-level teams and managed around 70 teams from various booths in the ward. In addition to this, we deputed young volunteers for each booth to spread awareness about the importance of this campaign. I told them jokingly that the chief minister would give the award in person and that it would be a true honour,” said Nizamudeen. He said that initially people were skeptical. “We first covered shops and households and then we picked hotels. We could destroy many mosquito-breeding spots. People soon realized the importance of this campaign and actively supported us,” said Nizamudeen. Altogether, 62,887 households in the city took part in the campaign and over 1 lakh sources of mosquito breeding were destroyed. Mayor also acknowledged the efforts of residents of Vazhottukonam and Punchakkari ward. Notably, neither the ward represented by Mayor Arya Rajendran and nor those by heads of various standing committees, including the health standing committee, figured in top three. The health wing thought of a participatory campaign for mosquito eradication in the wake of the lockdown. In the previous years, health wing had often met with disinterest from residents when they approached them with awareness pamphlets and forms. Residents seldom take any steps to eradicate mosquito breeding sources by themselves. A severe outbreak of Dengue in 2017 had put corporation in bad light. Following this, the city corporation stepped up activities for dry day campaign. This year we decided to introduce a challenge hoping that people would show more interest in doing things themselves. It was a participatory kind of campaign and except in city wards, we received good response,” said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/harbour-ward-shows-the-way-in-mosquito-eradication/articleshow/83348723.cms||---

The bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Biren Vaishnav sought details of vendor registration and welfare measures because a PIL on Wednesday prayed for directions to the government to create a portal, register all street vendors and create a database to enable the authorities to identify vendors and extend benefits of welfare schemes to them. Besides, a PIL also demanded financial support for street vendors, whose businesses have been severely affected by the government’s Covid-19 measures, reduction in school fees for their children and benefits of the ‘MA card’ scheme in health services. The PIL has sought spaces in open plots in towns for vendors to carry out their business. In response, the state government told the court that the portal for registration of workers in the unorganized sector will facilitate the issuing of smartcards to them so they can avail of the benefits of welfare schemes. Registration has been incentivised so more workers register and get benefits. It was submitted that the issue of school fees was already resolved through court proceedings last year. After a brief discussion, the HC asked the government to file an affidavit in two weeks with details about how many vendors register on the new portal and other details of welfare measures carried out in Covid times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-wants-details-of-street-vendors-registration-on-portal/articleshow/83351338.cms||---

But what was witnessed on Monday night was unprecedented. A group of 31 heavily drunk men returning from the Diu unleashed terror on the Bhavnagar-Somnath coastal highway, smashing bottles on heads of toll tax employees, assaulting cops, home guard jawans and stabbing a villager, late on Monday night. Drunkards in Diu unleash terror on the coastal highway.The mayhem continued for nearly four hours before their bus was intercepted by a team of cops from four police stations at around 2:30am after a high-voltage chase of 50 km. All those arrested are natives of Bhavnagar city’s Karchaliyapara locality and aged between 19 years to 36 years. They had hired a private bus and gone to Diu for boozing on Monday and started for Bhavnagar in the night. The high drama started unfolding around 11:30pm at Dudhala toll booth in Amreli district when they refused to pay the toll tax. Some of the men got down from the bus and smashed beer bottles on the heads of employees Aditya Bhupat and Dudha Jirubhai. When two other booth employees - Ranjit and Lalbhai - rushed there, the drunk men attacked the duo with the iron spanner and plier. After escaping without paying the tax and injuring the employees, they drove towards Bherai village where a railway crossing is located. In the meantime, toll booth employees had already informed the police who got the crossing closed and asked home guard jawans to reach there. At around 1am, the bus reached the crossing and again some of the men got down seeing that it was closed. They had an altercation with the railway crossing employee and thrashed him. They even slapped and threatened home guard jawan Ajay Gohil who reached there and forced the duo to open the railway crossing. From there, the bus driver sped towards Visariya village located near the coastal town Rajula where the police had placed trucks to block. A police SUV was also stationed there to intercept the hoodlums. Close to Rajula, they even stabbed some villager, informed Nirlipt Rai, Amreli district superintendent of police. “Close to Rajula town, they tried to run their bus over the police van and escaped. Ultimately, the bus was intercepted by teams of Pipavav Marine, Nageshri and Rajula police stations. They were heavily drunk and made all attempts to resist the arrest,” Rai added. Rai said this is the first time they have arrested such a big group of people returning drunk from Diu. All have been booked under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) including attempt to murder and sections of Prohibition Act. Police seized several bottles of liquor and beer from the bus.

District judge RP Singh in his order stated that without making any comment on merits of the case, conditional bail was being granted to Gopal Sharan Singh and Narayan Singh Bhadauria after they furnished two bail bonds of Rs 25,000 each and a personal bond of the like amount. The district judge in his order directed the accused-applicants to co-operate in the trial, not to pressurise witnesses, present themselves for examination-in-chief and cross examination and not seek adjournments without any valid reason. Moving the bail application the defence counsel said the accused-advocates have been in jail since June 6. As the charges levelled against them attract maximum three years imprisonment, therefore, they are entitled for bail. On the other hand, the additional district government counsel (ADGC) urged the court to reject their bail application as the case is in the investigation stage and moreover the accused had helped the history-sheeter to escape from the police custody. Earlier, the lower court (ACMM-III) had rejected their bail application. On June 2, police had caught Manoj Kumar, a history-sheeter when he went to attend a birthday party at a guest house. When the cops, in plain clothes, took Manoj in their custody and made him sit in the jeep, some people, including the accused advocates, allegedly manhandled the police and helped Manoj to escape from police custody. The accused advocates were arrested on the basis of videos that had gone viral and sent them to jail on June 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/2-advocates-charged-for-rescuing-history-sheeter-get-conditional-bail/articleshow/83352882.cms||---

---||India||Rural job scheme hours dip in May||NEW DELHI: Employment programme MGNREGS generated around 30 crore persondays of work in May 2021, around half of the same month last year after the onset of pandemic, further proving that rural employment took a hit in the second wave of the pandemic. As the country moves towards easing of curbs with the ebbing of the second wave, there are signs that the job scheme may explode once work resumes at full capacity. The programme recorded 29.7 crore persondays of work in May, the worst phase of the second wave, which is a rough 50% dip from the 56.9 crore persondays notched in the same month in 2020. Times ViewMGNREGS has often served as a lifeline to the rural underprivileged. In these times of lockdowns, when millions of migrant workers have returned to their respective villages, the job guarantee scheme must be implemented with renewed vigour. It can be a lifesaver for millions.The drop points to the impact of the disease in rural areas during the second wave, in stark contrast to last year when the virus was largely limited to cities and towns. The rural populace this time was struck badly by the infections and the local lockdowns imposed to break the chain kept the workers indoors and MGNREGS sites empty. Interestingly, the work pattern aptly maps the onset of pandemic in 2020 and 2021. This April, the job scheme recorded 34.1 crore persondays, much higher than 14.2 crore persondays generated in April 2020. When the pandemic emerged in the country last year, a nationwide lockdown was imposed in March-end and the MGNREGS resumed only after the partial easing of curbs on April 20 — practically consuming entire month and resulting in lower level of work. On the contrary, the second wave hit only in the third week of April 2021 when localized lockdowns across states were announced according to the intensity of the pandemic. The Corona-induced dent on MGNREGS in May 2021 broke the normal course of work pattern witnessed during the year. In March, 25.6 crore persondays of work was generated, slipping from 30.8 crore persondays in February, before rising again in April to 34.1 crore persondays. The MGNREGS work goes up from December to February, albeit not by big margins, before dipping in March and remaining at roughly the same level in April. Then, it rises in May and remains at same level in June, followed by a downward trend again till October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rural-job-scheme-hours-dip-in-may/articleshow/83356919.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Kapoor highlighted that traders, entrepreneurs and cinema, restaurant and hotel owners had been facing financial distress due to prolonged economic restrictions that had hit their business activities since March 2020. “Delhi government has ignored the demands of traders’ bodies till now. Though they need several reliefs, I would like to draw your attention towards waiver of fixed charges in electricity bills. I request you to direct discoms to waive off fixed charges for all traders and factory owners from April 2020 to June 2021,” Kapoor wrote. The cinema, restaurants and hotels industries have been largely closed since April 2020 and had done little business otherwise. “As a preliminary relief, I suggest that they be allowed waiver of fixed charges in electricity bills for the entire financial year 2021-22,” Kapoor wrote.

Ajay Singh, a senior office-bearer of Lal Imli Mill Employees’ Union said that nearly 400 workers of the mill have not been paid their salaries for the last three years whie more than 40 mill workers have died in the last couple of years. Lal Imli is owned by British India Corporation Limited (BIC) and is a public sector undertaking (PSU) of the ministry of textiles. Singh said the mill workers are facing extreme hardships particularly in the ongoing pandemic times as no budgetary allocation has been made for the salaries of the mill workers by the Centre. “We have been approaching the local representatives with our complaints but none paid heed. We staged a protest in front of the residence of the local MLA, met him and handed over a memorandum. We will intensify our stir in the coming days,” he warned.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana extends lockdown till June 19, eases relaxation||HYDERABAD: The Telangana government has extended the lockdown, which is ending on June 9, by another 10 days to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state. The state cabinet, which met here on Tuesday, also decided to extend the relaxation hours from 6 am to 5 pm (presently, the relaxation is between 6 am and 1 pm). A one-hour grace period has been given — up to 6 pm — to enable people reach their homes. This would mean the lockdown will be enforced for 12 hours — from 6 pm to 6 am — till June 19. However, the relaxation in lockdown timings will not be applicable for the assembly constituencies of Sathupally, Madhira, Nalgonda, Nagarjuna Sagar, Devarakonda, Munugode and Miryalaguda. The government took this decision as these constituencies continue to report a surge in positive cases. The present lockdown timings of 6 am to 2 pm will continue in the seven constituencies. Sources said the decision was taken following the recommendations of the health department officials who toured these areas a couple of days ago. The cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao also discussed agriculture, ration cards distribution and developmental works to be taken up by the government. The government had first imposed the lockdown from May 12 and extended till May 30 by providing relaxation in lockdown curbs from 6 am to 10 am. The lockdown was again extended from May 31 till June 9 and the curbs were eased from 6 am to 2 pm, including one-hour additional time to reach homes. It has been decided to constitute a cabinet sub-committee headed by minister T Harish Rao to review infrastructure and facilities in the state-run government hospitals and manpower requirement. The sub-committee will visit states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala where better health care is provided. The panel will also tour Sri Lanka to take stock of health care facilities provided there. Ministers — G Jagadish Reddy, Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Vemula Prashanth Reddy, V Srinivas Goud, P Sabitha Indra Reddy and Satyavathi Rathod — are part of the sub-committee. The cabinet decided to sanction 4,46,169 ration cards which had been kept pending for the last two-and-a-half years. The CM, during his Nagarjuna Sagar poll meeting and even on the floor of the assembly, had assured to disburse new ration cards to eligible beneficiaries and instructed officials to issue them within next fortnight. Giving priority for special food processing zones (FPZs) in all the districts except Hyderabad, the cabinet gave nod for setting up the special FPZs in each zone in 250 acres. The government asked the officials to have rice mills and food processing industries in the proposed TSFPZs. Some district collectors have already identified land for the FPZs on the directions of the CM during the collectors’ conference. The cabinet reviewed monsoon cultivation (kharif agriculture season), preparedness and Rythu Bandhu payments to eligible farmers. The cabinet expressed happiness over increase in cultivation area under Kaleshwaram and other irrigation projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-extends-lockdown-till-june-19-eases-relaxation/articleshow/83354099.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Ahmedabad||Bad roads? Man takes samples for tests under RTI Act||AHMEDABAD: Why did a newly laid road near your society crack and turn into rubble? Just ahead of monsoons an RTI applicant from Kalupur wanted to know how roadworks in the central zone are being undertaken and whether proper quality parameters are met or not. Kalupur resident Pankaj Bhatt was allowed by the Gujarat Information Commission to take road samples almost a month ago. But he finally got a chance on Monday night to inspect a fresh batch of materials used in an ongoing road construction project in Shahibaug under the RTI Act. Bhatt examined whether the temperature of the asphalt is maintained, whether the mettle used was being weighed before being used for roadwork. Bhatt pulled out the road construction manual and pointed out that the weighing machine was not calibrated and also suggested a few more tips from the manual to ensure quality work. Bhatt even took samples of the material and have given them to be tested at a government lab. “We prepared three small sacks of the road sample, one of which stays with the applicant, one with the contractor and the third is given to government accredited lab which is appointed for inspection of road material for tests,” says Bhatt. The AMC ward official had remained present during the entire process and has said that Bhtt will be provided with a test certificate of the samples under RTI Act. It was in early April that state information commissioner Subhash Soni ordered the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to provide a citizen samples from the fresh batch of materials used in an ongoing road construction project under the RTI Act within 15 days. Bhatt took advantage of the very first section of the RTI Act, which defines “Right to Information” as the right to “inspection of work, documents, records; taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or records and even taking certified samples of material. The commission had also went a step further and asked the AMC to provide the RTI applicant a copy of ‘test certificate’ against the material whose sample was provided to the citizen within 15 days. “Though ‘seeking samples, copy of test reports of civic works or inspection of on-site civic works’ comes under them purview of the RTI Act, not many citizens have exercised this right,” says Bhatt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bad-roads-man-takes-samples-for-tests-under-rti-act/articleshow/83351551.cms||---

---||Chennai||Nurse chops off baby’s thumb by mistake at Tamil Nadu hospital||TRICHY: A staff nurse of a Thanjavur hospital accidentally cut off a portion of the thumb of a newborn while removing the paediatric venflon (cannula) from its hand on Monday. The incident happened at the Government Raja Mirasdar Hospital in Thanjavur when the 14-day-old premature girl was being discharged from the hospital. Born to Priyadarshini, 20, of Katoor village at the hospital on May 25, the baby had congenital anomalies and was kept off breast feed by doctors and put on intravenous support. A venflon was placed on her left thumb and wrapped with surgical tape to inject fluids. Since she was recuperating well, doctors decided to discharge her on Monday. A nurse who attempted to remove the venflon from her finger eventually cut a portion of her thumb. On finding blood oozing from the baby’s finger, Priyadarshini raised an alarm. The nurse called the doctors and informed them about the incident. Thanjavur medical college hospital dean G Ravikumar, who is in charge of the hospital, told TOI that a paediatric surgeon carried out a small procedure to suture the finger soon after the incident. Terming it an accident as the nurse was one of the seniormost in the paediatric ward, the dean said the baby seems to have shaken its hand when the nurse was attempting to remove the plaster around the venflon using a scissor. The dean said an inquiry has been ordered and action will be taken if the nurse was found guilty. He said the venflon is removed before discharging any patient. Before the procedure is done on babies, the hand is tied to a scale to make it immobile. Despite all precautionary measures, the incident happened, said the dean. Meanwhile, the baby’s father Ganesan has sought action against the nurse and proper update about the health condition of the baby. “No other baby should undergo such pain,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nurse-cuts-off-babys-thumb-by-mistake/articleshow/83351555.cms||---

In Jaisalmer, 2,281 such migrants have been identified and preparations have begun to get them vaccinated. Rajasthan High Court had recently directed the state government to vaccinate Pak-Hindu migrants and those who recently got Indian citizenship. Barmer district collector Lokbandhu said recently the state government had issued an SOP for Pak-Hindu migrants who do not have any Indian ID card or Aadhaar and for jail inmates. Also, migrants who don’t have Indian citizenship were directed to be vaccinated based on their Pakistan passport. There is a colony for Pakistan displaced people in Chauhatan and a vaccination drive will be organised for them based on their passport. Barmer collector said that 125 jail inmates aged 18 to 45 years and 35 prisoners aged 45 years and above were vaccinated in Barmer jail. He said vaccination drives were being started at the panchayat level to inoculate people above 45 years of age. On Tuesday, there were only 23 positive cases in Barmer and 162 in the entire district. Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi said they had identified 2,281 migrants who don't have Indian identity card or Aadhaar card.

The transfer of Nagaur SP and that too after Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal wrote to chief minister accusing the district police chief of giving patronage to people involved in betting was much talked within police circles. Nagaur has witnessed frequent transfers of SP and the short stints of top cops clearly indicate political interference. Kota SP Vikas Pathak had a small yet meaty stint as Nagaur SP. He spent almost a year after which he was transferred. Outgoing Nagaur SP Shweta Dhankar had been winning accolades on Twitter for her effective crackdown on betting rackets. When contacted on the frequent transfers, DGP M L Lather said, “I think a stint of 10 months to one year is good enough for any SP in a district. Since it is an administrative decision, I can’t comment much on it.” Dhankar had a stint of almost nine months in Nagaur. Senior officers posted in Nagaur claimed that Beniwal had written to chief minister accusing him of giving patronage of those involved in betting and had also met the DGP. “It is evident that the officers who are not gelling well with the local MP were shunted. Such things are demoralizing and senior officers should not let it happen,” said a senior officer posted in Nagaur. Also among the transfers, the shifting of Abhijeet Singh from DCP (East), Jaipur, too was surprising. He had a five-month stint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/political-link-behind-frequent-transfers-of-sps-in-nagaur/articleshow/83351566.cms||---
---||Pune||Delhi, Mumbai top 2 in hazard index for infection, Pune no. 10||PUNE: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, have created a ‘hazard map’ of 446 cities and towns (with populations of over 1 lakh) to identify areas from where pandemic outbreaks can spread rapidly. According to the study, Delhi tops the hazard index of spreading an infection, followed by Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai. Pune is at number 10. IISER’s physics department used transportation networks and mobility patterns to create the map — the lower the rank, the higher is the hazard level. Researchers said infections can travel out from these cities because of the large, well-connected transport hubs. Lead researcher at IISER, M S Santhanam said, “Independent of the severity of infections or location of the outbreak, transportation modes serve to spread them far and wide. This is evident in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases earlier”. The project also used mobility and transport data to assign a risk score to cities if an outbreak occurs in another town or city. Again, lower the rank, higher the risk of infection a region faces. For example, Mumbai is ranked 1 (faces most risk) if Pune reports an outbreak. Satara is ranked 19 and Latur 50. Similarly, if Bengaluru is assigned rank 5 and Hyderabad 8, the former can expect cases to arrive quicker from the region reporting the original outbreak.Explaining the science behind the map, IISER, Pune, team member Onkar Sadekar said, “The basic idea is fairly simple: mobility of people is responsible for the spreadof infection. If mobility patterns of people are known, geographical spread of infection can be mapped out. A hazard rank is assigned using a combination of mathematical models and use of transportation and mobility data.”Another member of the team, Sachin Jain said, “If an infectious disease breaks out in one city, how long would it take for it to reach other towns or cities? This length of time can be a measure of the hazard that can be assigned to other cities. The longer it takes, the lesser the hazard.”Jain said the model can predict hazards from infectious diseases. “The framework can be extended to include multiple locations with outbreaks. We can use it to identify effective ways to selectively block transport to arrest quick spread of disease.” The two other team members were Mansi Budamagunta and G J Srejith. The project has been funded by a special MATRICS grant of the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/delhi-mumbai-top-2-in-hazard-index-for-infection-pune-no-10/articleshow/83352944.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The woman was wearing a red kurti and jumped off the flyover around 5.30pm. Police are trying to verify the details of the woman. She fell on the main road abutting the NTPC office. She had suffered internal injuries. Sudheer Singh, the station house officer of Sector 24 police station, said they received information about the suicide from passersby, some of whom had even tried to persuade the woman against taking the extreme step. A group of commuters took the woman in an auto to the District Hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival. “Some passers-by even tried to stop the woman from jumping off the elevated road, but she was oblivious to all the appeals. Since she did not suffer any external injury, we hoped she would survive. So, we rushed her to the District Hospital. Unfortunately, she had died by then,” a passerby said. The officer said they were not only trying to identify the woman, but also ascertain if she was suffering from any kind of depression. “Since she fell on the concrete road and not on the wet ground, she died due to internal injuries. She seems to be a local, but we are yet to identify her,” he added. In another case of alleged suicide, a 14-year-old girl was found hanging in her room in a highrise in Noida Extension on Sunday afternoon.  The Class IX student would stay with her parents and brother. The police said the girl had just finished her online classes and retired to her room. Her brother tried to enter the room, but found it bolted from inside. “He found her sister had bolted the door from inside the room. They broke open the door and found her hanging from the ceiling fan,” a police officer said. ACP-2 (central Noida) Yogendra Singh told TOI the girl’s family rushed her to a private hospital in Noida Extension, but she had died by then. Singh said though the parents shared information about the alleged suicide, they declined to speak about what could have driven her to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/40-yr-old-woman-jumps-off-elevated-road-dies/articleshow/83354104.cms||---

Nearly 300 respondents came forth to bid for 37 plots over 13,000 sqm of industrial land in Greater Noida’s Surajpur Industrial Area, which has fetched the industrial body over Rs 14 crore, officials said. “We are overwhelmed with the response. This is a shot in the arm for the industrialists in the midst of the Covid pandemic — this certainly shows the industrial sentiment is upbeat,” Mayur Maheshwari, CEO of UPSIDA, told TOI. Each of the 37 plots in the Surajpur Industrial Area has received at least six responses in the e-auction, officials said. “The responses we received for each plot were between six and 15. Because it was an e-auction, the participation was wide,” said Anil Sharma, regional manager, UPSIDA, Gautam Budh Nagar. The basic price of the industrial plots in the Surajpur Industrial Area was fixed at Rs 8,100-8,505 per sqm. The price fetched through the auction is around Rs 14 crore. “The auction has made it possible for us to create massive value enhancement for our industrial plots. This is significant because of the prevailing pandemic situation,” Sharma said. The auction, however, has run into controversy, with local industrial bodies claiming they were not aware of the same. Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) have complained about the same to the UPSIDA and requested for a repeat of the e-auction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/e-auction-37-industrial-plots-fetch-upsida-more-than-rs-14cr/articleshow/83354134.cms||---

The destitute women will receive the benefits of Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana, a government welfare scheme,” he said. The district administration has appealed to citizens that any information about orphan children can be shared on helpline numbers 1098, 7400015518, 8308992222, 9370003517. Meanwhile, the Covid positivity rate of Aurangabad has further dipped to 1.6% by Monday with active cases coming down to 348. The municipal limits of Aurangabad, which are witnessing almost no Covid-related curbs since June 7, have only 30 patients admitted to private hospitals whereas another 82 were opting home isolation. The health authorities have been expanding vaccination coverage to different identified groups, including industrial workforce and citizens, without having any identity proofs with them among others in order to increase the vaccination coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/covid-hit-339-orphans-265-destitute-women-to-get-official-help/articleshow/83347028.cms||---

Sources say that Singla is just a contractual employee, and has been shifted to the planning department, where he will prepare more mission annual program implementation plans (PIPs). The government has, however, maintained that Singla was shifted for being a contractual employee in a post reserved for a permanent worker. It was an audit objection. A permanent employee has replaced Singla, while sources in the mission claimed no irregularities in the purchase of the kit. The government is accused awarding the kit contract for a hefty price of Rs 1,338, as oppose to the kit’s actual worth of Rs 837, thus causing a loss to the exchequer. The first tender was for 180 days but, after ordering only a few thousand kits from the vendor for another higher price of Rs 940, a new tender was floated for Rs 1,226 per kit. The final chosen vendor did not have a medical licence. The opposition has called Singla’s removal as the government’s admission of a scam. The Aam Aadmi Party’s Punjab affairs in-charge and Delhi legislator Jarnail Singh, besides Youth Wing president and MLA Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the Congress government of Captain Amarinder Singh in Punjab was now under siege after the vaccine and Fateh kits scams. Jarnail Singh said: “The Punjab government tarnished the state’s image.” Jarnail Singh and Hayer accused the state government of awarding the Fateh kits tender to a garment manufacturer because the owners of the company were “close to the chief minister. Hayer said: “That’s why the government had issued tenders repeatedly and bought Fateh kits worth Rs 837 for Rs 1,338. Shockingly, it bought 50,000 kits for Rs 1,226.40 each from the second tender and placed another order for 1.5 lakh kits for Rs 1,338.40, even though the third vendor was more expensive than the previous.” The AAP said the Congress will pay for these scams in the 2022 assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-removes-nhm-director-finance-amid-row-over-covid-kits/articleshow/83351599.cms||---

BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has alleged these transactions involved land owner Vibhas Sathe, state transport minister Anil Parab and Sadanand Kadam. “The land transaction registrations of December 30, 2020, between Parab and Kadam are illegal. Hence, I had complained to the sub-registrar,” he said. “Based on Somaiya’s complaint, an inquiry report has been sent to our joint district registrar office. The agreements are being scrutinised and points to stamp duty evasion,” said Bharat Suryavanshi, sub-registrar, Dapoli, on Tuesday. When contacted, Parab said: “I purchased and sold my land. Those who sought the land to be converted into non-agricultural land, besides seeking other permissions including for construction, and the owner of the property are responsible. They will respond to the authorities. The authorities have not sought any papers from me. I will respond to the authorities with all details, including the payments I made, whenever they ask me. But I will not respond to Kirit Somaiya.” The state government ordered a probe into the deals on Monday, and the Centre began probing possible CRZ violations in the development of a resort in Dapoli, a popular tourist destination. “The inquiry points to violations in conversion to non-agricultural land and CRZ violations,” said Ratnagiri collector L N Mishra. A staffer in the Dapoli sub-registrar’s office said: “Sathe was paid Rs 1 crore on May 2, 2017, by Anil Parab towards the agricultural land. Later, the land was registered as non-agricultural land with ground plus one storey permission on June 19, 2019.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-duty-evasion-inquiry-starts-into-parab-land-deal-officials-hint-at-irregularities/articleshow/83352969.cms||Umesh K Parida

The ship was successfully transloaded 80 miles away from the port and 25 miles from the Haldia Dock Complex (HDC). Cape-size vessels are large dry cargo ships that have a capacity to handle 60,000 tonne to 1,30,000 tonne. “Calling of such a cape vessel at the Sagar anchorage’s 9.2m draft is a landmark in the port 151-year-old history,” said SMP chairman Vinit Kumar. “SMP has handled such a bulk carrier despite being saddled with maintaining one of the longest and most unpredictable navigational channels in the world,” he said. MV Lake D, one of the largest cape vessels of its kind with 66,000 tonne of steam coal cargo, is manned by 20 Filipino crew, including Master Martirez Arlan Narisma, and was anchored at Sagar for the first time. The vessel, with 9.2m draft, sailed from Abbot Point in Australia on May 10, refuelled at Singapore, sailed for Sagar anchorage after discharging 95,810 tonne of cargo at Vizag. The overall length or LOA of the vessel, whose registered port is Panama, is 292m. Its beam (or the ship’s width at its widest point) measures 45m. The gross registered tonnage (GRT) is 92,752 and dead weight 1,81,458. The cargo was unloaded with two floating cranes and transported through barges and handled at the Haldia Floating Terminal (HFTPL), outside the lock gate. “SMP Kolkata has constraint of draft in the channel and lock gate operation in the docks. By doing lighterage operation with this vessel, which has a very wide beam and can carry higher parcel load in draft of 9.2m, we have overcome the constraint of draft to a great extent,” SMP spokersperson Sanjoy Kumar Mukherjee said. The cargo, bound for Nepal in rakes, will reduce the transit time and cost and go directly to a floating jetty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-port-hosts-largest-cargo-ship-in-its-151-yr-history/articleshow/83348984.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

As per official data, 22,722 people received the vaccine across 236 sites in the district. Of this, 16m927 people received Covishield and 5,795 received Covaxin doses. With 14,645 vaccinations, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) inoculated the highest number of beneficiaries in the district. As many as 4,565 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Pune’s rural pockets, while 3,512 people received their shots in Pimpri Chinchwad. Tuesday’s drive saw more than 11,000 people in the 18-44 age group getting vaccinated. For Wednesday, PMC stated that Covishield would be available for the 45-plus age group at across 56 centres, with 60% slots available online and 40% onsite. It further stated that 16 centres will host the Covaxin drive for second dose. Those beneficiaries who got their first Covaxin dose before May 12 would be eligible for their second shot on Wednesday. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation said 40 centres will host Covishield sessions for the beneficiaries awaiting their second dose. The civic body said around 25 centres will host Covaxin sessions for beneficiaries due for their second dose from both the 45-plus and the 18-44 age groups. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI that they were awaiting further guidelines following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on June 7. “We will continue to get fewer batches of vaccines until June 21,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-22k-beneficiaries-in-dist-get-shots/articleshow/83351617.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||Covaxin-Covishield study triggers spat||HYDERABAD: A war of words broke out on Twitter after Bharat Biotech’s SARS-CoV-2 project lead Raches Ella questioned the findings of a recent comparative study of the immune responses evoked by Covishield and Covaxin in healthcare workers. The study, conducted on 515 healthcare workers (425 Covishield & 90 Covaxin recipients) and recently uploaded on preprint server MedRxiv, said that Covishield recipients were found to have a higher sero-positivity rate and average rise in anti-spike antibody (ASA) than those who got Covaxin. While Ella pointed out limitations in the study in a string of tweets late on Monday night, the lead researcher, Kolkata-based endocrinologist Awadhesh Kumar Singh objected to Ella pointing fingers at their study when Covaxin’s phase 3 results were yet to be published. Other Twitterati too weighed in on the debate with many of them demanding that Bharat Biotech publish Covaxin’s phase 3 results before trying to point out shortcomings in studies conducted by others. The spat was sparked off when Ella, who also heads business development & advocacy at Bharat Biotech, expressed surprise at researchers and media coming to conclusions based on non-peer-reviewed work on his Twitter handle. “Limitation 1: Spike-based IgG's are not appropriate when evaluating Covaxin, which induces broad antibody responses to Spike, N, and M. Recommend live virus neutralization,” he said. “Limitation 2: Past history of Covid was based on verbal response and not by a pre-vaccination IgG test. The study fails to account for asymptomatics (predominant presentation of Covid) and introduces misclassification bias. SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants may not be naïve after all,” he pointed out. “The Lancet recommends authors refrain from actively seeking media attention for articles that are not peer-reviewed. If contacted by the press, authors clearly need to state these are preliminary findings that have not been peer-reviewed,” he tweeted while tagging the study’s lead author Dr AK Singh. Singh tweeted: “Brother, whole country is getting vaccinated even without a preprint phase 3 results – lest forget published one. We owe a sincere gratitude to Bharat Biotech but that does not mean one should raise finger on others effort. Of course, we will produce published results finally!” Singh also defended the study by pointing out that to understand the difference between the two vaccines only ASA would help in this case. “AZ vaccine being a spike particle can’t induce NC and M Ab then what is point in doing that? It’s a well-known fact that CMI (cell mediated immunity) is least with whole virion vaccines but Big Q is why whole virion V induces less ASA?” he tweeted. Ella then responded to Singh pointing out that he was “not raising fingers, merely citing limitations that have a bearing on the study outcome. Salute your efforts as well. Phase 3 will be out very soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covaxin-covishield-study-triggers-spat/articleshow/83354202.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Noida||NBCC & Suraksha table new Jaypee plans, meet on June 10||NOIDA: Public sector company NBCC and Mumbai-based private realty group Suraksha, the two applicants in the long-winded Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL) insolvency resolution, have filed fresh proposals, which will be weighed by the committee of creditors (CoC) on June 10. If the CoC, which comprises homebuyers and institutional lenders, finds both proposals compliant with the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, the proposals can be put to vote to pick one of the two companies to complete nearly 20,000 flats JIL has to complete at its Wish Town project in Noida. After getting a month’s extension from the Supreme Court, interim resolution professional (IRP) Anuj Jain has sought a second 30-day extension to wrap up the process. The deadline for the first extension was June 8 but more time was sought because the process remained inconclusive as the proposals went back and forth between the companies and the CoC. The insolvency process is in its fourth year. “This is hopefully the last lap of our struggle and a fruitful resolution will come from this round of the process,” said AM Gupta, a buyer. For the thousands of buyers waiting, Suraksha has offered to deliver the flats in a time span of six to 42 months while NBCC has proposed a time frame of 15-42 months. Both have asked for a grace period of 12 months. To settle debts, Suraksha plans to liquidate 2,594 acres of land while NBCC plans to liquidate 1,903 acres. Suraksha plans to keep the Yamuna Expressway while NBCC plans to hive off 90% of it to lenders. “We hope this is going to be the final CoC for the JIL resolution and urge all buyers to cast votes for both resolution applicants to get a fair selection. Buyers have been waiting for a long time and we are now hopeful that a closure is near,” Jayshree Swaminathan, a homebuyer, said. Whoever bags the project will have to complete 19,500 flats at Wish Town in Sector 128, which is likely to require a corpus of Rs 6,000 crore. The insolvency process stretched further after NBCC challenged the IRP’s decision to reject its latest proposal as non-compliant with the IBC.  Instead of a consent vote on Suraksha’s proposal, it was then decided to seek a vote on whether both companies should be given more time to come back with fresh proposals. A majority voted in favour of that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/nbcc-suraksha-table-new-jaypee-plans-meet-on-june-10/articleshow/83354163.cms||Sharmila Bhowmick

Two more are slated to hold their camps later this week. They have been asked by the state government to ensure that all retailers and their staff are vaccinated before malls are given the permission to reopen. Mall developers are expecting that the go-ahead from the government would be given from June 16. City Centre 1 (Salt Lake) and Acropolis Mall started their drives on Tuesday. Quest Mall has finished collating its data and will hold its camp for the retailers and their staff on Thursday and Friday. South City Mall, too, will hold its camp later this week. A total of 482 retailers and their staff at City Centre 1 were jabbed on the first day. The mall had allowed patrons and other people to walk-in at a different time slot to take their jabs and another 378 people came in. At Acropolis, nearly 200 retailers, their staff and office employees were vaccinated on the first day, said mall head, K Vijayan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/malls-start-vaccination-of-retailers/articleshow/83348996.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: Origin of algal bloom to be traced||VARANASI: Taking note of the mushrooming algal blooms in the Ganga that have put a green blanket on the river stream and raised fears of harmful effect to aquatic life, the district administration has started an extensive survey to find out its origin. District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma has set up a high-powered five-member team to look into the matter and submit a detailed report by June 10 after environmentalists expressed concern over the appearance of algae in abundance in Ganga water, which may cause harm to aquatic life of the river. The DM said, “The team will go on a voyage in the boat of Jal Police in search of the source of the algae. The team will also examine how algal blooms covered the stretch of Ganga along the ghats. The algae first appeared around 15-20 days ago, which was examined by the officials of the Pollution Control Board. “It became visible again in the Ganga water in the last three-four days,” said the DM. The team consists of additional city magistrate (II), regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board, assistant commissioner of police (Dashashwamedh), executive engineer of Bandhi Prakhand and general manager of Ganga Pollution Control Unit. The DM has asked the team to submit its report with all details along with photographs and videos. However, according to environmental scientists, it might have come from some side drains or stagnant sources during recent rainfall. It will disappear with increasing flow of water. The UPPCB officials also claimed that it would have come to Varanasi from the upstream of the river. Noted environment scientist and chairman of Malviya Ganga Research Centre at Banaras Hindu University Prof. BD Tripathi said, “It will disappear with increasing flow of water. If the condition persists for a longer duration, it may cause fish mortality. Normally, neurotoxin-microcystin is produced by these algae which may be harmful to other aquatic animals.” A scientist of the Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, BHU, Dr. Kripa Ram said, “The algae grows due to increased nutrients in the water. During rain, these algae flow to the river from fertile lands. After getting adequate nutrients, they start the process of photosynthesis. Phosphate, sulphur and nitrate are the nutrients that help the algae grow.” President of Sankat Mochan Foundation and noted environmental scientist Prof. Vishwambharnath Mishra said that the ecology of the Ganga is being disturbed for commercial gains, which will create serious problems in future. “The construction of a platform in Ganga near Lalita Ghat has obstructed the flow of water. Due to the growth of algae in the upstream of Lalita Ghat, the colour of water has turned green. The presence of abundant algae in Ganga’s water is not good for people’s health,” he added. Meanwhile, raising these issues, a local lawyer Saurabh Tiwari, has also filed a petition at the National Green Tribunal on June 4 seeking intervention of the apex green watchdog into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/origin-of-algal-bloom-to-be-traced/articleshow/83352950.cms||Binay Singh
---||Noida||Few takers, GIMS slashes prices of optional vaccines||Greater Noida: As people stayed indoors because of the second wave of Covid and the resultant lockdown, the demand for optional vaccines such as for Hepatitis A, typhoid, cervical cancer and Japanese encephalitis has dropped drastically. With these vaccines not available at government facilities, the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida is now offering 20-50% discounts on these jabs. The hospital wants to reach larger segments of people, especially in the rural areas of Greater Noida, who do not have access to advanced healthcare facilities.Brigadier Dr RK Gupta (retd), director, GIMS, said, “With number of Covid cases down, we have begun focusing on upgrading and enhancing our facilities for the economically weaker section, especially those living in rural parts of Greater Noida. Being the only government centre in this region, we have started to offer the optional vaccines at affordable rates.”GIMS is offering Hepatitis A vaccine for Rs 1,000 as against Rs 1,600, which is normally charged at private facilities. Typhoid conjugate that costs Rs 1,945 is being offered at Rs 900 at GIMS, while vaccine for cervical cancer is being given at 2,350 and Japanese encephalitis at Rs 600. “We are extending the discounts offered on procurement by a healthcare facility to patients so as to encourage more patients to avail the benefits at our hospital,” said Dr Gupta. “The demand has been less, especially since the Covid outbreak. Because these vaccines are disease specific, mostly private hospitals offer them at different rates,” said Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association, GB Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/few-takers-gims-slashes-prices-of-optional-vaccines/articleshow/83354146.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Delhi||While danger lurks, Delhi unlocks old habits||NEW DELHI: The easing of the Covid-19 lockdown has brought much needed-relief for businesses in Delhi. Public movement has also increased. However, doctors said it was important at this time to spread awareness about the importance of Covid appropriate behaviour, like wearing a mask and maintaining a physical distance, to prevent another surge in infections. Consistently low positivity rates in recent days has led to the relaxation of the lockdown from Monday. Over the last 10 days, the number of positive cases among those tested, has remained below 1%, having touched 36% at April-end. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 316 new cases at a positivity rate of 0.44% and 41 fatalities. Read AlsoDelhi: Confusion and snarls as Phase 2 of unlock beginsThe odd-even plan worked out for markets in the second phase of unlocking of the capital left many show owners confused on Monday because either the numbers of the shops were not in sequence or all shops located within a complex which had a designated number decided to stay open.“A key factor for the spike in Covid cases from March onwards was the lack of adherence to Covid norms. Marriages, get-togethers and political rallies were held with little or no regard for preventive measures such as masks. We must not repeat that,” asserted Dr Shuchin Bajaj, founder and director, Ujala Cygnus group of Hospitals. On Monday, the first day of markets and malls opening, many people were seen without a mask. Bajaj pointed out, “We have to remember that vaccination doesn’t fully protect an individual from corona infection. She or he can still bring the disease home and infect their families. We have to keep following the Covid precautions until everybody gets inoculated.” Recalling the shudder that the resurgence of Covid sent down Delhiites’ spines, Gaurav Thukral, COO, Healthcare at Home, cautioned, “If we really don’t want to see a repeat of that nightmare, then the least we can do is to mask up properly. It’s important for our own family and the loved ones whom we don’t want to lose. The government will have to use a stick-and-carrot approach and take initiatives to change the behaviour of the public at large. South Asian nations that have been masking are examples to follow,” In fact, Dr S K Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, advised a “self-lockdown” for people. “They should go out only if it is really important and then strictly observe Covid-appropriate behaviour until at least 70% of the population is fully vaccinated,” he elaborated. According to Dr Rommel Tickoo, director, internal medicine, Max Healthcare, the majority of the people don’t even wear the mask properly. A mask has to completely cover the nose and the mouth and snugly fit the face without leaving gaps, he said. Tickoo recommended strict government enforcement of masks and physical distancing in public places to prevent the spread of Covid. “Masks should be made easily available and could even be distributed to the general public on a large scale. Anyone caught not wearing a mask outside their homes should be fined and the amount doubled for every subsequent violation,” prescribed Tickoo. Reiterating this was Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-Doc. “It is imperative that we should strictly continue with the mask up policy for at least three months,” he declared. “Punitive action against violators should continue. Any relaxation can be done after most of Delhi’s population is fully vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/while-danger-lurks-delhi-unlocks-old-habits/articleshow/83351633.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Kolkata||Air accident investigators probe flight turbulence||Kolkata: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is looking into the extreme turbulence in the Vistara Mumbai-Kolkata flight on Monday that led to injuries to eight passengers. Four of them had to be hospitalized. On Tuesday, an AAIB officer spoke to the pilots, cabin crew and injured passengers, including the two persons who are undergoing treatment in hospital, to determine what led to the incident. Planes hitting an air pocket and experiencing extreme turbulence during pre-monsoon, either in the east or north-east, isn’t uncommon. However, injury to passengers requiring hospitalization is rare. According to sources, AAIB will look into several factors involving the cockpit crew, cabin crew and passengers on board the Boeing B 737-800 aircraft. The questions posed to the pilots include whether they could have taken a detour to avoid the treacherous weather that the meteorological office had warned and whether the captain had sounded out a timely warning to passengers that the plane was heading into rough weather and they needed to buckle up. The investigation will also look into whether the cabin crew had quickly checked if all passengers were strapped before they themselves returned to their seats near the front and the rear exits to strap up and brace for the turbulence. Finally, the officials will also check if the passengers ignored the ‘fasten seat belt’ sign as well as the captain’s warning and got thrown around when the plane pitched and rolled, leading to injuries. One passenger suffered a fracture in her right arm while another had a gash in his scalp. Yet another elderly passenger complained of tenderness in the spinal region. The fourth passenger who had required hospitalization had complained of neck pain. According to a source in the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the seat belts were checked after the passengers alighted from the aircraft and were found to be intact, indicating that they did not snap or malfunction. “The passengers that were injured were all seated to the rear of the aircraft. They experienced more turbulence than those seated in front. While the woman who suffered an arm fracture was seated in 39D, the father-son duo was seated in 26A and 26B. The man who received a cut in the head was in seat 34B. All their seat belts were checked and found to be intact and functional,” the source said. Investigations into turbulence-related injuries in the past have shown that they were mostly due to non-compliance with the ‘fasten seat belt’ sign and announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/air-accident-investigators-probe-flight-turbulence/articleshow/83349048.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The district administration has also sent letters to all MLAs in the district asking them to adopt one CHC or PHC in their respective area. “We have received the letter regarding adoption of Hathi Bazar CHC by the CM on Monday evening. This CHC is in the Sevapuri model block,” district magistrate (DM) Kaushal Raj Sharma told TOI on Tuesday. “Currently, the CHC has one 15-bed ward in its indoor patient department (IPD),” said the DM adding, “After the adoption, the CHC will get two more wards of 15 beds each. It will not only become a 45-bed hospital, but a shed would also be constructed for the attendants of patients admitted in the IPD,” he added. Besides, an oxygen plant is also being installed at the CHC with corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, he said. The CHC has five oxygen concentrators while the CM will send 10 more concentrators soon. A pathology lab is also being established at this CHC, said the DM, mentioning that around Rs 1 crore will be spent for the modernisation of the CHC. The Niti Ayog had selected Sevapuri block to develop as the first model block of the country by saturating all its villages with government schemes and elevating the life standard of all by measuring them on the prescribed key performance indicators in 2020. “The administration has sent letters to all MLAs in the district asking them to adopt one CHC or PHC of their respective area,” he said adding, “Around Rs 25 lakh would be spent from their funds for associated work, including installation of oxygen supply pipelines and purchasing of medical equipment.” The DM said that all the staff of CHCs and PHCs, who were attached to major hospitals in the past, have been relieved and sent back to their respective centres. The block development officers have also been asked to ensure completion of civil work, including construction of platforms for installation of oxygen plants, minor and major repairs at each of 37 CHCs, PHCs and additional health centres by June 30. The DM along with chief medical officer (CMO) and other officials also took stock of the condition and facilities of Hathi Bajar CHC and asked the officials to streamline all arrangements within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cm-yogi-adopts-hathi-bazar-chc-of-sevapuri/articleshow/83352993.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Baramati had been under complete lockdown-like situation since April 4 to contain the spread of coronavirus. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer of Zilla Parishad, Pune, told TOI, “Since the Covid-19 positivity rate in Baramati tehsil has dropped to less than 10%, we have lifted the restrictions. Essential, non-essential shops and other business establishments are permitted to operate in line with the other 12 tehsils in the district.” Prasad categorically added that the rural areas are still under restrictions and there has been no fresh order issued by the district administration. “The Covid positivity rate in rural Pune has come down to less than 10%. However, the decision on restrictions will be taken during the weekly review meeting, which will be chaired by deputy chief minister and district guardian minister Ajit Pawar,” Prasad stated. Baramati has recorded a total of 24,704 Covid-19 positive cases since the outbreak of the virus. Of the total, 23,518 patients have been discharged after recovery, while 629 people have succumbed to the virus till date. Currently, there are 557 active cases in the tehsil. Pronima Taware, president of Baramati Municipal Council, said, “Ours was the only tehsil in the district that had gone for complete lockdown before the state-imposed restrictions. People and business establishments have suffered financial losses in the last two months.” Narendra Gujarati, president of Baramati Traders Association, said, “The lockdown has completely disturbed the economical equation here. Reopening was essential to curb financial losses. Many traders would struggle to pay rent and fill stocks due to their poor financial condition.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/curbs-relaxed-in-baramati-tehsil/articleshow/83351650.cms||Sandip Dighe

In fact, the heat-island effect created in the city due to the presence of glass and concrete structures, coupled with polluting particles like carbon and sulphur, create the perfect ingredient to trigger lightning flashes when low-hanging thick cumulonimbus clouds form over the city, particularly between April and June, said Presidency geography professor Soumendu Chatterjee. Many attribute the rise in SPM count in Kolkata to the increased lightning intensity in recent years. There have been multiple deaths on account of this. A young cricketer had suffered a heart attack after lightning flashed near him at Deshapriya Park in June 2018. A month later, a couple was struck by lightning near the Red Road-Mayo Road intersection. One of them died and the other was hospitalised. In August 2019, one person was killed and 16 injured when lightning struck at the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds. "The 8-10km thick thunderclouds develop in the west and travel over south Bengal on their way to Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal. Kolkata lies in the squall line in south Bengal through which these clouds pass. Hence, the city is prone to experiencing lightning strikes," explained Calcutta University geography professor Lakshmi Narayan Satpati. Climatologists, though, say improved early detection, warning and communication can save lives from lightning strikes in future. “With the help of advanced satellite and remote sensing techniques and thermal images, it has become easy to give warnings at least 30 minutes before any thunderstorm. It is most important to reach out to stakeholders like farmers in the field, labourers under open sky or pedestrians. If we do it on a regular basis, many such deaths can be avoided,” said Dr Nariwita Bandyopadhyay, a climatologist. The geostationary satellite has thunderstorm detectors that can detect in-cloud lightning and on-ground lightning quite accurately. But dissemination of interpreted data is most important. “The lightning (which is a static electricity) is particularly dangerous for farm fields filled with water. Water being a conductor of electricity can electrify an entire field. It is not advisable to take shelter below trees, which are mostly positively charged and attract thunder from the negatively charged cloud,” she added. One of the techniques in the field is to crouch on the ground at the time of lightning. The person will be saved. People must switch off their electronic gadgets, including mobile phones. Inside the home, people must stand apart from the doors and windows. They must switch off televisions, ACs and plug off the devices. They must not bathe or wash or clean utensils as water is a good conductor and the water pipe can be electrified. People can install lightning arresters on the houses and even lightning detectors. Since lightning can trigger inferno in the forest and even in houses, an evacuation system must be in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-susceptible-to-lightning-strikes-warn-experts/articleshow/83349028.cms||Subhro Niyogi

But only 11 to 15 per cent of children in the five to nine years group have iron deficiency compared to iron deficiency in 30 to 32 per cent of preschool children and adolescent girls, researchers said. The pan-India study by the premier nutrition agency in the country revealed that though many children had good intake of diet rich in iron, the synthesis of haemoglobin is poor in the body, resulting in iron deficiency. Although anaemia prevalence was higher in the rural and poorer children and adolescents, their iron status was better. This is not the case with children in cities and towns. The NIN team attributed this to the possible inefficient utilization of stored iron for haemoglobin synthesis in the poorer children and adolescents. Dr Bharati Kulkarni, senior scientist, who led the research, said: “Diet quality is important for efficient haemoglobin synthesis, as iron is not the only nutrient required. Many other nutrients are also essential.” “Underutilization of iron for haemoglobin synthesis in poorer communities could be linked with overall low diet quality, particularly low intake of meat and fruits. Moreover, highly prevalent infections due to unhygienic environment also reduce iron absorption and haemoglobin synthesis,” study published in the latest issue of the Journal of Nutrition said. NIN director Dr Hemalatha R said population-level surveys usually measure only haemoglobin in the blood which is often used as a proxy to estimate the iron deficiency in the population. “When anaemia prevalence increases in subsequent surveys, usually, iron supplementation interventions through supplemental iron tablets or iron fortification of foods is intensified. But are these solutions that focus merely on increasing intake of iron enough to reduce anaemia prevalence in India? It does not seem so as per this recent study”, she said. Stating that though anaemia prevalence was higher in the rural and poorer children and adolescents, counter-intuitively, iron deficiency was less common among these people. Similarly, although anaemia as measured by haemoglobin status was lower among their urban counterparts, iron deficiency was seen more in them. “This finding provides new insights into the public health problem of anaemia which according to some nation-wide surveys affects almost 40-50% women and children in India and may prompt a relook at the current approaches to the problem. There are several issues like quality of diet, infections and socio-economic factors that may need to be addressed to tackle the problem,” the researchers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/30-pre-school-kids-suffer-from-iron-deficiency-nin-study/articleshow/83354260.cms||Syed Akbar

The building had been inaugurated by chancellor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on December 19, 2019, and just one-and-a-half-years later, it is falling apart, said NU officials. The ceiling collapsed like a pack of cards in the corridor of Academic Section of the building on Amravati Road, which houses pro-vice chancellor Sanjay Dudhe’s office. Fortunately, no one was injured. Only the portion in corridors is damaged while the structure inside the cabins of NU officials is intact. Recently, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had proposed to set up a temporary children’s hospital in this building in anticipation of possible third wave of Covid-19 virus. The proposal was floated by mayor Dayashankar Tiwari, who also visited the premises and expressed satisfaction over the facilities. After Tuesday’s incident, NU officials were apprehensive about the safety. “I have just confirmed from our deputy engineer Sheshrao Tajne about the collapse. The possibility of substandard material being used can’t be ruled out at the moment. I told him to take a look at the material and inform me accordingly,” registrar Anil Hirekhan told TOI. He added that only civil engineers possessing technical knowledge would be in a position to confirm whether substandard material has been used by the contractor. NU officials blamed contractor – DV Patel and Company — that had constructed the building and interiors. The firm inordinately delayed completion of the new building, built with Rs15 crore corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds from Bajaj Group of Industries, while rest was contributed by the university. Bhavesh Patel, the contractor, denied any use of substandard material in the construction. “It’s not our lookout now, as we had already handed over the complex to NU. We don’t have any role in any damage to the building,” he told TOI. Tajne too ruled out any possibility of use of inferior quality material, saying that the ceiling collapsed due to strong winds flowing through the corridors. “Please understand that it wasn’t a plaster of Paris ceiling, but those were gypsum boards suspended from the frame. Wind can enter into the block from the main door and windows. Due to long corridors, the air pressure increased and damaged the portion.” He added that he had fixed a meeting with Thane–based consultant Koranne, which was awarded contract for maintenance, at 11am. “We will take remedial measures to avoid such incidents in future in case of strong winds like today. The registrar would also be there.” NU got occupancy certificate on June 5 NU had not received the occupancy certificates (OC) for the new building’s second, third and fourth floor till last week, some 1.5 years after its inauguration. “We received OC on June 5 and now we can shift our offices there. We’ve also installed four lifts – two each in front and side. NMC would be opening a children’s Covid hospital on these floors,” Tajne said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-buildings-false-ceiling-collapses-just-1-5-yrs-after-inauguration/articleshow/83351740.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Medical superintendent of BHU hospital Prof KK Gupta said, “As per the morning report, black fungus tally has reached 169 while 37 have died so far.” As per records available with Prof Gupta, as many as 46 new cases were detected between June 1 and 7 taking the tally up to 169. In the same week, 18 black fungus patients breathed their last taking the toll to 37. “Nine patients have been discharged after getting cured while 123 are under treatment,” he said adding, “six of them are admitted in Covid ward while others are in non-Covid wards of the hospital.” A total of 102 surgeries have been conducted upon mucormycosis infected patients at this hospital. The doctors at the hospital had started detecting black fungus cases since April 30. A woman from Azamgarh, who was also comorbid and Covid-19 positive, was the first to succumb to this infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/123-black-fungus-patients-at-bhu-hospital/articleshow/83353007.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Rural areas report less than 10,000 active Covid cases||PUNE: The number of active Covid cases in rural parts of the district has now slipped below 10,000 with a recovery rate of over 95%. Data revealed that in the last eight days, Pune rural recorded less than 1,000 daily cases. Recoveries are almost double that number. Officials said a month ago, the recovery rate in these parts was at 82% with some pockets adding as many as 4,000 cases daily. The situation has now improved, thanks to the 13% increase in recoveries. The Pune rural data matches Covid-19 trends in urban centres. The recovery rate in Pune city and Pimpri Chinchwad limits has already crossed 95%. In PMC limits, officials have even started to close Covid care centres due to the drop in the number of new cases. Health officials said focus on pockets reporting more cases helped contain the spread. Measures to catch symptoms early in people were also launched. “The number of hotspots had increased in rural areas after a spurt in Covid-19 cases. Drives were initiated to identify those with flu-like symptoms. Contract tracing and testing were also increased in these hotspot areas. Daily sample testing was increased to 19,000,” one health official said. Besides testing and tracing, officials from the administration also intensified Covid restrictions to stop unnecessary movement and prevent large gatherings. Spikes in some regions last year were attributed to large gatherings and weddings where the number of guests exceeded safe levels. Overall, vital indicators seem to have stabilised for now. Nearly 2.7 lakh patients have recovered in rural areas so far as against a positive caseload of 2.84 lakh. “Our teams are monitoring daily cases. No pocket in the rural areas has recorded a spurt in cases in the last few days. We are expecting the trend to continue,” said district health officer Bhagwan Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rural-areas-report-less-than-10000-active-cases/articleshow/83351673.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Delhi||Delhi Unlock 2.0: Footfall, Covid norm adherence low in markets||NEW DELHI: Business activity in retail markets continued to be low on the second day of the current phase of unlocking, but traders’ associations were hopeful that consumer confidence would start building up in a few days. As of now, most of the transactions are taking place in wholesale markets where small retailers are restocking their outlets. A crowded Gandhi Nagar market on Day 2 of #unlock #Delhi #Covid19 #pandemic https://t.co/RBFlrioDef— TOI Delhi (@TOIDelhi) 1623181400000The Confederation of All India Traders estimates that less than 10% of normal trade has resumed. However, some market associations point out that trade in June has always remained low and concentrated during late evenings. Some traders’ associations have demanded that curfew timings be modified to give additional shopping time in the evening, while others argue for a staggered timing system instead of imposing an odd-even opening of outlets. Ashok Randhawa, member of Sarojini Nagar market association, said people were probably reluctant to come out due to the high temperatures through the day. “One one hand, people are still fearful of Covid and black fungus and, on the other, the sweltering heat makes it impossible for them to shop in the afternoon. Instead of opening the markets from 10am to 8pm, we can go for 11am-9pm timings so that people can shop and get back in time,” he added. Praveen Khandelwal, who heads the Confederation of All India Traders, said wholesale trade was seeing more activity as smaller shop owners were restocking their outlets. Retail business, however, remained negligible, he said. “Less than 10% business has resumed in Delhi. After consultations with several hundred market associations, we had proposed a staggered time-based opening of retail and wholesale markets. Customers do not know which shops will be open or closed and comprehensive buying of multiple items is not possible,” he said. Rajender Sharda, who heads GK-I M Block market association, said the number of customers still remained low. “Historically, the trade volume remains low in Delhi during June due to the heat. It will take some more days for consumer confidence to return,” he said. Traders in Walled City were more positive. Sanjay Bhargava from Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal said: “We have seen good footfall since yesterday, unlike the unlocking exercise previous year when the streets were deserted. The economy will bounce back if we take proper precautions and the customers feel safe. This is usually a lean season anyway,” he added. Teams of 3-4 police officers each have been deployed in the area to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. However, social-distancing norms again went for a toss and mask compliance was very low in wholesale markets like east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar and Sadar Bazar in Walled City.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/footfall-covid-norm-adherence-low-in-markets/articleshow/83351661.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Breather on rain harvesting regulations till September 30||NEW DELHI: The deadline for installing rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems without attracting any penalty has been deferred by six months to September 30. The decision has been taken due to the second Covid wave in the city, an order issued by Delhi Jal Board (DJB) states. If anyone has paid the penalty, it will be reversed in the next bill, an official said. The previous deadline was April 1. RWH units have been made mandatory in Delhi in plots above 100 sqm and non-compliance invites a penalty amounting to 1.5 times the bill. On the other hand, a 10% rebate is provided for a functional RWH system. Delhi receives an annual average rainfall of 617mm and 917 million cubic metres of rainwater can be used to recharge its depleting groundwater levels. As per the Delhi water and sewer regulations, a rebate of 10% of the total bill is provided to popularise the idea. Last August, DJB had made it mandatory for all properties of 100 sqm and above to have functional rainwater harvesting systems. Rain centres have been set up in each district from where anyone can know about the guidelines, needs, basic structure and rebates. “DJB has achieved a near completion in installation of RWH system in its own buildings,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/breather-on-rain-harvesting-regulations-till-september-30/articleshow/83351667.cms||---

The woman identified as Shahidabano Saiyyad is a police constable posted at Kheralu police station. Saiyyad said in her complaint that she was married to Zakir Husain Salat who works at Bhabhar judicial court in Banaskantha. The couple have a six-year-old daughter. Saiyyad told the police that she spotted her husband with an unknown woman in Kheralu on Monday. She followed them and reached Behlim Vas where she confronted him. Zakir got furious and told his wife that he will go around with any number of women and she shouldn’t interfere in his life. He then pronounced triple talaq on the spot. An upset Saiyyad left the spot and approached the police to file a complaint against him. The cops have registered a complaint under section 3 and 4 of The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019. Saiyad also said in her complaint that she was being harassed mentally by Zakir since their daughter was born. She also alleged that he used to demand money from her as he was under debt. In 2019, the Indian government termed triple talaq as unconstitutional and made it a punishable act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cop-books-hubby-for-giving-her-triple-talaq/articleshow/83349083.cms||---

Bapat said thanked the Union government for this decision and said that it will offer a huge financial relief for the states. Bapat said, “The state government which was ready to pay for the vaccine procurement in a single instalment, should now announce a package for those who have suffered huge financial losses because of the pandemic. The money saved should be utilized immediately for the benefit of the poor.”He added that the state government should announce a vaccination programme to implement the free-of-cost drive. The state government should give top priority to save the lives of citizens without indulging in politics, he added.The MVA government has already announced monetary relief for autorickshaw drivers who have to upload their documents to get the benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bapat-urges-state-to-help-poor-with-funds/articleshow/83351708.cms||---
---||Delhi||A year on, show of support for Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal in northeast Delhi riots case||New Delhi: A year after the arrests of Pinjra Tod members Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal in a northeast Delhi riots case, many came out to show solidarity on Tuesday. One of them was Mohammad Aamir Khan, who himself had to fight for 14 years before he was acquitted of terrorism charges. When he was arrested, Khan said, his family was harassed. Such incidents also impact family members, he added. “Natasha’s father also faced a lot and needed support,” he said, referring to the death of Mahavir Narwal, who died due to Covid-19 while she was in jail. The situation hasn’t “improved much but at least now people come out to discuss and show solidarity for those who are arrested wrongly”. Khan pointed out, “When Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act was enacted, many civil society members from India and abroad opposed it saying that it was against the Constitution. Under these laws, we need years to prove our innocence. Even lawyers did not come ahead to help us.” Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani said more such events should be oragnised so that “people know who the arrested people are and the reasons behind their arrests”. Mevani added, “We see that draconian laws are used by all states and there has neither been any substantial consensus against these nor any pressure created by the public. These human rights violations have happened in multiple states, for years and by multiple governments.” He urged people to put pressure on parties and governments to act against draconian laws. Many of those arrested are given bail on multiple charges, but they still remain in jail due to Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, said Mevani. “This shows that the law is created in a way so that people can’t come out of jail... People are in jail for months despite no evidence against them.” People who had fought against the Citizenship Amendment Act did so for nation building, the MLA said, claiming that “the fact that they got arrested shows that the government only believes in attacking them”. JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh said many in jail were students from JNU. “They have been targeted as they were speaking up and challenging the system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-year-on-show-of-support-for-kalita-narwal-in-riot-case/articleshow/83351711.cms||---

It has been observed that about 30% of the Covid patients have developed post-infection problems, requiring treatment and readmission in certain cases. The health experts feel that the recovery period of patients infected during the second wave is likely to be around three months, especially for those suffering from pre-existing chronic ailments and whose condition was critical. A large number of patients, especially those who were critical, after recovering are seeking medical help for fatigue, cough, sore throat, palpitations, body aches and insomnia. Unlike the first wave of infection that had hit the state last year, many patients are being readmitted to hospitals for oxygen support after recovery due to breathlessness caused by decreased lung capacity. About 20% of Covid infected patients in Government Medical College in Patiala had to be readmitted and put on oxygen support after they had been cured. Due to steroid use, many of them have developed fungal infection (Mucormycosis), others are seeing elevated blood sugar levels and some have started exhibiting symptoms of neurological and cardiovascular ailments. Among children, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), a condition in different body parts including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin and eyes get inflamed, have been reported. Dr Bimal Garg, a private physician in Faridkot, said he was being approached by 8-10 post-Covid patients on a daily basis. Dr KK Talwar, Punjab government’s adviser on health issues, acknowledged that a substantial number of people are approaching health facilities for treatment of health issues developed after recovery. He, however, said that the majority these complications are minor and only a small proportion of recovered patients have so far developed serious complication. Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president of Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (SIPHER), maintained that people are developing different types of post-Covid health problems for which mostly symptomatic treatment is required in consultation with a physician. As there has been a steep rise in the number of such patients during the second wave as compared to the first wave, Dr Gupta said the state government needs to come out with an action plan for providing appropriate treatment to such patients. “Proper follow up of such patients is required to help them recover fully,” he said. The state government is running dedicated post-Covid outdoor patient department (OPD's) services in all the three government-run medical colleges for such patients. Principal secretary of the department of medical education and research DK Tiwari said that doctors from different streams have been entrusted with the responsibility of examining patients in these OPDs. The government is all set to start dedicated post-Covid wards in all government hospitals having Level-III facilities. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said such wards will initially be set up in Government hospitals in Ludhiana and Jalandhar and will have oxygen-supported beds. "The focus will be on complete rehabilitation of patients," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/post-covid-problems-in-30-cured-punjab-cases/articleshow/83351679.cms||Vinod Kumar

The Gujarat government has proposed a Rs 700 crore pipeline project to transport treated water from the common effluent treatment plants (CETP) in Jetpur to Porbandar. The fishing community has raised concern over the impact of the project on future of fishing industry that thrives on exports to Europe and US. They apprehend that dumping of effluent into deep sea will not only adversely impact the fish population but also contaminate the marine organisms. According to fishermen, the project will affect fishing activity in Porbandar, Veraval, Mangrol and Okha, where over 30,000 people are engaged directly with the fishing business. Fish production along Saurashtra coast is about 6 lakh tonnes per year, out of which 2 lakh tonnes is exported resulting in earning of Rs 5,000 crore annually. Shree Akhil Gujarat Macchimar Mahamandal (AGMM), representing the fishing community in the state, on Monday, wrote to chief minister Vijay Rupani demanding suspension of the effluent pipeline project. “The fishermen community is already in financial distress due to Covid-induced lockdown worldwide and the recent cyclones that ravaged the fishing villages. Several factories having units on the coast are already polluting the sea. Many species of fish are already on the verge of extinction. If Jeptur’s polluted water is discharged into the sea, it will ruin the future fishing prospects.” Gopal Fofandi, president of AGMM told TOI, “This is a very serious issue as it will destroy the entire seafood industry. If our concerns are not heard, we are willing to fight it out.” President of Porbandar Fishermen’s Association, Bharat Modi said “The polluted water (from Jetpur) will kill the fish in area 15 nautical mile from the shore where the small fishermen do fishing. If the government wants to spend this much money they should make a plan to use treated water for irrigation or in the industry.” Environment activist Rohit Prajapati said that industries have already polluted water of Sabarmati water and Mahi rivers. “Here the government will be creating more problems than solving the pollution issue in Bhadar river. The polluted water in the sea will not only reduce the catch but it will contaminate the seafood which may affect human health and directly impact the revenue of the fishing community.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/dumping-jetpurs-effluents-in-deep-sea-worries-fishermen/articleshow/83349166.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Lidwina Joseph, a fifth standard student in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Thrissur, Kerala, sent a letter reflecting the awareness of today’s young population. She said, “I was much worried about the deaths in Delhi and other parts of country due to corona. From the newspaper, I understood that your honourable court has intervened effectively in the suffering and deaths of people in the fight against Covid-19. I am happy and feel proud your honourable court has passed orders for supply of oxygen and saved many lives. I understand your honourable court has initiated effective steps in bringing down Covid and death rate in our country, especially in Delhi. I thank you, your honour, for this.” She was probably referring to the SC taking up issues relating to short supply of oxygen to Delhi and some other states during the pandemic’s peak and the Centre being directed by the SC to maintain optimum supply of oxygen to Delhi. Responding to the girl’s letter, the CJI said, “I have received your beautiful letter along with a heart-warming illustration of the judge at work. I am really impressed with the way you kept track of happenings in the country and the concern that you have displayed for the well-being of people... I am sure you will grow up into an alert, informed and responsible citizen who’ll contribute immensely towards nation building.” A few days ago, the CJI had responded to a Class 12 student from Andhra Pradesh, Potluri Darshet, who sent a letter written in flawless Telugu. The CJI appreciated his effort and said it was rare these days to come across youngsters writing letters in their mother tongue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/class-5-kerala-girls-letter-gets-justice-cji-writes-back/articleshow/83357200.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The notification was issued in January and the land was transferred to the forest department last week. This is one of two acts of land handover to the forest department of late, the other having been the transfer of 712 acres of Aarey Milk Colony land to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park by the government early this week. Maharashtra implemented a mangrove conservation programme on government land after the Bombay high court declared these as protected forests in 2015. Later mangroves were declared reserved forests. A joint inspection of mangroves on government land was carried out by the state revenue and forest officials in Mira-Bhayander from June 2 to 4. In a statement, revenue officer from Bhayander Prashant Kapde and forest officer from Thane mangroves cell Sachin More said that while the mangroves had been notified as reserved forests, a decision on encroachments on some of the land is still to be taken. The forest department will be responsible for the conservation and protection of these mangroves. The survey to identify and demarcate the mangrove cover began in November 2019. Mangroves in Versova, Ghodbunder, Penkarpada, Navghar, Utan, Tarodi, Chowk, Murdha, Rai and Bhayandar have been notified as reserved forests. Of these, Utan in Bhayander (west) has over 616 hectares of mangrove forest. Environmental activist Dhiraj Parab, who has been fighting to save the mangroves in Mira-Bhayander, said more mangroves in the region need to fall under the reserved forests category. “For instance, in Survey No. 15 extending from Jesal Park Chowpatty in Bhayander (east) to Ghodbunder, only 25 hectares have been earmarked as reserved, whereas the actual stretch is over 37 hectares,” said Parab. He said salt pan land owned by the state and on which mangroves exist is has not part of the notification. Parab said that the destruction of mangroves on private land in the region by a nexus of builders and politicians also needs to be taken into account. He said that the civic body played a big role in destroying mangroves and constructing the Jesal Park Chowpatty in 2013. Parab had petitioned the court against the civic body then. Officials said encroachments details are being studied and a plan to restore mangroves is being worked out. In March, over 409 hectares of mangroves in Alibaug, Raigad district, were declared reserved forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-transfers-mangroves-on-1036ha-to-forest-department/articleshow/83353122.cms||Sandhya Nair

The 20-year-old victim was a third-year student and resident of Vembakkam village. She has been posting several of her pictures on social media sites and unknown miscreants had morphed and uploaded them on other portals. After her brother and friends inquired about her pictures along with another man being circulated online, she went missing from home on Sunday. She was later found dead inside an abandoned well. Police said the person in the photograph was a college student from the same locality. Incidentally, both of them were students of a same tuition centre. When the victim confronted the youth about the picture, he denied any role and said he suspected it to be the work of some miscreants, police, quoting sources, said. The victim, who was previously warned by her family over posting pictures on social media, was distraught by the incident and feared that it may bring disrepute to her family. She was also receiving multiple phone calls from her friends about the photograph, police said. Frustrated over this, she left home on Sunday without telling anyone. Her family members who were searching for her, finally found her dead in an abandoned farm well. Police recovered the body and sent it for postmortem. Chengalpattu taluk police have registered a case. Preliminary inquiries with the youth revealed that they were friends and someone had deliberately done it. Chengalpattu taluk police have traced four different social media IDs from which the photographs have been uploaded. “One picture and two IDs have already been deleted by the person who posted it. We are tracking the other two,” a police officer said. Police have detained the youth for questioning. They are also probing whether it could be an act of revenge by a spurned lover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-college-girl-ends-life-after-morphed-pics-appear-online/articleshow/83351697.cms||---

After making an onset over Pune and parts of the Konkan region on June 6, the monsoon has stalled over the Indian east coast and interiors of Maharashtra, said Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division at IMD-Pune. The monsoon remained stalled on Tuesday as well, IMD said. “Monsoon has stalled over Maharashtra and adjoining regions in south peninsular India as there has been no significant system driving its movement the past few days. Its progress after June 6 has been poor over eastern parts of southern peninsular India, such as Telangana, the Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions of Andhra Pradesh, as well as interior parts of Maharashtra. Though Konkan-Goa are getting some rainfall, the amount has not been sufficient in adjacent areas to push the line of monsoon advancement further,” said Kashyapi. Kashyapi said the monsoon has so far made an onset over nine districts in Maharashtra — Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Satara, Kolhapur, Solapur, south Raigad, Pune and Osmanabad. Places north of Osmanabad, such as Mumbai, Beed, Latur, and Ahmednagar, have seen little to no rainfall. “The offshore trough that was providing rainfall over Mumbai and adjoining areas till Tuesday became less marked. However, from June 10 evening, monsoon may get activated over Maharashtra, courtesy the low-pressure area set to form over and around north Bay of Bengal on June 11. Under its influence, widespread rainfall activity with isolated to scattered heavy rain is likely over most of eastern India and central India from June 10,” he said. Due to the strengthening of westerly winds along the west coast, enhanced rainfall activity is also likely along the west coast, including Maharashtra, from June 11, with isolated very heavy rainfall over Konkan and Goa on June 11, the forecast said. Scattered heavy to very heavy rainfall is also expected over Konkan and Goa on June 12. Madhya Maharashtra’s ghat areas have also been put on heavy rainfall alert at isolated places on June 11 and 12. “The low-pressure area is expected to aid moisture incursion into Maharashtra, even from the Arabian Sea, by the strengthening of westerly winds (which would case packed isobars over the Arabian Sea). This is likely to result in monsoon revival in Maharashtra,” said Kashyapi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-likely-to-cover-maha-by-june-11-says-imd/articleshow/83351730.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Monsoon onset likely today, orange alert for Saturday, says IMD||MUMBAI: IMD said on Tuesday weather conditions were favorable for monsoon onset to be declared over Mumbai on June 9, and the city and adjoining areas like Thane can expect heavy rain at isolated places from Thursday (June 10), with IMD issuing a yellow alert. The weather bureau issued an orange alert for June 12 (Saturday), indicating heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places. June 9 is two days earlier than the official onset date. Last year, the onset was on June 14. Shubangi Bhute, scientist (IMD), said, “Many parts of Mumbai are already reporting rain. Conditions are favorable for monsoon onset in Konkan region, including Mumbai. There are chances of heavy rain in some areas in the coming days,” said Bhute. IMD said thunderstorms accompanied with lightning/gusty wind and heavy rain at isolated places are very likely on Wednesday. On Tuesday, many parts of the city recorded rain. In the 24 hours (June 7-8), the rain reported by IMD Colaba was 21.8mm, while Santacruz recorded 20.7mm. IMD said the rain in upcoming days was due to the likely formation of a low pressure area over North Bay of Bengal and neighborhood by June 11, and strengthening of westerlies. “An active rainfall spell is expected over Konkan, Goa, and adjoining ghat areas of Madhya Maharashtra from June 10 for 4-5 days,” said IMD. Last year, the highest one-day rain recorded in June was on June 6 (64.9mm), while the total monthly rain recorded was 395 mm. This year, total rain recorded at Santacruz has been 136mm (82mm above normal). At Colaba, total rainfall so far has been 60.4mm (7.7mm above normal). IMD suggested checking for traffic congestion on one’s route before leaving for any destination, and it urged people to follow traffic advisories, avoid areas that face water-logging often and not staying in vulnerable structures. The Thane district administration restricted gatherings at popular waterfalls, lakes and dams. Monsoon hangouts like Yeoor, Mumbra Retibunder, Malshej ghats, Barvi dam, Gaimukh and Uttan seashore, Khadavali river and others will be out of bounds after the district collector issued orders under section 144 of CrPC, Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-monsoon-onset-likely-today-orange-alert-for-sat-says-imd/articleshow/83351755.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Vijayawada||Victorian-era coins found in Andhra Pradesh temple ruins, villagers share them||VIJAYAWADA: Villagers of Ummadivaram under Pullacheruvu mandal in Prakasam district, engaged in renovation of an old temple, on Monday stumbled upon around 500 silver coins dating back to Queen Victoria era. The villagers, who recently decided to take up the renovation of the local Maisamma temple that was in ruins, were removing the debris that had accumulated over the years when a local youth, who was tasked with disposing it, found a silver coin stuck inside the mud pile. On close observation, he found that it was a one-rupee coin minted way back in 1875 with Queen Victoria’s emblem on its obverse. Several villagers including the ones renovating the place, dug out around 500 coins from the temple’s premises. As no revenue official or police went to the spot to inquire about the incident, the villagers distributed the coins among themselves. According to numismatists, though the coins are partly made of silver, their numismatic or antique value is higher than their intrinsic value. Each coin could command a price of up to Rs 10,000 and even more depending on their rarity and the year of minting. “A half rupee of the same era is sold for Rs 5,500 on e-commerce websites. One rupee can fetch something between Rs 7,000 to Rs 10,000. Though these coins aren’t rare and are available with many coin collectors, they still command a high value,” K Perumal, a Chennai-based numismatist, said. As far as the coins being found in the temple premises are concerned, officials believe that the money must have been buried in the 19th century as part of the temple’s ‘prana pratishtha’ (consecration of the idol).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/victorian-era-coins-found-in-ap-temple-ruins-villagers-share-them/articleshow/83354328.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Pune||Private hospitals in Pune say price cap may impact vaccine drives||PUNE: Many private hospitals in Pune may have no choice but to suspend vaccination drives after June 21, following a government directive that said service charge for each dose cannot exceed Rs 150, sources from the Association of Hospitals in Pune have said. The cap may lead to financial losses for hospitals, the sources added. For Covishield (bought by most private hospitals here), citizens are charged Rs 850 to Rs 1,000 (including GST) as per dose price. Hospitals’ procurement cost is Rs 630 ( with GST). Not all have agreed with the association’s sources. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, said the unit will keep up its drive. “The Rs 150 per dose service charge would mean drives “at cost” price. But the healthcare community should continue vaccination even if it is at cost, because they are in everyone's interests,” Dr Kelkar said. Bomi Bhote, CEO of Ruby Hall Clinic and president of the Association of Hospitals in Pune, said, “Procurement price of Covishield, when bought by the Centre, is Rs 150 per dose. For states, it is Rs 400 per dose. But for private hospitals, the cost is Rs 600 (excluding GST). The Centre has taken over 75% of vaccine procurement and will still be buying at rates lower than private hospitals. So why do private hospitals have to buy vaccines at a higher cost?” Bhote added, “Private hospitals have had to divert a significant chunk of their staff — doctors and nurses — to hold these drives even though their core function is medical treatment and not vaccination. With a service charge brought down to Rs 150, it would not be possible to cover costs. Many private hospitals may be unwilling to participate in the drives.” Dr J Ravindranath, director of Poona Hospital and Research Center and vice president of Association of Hospitals, said, “Several hospitals may want to drop out of the drive as additional staff and resources for the vaccine drives need money. Also, off-site vaccinations (due to tie-ups with companies) are not possible at a service charge of Rs 150 per dose. The government has also capped Covid treatment costs, which has caused huge losses to private hospitals.” Vinod Sawantwadkar, CEO of Jehangir Hospital said, “As a hospital, we have incurred additional cost of manpower for the vaccine drives. This manpower is excluding the in-house staff. And apart from manpower costs, on-site camps also involve logistical expenses, which will certainly be more than Rs 150.” Sources said private hospitals may first finish the vaccine stocks they have bought and then rethink holding drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pvt-hospitals-say-price-cap-may-impact-vaccine-drives/articleshow/83351720.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Patna||Unlock evokes mixed response from people in Bihar||PATNA: The government’s decision to lift lockdown in the state from Wednesday evoked a mixed response from people from cross-section of the society. While people welcomed the ease in mobility for private vehicles and public transport, some wanted separate timings in the evening hours for businesses than allowing a single stretch only till 5pm. Vinit Mishra, who runs a chocolate shop at Kadamkuan, said the ease in public and private transportation will definitely help, but business should have been allowed in the evening hours. “There is rush in the morning hours as people avoid going out in the afternoon owing to the scorching heat. However, if shops are allowed to open for a few hours in the evening, it would have been good for all. However, it is impossible for the government to control each individual. Hence, precaution is the only way to minimize the chances of another wave,” Mishra said. Shivanand Pandey, a guitarist in the city, said ease in the timings will definitely help businesses, but enforcing Covid appropriate behaviours is the main challenge. “Before the decline in cases, people were scared. So, they took precautions. Now when I look on the streets, almost half the people are seen even without masks. It is in our nature to take things for granted for which we later have to pay,” he said. Shashi Kumar Shekhar, who runs a supermarket in Magistrate Colony, said most of the shoppers come around 10am and the number reduces in the afternoon due to heat. “So, there is not much difference for our business. But it is better from the point of safety than keeping a separate window in the evening as most shoppers will concentrate during the evening hours only,” he said. Mohan Choudhary, who runs an electrical store at Khajpura, said the extension of the timing and ease in transportation were very much required. “Small businesses would have perished had the lockdown been extended for long. We wish for more ease after June 15,” he said. Social worker Saquib Nezami from Phulwarisharif praised the government’s move. “It is certainly in the interest of general public of Bihar as many states are also in the process of Unlocking. Maharashtra has already eased its restrictions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/unlock-evokes-mixed-response-from-people-in-bihar/articleshow/83349878.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Development Authority pitches in by amending bylaws for better oxygen infrastructure||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has decided to provide several relaxations to boost the medical oxygen infrastructure in Delhi, which had battled a tremendous crisis during the second wave. In a meeting headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday, DDA approved an amendment to the Unified Building Bye Laws to allow oxygen-related infrastructure, such as PSA plants, liquid medical oxygen plants and related infrastructure, to be free from floor area ration (FAR) and ground coverage. Hospitals will be able to set up this infrastructure in the setback or its open areas, and no notice and building permit will be required from the sanctioning authority for installation. “The step will reduce the reliance on outside states for oxygen. Other clearances from safety regulator PESO and fire services will be required. However, oxygen plants having an area less than 250 square meters will not require a fire safety certificate as per existing rules,” an official said. DDA has also approved modification in Master Plan Delhi-2021 (MPD-2021) for development control norms for unauthorised colonies in Delhi. “The norms were approved in December 2020 and put in public domain. Based on the suggestions received and discussions with the local bodies, the draft development control norms for such colonies were approved,” the official said. “As per the approved norms, alternatives have been formulated for the unauthorised colony regeneration scheme by amalgamation of plots and ensuring participation of owners,” he added. The regeneration scheme incentivises large amalgamation of plots through incentive FAR. “The smallest amalgamation allows landowners with the total area of 2,000 square metres for the regeneration scheme. The scheme should provide a minimum 12m right of way (road width) and provision of local-level commercial space under 5% of the scheme area and 10% area for public facilities,” DDA announced. Regularisation can be done on meeting minimum requirements that have been relaxed compared to development norms under MPD. Providing relaxation to standalone godowns in non-conforming areas, DDA has extended date of approval for redevelopment plans to December 31, 2023. Moreover, a proposal for allowing DDA to undertake development and sanction of building plans for its in situ slum rehabilitation projects under Pradhan mantri Awas Yojna has also been approved. DDA has decided to provide opportunities for small-format houses by approving disposal of some group housing plots for construction of small houses up to 60 sqm though freehold basis through e-auction. “This will cater to the demand of 40-60 sqm affordable housing due to the growing trend of reduction in family sizes,” the official explained. The pricing policy for some commercial built-up space has also been modified. “As per the existing policy, the cost of construction was enhanced every year by 10% with respect to the year of construction while fixing the reserve price, whereas structures are depreciated as they age. Under the new policy, the reserve price is reduced by 30-55%. Most of these units are unsold inventory located in already functional markets. The built-up shops with revised rates will be part of the e-auction scheduled in August,” DDA stated. DDA also cleared change of land use for multilevel car parking on Idgah Road and a public notice will be issued inviting suggestions from common people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-pitches-in-by-amending-bylaws-for-better-o2-infra/articleshow/83351774.cms||---

TimesViewThe Pune police commissioner’s decision to commence nakabandi from 6.30 pm instead of 5pm will help reduce traffic jams in the evening hours. As most offices and shops close at 4pm, those working in these establishments were scrambling to return home before 5pm. The police have rightly observed that the one-hour window was grossly inadequate to facilitate the return journey of these staffers and visitors, more so because most of the roads in central city areas have been dug up. While the police chief has taken the right decision, the civic administration must step up its efforts to repair the dug-up roads on a war footing.Gupta said, “If anyone wants to travel to a district falling under level 1 to level 4 categories, and there is no level 5 district falling in between, then the person is not required to apply for an e-pass. He/she can travel to that district without an e-pass.” “We will continue to update our e-pass software according to the updates of the government pertaining to Covid restrictions being emforced in different districts,” Gupta said. The move is in line with the state government’s five level unlocking plan that is based on a district’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) and Covid bed occupancy. A level 4 or 5 classification suggests classification suggests a district or area still has high WPR and bed occupancy The police chief said, “According to the new state government guidelines, shops and offices cannot function beyond 4pm. After the closing time, people need at least an hour to reach their homes.” “But owing to some factors, like rush of commuters going back home and dug-up roads at many places, it has now been decided to start the nakabandi operation at 6.30pm, instead of 5pm. People moving on roads may be questioned by the police authorities and they should cooperate with them,” Gupta fuether said. “The 5pm nakabandi is likely to cause traffic jams on city roads and create unnecessary hassles for commuters,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-curbs-on-movement-till-6-30pm-pune-police-chief/articleshow/83351743.cms||---

For the third and last phase, funds worth Rs2 crore were released in April and work started in May. The work will cover some key rock patches towards the hilltop.However, PWD officials have said that the work may be halted if the area receives intense rainfall in the coming months and will resume later.“We are continuing with the work at present, but it will be stopped in case of heavy rainfall. The ongoing work is the last phase of the work planned to restrict landslides. Many landslide-prone spots have been covered in the first two phases. The remaining patches will be covered in the third phase,” said a PWD official.A decision to install the mesh was taken after the ghat section witnessed repeated instances of landslides over the last few years. The state government had requested experts from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, to study and recommend measures. The PWD had chalked out a plan to fix the mesh based on the recommendations.The official added, “We have appointed agencies that have an expertise in such work. The manpower is skilled to do the work even in a difficult terrain. We will also observe the efficacy of the work done in the first two phases.”The ghat section is closed due to Covid-19 restrictions at present. The PWD has said that it will shift the machinery if the work is stopped during the monsoon. The ghat road will then be opened to commuters.Regular visitors to the fort have been seeking measures to ensure safe ride to the location. Akash Bhosale, who often travels to the fort, said, “In addition to fixing the safety net, the authorities should also ensure that the ghat section road is regularly maintained. This will prevent accidents.”In December last year, the ghat section of the road had been shut to motorists once work to secure the area began. More than 100 sites in the section have been identified for bolting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pwd-begins-last-phase-of-fixing-protective-mesh-at-landslide-prone-sinhagad-fort-ghat-section/articleshow/83351751.cms||Sarang Dastane

In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Mumbai’s collector Rajiv Nivatkar, Khandwani said places of worship, including dargahs or Sufi shrines, have complied with government protocols in the fight against Covid-19. “We request relaxation at places of worship and 50% occupancy. We will follow preventive measures, guidelines, SOPs of government (masks, sanitization, distance maintenance, thermo check),” he said. The chief minister’s office has forwarded the letter to disaster management and urban development departments for action, according to ANI. Khandwani added that lockdown had created psychological issues and visits to places of worship can help overcome distress and depression. “People find solace and hope at Sufi shrines and other places of worship. If they are allowed even in reduced number at places of worship, depression and other psychological issues can be solved. Those managing places of worship will ensure Covid-19 protocols are maintained while people are allowed to pray there,” he said. Places of worship have been hit hard in the lockdown. “Places of worship are facing huge difficulties because of lack of funds. Sacred spaces provide peace to disturbed souls. With following precautions and protocols, people should be allowed to pray at places of worship and seek God’s forgiveness, and end the miseries caused by coronavirus,” said senior spiritual leader Syed Moin Ashraf Quadri (Moin Mian). Only five people, comprising caretakers and staff, are presently allowed to pray at places of worship. No congregational prayers are being held at sacred spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-reopen-places-of-worship-for-solace-says-haji-ali-dargah-trustee/articleshow/83349368.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

In his plea, Kumar has stated that he had submitted a complaint to the Ambala police for registration of a criminal case against Yadava under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. According to him, as per the provisions of the act, police have to first register an FIR and then conduct an inquiry. However, according to Kumar’s petition before HC, Ambala police have marked an inquiry without registration of a case against the DGP under the SC/ST Act. Kumar had submitted a complaint to SP Ambala against his alleged victimisation by Yadava. Kumar’s plea will come up for hearing on June 10. The entire tussle between Kumar and the DGP relates to a news report when IGP Y Puran Kumar, who belongs to SC community, installed a Shiva Linga at a temple at Traffic police station in Shahzadpur, Ambala district, on August 3, 2020. In his complaint, IG stated that on August 3, 2020, which was a public holiday, he visited the temple. “The then SP Ambala, Abhishek Jorwal, visited the temple the same day. The same was reported in a newspaper on August 4, 2020.

Accordingly, 200ml of hand sanitizer cannot be sold beyond the maximum retail price (MRP) of Rs 110, while customers need not have to pay more than Rs 22 for a N95 mask and fingertip pulse oximeters will be available for a maximum retail price of Rs 1,500. Similarly, one unit of sterile gloves and examination gloves should be marketed only at Rs 15 and Rs 5.75, respectively. In a notification, health and family welfare secretary J Radhakrishnan said the director of drug control has informed the government that in order to ensure the availability of essential medical items during the Covid-19 pandemic at reasonable prices to people, it is necessary to declare certain items as essential articles under the Tamil Nadu Essential Articles Control and Requisitioning Act, 1949, and fix the MRP. The notification drafted on June 4 declares that 15 specified medical items are essential articles to be sold at specified MRP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-caps-retail-price-of-ppe-kits-at-rs-273-apiece-rs-1500-for-oximeters/articleshow/83351778.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Ghaggar: Check discharge of untreated water into river, NGT directs Punjab, Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: Taking a serious view of the untreated water of a drain originating from Chandigarh and passing through various sectors and villages of Punjab’s Mohali district before merging into the Ghaggar river, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the Punjab chief secretary and adviser to the UT Chandigarh administrator to take immediate remedial measures. The NGT bench, headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, asked a joint committee of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and the UT Pollution Control Committee (PCC) to inspect the drain and furnish a status report positively within two months to the NGT. Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan and UT Chandigarh adviser Manoj Parida have been asked to ensure appropriate remedial measures to comply with the mandate of the Supreme Court and the NGT. Advocate and social activist Sunaina had approached the NGT highlighting the failure of the statutory authorities in Punjab and UT Chandigarh to install necessary sewage treatment plant (STP), resulting in the discharge of pollution in the drain originating in Chandigarh and passing through Mohali, before joining the Ghaggar. She submitted that the wastewater of the drain is used by nearby farmers for cultivation of crops and washing of the vegetables which are consumed by the residents and it was affecting the food chain and the public health. The NGT observed that it has already dealt with water pollution very seriously and issued detailed instructions to the various states and UTs. “In spite of the enactment of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 making discharge of untreated effluents into a water body a criminal offence, the states are still struggling with preventing untreated sewage from being discharged into the water body at a huge cost to the environment and health and lives of citizens who have the fundamental right to a clean environment under the Constitution,” said the NGT in its order. It added that water pollution is a serious threat to the health of the citizens as well as other living beings who consume the water and also to the food safety for growth of which the water is used for irrigation. NGT strictures against Punjab, Haryana, UT, HP “The states of HP, Haryana, Punjab, and UT Chandigarh continue to contribute water pollution which is a criminal offence. It is a breach of public trust under public trust doctrine. We are left with a feeling that there is no commitment to the rule of law and no concern for the environment and health of the citizens on the part of the concerned authorities in the states of HP, Haryana, Punjab and UT Chandigarh,” said the NGT. The green tribunal added that after the Supreme Court fixed a deadline of March 31, 2018, in ‘Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti’ case for ensuring that all requisite equipment for the treatment of water pollution was in place, there can be no justification whatsoever for the state to have failed in complying with the law. “If the state finds that they are unable to manage the sewage directly, there is no bar to other options being explored but there cannot be any justification not to comply with the mandate of law and protecting the health of the citizens in accordance with the constitutional mandate,” added the NGT. The NGT also observed that no action was being taken against the erring officers and it gives an impression that there is a collapse of environmental rule of law. “Who is to pay the cost of damage to the environment and public health of a large number of unidentified citizens and other living creatures? Is such a cost being calculated? How officers responsible for damage by their inaction or otherwise are being dealt with. Should the state be held liable vicariously for such failure and failure to punish the guilty?” questioned the NGT and added, “This tribunal has been passing repeated orders and as many as six reports have been submitted by a monitoring committee headed by a former high court judge and a former chief secretary, clearly recording failure of the state authorities but the higher authorities are also conveniently ignoring their responsibility. Advocates for the authorities only maintain silence before this tribunal.” The NGT underlined, “If the state itself fails in implementing the law, it is nothing but the breakdown of the system itself. Is this Tribunal to just remain a silent spectator for such gross failure or hold the highest authorities accountable by directing their prosecution for their criminal failure and indirectly being party to the crime against the law of the land? How the law of the land is to be meaningfully enforced. We expect answers to these questions from the states.” The green tribunal said that for the delay and continued violation, realistic compensation has to be recovered from the erring officers, apart from other action or in default, the compensation has to be quantified and recovered. The executing committee may make its recommendation in this regard, said the NGT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ngt-directs-punjab-chandigarh-to-check-discharge-of-untreated-water-in-drain-flowing-into-ghaggar/articleshow/83351757.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Vaccination-triggered antibodies stronger than those formed post-Covid, says KGMU study||LUCKNOW: A study on antibodies, conducted by the King George’s Medical University (KGMU), has found out that the desirable herd immunity which can break the chain of virus, can only be achieved by mass vaccination and not through natural course of transmission of infection. In a two-part study, antibody test was done on 989 KGMU healthcare workers and about 500 plasma donors. It was found that antibodies formed after vaccination were stronger and lasted longer, whereas those generated after infection fizzled out in less than four months, and in some cases, the number was inadequate. Of the 989 healthcare workers including class four employees, junior doctors, staff and senior faculty members, 869 (88%) had antibodies. Of 869, about 73% had completed a two-dose vaccination course and 13% had taken one dose. The remaining were those who had not taken vaccines but had acquired infection in the past few months. About 61 healthcare workers had not developed adequate antibodies even after taking both the doses. Similarly, there were 25 workers who had taken a dose but had not developed antibodies. The remaining who lacked antibodies have not been vaccinated so far. However, out of 500-odd plasma donors who came for donation 14 days to three months after recovery, only 50% were found to be having adequate antibodies. These donors had either lost their antibodies prematurely or did not produce enough. It could be because of low immunity or less severe infection. “This shows the probability of developing adequate antibodies that also last for a long period through vaccination rather than acquiring infection in a natural way. The high percentage of antibodies in this group is a good sign, hinting at herd immunity through vaccination,” said Prof Tulika Chandra, head of the transfusion medicine department. “Generally, when a person is infected, memory cells in the body store the information of infection. Hence, even if antibodies are not formed, it is assumed that memory cells will be able to fight the infection if a person is exposed to the risk again. But the second wave saw many cases of reinfections due to which scientists presumed that memory cells did not work well in them,” she added. These are preliminary results of the study. The target is a sample size of 4,000 which can bring about further revelations. Some of the vaccinated healthcare workers tested in the first round will be tested again later to determine the longevity of the antibodies developed through vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vax-triggered-antibodies-stronger-than-those-formed-post-covid-kgmu-study/articleshow/83353129.cms||Yusra Husain

While hair loss has been the most common of them, doctors suggest not to worry as hair will grow again in the next six months in most of the patients. Doctors say Post-Covid hairfall related to stress.“In most of the cases, the hair loss is due to the Covid related stress and the aftermath of the heavy medicines taken during hospitalization. But, this is temporary. If you experience the same for more than four months, you can consult hair fall expert,” said Dr Shashank Bansod, Dermatologist, and Hair Transplant Surgeon. “You can lose up to 100 hair per day. We call it Telogen effluvium which is temporary hair loss. I suggest protein rich balanced diet, Yoga, meditation and stress management to stop this hair fall early,” Dr Bansod said. Apart from hair fall, patients are experiencing different types of rashes too. “There are four to five types of rashes. The connection between Covid-19 and rashes is now well-established. Rashes can come as early symptom of Covid-19 as well as during post-recovery phase,” he said. Doctors also suggested that a person having mild Covid symptoms along with rash on any part of the body should go for Covid-19 test immediately. Many patients in recovery phase are suffering from herpes. It’s recyrring in those a history of herpes while some are contracting it afresh. “It’s due to lowered immunity. That’s why we suggest eating healthy food during the recovery period of Covid-19. The herpes could be very painful,” said Dr Bansod. Dr Sanjeev Choudhary, additional professor of dermatology at AIIMS, Nagpur said that skin manifestations of Covid-19 are now well-known. “Most of the skin lesions are self-limiting. In case they continue for long, patients should consult the doctor,” he said. According to him, some of the common signs include maculopapular rash (a flat, red area on the skin that is covered with small confluent bumps) and urticaria (swollen, pale red bumps or plaques (wheals) on the skin that appear suddenly).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-covid-hair-fall-continues-for-up-to-4-months-mostly-related-to-stress-doctors/articleshow/83351793.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||India||SC asks state govts to hold hands of Covid orphans||NEW DELHI: As thousands of children lost either both or one of the parents during the Covid pandemic and many are faced with a bleak future, the Supreme Court has passed a slew of directions to provide them a helping hand by asking states and Union territories to ensure that there is no break in their schooling and bear the cost of their education. Pointing to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) receiving many complaints regarding illegal adoption of such orphaned children, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose also directed the states and police to take stringent action against individuals and NGOs indulging in such activities. It also ordered the states to track all such children who are in distress and grant them financial assistance, including payment of Rs 2,000 per month under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS). The court said states needed to get into action with relief and financial assistance as the Centre has not finalised modalities to come to the rescue of such children under the PM Cares fund and sought four weeks’ time to finalise it. The bench passed the order after accepting the suggestion of advocate Gaurav Agrawal who is assisting the court as amicus curiae. “If the affected children are studying in government schools, they should be permitted to continue. In so far as the children who are studying in private schools, the state governments/Union Territories should take steps and direct the continuance of the children in those schools at least for a period of six months by which time some arrangement can be worked out.... The states/UTs should ensure that there is no break in the education of children who have become orphans or lost one parent during the pandemic,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-asks-state-govts-to-hold-hands-of-covid-orphans/articleshow/83357226.cms||---

Earlier, Akhilesh had announced that he will not get vaccinated since he did not trust the ‘BJP vaccine’. Though BJP welcomed Akhilesh’s decision to get vaccinated, the party said SP chief would be held responsible for insulting the scientists and doctors by questioning the efficacy of the vaccine, until he apologised for it. On Tuesday morning, SP chief announced on Twitter that he will take the jab and also appealed to those who have not got vaccinated, to get the jab. “After public outcry, the government has finally decided that it will not politicise the vaccination process but the Centre will get people vaccinated instead. I was against the ‘BJP vaccine’ but welcome the ‘Government of India’ vaccine and I will also get inoculated. Those who were unable to get the jab due to shortage of the vaccine till now, I appeal to them to get vaccinated,” Akhilesh tweeted. Minutes after Akhilesh’s announcement, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya welcomed the former CM’s decision but minced no words in holding him responsible for insulting the Indian scientists who developed the vaccine and unsavoury events wherein doctors and paramedics involved in the vaccination drive were ill treated by those opposed to the vaccine. “He should get vaccinated, we welcome that. But till he apologises, he is guilty of insulting scientists who developed the vaccine and health workers associated with the vaccination,” Maurya tweeted. SP chief had courted controversy when on January 2, he had said that he will not take the ‘BJP vaccine’ as he did not trust the BJP government and announced that when SP will come to power, it will ensure free vaccines for everyone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-greets-goi-vaccine-will-take-jab/articleshow/83353135.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

According to the FIR, Patker was appointed as an honorary consultant at the hospital in 2016 based on the fake PhD degree certificate issued in the name of Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj University in Kanpur. On May 26, Bandra police lodged an FIR against Patker under IPC sections for impersonation, cheating and forgery based on social worker Gurdeep Kaur Harinder Singh’s (51) complaint. Kaur said, “In the second week of April, someone left an envelope with documents related to the degrees belonging to Patker and information about her profession and hospital where she worked outside my Andheri (W) home.” Singh said she found that Patkar’s degree in clinical psychology was a fake. An officer said: “We verified that the PhD degree was fake. We asked Patker to submit a copy of her degree, but she said she did not have it as her husband took it. We then arrested her.” Zonal DCP Abhishek Trimukhe confirmed the arrest. But Patker’s lawyer Abha Singh told TOI, “In May, my client filed a writ against police for not lodging an FIR against Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut. Now police have filed an FIR against her based on a complaint. To make the offence non-bailable, they have wrongly applied section 467 which carries life term.

Such observations are based on BJP’s misplaced priorities like celebrating vaccination as an ‘Utsav’ (festival) and the indecisiveness with regards to a clear-cut policy for vaccination, he said. “Now vaccination will gather steam once the SP government comes in place after the 2022 assembly elections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sens-remark-has-exposed-govt-akhilesh/articleshow/83353153.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Atul Laxman Sathe (22) was among the 18 people who were burned to death in a devastating fire that broke out at a mid-sized industrial plant at Urawade village near Pirangut in Mulshi taluka, about 25km from here, on Monday. “Atul was working in the company for two years. I do not know how the fire broke out. I know my son’s nature — he would always help others. I have now lost my son,” Laxman on Tuesday told TOI from Bhalgudi, a non-descript village, barely 10 from Urawade, in the hilly terrains of Mulshi taluka. Six people from the village were working in the chemical plant, and two of them, including a woman, were charred to death. Two villagers sustained severe burns, while two others escaped with minor injuries. An employee of the company, Rahul Sathe (30), lost his wife, Sunita (28), in the fire. His younger brother, Santosh Sathe (24), sustained severe burns. Rahul himself escaped with minor burns. “The couple has a six-year-old daughter and five-year-old son. They do do not know what has happened,” a relative told TOI. Two other villagers, Adinath Mahipati Sathe (21) and Sachin Bharat Sathe (24), sustained injuries. Adinath is undergoing treatment in a hospital. Atul’s father, Laxman, said, “The residents of Bhalgudi are distant relatives. No one could sleep on Monday night.” The mood at Kanjane Vasti near Urawade village in Mulshi was similar following the news that Gita Diwadkar was not traceable after the blaze. Her sister, Jayashree More, said, “Gita was inside the factory when the fire broke out. As soon as the news spread, I rushed to the plant and looked for her everywhere. But I failed to find her.” She said, “Gita had joined the company six months ago after loosing a job in another firm. Her husband, Bharat, has a problem in his knee joint. She had built a house and took responsibility of her two sons’ education.” Two houses at Walhekar Chawl in Urawade were locked on Tuesday. The two inhabitants, Shital Khopkar and Sangita Gonde, died in the fire. Landlord Amit Walhekar told TOI, “Khopkar joined the plant a year ago. The Khopkar couple were staying in our house with their two children. The Gonde family was staying in the house for 10 years and Sangita was an old employee of the firm.” Rajendra Deshmukh, a former neighbour of victim Trishala Jadhav of Urawade, on Tuesday went to the Sassoon hospital, to be with her husband, Sambhaj. “They were our neighbours till last month.

They should prepare 50 multiple-choice based questions (MCQs) and based on the marks, they can allot groups,” the circular from school education commissioner K Nanthakumar to chief educational officers said. If the school receives fewer applications than the available seats, it can allot the seats based on the interest of students, the circular added. It also allowed government and government-aided schools to increase 10% to 15% seats in each stream in Class XI if the applications are more than the available seats. The circular asked schools to commence online classes for Class XI in the third week of June by following the Covid-19 guidelines. It also asked the schools to start online classes and classes through Kalvi TV for Class XII students. “Since Class XI groups are deciding the careers of students, the interest and aptitude of students needed to be given due consideration,” said N Vijayan, senior principal of Zion Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Tambaram. GJ Manohar, principal, MCC Higher Secondary School, said there needs to be more clarity on the mode of test for Class XI admissions. “For the first few weeks, the schools may have to conduct only the online classes in view of the pandemic,” he said. Some activists also opposed the test saying it is indirect entrance test for Class XI admissions. “If more students apply for a group in a government school, the department should allow the school to start additional sections. Students should not be denied the opportunity to study the stream in which they are interested,” said P B Prince Gajendrababu, general secretary, State Platform for Common School System.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/admissions-for-class-xi-tn-okays-test/articleshow/83351882.cms||---

At the start of the summer schedule from March, the airport was gearing up for 108 flights per day. However, the second wave and the resultant restrictions caused a 70% dip in the number of flights in June compared to March. Airport officials said that there are 32 to 42 flight movements at present. “Many airlines, which started flights under the summer schedule, stopped operations to many destinations due to the second wave, affecting passenger traffic,” an airport official said. He added that now with some relaxations and significant drop in Covid cases, the airlines might think of operating more flights. “We are now hoping for a revival in passenger traffic. Airlines may then consider resumption of more flights. We hope to have 100 flights per day,” the official added. In the summer schedule, the airlines had promised flights to Chandigarh, Delhi, Coimbatore, Bhopal, Goa, Hyderabad, Prayagraj, Darbhanga, Chennai, Jaipur, Nashik, Kochi and Varanasi. For a few destinations like Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad or Kolkata, airlines had more than one direct flight, giving multiple options to flyers. However, things had changed drastically in the past few months, with many daily flights changing to weekly flights and the number of destinations shrinking. “With the passenger traffic at all airports, including Pune, dropping, operating flights as planned in the summer schedule has not been possible. All states have placed strict restrictions and the unlock process will start slowly. The passenger traffic was almost zero for some cities. However, with things opening up, we will study the scenario and begin operations,” a local representative of an airlines, told TOI. Flyers, too, hoped for more flights soon. “Until last week, there was only one direct flight from Pune to Kolkata — down from three in March. I think the airlines should increase the number of arrivals and departures, which will give flyers more options,” Tanay Ghosh, a frequent flyer, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-flights-expected-from-pune-as-covid-numbers-drop-restrictions-ease/articleshow/83351890.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Mumbai||HC junks Maharashtra independent MP’s caste certificate as ‘fraud’, fines her Rs 2 lakh||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday cancelled and confiscated the caste certificate of Navneet Rana, independent MP from Amravati, ruling that it was “fraudulently obtained”. It also imposed a cost of Rs 2 lakh on her. It must be paid to the Maharashtra Legal Services Authority within 2 weeks. Rana (36) was elected in the May 2019 LS elections from a reserved seat. A former model and actress, she won as an independent supported by the Congress-NCP and RPI against Shiv Sena leader Anandrao Adsul. The ruling came on a batch of three petitions, two by her opponents in 2018 and 2019, and one filed by Rana in 2020. Alleging “political kichdi’ for the row over her SC certificate, Rana said she will move the top court. Setting aside MP Navneet Rana’s caste certificate and a 2017 order validating her certificate that she belonged to the “‘Mochi’ Scheduled Caste”, the HC on Tuesday directed her to surrender the caste certificate within six weeks. The court observed she had “committed a fraud on the Constitution”. The HC bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht said, “In our view, the caste claim made by (her) for obtaining a caste certificate as Scheduled Caste itself was fraudulent and was made with the intention to obtain various benefits available to a candidate from such Scheduled Caste category knowing well that she does not belong to that caste… (and) made intentionally to make a fraudulent claim to enable (her) to contest an election for Member of Parliament on the seat reserved for an SC candidate.” The HC, in its 108-page judgment, said the scrutiny committee’s order in accepting her claim on the basis of two “fabricated” documents—a rent agreement of 1932 of her great-grandfather and a 2014 college certificate—is “totally perverse.” “In our view, there were two sets of documents produced which were contradictory,” it said. She had claimed to be ‘Sikh Chamar’ as well as ‘Ravidasiya Mochi’, said the HC, adding, “In our view, the term ‘Chamar’ and ‘Mochi’ are not synonymous and are different identity.”  “Abdicating its responsibility... the scrutiny committee chose to remain discreet,” the HC said, adding it was “aghast at the eerie silence” of the committee at certain questions. The HC said “all the consequences in law provided upon cancellation of... caste certificate... shall follow”. An election petition against Rana’s 2019 win is pending before HC’s Nagpur bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-hc-slams-panel-for-eerie-silence-says-rana-case/articleshow/83351914.cms||Swati Deshpande

On May 26, while reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state, the CM called upon people’s representatives to adopt a health facility and ensure that it has all kinds of services. On Tuesday, the CM announced that he was adopting Jangal Kaudia and Chargavan CHCs in Gorakhpur, Hathi Bazaar CHC in Varanasi, and Masaudha CHC in Ayodhya. Officials confirmed the same. “We have received the letter regarding adoption of Hathi Bazaar CHC by the CM. It’s in the Sevapuri model block,” Varanasi DM Kaushal Raj Sharma told TOI. Yogi has directed local authorities to undertake a gap analysis of the centres and said that problems must be corrected at the earliest. In Varanasi for instance, the local administration has already launched the exercise to equip the centre with modern medical facilities and augmenting capacity of its indoor patient unit ward. “Currently, the CHC has one 15-bed ward in its indoor patient department (IPD),” the DM said, adding, “After the adoption, the CHC will get two more wards of 15 beds each. It will not only become a 45-bed hospital, but a shed would also be constructed for attendants of patients admitted in the IPD,” Varanasi DM said. On Yogi’s appeal, several people’s representatives have already adopted health facilities. They include basic education minister Satish Dwivedi taking responsibility of the Itwa CHC and minority affairs minister Mohsin Raza taking charge of CHC in Safipur, Unnao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-yogi-adopts-gorakhpur-varanasi-and-ayodhya-chcs/articleshow/83353168.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Their findings are up on the International Astronomy Search Collaboration (IASC) site. The programme, conducted by STEM & Space in collaboration with IASC, gave students the opportunity to explore real astronomical data and look for asteroids. Asteroids are small rocks and objects in our solar system that pose a threat to the earth. NASA and Jet Propulsion Laboratory work with programmes such as IASC to identify and track asteroids to circumvent any such calamities. A statement issued by STEM & Space stated, “.. would like to congratulate two of our asteroid discoverers Ankita Sharma and Trisha Singhal .. on the impressive achievements attained in the international project ‘International Asteroid Discovery Program’ in April 2021.” The ‘preliminary discoveries’ are only the first discoveries of an asteroid, and it will take about a year of observations before a few of them are confirmed as provisional discoveries and are formally recorded. Menstrual Hygiene:Break the silence Global Talent International School conducted a session to create awareness among people on menstrual hygiene on May 28, which was World Menstrual Hygiene Day. The aim was to erase the social stigma and taboo associated with menstruation. Poor menstrual hygiene was one of the reasons for high prevalence of certain illnesses among women.

---||Chandigarh||10 Raj dists getting black water from Pb||Bathinda: The Gang Canal carries serious ailments from Punjab to 10 districts of Rajasthan or a third of its population, which uses this water for both drinking and irrigation. Released on June 6 when the canal was closed for 40 days of repair, the water was almost black when it reached Ganganagar district on Monday evening. Ganganagar MP Nihal Chand Chauhan and Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat raised concern during World Oceans Day on June 8. The volunteer organisations of the two states asked Punjab’s water resources department and pollution control board to inspect the Harike Pattan headworks in Ferozepur district. These organisations claimed that say this water was making people sick in Punjab as well. The untreated Budda Nullah carries the effluents from Ludhiana’s dyeing industry and Jalandhar’s leather factories into the Satluj river, which then fills the Rajasthan and Sirhind Feeders that run parallel through Punjab’s Faridkot and Muktsar districts before crossing the border. When water stopped getting into the Satluj, it stopped the dissolution of the pollutants, just when the Budda Nullah treatment plant project was also delayed. Environmentalist Gurpreet Singh Chandbhaja and Aam Aadmi Party legislator Kultar Singh Sandhwan reached the Harike barrage on Monday to check the quality of water. The MLA said: "We were stunned to see a stream of jet-black water enter Rajasthan. In the last two years, we have asked both Punjab and central government for help. The Punjab pollution control board (PPCB) promised to set things right by March 31." Rajasthan’s volunteer organisation Dooshit Jal Asurakshit Kal (polluted water unsafe future) Janjagran Samiti’s convener Ramjan Ali Chopdar said Rajasthan had for long put up with this contaminated canal water from Punjab and stayed silent only because of Covid-19. Ganganagar MP Nihal Chand Chauhan said over telephone: "I got minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to speak with the Punjab government. My constituents have hepatitis and cancer because of this water." PPCB member secretary Karunesh Garg said a sewage treatment plant at Ludhiana was the only long-term solution but that will take 18 months and Rs 650 crore. Besides, the Bharkra Beas Management Board (BBMB) will have to release more water into the Satluj to dissolve the pollutants before the river pushes these downstream. The central pollution control board collects samples from Rajasthan, while the PPCB does it in Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/10-raj-dists-getting-black-water-from-pb/articleshow/83351902.cms||Neel Kamal

She was 93. Verma was undergoing treatment after her health deteriorated due to mucormycosis (black fungus) infection in the lungs post recovery from Covid-19. Offering condolences, Haryana chief minister (CM) Manohar Lal Khattar tweeted on Tuesday evening: “An era has come to an end with the death of Kamla Verma, the first woman president of Haryana state BJP and three-time cabinet minister. The resolution power that was contained in your (Kamla's) personality for good governance with organisational capacity, those virtues will always inspire us for public welfare.” As per her son Rajan Verma, Kamla tested positive on May 5 and she was admitted to a multi-speciality hospital in Rajpura, Punjab, but could not get the satisfactory treatment there. She was then shifted to a private hospital in Jagadhri town of Yamunanagar district on May 20. During her treatment, it was confirmed on May 31 that she had black fungus infection in the lungs. The family had to struggle for amphotericin-B injection. Haryana CM and home and health minister intervened in the matter and the medicine was made available to district health officials for the treatment.

---||Pune||Firm partner held, 2 booked for fire tragedy in Pune||PUNE: The rural police on Tuesday arrested Nikunj Shah (39), one of the three partners in SVS Aqua Technologies company at Urawade village in Pirangut, on the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder after an expert panel set up by the district collector cited several shortcomings and non-compliances leading to Monday’s devastating fire that claimed 18 lives. The police have also booked the other two partners, Shah’s 68-year-old father and his brother, who is currently travelling in a west Asian country. “We arrested Shah after a prima facie investigation revealed negligence on the part of the company,” Pune rural superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh told TOI. Fifteen women and three men were charred to death in the fire that broke out at the plant on Monday. The bodies were burned beyond recognition. Four workers sustained injuries and two of them, who sustained severe burns, are being treated at a private hospital. “The expert committee, headed by the sub-divisional officer of Mulshi, on Tuesday submitted its report to the district collector, mentioning 12 points of negligence, shortcomings and irregularities on the part of the company owners. Based on this report, senior inspector Ashok Dhumal of the Paud police filed the FIR against the company partners,” Deshmukh said. The three partners have been booked for an offence under sections 304-II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible material), 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. The police have also recorded the statements of injured workers Adinath Sathe, Santosh Sathe, Sachin Sathe, Pravin Kavankar, security guard Rajman and worker Shashikant Gadekar. “We have found a large quantity of sanitizer stored in the company,” the officer said. The police have so far identified 17 victims and found some body parts. “No one has so far come forward to inform us that any one from their family was missing. We suspect that it could be parts of one of the 17 bodies. That will be proved after the DNA tests,” said Dhumal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/firm-partner-held-2-booked-for-fire-tragedy/articleshow/83351915.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The project was conceived during the DMK rule in 2010 but hit roadblocks ever since including fund crunch and was put on hold. Proposed in 2009, the zoological park on around 62 hectares could be the fifth zoological park under the zoo authority in Tamil Nadu, if becomes operational. The project got a new lease of life after the DMK government assumed charge. The project was proposed by then forest minister N Selvaraj from Trichy. “The zoological park will be an educational entertainment destination in Trichy region,” said S Ramasubramanian, chief conservator of forests, in-charge of Trichy forest circle. A detailed proposal answering all the queries sought by the union government and the central zoo authority has been sent and a positive response is expected soon, he added. “The place selected for the park being dry and scrubland, many had expressed reservation for having the park at M R Palayam. Ample deer population in the region and a wildlife census in the area gave proof of enough mammal population for establishing a zoo,” said a forest official. The forest department had planned to make it operational two years back by bringing animals from zoological parks in Vandalur, Ooty, Thanjavur, Coimbatore, Vellore and Thiruvananthapuram. The Central Zoo Authority of India (CZA) had asked to make some changes to the design of the park which led to further delay. Four enclosures has already been brought to the facility to accommodate wild animals. Besides this, the park was designed to have 17 types of amenities at an outlay of Rs 60 crore. Preliminary work on the proposed site was completed in 2017 by spending Rs 2.4 crore. The state government has to allot Rs 7 crore for the next stage. Perambalur Lok Sabha MP PT Pariventhar had asked the state government for a speedy inauguration of the facility last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/forest-dept-dusts-off-trichy-zoo-project-sends-proposal-to-cza/articleshow/83351928.cms||Sampath Kumar

Don Mukhtar Ansari is lodged in the same prison. Senior officials said that more guards will be deployed along the boundary wall as well. DIG, jails, Prayagraj range, Sanjeev Tripathi told TOI that the inner wall of the jail was about 7-foot high and could be scaled easily. Now, it has been decided to increase its height. Inside the prison, there would be two cops on duty instead of one. “I have also directed the jail superintendent to clear and put all things like bamboo sticks under lock,” said Tripathi. Tripathi also said that a report has been sent to the headquarters against the jail warder in charge of the section where 22-year-old undertrial Vijay Arakh was lodged. The breach in Banda jail came after last week’s ruckus in Jaunpur jail. On Tuesday, the prisons department conducted a random security audit of district jails in Bahraich, Ballia, Sultanpur, Unnao, and Siddharth Nagar. Senior officials said that high-security barracks were checked and all surveillance equipment was installed. They also inspected functioning of CCTV cameras installed throughout the prisons. Modern search equipment, pole metal detectors, baggage scanners and hand-held metal detectors were also checked. The audit also involved investigation of the causes of dissatisfaction among prisoners. “They checked the functionality and adequacy of security equipment like body protectors, helmets, batons, and arms of prison security personnel and also requirements of officers and security personnel,” said another jail officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/higher-walls-more-guards-for-banda-jail-after-breach/articleshow/83353180.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The report has been prepared after hearing suggestions and objections from the residents of these villages. The state government has already given an in-principle approval to the merger. Now, only the gazette notification remains to be issued. The merger of 23 villages will make PMC, the biggest municipal corporation in Maharashtra. “The process of suggestions and objections is over. We have given our report to the state government,” divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said. As per the district administration, there were many objections which pointed out that the merger will put greater stress on the civic infrastructure. A total of 850 people, including NGOs, political leaders and common citizens had submitted their objections and suggestions. According to the officials, a majority of the objections came from one village while only a couple were in favour of the merger. After the PMC planned to merge 23 villages in the municipal limits, the draft notification was issued in December 2020 and suggestions and objections were sought in a month. The decision to merge 34 fringe villages in the civic areas was taken in 2013-14. The civic administration had merged 11 villages in the PMC limits in 2017 when nine villages were partly merged and two were added completely. The limits will now increase to 480sqkm after this merger. Areas like Wagholi, Khadakwasla and Manjari Budruk will be part of the PMC post-merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/div-commissioners-office-clears-merger-of-23-villages-with-pmc/articleshow/83351926.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Biz Buzz: Shopkeepers make a beeline for vaccination camps in Bhopal||BHOPAL: More than 10,000 people working in city markets got the vaccine jab to protect against Covid-19 on Tuesday. The rush to get inoculated came after district coordination committee announced opening of all markets and establishments from Thursday. It also came with a warning, that workers in markets without vaccination certificates would be penalized and commercial establishment sealed. Financial implications took precedence, as even vaccine hesitant queued up to get the jab. Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) alone organised special vaccination camps in 36 locations. SDM level vaccination centres accounted for 6,000 beneficiaries getting the jab in 14 locations. It would continue on Wednesday too. BMC vaccination staff, noted the Aadhaar identification number of people and gave them a slip, that would be a proof of vaccination. Many were not aware of how to generate a vaccination certificate. Once the Covid-19 vaccination is completed, a certificate is issued to the citizens as a proof of vaccination. The vaccination certificate has a secure QR code to protect it against falsification. The genuineness of the certificate can be authenticated from CoWin portal. Much of the vaccination data is uploaded manually after the session is completed. Overall in Bhopal about 11,000 doses of vaccine were administered on Tuesday. 8.26 lakh people have received the first dose in Bhopal, whereas 1.54 lakh have been fully inoculated, according to government data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/biz-buzz-shopkeepers-make-a-beeline-for-vaccination/articleshow/83349551.cms||---

This is among the highest in Maharashtra. While Parbhani usually records the highest petrol prices in Maharashtra due to greater transportation cost incurred by the retailers, the price of diesel in Aurangabad on Tuesday was higher than in Parbhani, where diesel was sold at Rs 94.42 per litre. The Association of fuel retailers in Aurangabad said 3% tax being charged by the civic body for more than a decade makes diesel costlier in the ‘tourism capital of Maharashtra’. “The beautification tax has been in place for more than a decade and went unnoticed until fuel prices crossed the Rs90s-mark recently. It was meant for raising infrastructure and beautifying the city when introduced first. Despite the work being over, the tax continues,” Association president Aqeel Abbas said, adding that central and state tax regimes also make fuel costlier. At Rs 95.1 per litre, Amaravati had one of the highest diesel retail rates in Maharashtra, revealed the official data of oil companies. Among other major cities in the state, the retail sale of diesel took place at Rs 92.27 per litre in Mumbai, Rs 91.82 in Pune, Rs 92.03 in Nagpur, Rs 92.56 in Nashik, Rs 92.43 in Kolhapur and Rs 94.29 in Nanded. Meanwhile, the petrol price in Parbhani was Rs 103.88 per litre. The prices in Amaravati (Rs 103.01), Aurangabad (Rs 102.81), Nashik (Rs 101.94), Kolhapur (Rs 101.78), Mumbai (Rs 101.57) and Pune (Rs 101.18) breached the Rs 100-mark.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/diesel-price-close-to-rs-95-mark-in-aurangabad/articleshow/83344697.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Single-dose ‘Virafin’ raises hope for quicker Covid cure in moderate patients||NAGPUR: A new drug, Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b, launched as ‘Virafin’, has reached Nagpur’s pharmaceutical market this week, with doctors eager to test it’s use and efficacy. This single-dose injectable had got emergency use clearance from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) in April following clinical trials. Zydus Cadila’s Virafin is the second crucial drug for the Covid-19 treatment to reach city in last one week, after monoclonal antibody-based ‘Cocktail therapy’ or combination therapy of Casirivimab and Imdevimab. While cocktail therapy is to be administered at the earliest, experts feel Virafin may have to be administered in moderate patients. Dr Kamal Bhutada, director of ICU at Care Hospital, and also chairman of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, Nagpur chapter, said interferons are natural molecules produced in the body which are the first line of defence. “Pegylated form of interferons are sort of artificially produced molecules, which are administered subcutaneously in persons whose capacity to produce natural molecules diminishes due to age and other factors,” said Dr Bhutada. “This drug must be injected early in the disease but not in very mild form, and also not in severe disease,” he said. Dr Bhutada also said phase III trials of the drug showed that it lessens complications, reduces oxygen dependency and also returns RTPCR report negative early. Senior physician and intensivist Dr Rajesh Atal said he had used interferons for treating Hepatitis B and C. “The studies on the interferon’s extrapolated use in Covid treatment so far have showed they reduce viral loads in moderate patients. Therefore, we can expect this drug to check progression of a patient from moderate to severe, and reduce oxygen dependency,” said Dr Atal. “The studies available showed this drug acts by reducing the viral replication,” he said. Dr Atal is looking forward to test this drug’s efficacy in the coming days. Consultant chest physician and intensivist Dr Shashank Kharwade said interferon are signalling proteins that help body’s immune system fight against viral infections. “As per the research study and trials, it is beneficial in moderate Covid viral pneumonia patients who have oxygen saturation between 90-94%. It means if the drug is administered early in moderate Covid pneumonia patients, then it may help recover faster and avoid later complications,” said Dr Kharwade. Dr Vimmi Goel, senior consultant physician, Kingsway Hospital, said interferons help body’s immune system defend against viral infections but it is also known to have side-effects. “Till now, we have not used this drug for Covid patients in the city but it’s use in moderate patients still remains uncertain, as there is insufficient data regarding this drug on large number of patients,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/single-dose-virafin-raises-hope-for-quicker-covid-cure-in-moderate-patients/articleshow/83351934.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chandigarh||India has lost 90% area under its biodiversity hotspots: CSE||Bathinda: India has lost 90% of the area under its four biodiversity hotspots. The Indo-Burma hotspot is the worst hit as the extent of vegetation in the region has been reduced from 23,73,057 sq km to a mere 1,18,653 sq km, a loss of 95%, says the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in its annual report. It also said that 25 species have gone extinct in these hotspots. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List monitors 1,212 animal species in India. The IUCN says over 12% of them are endangered. Out of the 148 endangered species, 69 are mammals, 56 amphibians and 23 reptiles. CSE director general Sunita Narain said: “Data collection is important—it is part of the art of governance — but it is equally important that entire data sets are shared and worked upon so that they can be critiqued and improved.” India’s forests could certainly use a better understanding of the crisis they are facing, says Richard Mahapatra, managing editor of Down To Earth. “At a time when we are witnessing an alarming fall in the timber and non-timber forest produce services in Indian forests climatic cycles are combining with other factors to result in a dramatic rise in forest fire alerts. We must learn to connect the dots.” The CSE report says 16 states have witnessed a significant rise in number of forest fire alerts. “India has seen a drastic rise in forest fires since the start of 2021. As of May 1, the number of fire alerts recorded by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is 4,33,581. This is quite a jump, even though the official forest fire season of the country is from February to June. The year 2016, the hottest on record when India’s annual temperature rose 0.71 degree C over the annual average, saw 5,41,135 forest fires.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/india-has-lost-90-area-under-its-biodiversity-hotspots-cse/articleshow/83351923.cms||---

In doing so, Thackeray sought to push the onus for providing reservations beyond the 50% limit on to the Centre. Thackeray also had a personal meeting with PM Modi, which lasted around 30 minutes, and created a buzz. On his one-on-one meet with the PM, Thackeray said, “I did not go to meet Nawaz Sharif (former PM of Pakistan). What’s wrong if I met the prime minister?” This was the second Modi-Thackeray meet after the latter broke ties with the BJP and became chief minister one-and-a-half year ago. CM thanks PM for free vax, says all issues will be sortedOn his one-on-one meet with PM Modi on Tuesday after the MVA delegation’s meeting, CM Uddhav Thackeray said, “There is nothing to hide, and I will not. Although we are not together politically today, our relations have not been broken. If I told my alliance partners that I wish to meet him, what’s wrong with it?” The MVA government is struggling with the impact of court orders cancelling various reservations for the Maratha, OBC, SC and ST communities. Last month, the apex court cancelled reservation in jobs and education granted to the Maratha community and also struck down 27% reservation for OBCs in local body polls. The Bombay high court, meanwhile, refused to stay a government order cancelling the 33% ‘reservation in promotion’ quota for SCs and STs. The delegation accompanying Thackeray included deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar from the NCP and PWD minister Ashok Chavan from the Congress, state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and Shiv Sena secretary Milind Narvekar. The delegation had a 90-minute meeting with Modi to urge him to consider legal and legislative solutions to the quota issue. Thackeray requested Modi to seek an amendment in the Constitution to relax the 50% ceiling on quotas in order to restore the Maratha quota. He asked for constitutional protection to be given to the OBC quota in local body polls since it is statutory and not constitutional. He also raised the ‘reservation in promotion’ of SC and STs issue and appealed that the Centre request the SC to dispose of the case soon. Thackeray said they had a ‘positive and satisfactory’ discussion. “We all are satisfied with the meeting, and I believe the issues will get sorted out soon,” he said. Thackeray applauded the Centre’s decision to provide free vaccination to all 18-plus citizens and thanked PM Modi. “Though we were prepared for the vaccination of 18-plus citizens, many hurdles erupted in the recent past. We hope now that all states and the country will be vaccinated. Every citizen has a right to get a free vaccine and to get protection from Covid-19,” Thackeray said. Meanwhile, ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis said he was not aware if Thackeray had met PM Modi separately. “Though I’m not sure if such a one-onone meeting took place, it is not surprising even if we assume a meeting happened,” he said.

The latest one being the drive-by vaccination, where people can take a shot of the covid-19 vaccine right on the road sitting in their own vehicles. A joint initiative by AMRI Hospitals and Kolkata Police, the inoculation drive will take off on Wednesday. One does not need to book a slot but pre-registration via the Co-Win portal is a must. All that one need is to drive down with an identity card used while registering and show the registration number. The vaccination team from AMRI Hospitals will verify the authenticity before administering the dose. One needs to wait for the mandatory half an hour at the spot still sitting in the car for observation. They can then drive back home in case of no AEFI. Each dose will cost the recipient Rs 850. “The drive is open to all eligible recipients who are above 18. They will get service while they remain seated in their cars. Many people still have this fear of going to hospitals because of Covid patients. We believe such drives will help us reach out to more people, scaling up vaccination. We are thankful to Kolkata Police for taking this up with us,” said group CEO AMRI Hospitals Rupak Barua. The first such camp will be launched at East Bengal Club approach road (Leslie Claudius Sarani) on Wednesday. Commissioner of Kolkata Police Soumen Mitra is expected to flag off the drive around 11 in the morning. The hospital has plans initiating two more similar camps at Ajoynagar Service Road on Thursday and and at KP Traffic Training School, Tala Park from Friday. Private hospitals in the city have not stuck the inoculation drive to the hospitals centres, expanding the drive to housing apartments, corporate houses, clubs, banquet halls, movie theatres and the likes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosp-cops-launch-drive-by-vax-facility/articleshow/83349562.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Hyderabad||UCIL row: PCB picks samples from farms in AP’s Kadapa||Hyderabad: Former scientists have slammed AP Pollution Control Board (PCB) of inaction for alleged pollution of agriculture fields in Thummalapalle, KK Kottala of Kadapa district by refuse from Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL). Meanwhile, PCB officials on Monday collected samples from the agriculture fields following complaints from farmers that their farms were flooded with uranium-contaminated water from the tailing pond of UCIL. The PCB officials said they have sent the samples to the lab and awaiting results. Due to heavy rain, tailing ponds and decantation ponds got flooded and uranium plant water mixed with rain water flooded the nearby agriculture fields. Dr K Babu Rao, former scientist of ICRISAT, said “We have been warning APPCB about the consequences of continuing inaction regarding UCIL pollution. A letter was written to Chairman, APPCB, in 2019 October where I specifically warned about likelihood of heavy rains (causing radioactive substance to spill over to farms).” Reacting to the latest leakage from UCIL tailing pond, Babu Rao said “Groundwater pollution has been going on unchecked due to inability of APPCB to fix responsibility on UCIL. It is four years since groundwater contamination was detected. Even now, APPCB has not been able to identify the source of groundwater pollution that is so evident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ucil-row-pcb-picks-samples-from-farms-in-aps-kadapa/articleshow/83351937.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The cantonment board has received two plants under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative from a private company and social organization. One plant, which would generate 500 litre per minute (LPM) oxygen, would be installed at the main hospital building while the second with 200 LPM capacity plant would be set up at the upcoming mother and child Covid care centre. Dr VD Gaikwad, the Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) resident medical officer, said, “We have got the equipment and the civil work is underway at the hospital. The installation would be completed in the next few days.” With addition of these plants, the cantonment hospital would become self reliant in oxygen supply. “We had several difficulties in arranging for oxygen cylinders when the Covid cases were high across the district. We were sending our teams to the supplier to get our daily quota of cylinders in April,” he added. The hospital has 20 ICU beds and 100 oxygen-supported beds for Covid patients. The cantonment has also decided to set up an 86-bed dedicated Covid mother and childcare facility, in view of the possible third wave of the pandemic. The facility would have 10 paediatric beds, six high-dependency units and five neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) beds. The PCB needed over 125 jumbo oxygen cylinders daily when the hospital was totally occupied. Gaikwad said, “The total cost of the oxygen cylinders was Rs25 to Rs30 lakh per month. Now, we will be able to reduce the cost to 50%. Moreover, we would be able to add more oxygen beds, if needed in the future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcb-to-install-2-oxygen-generation-plants-at-its-hospital/articleshow/83351958.cms||Sandip Dighe

However, he was admonished by cops for creating a scare among the people. Lingampalli Srinivas circulated a video of a snake to spread fear among villagers. He downloaded a video of the eastern hog-nosed snake from ShareChat and circulated it in local WhatsApp groups. What is unusual is that this snake makes a sound as if it is shouting when it opens its mouth wide. “I wanted to create fear. That is why I downloaded the video of the snake and circulated it,” Srinivas told Ramadugu police SI Tandra Vivek who questioned him. The video was reportedly circulated in as many as 15 WhatsApp groups. When people asked where did he capture the video of the snake, Srinivas responded saying that he had spotted it in the area near his house in Velichela. Srinivas thought the fear that he created would have its desired effect and children and youngsters would no longer gather near his house to play cricket. His idea boomeranged and the video in circulation was taken to the notice of police by the villagers. “If people are gathering against lockdown rules, bring it to our notice and we will book cases against them under the Epidemic Act. If you try to create fear again, we will book a case against you,” Vivek warned Srinivas and let him off. The Virginia Herpetological Society in its description of the snake says: “Eastern hog-nosed snakes are docile animals that bluff and feign death to discourage potential predation against them. At the initial encounter, the snake will inflate its body and neck, coil with head elevated and often turns sideways, hiss by rapidly expelling air from the lungs and strike with mouth open or closed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/villagers-prank-to-scare-kids-boomerangs/articleshow/83351945.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh 7th among states to give at least one vaccine dose||BHOPAL: When it comes to vaccinating eligible persons, Madhya Pradesh is seventh in the country in administering at least one dose of the vaccine. As per the official information available on the Co-win portal, a total of 1.13 crore people have been administered with at least the first dose of vaccine so far in the state. And when it comes to numbers Madhya Pradesh is at the seventh position, states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka and West Bengal have administered first dose of vaccine to more people than Madhya Pradesh. Sources said that of these seven states, it is only Gujarat and Rajasthan which have population similar to that of Madhya Pradesh, thus in terms of covering the total eligible population, state is only behind these two states, as now around 19% of the population that is eligible for vaccination have already been administered the first dose. Sources from the health department said that making the vaccination of even 18 plus population free and universal by union government will speed up the things and lead to better results. Till now it was like, there were two producers and all the states competed with each other, the key was still in the hands of Union government as it issued release orders, we from Madhya Pradesh had also raised objections in past against disproportionate allocation of vaccine to some states, and had requested that vaccines should be allocated in proportion with the population of the states, added sources. Now, by making it universally free, things will be in proportion to the population, said sources. Now, we are confident that if adequate and appropriate supply of vaccine is available we will be able to vaccine our entire eligible population within next four-five months, i.e., by November, because in past also we had vaccinated 2.5 crore people with measles rubella vaccine in around two months, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-7th-among-states-to-give-at-least-1-vac-dose/articleshow/83349587.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal traders vow to get vaccination shot, ensure Covid norms||BHOPAL: As and when lockdown is enforced, the worst-hit is the traders’ community. Industries are often allowed to continue operations but not the shopkeepers and vendors. Showrooms to roadside small shops remain shut and even when the lockdown is lifted, shops are allowed to open in a phased manner. Yet, in popular perception, it’s uncontrolled crowd in markets and blatant flouting of Covid-19 protocol by shopkeepers and customers alike, which contributes in a major way in creating a situation where lockdown is the only option left with the government and the administration. “Following lockdown, markets open first and then malls, restaurants and bars. But, in the absence of any mechanism to check entry of an infected person in the market, people crowding the markets are the most vulnerable to contract the infection. In malls, restaurants and bars, you have provision of thermal screening, you are offered sanitiser, the chair you sit is sanitised, social distancing is more or less maintained. But, in markets, you have no such provision, therefore monitoring of markets for observance of Covid-19 protocol is a must,” said Satish Chauhan, a govt servant. The administration is also prevailing upon the traders to ensure observance of Covid-19 protocol themselves, not give goods to people with mask, draw circles outside shops to let customers stand at safe distance from one another and don’t allow crowding in the market. The chief minister himself has appealed to traders to follow the principle of “Mask nahin, saman nahin” (No mask, no goods). Following demand by traders to allow shops in all the segments to pull up shutters, district administration on Monday decided to concede to the demand if all the shopkeepers and their staff working in the shops get vaccinated in the special camps being organised for them on Wednesday. “Vaccine lagwao, dukan khulwao” (get a vaccine jab and open the shop) said minister for medical education, Vishwas Sarang, who is minister in-charge for Covid control in Bhopal. And, how the trading community is responding to administration’s efforts to ensure adherence to Covid-19 protocol in the markets. Though the markets are not fully open but the shops, which are in operation, like the wholesale grocery shops in Azad Market, are trying to enforce Covid-19 protocol in the market. General secretary of New Market Vyapari Mahsangh, Ajay Devnani, said that only 100-odd shops out of 1280 shops in New Market are open as of now. But, we are cooperating with the Corona Safety Team (CST) created to monitor observance of Covid-19 protocol at the market places in the city. We are for spot fine both to shopkeepers and customers, if they flout the norms but the amount of penalty should not exceed Rs 200 as shopkeepers are in dire straits due to prolonged lockdowns in 2020 and 21. District collector, Avinash Lavania, said that officials of Covid Safety Teams would be deployed at every place, where we are expecting crowds to turn up once the lockdown is completely lifted — be it big markets or tourist spots, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/traders-vow-to-get-vac-shot-ensure-covid-norms/articleshow/83349604.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Trichy||Trichy: Farmers gearing for kuruvai cultivation asked to avail loan||Trichy: The Trichy district administration has invited farmers gearing up for kuruvai cultivation, to avail crop loan in the primary agriculture cooperative credit society (PACCS). Trichy collector S Sivarasu stated that the farmers can obtain crop loans from 147 PACCS in the district for kuruvai cultivation.  In 2020, PACCS had disbursed Rs 325.5 crore as crop loan to the farmers. “PACCS are ready to provide the crop loan for kuruvai paddy cultivation and other crops,” he said in a statement. Joint registrar of cooperatives G P Arularasu said that the state government has instructed them to disburse sufficient amount of loans to the farmers. “Farmers can avail the crop loan to the tune of Rs 400 crore for this year. If necessary, the ceiling can be increased,” Arularasu told TOI on Tuesday. It may be pointed out that the farmers were worried over the delay in issue of loan waiver certificate despite the previous AIADMK government writing off Rs 12,110 crore. There were apprehensions that their loan applications without the waiver certificate may be rejected. “Information of farmers whose loans were waived was published in the respective PACCS. So, the farmers need not worry about the certificate. They can apply for the loan,” Arularasu clarified. Farmers in need of crop loan have been asked to submit the required documents to the respective PACCS. In case of denial of loan and delay in the process, they can complain to deputy registrar (Trichy) at 9488605317, deputy registrar (Lalgudi) at 9488605317, deputy registrar (Musiri) at 8056676183 and the regional joint registrar at 7338749300. Joint director of the agriculture department, M Murugesan said that nurseries were being readied in Trichy district. A total of 46 tonne seeds of paddy varieties have been supplied to the agriculture extension centres . “TPS 5variety is introduced to the Trichy farmers this time. Farmers may have the seeds with them or buy from private companies also,” Murugesan told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-gearing-for-kuruvai-cultivation-asked-to-avail-loan/articleshow/83351959.cms||Gokul Rajendran

It has sought the state social welfare department’s help, thus raising a concern that a large section of these super-spreaders, might be left out of the inoculation radar. Rotary Club of Calcutta Labanhrad has been trying in vain to vaccinate this section. “We faced several challenges. First was preparing a list of rag-pickers and pavement-dwellers. They don’t have ration or Aadhar cards, so registering on Co-Win will be difficult,” said Anindya Chatterjee, president of the Rotary Club. Speaking to TOI, social welfare minister Shashi Panja said, “We all know what the ground realities are regarding availability of vaccines. There are different sections of the community out of the realm of inoculation. To include them we must ensure adequate stock.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Is it cold, allergy, flu or Covid? Symptoms similar but not same, say docs||NAGPUR: Pre-monsoon showers have lashed Nagpur in the last two days and many of us, especially children, will now experience symptoms like cold, allergies, and flu. Covid-19, flu, common cold, and some allergies have similar symptoms but there is no need to panic, say doctors. While we should consider all such symptoms as possible Covid-19 infection for precaution, there is no need to hurry for RT-PCR test or CT scan. Senior intensive care physician Dr Rajan Barokar said, “People have become cautious, which is very good, but there is no point in going for RT-PCR immediately after experiencing symptoms like cough, muscle ache, tiredness, sneezing or sore throat.” Barokar added, “Ideally the test should be done after 3-5 days of symptoms. But until then, one should consider themself as a Covid-19 patient and isolate from other family members as a responsible citizen.” He further said, “Visit your family doctor or any physician and get yourself tested. Before Covid tests, simple blood tests like CBC (complete blood count) give a better idea of whether it is Covid-19 or the seasonal flu.” Both Covid-19 and the common cold are caused by viruses. These viruses spread in similar ways and cause many of the same signs and symptoms. However, there are a few differences. While coronavirus symptoms generally appear 2-14 days after exposure to it, symptoms of a common cold usually appear 1-3 days after exposure to a cold-causing virus. Paediatrician Dr Sanjeev Joshi said children could be asymptomatic in Covid-19 but there is no chance for them to remain asymptomatic in case of common cold and flu. “Silent flu is very rare. If your kid has already taken the flu vaccine and is still experiencing symptoms, it could be Covid-19,” he explained. Joshi added, “Generally, children are safe and most of them recover without illness from Covid-19. If symptoms come and stay for more than 3 days, you must see a paediatrician,” he said. With rains around the corner, seasonal allergies will also emerge. Allergies are immune system responses triggered by exposure to allergens, such as a seasonal tree or grass pollens. Also, while Covid-19 can cause shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, seasonal allergies don’t usually cause these symptoms. Doctors urged people to use masks regularly as the markets are open now and people are mingling with each other. Standard precautions like maintaining distance, wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding crowded indoor spaces should be followed, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/is-it-cold-allergy-flu-or-covid-symptoms-similar-but-not-same-say-docs/articleshow/83351954.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The woman, who hails from Mumbra in Thane district, was on a visit to her parents’ house at Akurdi when the duo tried to rob her. Later, the youth, who was handed over to the Nigdi police, told the policemen that the woman’s brother-in-law, who stays at Wadala in Mumbai, had hired them to carry out the crime. “Their plan came unstuck when the woman raised an alarm and resisted the duo’s bid till people from the vicinity came to her rescue and managed to overpower the youth. She sustained injuries on her right finger in the scuffle with the intruders,” Ravsaheb Bamble, sub-inspector, Nigdi police, told TOI. The arrested suspect, Ikarma Barmare of Mazgaon in Mumbai, his aide and the woman’s brother-in-law have been booked under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery), 511(punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Bamble said that around 11.30am on Monday, the duo barged into the woman’s house. Wielding a sharp knife, one of them threatened to kill the woman and attempted to snatch her gold chain, he said. Bamble said that the woman raised an alarm and resisted the man. Hearing her screams, the neighbours rushed into her home. Seeing the people, the duo started running away. During the scuffle, the woman sustained injuries on her finger. “The residents nabbed Barmare. His accomplice, however, managed to flee,” Bamble said. During questioning, Barmare revealed that the woman’s brother-in-law had hatched a plot to rob her gold ornaments. “We are investigating the case and have sent a team to detain the woman’s brother-in-law for questioning,” Bamble said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/youth-held-for-attempting-to-rob-womans-ornaments-at-akurdi/articleshow/83156061.cms||---

While the curfew had been lifted in 72 district earlier, Lucknow, Meerut and Gorakhpur would be out of it from Wednesday morning. However, the authorities said restrictions between 7pm and 7am would remain effective as before. No relief would also be given in weekend curfew in public interest. At least 797 new coronavirus cases were reported in the last 24 hours while 2,224 were discharged from hospitals or relieved from home isolation. This left the state with just 14,076 active Covid-19 cases. “There will be relaxation in coronavirus curfew in all the districts of the state from Wednesday onwards, from 7am to 7pm, for five days in a week as active Covid-19 cases have dipped below 600,” an official spokesman said. Additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said UP’s case positivity was around 0.27% and was below 1% for the last one week which speaks of the effective control on Covid-19 situation in UP. “Constant improvement in Covid-19 situation has taken state’s recovery rate to 98% now,” Prasad said. Officials attributed the success to the hard work put in by surveillance committees which worked overtime to find out hidden cases of influenza like symptoms and get the patients tested. Covid-19 deaths remained less than 100 for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. As many as 94 casualties were reported across the state taking the total to 21,425. Officials insisted that despite the decline in cases, the risk of infection persists. They urged the people to adhere to Covid-19 prevention protocol and get themselves vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-relaxes-covid-curfew-night-weekend-curbs-to-remain/articleshow/83353186.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Mumbai||Another clash with Centre? MVA govt pushes to exit PM’s crop cover scheme||MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is pushing hard to exit the Prime Minister’s Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) or crop insurance scheme in what could become another flashpoint with the Centre. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray raised the issue in his meeting with PM Narendra Modi on Tuesday. In May, Thackeray had written to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar pointing out that the premiums paid to insurance companies in the state in the last five years outstripped the claims paid to farmers. While the premiums since 2016 amounted to Rs 23,180 crore, the claims paid were Rs 15,622 crore. Times ViewThe last two years have seen a large number of states including those with BJP governments like Gujarat, opt out of the PMFBY. The exodus grew after the Centre capped its premium, leaving a larger financial burden on the states. There have been rising allegations that insurance companies have profiteered from the scheme by making large sums of money on premiums, which far outstrip the claim payouts to farmers. The scheme’s design treats the village as a unit. This means farmers suffering losses are at a disadvantage if the yield of the village is high. Although the Centre has amended the scheme in response to criticism, perhaps it needs to take greater inputs from states for a major overhaul.Thackeray suggested that Maharashtra be allowed to implement the crop insurance model introduced in Beed district, where a portion of the unused premium has to be returned to the government in a good year. The state has been raising this issue since January. But, the ministry turned down the request, saying it will take some time to study the proposal. It said that for the current kharif season, the state should continue to implement the PMFBY. Several states have already exited the PMFBY including Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Telangana and Bihar. Under the PMFBY, the farmer pays 2% of the premium, while the rest is split between the Centre and state. However, the payout of claims to farmers can extend upto 350% of the premium. If the claims paid are less than the premium, the insurance company can keep the amount that remains. Last year, drought-prone Beed district did not receive bids from private insurers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-another-clash-with-centre-mva-govt-pushes-to-exit-pms-crop-cover-scheme/articleshow/83353192.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

After all, the police are only performing their public duty. When they question someone who is moving around during total lockdown, the concerned person is expected to properly answer to the police,” observed justice N Anand Venkatesh. “Police cannot be subjected to abuse and threat by anyone and such acts must be dealt with very sternly. This court is not going to be lenient when it comes to threatening the police, when they are performing their duty during this pandemic situation,” observed the judge. The judge made these observations while hearing the anticipatory bail plea of Kaja alias Kaja Hussain, and directing him to pay Rs 10,000 for abusing police officials who had questioned him for travelling in an auto without following Covid-19 protocol in Trichy district. The judge also directed the petitioner to file an affidavit to the registry expressing regret for the entire incident and giving an undertaking that he will not be involved in any such activities in future. The judge said that the petitioner must pay the compensation to the advocate clerk’s welfare association at Madurai on or before June 11. Posting the case for reporting compliance on June 14, the judge directed the police not to arrest the petitioner till then. The main allegation made against the five accused persons including the petitioner, who is the fourth accused in this case is that they had abused and prevented the police from doing their duty. The additional public prosecutor submitted that police had arrested the first three accused while the petitioner and the fifth accused are absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-warns-of-stern-action-against-those-abusing-police-on-duty/articleshow/83349595.cms||Kaushik Kannan

When the outbreak and lockdown started last year, the Amritsar MC had made 85 teams of cops and civic officials led by a councillor each for home delivering the essentials. Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu said: "We had a team to issue emergency passes on the spot and another to take food to the patients and those who had lost their jobs and businesses. "Each of us, on a personal level, fed 300 to 400 people each day." The MC had also released the telephone numbers of grocers and chemists but the system crashed under heavy traffic, and now all the decisions to deliver the essential services are in the hands of police and the health department. The AMC is left with just sanitising the areas based on a given list. The Punjab Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, empowers the MCs to ration food, order medicines, and disinfect buildings in case of outbreaks. Rintu said they had a team of 5,000 in different departments for anytime deployment. He went silent when asked why the MC’s significance had been downgraded and Covid management given over to the bureaucracy. "Eventually, we the elected representatives and not the appointed officials are answerable to the people," was all he could say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/amritsar-mcs-5k-army-forced-out-of-covid-war/articleshow/83351952.cms||Yudhvir Rana

CIFA founder P Chengal Reddy said: “Soya beans farmers are disturbed by the announcement of government of India to import 12 lakh tonnes of soya cake.

The import of soya will impact them and result in a considerable reduction of soya price in the market. Farmers from north Indian states will be hit badly,” he said.

Most of those who went for their jabs were senior citizens, who were hesitating to go to vaccination centres because they feared long queues and crowd. However, since Tuesday’s time slot was exclusive, seniors were happy. Many young members of the community too went to the camp to receive their jabs. Lakshmi Rao and husband VV Rao are an elderly couple who have stayed indoors mostly for the past 15 months. They were glad that the Association had taken this initiative. “The afternoon slot was convenient too since we could go in leisurely after lunch,” Lakshmi said. Maruvada Vijayalakshmi (70) too was extremely happy at the initiative. “Apart from old age related issues, many of us have so many co-morbidities. But since this was a fast track camp, we could take the vaccine,” she said. The Association even offered to ferry the seniors. “We are extremely happy at the response. We will hold another camp soon after we collate details of how many more people within the community are left to take the jab and whether they want us to book another slot like this for them,” said president of the Association, Srinivas Vedula.

The new academic session (2021-22) will commence from September 13, said deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma. There are 41 lakh students enrolled in UP universities. As reported by TOI in its June 2 edition, students in final year/terminal semester of various UG and PG courses across the state will be assessed through an examination before they receive degrees. In institutions where exams for 5th semester (in UG) and 3rd semester (in PG) were not held, last semester scores will be calculated on marks obtained in previous semesters. Students in second year, who did not take exams last year will also take the test. Students dissatisfied with their marks will be allowed to appear for improvement examinations in one or all subjects to beheld in 2022-23, he said. Both state and private universities must conduct OMR-based test which consists of multiple-choice questions by mid-August. The government recommended universities to reduce both examination duration and number of questions in the test. The three-hour test will be reduced to 90 minutes and number of questions will be reduced to five, instead of 10, Sharma said. The government further said, universities could consider the option of online examination for courses, they think is feasible. It also recommended universities to award marks of practical examinations for terminal semester/graduating students as per performance in theory papers. The viva-voce should be done online. However, the final call on modalities of conducting examination will be taken by respective universities. All results are to be announced by August 31. For universities where both UG and PG courses are run under the annual scheme, the government decided to promote all first-year students to second year. First year results of such students will be tabulated based on performance in second year examinations when they take them. Universities which conducted exams for first-year students in 2020 will prepare second-year results of such students based on performance in first year. Subsequently, students will be promoted to third year. However, in universities which couldn’t conduct exams for first year in 2020, students must appear for exams in second year through an OMR based test. Based on their performance, they will be admitted to the third year. Under the semester system, for second-semester students who didn’t take their exams, all universities will prepare results on basis of their performance in first semester exams and mid-term/internal evaluation of second semester. The same formula will be applied to UG and PG students who are in odd semesters. In institutions where no examinations were held, marks for odd semesters will be based on performance of students in mid-term/internal evaluation (whichever is available), results of even semesters will be based on previous semester marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-varsities-first-year-students-to-be-promoted-test-for-final-yr/articleshow/83353203.cms||Isha Jain

A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi was hearing a public interest litigation filed by R Ezhiloviya, a resident of Pudukottai district. The petitioner stated that the livelihood of the tribal people in the state was affected during the second wave as they could not market their produce. The tribal people who were once a self-sustaining population have now become dependent on the government, NGOs and volunteers. As per the Unicef data, about 40% of children under the age of five in India are stunted, and 16% are severely stunted. The midday meal scheme offered in government schools was the assured source of nutritious food for the tribal children. In the wake of the pandemic, the schools were closed all over the state as a result of which there are adverse effects in the nutrition intake of tribal children. She stated that in Kerala, community kitchens have been set up to feed the needy people. Hence, it is of utmost importance for the state government to establish community kitchens in the tribal hamlets to ensure that the tribal people and their children get nutritious food during this pandemic period. Since no steps were taken by the authorities on the representation sent, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench. The petitioner further sought to convert the government buildings including schools and forest department guest houses as Covid care centres to isolate and treat the tribal people affected with Covid-19, since home isolation would not work in tribal areas. The petitioner also sought to establish makeshift schools equipped with required devices for the students to attend online classes at all tribal hamlets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-establish-community-kitchens-in-tribal-hamlets-during-pandemic/articleshow/83349652.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Wadettiwar aims to set up liquor trade in Gadchiroli: Dr Bang to CM||Nagpur: Noted social worker Dr Abhay Bang and his wife Dr Rani have rushed a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray complaining that relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar’s recent statement of lifting the liquor ban from Gadchiroli after Chandrapur has led to confusion and chaos. The minister had told the media on May 29 that the ban was supported by activists driven by ‘vested interests’ and it lacked public support. Accusing the minister of crossing his jurisdiction, the Ramon Magsaysay recipient claimed the former had deliberately made a statement of constituting a committee to lift prohibition. “He aims to set up an annual liquor trade worth Rs 1,000 crore in Chandrapur and Rs 500 crore in Gadchiroli. He’s superseding CM Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and guardian minister Eknath Shinde by making such a declaration without consulting them,” said Dr Bang. Recounting on how the ban came into effect in the Naxal-infested district, the Maharashtra Bhushan awardee said it was implemented by NCP supremo Sharad Pawar in 1993 as CM after taking all the aspects into consideration. “It was in line with the central and state governments’ ‘policy for tribal areas’. The district-wide alcohol-tobacco control experiment is under way under the ‘Alcohol-Tobacco Control State Level Task Force’ chaired by the CM. For this, 1,100 villages have set up ‘Muktipath’ organizations to continue the prohibition,” he said. The founder of NGO SEARCH in the backward district said women had staged non-violent protests more than 2,000 times for banning alcohol in various villages. The ‘Adivasi Gram Sabha Mahasangh’ of 1,050 villages and five towns had sent proposals to the government in support of the ban. “Even the collector and police are actively supporting such public awareness and non-violent campaigns. The masses are turning from Naxalism to democracy due to prohibition. Liquor consumption has dropped by 70% and 48,000 villagers have stopped consuming liquor. Expenditure on illicit liquor and tobacco too has reduced by about Rs 100 crore annually,” said the doctor. Stressing on continuing the ban, the Padma Shree winner said during parliament, assembly and Gram Panchayat polls, a majority of contestants have to submit written and video recorded assurances to voters to support prohibition. “After reviewing the Gadchiroli pattern in 2019, a working group of six ministers and an equal number of secretaries under the CM decided to implement it in two other districts,” the couple said, while requesting the CM to remove confusion created by his minister through his malafide statement. Refuting charges, Wadettiwar warns of defamation case against Bang Refuting Dr Abhay Bang’s allegations, minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the former seems to have lost his mind. He denied making any statement on lifting prohibition in Gadchiroli. “I just replied to a media query on whether the Chandrapur model would be replicated in Gadchiroli. It’s up to the district guardian minister (Shinde) to take a decision in this regard. I am no one to comment on the issue and have absolutely nothing to do with the liquor trade,” he said. Warning the veteran doctor of a defamation suit for making such baseless allegations, the Bramhapuri MLA asked him to produce evidence. “It’s nothing but a cheap publicity stunt by Dr Bang, who has hardly made any major contribution towards the development of Gadchiroli. He shouldn’t preach to others when his own house is in disorder,” said Wadettiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wadettiwar-aims-to-set-up-liquor-trade-in-gadchiroli-dr-bang-to-cm/articleshow/83351977.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

On Monday, the rural areas in Madurai accounted for over 61% of the new cases reported in the district. In Trichy, urban areas have been recording only 30% to 35% of daily infections since June 1. The rural administrative blocks in Trichy district have been undergoing multi-level screening at the doorstep by self-help group (SHG) women, anganwadi workers and volunteers to identify potential cases. Poor awareness about isolation and delay in seeking medical attention have been making these blocks vulnerable. Gatherings in villages despite the lockdown and people failing to follow standard operating procedures at funerals were cited as reasons too. About 50-60 workers are covering the households in Manapparai, Manachanallur, Musiri, Thottiyam and Thiruverumbur blocks with pulse oximeters and thermal scanners. After a team surveys a vulnerable village, another team follows it up. “The infection is coming down but the rural parts have not witnessed a decline as much as the city. Intense screening is underway to test the potential positive cases,” a senior health official in Trichy said. In Madurai, people in contained zones have been asked not to venture out and assured that the district administration and local bodies will attend to their immediate requirements. District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar visited Madurai north and Vadipatti blocks on Tuesday and inspected the Covid care centre at Mangayarkarasi College in Paravai and functioning of the PHC at Samayanallur. He also visited the mobile camp at Umatchikulam put up by the public health department. Residents in rural areas of Trichy with low oxygen level are immediately referred to interim Covid care centre (ICCC) for further screening and deciding on hospitalisation. Every block has an ICCC to accommodate the patient until the test result is disclosed and a triage to screen the vulnerable cases. As in the urban areas, the health department has made even mildly positive patients to stay in CCC unless the block medical officer and health inspector find them eligible for and capable of safe home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-madurai-to-rein-in-high-rural-cases/articleshow/83351969.cms||Deepak Karthik

The court was hearing the petition filed by A Pavanasam, father of P Muthu Mano, 27, seeking a judicial inquiry by a sitting judge of HC and seeking the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 2 crore. This is the second petition filed by the petitioner before the HC Madurai bench. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that earlier the petitioner had filed another petition where the primary relief sought for was to transfer the investigation to CB-CID. Various directions were passed by the single judge. The last direction was on April 29, wherein the petitioner was directed to receive the body of the deceased on or before May 1. The judges said that subsequently the petitioner had filed this present petition seeking a judicial inquiry. When the petition came up for hearing before a division bench on May 12, the bench said that it was not inclined to pass any direction as the petitioner had not complied with their order. The judges observed that today (Tuesday) also they are placed in a similar position. The judges observed that in the absence of any order reversing or setting aside the earlier order, they are of the view that the petitioner should either comply with the direction to receive the body or if aggrieved he has to challenge the order before the Supreme Court. Hence, the judges adjourned the case to June 14. The judges also made it clear that if the petitioner receives the body, all issues raised by him would be left open and would be considered by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/murdered-mans-father-fails-to-comply-with-order/articleshow/83349626.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CM thanks PM for free vax, says all issues will be sorted||Mumbai: On his one-on-one meet with PM Modi on Tuesday after the MVA delegation’s meeting, CM Uddhav Thackeray said, “There is nothing to hide, and I will not. Although we are not together politically today, our relations have not been broken. If I told my alliance partners that I wish to meet him, what’s wrong with it?” The MVA government is struggling with the impact of court orders cancelling various reservations for the Maratha, OBC, SC and ST communities. Last month, the apex court cancelled reservation in jobs and education granted to the Maratha community and also struck down 27% reservation for OBCs in local body polls. The Bombay high court, meanwhile, refused to stay a government order cancelling the 33% ‘reservation in promotion’ quota for SCs and STs. The delegation accompanying Thackeray included deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar from the NCP and PWD minister Ashok Chavan from the Congress, state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and Shiv Sena secretary Milind Narvekar. The delegation had a 90-minute meeting with Modi to urge him to consider legal and legislative solutions to the quota issue. Thackeray requested Modi to seek an amendment in the Constitution to relax the 50% ceiling on quotas in order to restore the Maratha quota. He asked for constitutional protection to be given to the OBC quota in local body polls since it is statutory and not constitutional. He also raised the ‘reservation in promotion’ of SC and STs issue and appealed that the Centre request the SC to dispose of the case soon. Thackeray said they had a ‘positive and satisfactory’ discussion. “We all are satisfied with the meeting, and I believe the issues will get sorted out soon,” he said. Thackeray applauded the Centre’s decision to provide free vaccination to all 18-plus citizens and thanked PM Modi. “Though we were prepared for the vaccination of 18-plus citizens, many hurdles erupted in the recent past. We hope now that all states and the country will be vaccinated. Every citizen has a right to get a free vaccine and to get protection from Covid-19,” Thackeray said. Meanwhile, ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis said he was not aware if Thackeray had met PM Modi separately. “Though I’m not sure if such a one-on-one meeting took place, it is not surprising even if we assume a meeting happened,” he said. Fadnavis said when he was CM, the PM used to discuss various issues with him separately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-thanks-pm-for-free-vax-says-all-issues-will-be-sorted/articleshow/83353218.cms||Sujit Mahamulkar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Chorus for new TPCC chief gets louder||HYDERABAD: The chorus to appoint a new Telangana Congress president is getting louder. A change of guard in the state Congress has been hanging fire for over two years after incumbent N Uttam Kumar Reddy resigned from his post following the party’s defeat in the 2018 assembly elections. Stressing on the need to have a new boss to run the state party affairs, former Union minister Balram Naik said the high command should consider appointing a candidate from ST community as new TPCC president. “It is unfortunate that ST community leaders who have been loyal to the party are not even being considered for the coveted post,” he rued. Former MP Madhu Yashki Goud urged the party leadership to appoint a leader from the BC to lead the party in the run-up to 2023 assembly polls. “The BC population in the state is over 52 per cent and a BC leader of the party should be made TPCC president,” he said. Sangareddy MLA T Jagga Reddy, who has thrown his hat in the ring, said he has a ‘formula’ to bring down KCR-led TRS government. “This is the right time to effect a change of guard as the new chief will have enough time to rebuild the party before the next assembly elections,” he said. The Congress Loyalists Forum comprising veterans is also stepping up its game by demanding that only loyal party members be given a chance to lead the party. Marri Shashidhar Reddy and V Hanumanth Rao are front runners for the top post from the CLF. AICC secretary in charge of Telangana affairs Manickam Tagore told TOI that the high command is likely to take a decision on appointment of a new TPCC president anytime soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chorus-for-new-tpcc-chief-gets-louder/articleshow/83351996.cms||Roushan Ali

The petitioner had sought for a direction to the state government to frame appropriate rules to govern the appointment of public prosecutors, additional public prosecutors, government pleaders, standing counsel to appear on behalf of the government at all the subordinate courts and tribunals in the state in consonance with the order of the Supreme Court and on a par with the Law Officers of High Court of Madras and its Bench at Madurai (Appointment) Rules 2017. The advocate general R Shanmugasundaram appearing for the state submitted that appropriate procedure is in place in the form of guidelines issued in 1961. A division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi directed the principal secretary of home department to file a counter by enclosing all the relevant guidelines which are in existence for selecting law officers for subordinate courts.

---||Trichy||Trichy corporation introduces pilot waste collection model||TRICHY: Trichy Corporation has come forward to streamline its waste collection process after coming under criticism for lapses in the door-to-door waste collection leading to littering on roads. A streamlined waste collection mechanism was implemented in one of the 65 wards, and based on its outcome, it will be replicated in remaining wards, the civic body has said. At present, the city generates 320 to 350 MT of waste per day. The door-to-door waste collection, which was supposed to be done daily, was covered on alternative days. The irregularities led to littering on roads while sanitary workers were accused of setting fire to the garbage mounds. After repeated complaints, corporation chose ward number 23 in the Ariyamangalam zone for the pilot project. A team of 30 sanitary workers were appointed in the ward and each was allotted a pushcart to cover 100 households daily. Around six supervisors have been appointed to monitor them. “The workers will have to complete waste collection from houses and commercial establishments between 6am and 9am. The collected waste should be placed in the street corners, from where the trucks will remove them,” a sanitary official said. At present, the doorstep waste collection through mini-trucks is covering only 60% of the households. The manual collection is expected to ensure street-level coverage. “Trichy East MLA Inigo Irudhayaraj who suggested the proposal has instructed to continue waste collection even on Sundays,” the official added. The workers are provided with a whistle to alert the residents. Residents have been told to dump waste in two separate bins as biodegradable and non-biodegradable. Erring residents will be penalised. Both permanent workers and SHG women have been mobilised for the waste collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corporation-introduces-pilot-waste-collection-model/articleshow/83351987.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Trichy rural health centres lack toilets||TRICHY: Government hospitals in semi-urban towns and primary health centres (PHC) in villages lack toilets for outpatients and attenders. Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in footfall at government hospitals in Musiri, Thuvakudi and Lalgudi for both Covid and non-Covid related consultations. Both medical professionals and rural residents said that the sanitary infrastructure at GHs and PHCs has not improved. “Mostly the people waiting for outpatient consultation and attenders of patients undergoing treatments are urinating and defecating in the open. Unlike the urban population, the rural residents will not even raise a complaint when it comes to sanitary infrastructure,” said Padma Shri M Subburaman, a social worker in Trichy. NGOs and social workers who were at the rural health centres in Musiri and Thottiyam blocks for handing over oxygen cylinders under CSR activity said that people visiting the health centres could not access a toilet. A government doctor under condition of anonymity added that most of the old PHC buildings lack proper infrastructure for patients. “New PHCs are relatively better, but Musiri GH desperately needs an overhaul,” the government doctor said. When contacted, Musiri MLA N Thiyagarajan said that a sanitary complex will be built at the Musiri GH at the earliest. “Doctors apprised their concern during our recent inspection. We will consider appointing more sanitary staff for the rural health centres through the respective rural local bodies,” the MLA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-rural-health-centres-lack-toilets/articleshow/83352003.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Fuel hike hits retailers hard in border areas||BHOPAL: While it might be the common man who is bearing the biggest brunt, the rise in petrol and diesel prices is also causing distress among fuel retailers operating on the borders of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Take a comparison of fuel prices in the two neighbouring states — while the price of petrol has cross the Rs 100-mark in MP, thanks to the taxes slapped by the state government, petrol rates are still below Rs 100 in UP. The difference in rates becomes even more distinct if one compares the border districts. Take for example, the price of petrol in Chhatarpur and its bordering district of Mahoba in UP. On Sunday, petrol was sold at Rs 93.48 per litre in Mahoba while in Chhatarpur’s Luvkushnagar, petrol price stood at Rs 106.3 per litre — a major difference of over Rs 12/litre. This huge difference in rates sort of offers an advantage for those living in these border areas. Jamuna Prasad, a native of Luvkushnagar who runs a stone crusher and also owns a farm land, said, “I get my vehicles filled to the capacity of the fuel tank from Mahoba, barely 15km from my house, and thus save a lot every month.” He added that people living in the interior of Madhya Pradesh might feel jealous of those in Luvkushnagar. However, for fuel retailers, this is not the ideal situation. “This phenomenon is costing us dearly. The sales have been going down gradually for the past few years. Now it has declined to more than 50%,” a petrol pump owner said. Madhya Pradesh collects a tax of about Rs 27.75 on every litre of petrol sold in the state and this includes a cess of Rs 4.50. On the other hand, the state collects about Rs 18.75 tax on diesel including Rs 3 cess. The quantity of the revenue generated through fuel can be understood from the fact that after a hike of just Re 1 on the petrol and diesel, the government had aimed at collecting an estimated Rs 570 crore annually — Rs 200 crore from petrol and Rs 370 crore from diesel. Across the state, the chorus is for a reduction in fuel. “We require more and more capital to procure the fuel on a daily basis when our margin of profit remains the same,” a petrol pump owner said. In areas bordering UP, a large number of fuel stations are said to be on the verge of closure. Rclaim that the only ones gaining from the fuel price hike are the state governments and the oil companies. In February this year, the fuel retailers in MP released statistics to show that petrol and diesel are the costliest in Madhya Pradesh. President of the fuel pumps owners’ association Aay Singh said that retailers have been demanding the governments to lower the fuel prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/fuel-hike-hits-retailers-hard-in-border-areas/articleshow/83349686.cms||---

---||Lucknow||BJP will contest 2022 polls under Yogi Adityanath, says Uttar Pradesh BJP chief||LUCKNOW: UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Tuesday affirmed that the saffron party would contest the next assembly polls next year under the leadership of none other than Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. “UP ka chunav Yogi ji ke netritva mein hi lada jayega,” Singh told TOI on Tuesday. His statement further defused speculations about BJP's top central leadership asserting itself for changes in the government in the state ahead of the high-stake assembly elections due next year. This comes a day after Yogi, in an interview with TOI, scotched speculations that the recent high-level meetings of the BJP and RSS brass had anything to do with the changes in his government. The political corridors of BJP have been abuzz with high-decibel rumors about ex-IAS officer-turned-BJP MLC AK Sharma, who is considered close to PM Modi, being adjusted in the state cabinet and given a prominent portfolio. Singh said that the party workers would soon be asked to fan out across the state and create atmosphere in favour of the BJP by projecting the face of both PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi. The party workers will visit villages and highlight the schemes and achievements of the Modi as well as Yogi government. The party would also heavily rely on the hard work of its workers,” he said. The UP BJP chief had recently hailed Yogi as one of the most popular and hardworking CM the state ever had.

---||Mumbai||MLA Pratap Sarnaik seeks arrest bar in NSEL case, restraining of ED||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MLA from Thane Pratap Sarnaik, along with sons Vihang and Purvesh and a relative, Yogesh Chandegala, has filed a petition in the Bombay high court seeking protection from arrest, and restraining the Enforcement Directorate (ED) from investigating them in the National Spot Exchange Limited money laundering case till the court decides on his plea. The court will hear the petition on Thursday. Sarnaik claimed high handed action against him by the ED, and cited BJP leader Kirit Somaiya’s tweet that read, “Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik GAYAB, his partner in Titwala land scam arrested few weeks back, since then Sarnaik is not traceable”. Sarnaik also cited a news report in which Thane builder Yogesh Deshmukh was referred to as an “aide of Sarnaik”. In April, the ED had arrested Deshmukh, who was a partner in one of the companies with Sarnaik that had allegedly received Rs 22 crore tainted money from the NSEL scam. It was said the ED was on the lookout for Sarnaik for questioning, but he was not traceable. It was alleged that the Aastha Group had defaulted on a Rs 250 crore payment in NSEL and Sarnaik’s company, Vihang Group, helped it to launder the money. Aastha Group and Sarnaik’s Vihang Group had formed a joint venture, Vihand Housing Project, and had purchased several plots at Titwala with the help of Deshmukh. ED officials learnt that some of the plots were fraudulently acquired from farmers. During the investigation, the ED found that from the Rs 22 crore, the accused used Rs 1 crore to pay farmers while Rs 11 crore was transferred to Sarnaik’s company and Rs 10 crore to Deshmukh. The ED had attached the Titwala plots in 2014 and subsequently, the adjudication authority had confirmed the attachment. The ED officials informed the local revenue authority about the attachment to ensure that no further transactions take place related to the land. But revenue officials failed to take the ED’s attachment order notice on record. In January, the ED officials learnt that Deshmukh, with the help of Sarnaik, was developing the attached plots for sale, after which the ED initiated further investigation. Earlier, Sarnaik had got protection from the SC against any coercive action in the money laundering charge the ED was investigating against him in the Tops Grup case. The earlier management of NSEL had indulged in criminal conspiracy which resulted in investors trading in non-existent goods and losing the money. Many dubious sellers had defrauded investors of their investments worth Rs 5,600 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mla-sarnaik-seeks-arrest-bar-in-nsel-case-restraining-of-ed/articleshow/83352122.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Delhi||No evidence that next wave will hit children: AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria||NEW DELHI: There is no evidence to suggest that the next wave of Covid-19 will cause serious infection in children, AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said underlining that 60-70% of kids who were hospitalised had co-morbidities while most others had mild disease and recovered at home. “I don’t think we will have a serious infection in children in the future,” Dr Guleria said. He said data collected from the first two waves showed that neither new variants nor the old ones caused severe infection in kids. “No data, global or Indian, has had any observations of kids being affected more. Even in the data from the second wave, most infected kids had mild illness. Mostly those with co-morbidities required hospital admission,” he said. “In many parts of the world where new waves are happening there’s no data to show children are being severely affected,” he added. However, there is need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, including following hand hygiene, wearing masks and avoiding crowd, he said. With the Centre pushing for preparedness of paediatric health infrastructure to be able to tackle any surge in cases of Covid among kids, hospitals across the country have started ramping up facilities for paediatric care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-evidence-that-next-wave-will-hit-children-guleria/articleshow/83357254.cms||---

J R P Manikandan of Ramanathapuram said that he had been a wholesale tomato trader for three decades. During the first lockdown last year when Covid struck, he had given away bags of assorted vegetables to 2,000 families, including municipality workers and loadmen. This year too, he gave away bags of five kg rice and vegetables to thousands of families. When he realised that people were struggling to find groceries and vegetables during the lockdown, he decided to provide bags of tomatoes to 5,000 families as a goodwill gesture. “Tomatoes are used in many dishes, nutritious and have immunity boosting properties, hence I decided to give them away,” he said. A good quantity of tomatoes would ensure a proper meal. His family and friends helped pack the tomatoes into bags of two kg each and they distributed them through share autos in all the residential areas of the municipality on Sunday and Monday. “The response was overwhelming though the tomatoes are only selling at Rs 15 a kg. People said that it would help them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tomato-vendor-distributes-15-tonnes-to-poor-families/articleshow/83349751.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Shift in monsoon pattern may make Thar desert greener, says BSIP-JNU study||LUCKNOW: It may sound strange but a greener and serene Thar desert may become a reality due to the change in monsoon pattern and rise in temperatures in India due to global warming, according to a joint study conducted by the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, and Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi. According to the study published in renowned international journal, ‘Climate Dynamics’, air temperatures in India have been unusually warmer from 2000-2020, making the period warmest in the last 130 years. This climate change has resulted in the monsoon shifting towards Rajasthan and Gujarat leading to frequent floods in the two states along with erratic rainfall events over all the places. A team of three scientists – Rajesh Agnihotri from BSIP and PM Maharana and AP Dimri from JNU – investigated the developing patterns of change in temperature and moisture distribution over the Indian subcontinent in recent decades and found some new “warmer and colder”, along with new “wetter and dryer” zones in India. The study also contradicts the earlier perception of global climate change which advocated that global warming will make wet regions wetter and arid zones drier. “We analyzed the monthly data of rain and temperature in India spanning over a century available from various reliable sources like Indian Meteorological Department, the University of Delaware, National Centre of Environmental Protection/National Centre of Atmospheric Research, among others. After processing and analyzing the data, we found that the impact of global warming in India is not the same/equally distributed in the entire country but it varies according to region,” said senior scientist Rajesh Agnihotri. “We concluded that the temperature and moisture distribution over the Indian subcontinent has been changing in recent decades with rise in global temperature. Due to climate change, northern Rajasthan, Jammu and Punjab regions are getting warmer at a greater pace while Odisha, West Bengal and coastal Andhra regions are getting relatively colder,” he added. Prof AP Dimri of JNU’s School of Environment Sciences said places in Northeast India like Cherrapunji, which used to record very high rain, have witnessed a dip in rainfall while precipitation has increased in dry regions of Gujarat and southern Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shift-in-monsoon-pattern-may-make-thar-desert-greener-bsip-jnu-study/articleshow/83353219.cms||Mohita Tewari
