Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther named Elaine Bryant as the new chief of the Columbus Division of Police, following months of turmoil in the force amid a series of high profile fatal police shootings of Black men and children.  "We need a police chief who is committed to change. We need a leader with extensive experience in law enforcement, as well as sound judgement, empathy, and a commitment to community policing," Ginther said during a press conference Wednesday. "We have found all of this in Elaine Bryant." Bryant has been with the Detroit police department since 2000 and has held several positions in the agency, including commander over the agency's major crimes unit. In her application, she promoted her skills in several areas, "including community relations, emergency preparedness, strong administrative background, investigative and proactive policing."  Bryant will be the city's first Black female police chief.  "I have faced many obstacles in my journey, some because of my gender and some because of my race," Bryant said in her first time speaking as chief. "I've never let these obstacles stand in my way."  The selection had come down to Bryant and finalists Avery Moore, an assistant Dallas police chief, and Ivonne Roman, the former chief of the Newark, New Jersey, police department.  Roman tweeted her congratulations Tuesday to Bryant. "Sending a BIG CONGRATS to Detroit's Deputy Chief Elaine Bryant on being selected as the next Columbus, OH Police Chief. She was stellar during the town hall and the residents of Columbus are lucky to have her," she tweeted.  In addition, Moore told WTTE-TV and The Columbus Dispatch he was not selected. "I was disappointed," Moore told the Dispatch. "I had hoped to have the opportunity, but I'm very busy in Dallas and I've got to keep working."  Ginther has been adamant that the new chief come from outside the department, saying that was the only way to enact the kind of broad, cultural changes he was seeking in the agency.  As part of the selection process, Columbus also created a first-ever assistant chief post to allow the next chief to bring his or her own team. Ginther has said candidates wanted that ability to allow them to put their own plans in place.  In January, Ginther forced out the man he selected for the job in 2019 - Chief Thomas Quinlan, a veteran Columbus officer - saying he'd lost confidence in Quinlan's ability to make needed changes.  The announcement comes at a time of historic reckoning for the department. Ginther and other officials invited the Justice Department in April to review the agency for deficiencies and racial disparities in several areas.  The department is also under scrutiny for recent fatal shootings of Black people by white officers, including the death of 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant on April 20.  Earlier this month, the city agreed to pay $10 million to the family of Andre Hill, a 47-year-old Black man who was shot and killed by former Officer Adam Coy as Hill walked out of a garage holding a cell phone. It's the largest civil settlement in Columbus history.  Coy, who is white, was fired after the shooting and has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and reckless homicide in the Dec. 22 death of Hill.  Also this month, a federal judge ordered the city to alter the way it responds to mass protests, saying officers ran "amok" during protests over racial injustice and police brutality last summer.  The union representing Columbus officers has criticized what it calls politicians' "constantly vilifying officers."  The Columbus agency - like many big-city departments - is juggling calls for internal change even as it battles a spike in gun violence. Columbus saw a record 174 homicides in 2020 and as of mid-May had recorded 74 so far this year, a figure not reached until late July of last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/first-black-woman-set-to-serve-as-next-columbus-police-chief/articleshow/83185712.cms||---

Citing statistics published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on tele-density and the number of common service centres run by the ministry of electronics and IT, a bench of justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat said, "There exists a digital divide in India, particularly between rural and urban areas. The extent of advances made in improving digital literacy and digital access falls short of penetrating the majority of the population in the country. Serious issues of availability of bandwidth and connectivity pose further challenges." Read AlsoFor India’s foreign policy future, vaccine game must be wonThe Quad is at the core of the new global geopolitics and the US, an early skeptic, has taken ownership and put itself in the driving seat. Beyond the vaccine conversations, says Indrani Bagchi , this shift was the unwritten headline during External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s“A vaccination policy exclusively relying on a digital portal for vaccinating a significant population of this country between the ages of 18-44 years would be unable to meet its target of universal immunisation owing to such a digital divide. It is the marginalised sections of society which will bear the brunt.... This could have serious implications on fundamental right to equality and the right to health.” Coronavirus: Live updatesTimes ViewThe CoWin app has its utilities, but it also has serious limitations. Making registration on it mandatory for vaccination could leave millions of underprivileged Indians, especially those in rural India, out in the cold. Which means that at its core, the vaccine policy is discriminatory and non-egalitarian in nature. The apex court has rightly raised these pertinent questions.The SC sought clarifications from the Centre on the following issues in two weeks: * Is it feasible for majority of the population to rely on friends/NGOs for digital registration on CoWin for slots? * If digital registration was meant to prevent crowding at vaccination centres, how will it be avoided at community service centres in rural areas where people will have to visit constantly in the hope of a vaccine slot opening up? Read AlsoAarogya Setu App to now show vaccination status; be used for travel &amp; access to various premisesThe Aarogya Setu App will now display your vaccination status after verifying the same with the CoWIN portal. In the long run, displaying fully vaccinated status on this App could be a tamper-proof way of proving the same for purposes like travel.* Can certain vaccination centres be earmarked for on-site registrations for those aged between 18-44 years to prioritise those with co-morbidities/disabilities/other socio-economic vulnerabilities? Alternatively, if specific daily quotas could be introduced for on-site registration at each centre or specific centres? * Whether on-site registration with self-attestation of age to ensure widespread vaccination can be provided? The bench said CoWin platform and other IT applications like Aarogya Setu should be made available in regional languages and asked the Centre to specify the timeline for ensuring the same. The SC also suggested conducting a disability audit for the CoWin website and Aarogya Setu. On supply chain of vaccines, the SC asked the Centre and states to specify how they were managing the logistical burden, including cold storage facilities, for vaccinating all eligible people. It wanted to know “whether cold storage facilities in India have increased for the Covid-19 vaccination drive, their present numbers, and comparison with the numbers prior to March 2020”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/digital-divide-will-exclude-marginalised-from-jabs-supreme-court/articleshow/83185732.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Slain Rakesh Pandita was targeted while visiting a friend in Tral Payeen, around 45km from Srinagar, without the two personal security officers assigned to him, the police said. A daughter of the friend, identified as Mushtaq Ahmad, was injured in the terror attack. Injured Asifa Mushtaq has been admitted to SMHS hospital in Srinagar. "The BJP leader had asked his security guards to remain in Srinagar when he set out to visit his friend’s home at Tral," a police officer said. "Security forces have cordoned off the area and a massive search operation is underway to nab the three assailants." Pandita, chairperson of the Tral Municipal Committee, had been provided "secured hotel accommodation" in Srinagar along with PSOs, the police said. Condemning the killing, lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said, "Saddened to hear about the terror attack on the councillor Shri Rakesh Pandita...Militants will never succeed in their nefarious designs, and those responsible for such heinous acts shall be brought to justice." A series of terror attacks on political workers had rocked the Valley last year, starting with the killing of Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita in his Anantnag orchard in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/bjp-municipal-chief-killed-in-jk-terror-attack/articleshow/83194492.cms||M Saleem Pandit

No injury or damage was reported in the exchange of fire. Official sources said Pakistan Rangers fired some 20 rounds upon noticing movement of vehicles clearing bushes near a forward post on the Indian side. Earlier on May 2, Pakistan had violated the ceasefire by opening fire along the IB in Ramgarh sector. This was the first ceasefire violation by Pakistan since February 25 when a fresh agreement was signed between the two countries to maintain calm along the border. On May 14, BSF troops had recovered drone-dropped arms and ammunition in Samba district, approximately 250 metres inside the Indian territory. Alert BSF troops also foiled at least five infiltration bids and captured two intruders between March 16 and May 18 this year. They also shot dead two intruders and injured one, who later succumbed to his injuries during treatment at a Jammu hospital on May 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-violates-truce-along-ib-in-jk/articleshow/83186006.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The United States is the worst-affected country with 595,213 deaths, followed by Brazil with 465,199, India with 335,102, Mexico with 227,840, Peru with 184,507 and Britain with 127,782. WHO narrows in on Delta Covid variantThe World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday said that one strain of a Covid-19 variant first detected in India was now considered "of concern" and had been dubbed "Delta", while two other strains had been downgraded. The B.1.617 variant of the virus, which has in part been blamed for India's explosive outbreak, has been called a triple mutant variant since it is split into three lineages. WHO last month declared the entire strain a "variant of concern", or VOC, but on Tuesday, it said only one of the sub-lineages deserved that label. Australia's Victoria extends Melbourne lockdown for 2nd weekThe Australian state of Victoria extended on Wednesday a snap coronavirus lockdown in its capital of Melbourne for a second week. Victoria officials said Wednesday that the state recorded six new locally acquired coronavirus cases, bringing the latest outbreak to 60 active infections. The lockdown is the fourth for Melbourne, which has 5 million residents. More than 800 people died in that outbreak, accounting for about 90% of Australia's total deaths since the pandemic began. Cafe chairs are stacked up on the Lygon Street cafe and restaurant strip in Melbourne. (AFP)France widens Covid vaccine drive to 12 to 18-year-oldsFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday said that France will start offering Covid-19 vaccines to everyone between 12 and 18 on June 15. Macron said that 50 percent of French adults have now received at least one Covid vaccine jab, calling it "truly a turning point" in the country's inoculation drive. Vaccine supplies have increased sharply recently, prompting officials to open up appointments to all adults earlier this week, several weeks ahead of schedule. With the country just beginning to bounce back from a severe third wave of infections, Macron's government is keen to quickly expand the vaccine coverage to slow the spread of variants that could spell fresh disaster. Lonza to up Moderna Covid jab output with Dutch production lineSwiss firm Lonza said Wednesday it will open a new production line for the drug substance in Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine, making it possible to churn out hundreds of millions more jabs per year. The new line will be set up at Lonza's site in Geleen, Netherlands, and is expected to begin production by the end of the year, the Swiss company, a major supplier to the pharmaceutical industry, said in a statement. The move marks an expansion of a deal Lonza signed with Moderna in May last year to help produce the US vaccine-maker's jab, which is based on pioneering mRNA technology. AstraZeneca starts deliveries of Thailand-made vaccinesAstraZeneca's partner in Thailand has started its first deliveries of Covid-19 vaccines after concerns they were behind on their production schedules for the country and parts of Southeast Asia. Siam Bioscience says the first locally produced AstraZeneca doses were delivered Wednesday to Thailand's Ministry of Health ahead of the June 7 start of the country's official mass vaccination program. Last year, AstraZeneca signed Siam Bioscience to be its vaccine production and distribution center in Southeast Asia. Free beer, other new incentives for Biden's 'vaccine sprint'Dangling everything from sports tickets to a free beer, President Joe Biden is looking for that extra something that will get people to roll up their sleeves for Covid-19 shots when the promise of a life-saving vaccine by itself hasn't been enough. Anheuser-Busch -- the leading brewery which produces Budweiser -- on Wednesday said that America's next round of beer would be on them if the nation achieves president Joe Biden's goal of 70% of adults being partially vaccinated by July 4. Biden, earlier last week, expressed optimism over the vaccination progress in the US. "As more Americans get vaccinated, the days grow brighter and brighter," he said during an address in Virginia. Japan gives another $800M to UN-backed COVAXJapan's prime minister announced another $800 million to the UN-backed programme to deploy Covid-19 vaccines for poor countries, a four-fold increase of Japanese funding to the COVAX programme. Yoshihide Suga spoke as Japan co-sponsored a fundraising event for COVAX with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which helps run the programme. The programme managers are seeking about $2 billion more to reach a target of $8.3 billion for its effort to fund free vaccines for low- and middle-income countries around the world. The additional $800 million will bring Japan's contribution to $1 billion, Japan PM said. 'Pandemic plunges 100 million more workers into poverty'The UN on Wednesday said that the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed more than 100 million more workers into poverty after working hours plummeted and access to good-quality jobs evaporated. The UN's International Labour Organization in a report warned that the labour market crisis created by the pandemic was far from over, Employment was not expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest, it said. The ILO's annual World Employment and Social Outlook report indicated that the planet would be 75 million jobs short at the end of this year compared to if the pandemic had not occurred. And it would still have 23 million fewer jobs by the end of next year than would otherwise have been the case.

Addressing a virtual meeting with senior party functionaries, Mehbooba said, “From the rising graph of Covid-positive cases and fatalities it is clear that the administration in J&K, like the rest of the country, was caught unprepared to meet the exigencies. Nepotism and favouritism has crippled the entire administrative setup in the erstwhile state, compounding miseries of the general masses.” She said administration at the district level has been crippled as the governing dispensation in New Delhi is not allowing officers to make decisions required for the welfare of people. “The independence and functioning of the administration has been made hostage to the political aspirations of BJP, and Jammu has been at the receiving end,” she said. The PDP chief said the Mughal Road and Kishtwar-Sinthan highways remained closed for vehicular traffic despite huge amounts spent on snow clearance only because those sitting in New Delhi consider surface connectivity of Rajouri-Poonch and Doda-Kishtwar-Ramban of Chenab region with Kashmir as detrimental to their political interests. “The closure of these vital road links has not only affected the trading community but has also restricted options for those who are required to go for specialised medical treatment,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-apathy-proving-more-fatal-than-covid-in-jk-mehbooba/articleshow/83186075.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||Biden, GOP senator to meet as infrastructure deadline looms||WASHINGTON: Deadline looming, President Joe Biden is set to meet with the top Senate Republican negotiator on infrastructure as the administration signals time is running out to strike a bipartisan deal on the White House's big investment proposal and top legislative priority. The president is looking forward to hosting West Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the White House said ahead of the Wednesday afternoon session. The two will continue bipartisan negotiations. The administration's deadline for a deal is now June. 7. Privately, however, the president has sized up the GOP's latest $928 billion offer as unworkable, in large part because it taps unused COVID-19 funds to pay for it. Biden wants to hike the corporate tax rate to generate revenue, a nonstarter for Senate Republicans. Publicly the administration is making it clear it views next week as a make-or-break moment for the president's push toward a deal with Republicans. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Capito is heading into the meeting re-upping the GOP's push to repurpose the coronavirus relief fund to pay for infrastructure investments. “That's the key to getting a bipartisan agreement,” McConnell said at a press conference in Kentucky. He said he particularly wants to halt unemployment assistance that he says is preventing Americans from returning to work. “I hope we can get there,” he said. Together, the president and the Republicans both have political incentives to negotiate a bipartisan accord over his sweeping investment package, even if no deal is within sight. For Biden, reaching across the aisle and cutting deals in Congress is central to his brand of politics. Republicans can also score political gains by trying to work with a popular president. Yet an initial Memorial Day deadline came and went without results and in the latest round of talks, Biden and a core group of GOP senators appear to have pulled farther apart. Democrats, who hold slim majorities in the House and Senate, are watching warily as the White House and Republicans try to narrow the gap between the president's initial ideas for a massive investment in not just roads and bridges but the “human” infrastructure of hospitals and child and senior care facilities, and a GOP approach that is more focused approach on traditional infrastructure projects. The White House has pared back the president's initial $2.3 trillion bid, now tallied at $1.7 trillion, with Biden proposing to fund the investment by raising the corporate tax rate, from 21 per cent to 28 per cent. “He's appreciative and heartened by the good faith effort that we've seen from Republican senators but as the president said last week we do need to finish these negotiations soon,” White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday traveling with the president on Air Force One to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where delivered remarks to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre. Biden's own thinking is that the Republican proposal, while improved from an earlier $568 billion opening bid, is unworkable because the Republicans want to tap unspent COVID-19 funds to pay for the spending, according to a White House official granted anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. The president, in meetings with his team, has zeroed in on the questions the GOP proposal raises — namely, which coronavirus relief funds to possibly shelve. Biden's view is that tapping the COVID funds would unduly burden the middle class, including small business owners, who are receiving the virus aid during the pandemic crisis. McConnell said Wednesday he wants to halt the extra federal unemployment benefits as that he believes are unnecessary and providing an incentive for Americans to stay home. “The coronavirus is behind us. We need to get back to work,” McConnell said. For Republicans, the corporate tax hikes are a red line they will not cross, and instead want to pay for the infrastructure investment with virus aid money as well as typical gas taxes and other fees on consumers. “I think we can get to real compromise, absolutely, because we're both still in the game,” Capito said over the weekend. “I think the president told me himself that let's get this done.” Congress is away for a weeklong Memorial Day break, but faces a deadline when lawmakers return next week. Without a bipartisan agreement, Biden will be faced with trying to muscle support from Democrats alone. That approach also poses political challenges in the narrowly divided House and Senate where the administration has few votes to spare if the president tries to push the package to passage under budget rules that allow for a majority vote. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday that by the time Congress resumes, June 7, "we need a clear direction.” The White House said the president is also eyeing action in the House that week when the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is set to begin debating a big highway reauthorisation bill that is being closely watched as a potential building block toward the broader package. Jean-Pierre noted the panel's June 9 hearing as “a relevant date in terms of the overall time frame." That week, she said, "will be incredibly critical.” A similar bipartisan highway bill is underway in the Senate and those bills, along with others being negotiated over water resources and other public works could make up the foundations for a broader package.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-gop-senator-to-meet-as-infrastructure-deadline-looms/articleshow/83186457.cms||---
---||World||Ukrainian president says Russian troops remain near Ukraine||KYIV: Ukraine's president said Wednesday that Russia has maintained a massive military presence near his country's borders. Speaking during a meeting with a group of visiting US senators, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy charged that Moscow had withdrawn only a fraction of the forces it concentrated near Ukraine in April, a buildup that worried the West as well as Ukraine. The Russian buildup came amid regular cease-fire violations in the conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, and fuelled fears that full-scale hostilities would resume. The Russian military announced a pullback of its troops following the completion of drills in late April. But it ordered the troops to leave their weapons behind in southwest Russia near Ukraine for another big military exercise set for September. Zelenskyy claimed Wednesday that Russia so far has withdrawn just a fraction of the more than 100,000 troops that Ukrainian officials said had been deployed near the border earlier in the spring. “They only have pulled back about 10,000 soldiers,” Zelenskyy told the three US senators in Kyiv. “The Russian forces' pullback is just a declaration.” Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, a senior Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Republican Rob Portman of Ohio and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy emphasized strong bipartisan support for Ukraine. “This bipartisan trip sends a clear message that the United States is committed to rebuilding our transatlantic relations and reasserting US global leadership to promote democratic values,” they said in a statement. “We talked about the importance of increasing our ties, providing even more effective military assistance, so Ukraine can defend itself," Portman told reporters after the talks. Russia annexed the Black Sea's Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014 following the ouster of Ukraine's Moscow-friendly president and then threw its weight behind separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Seven years of fighting has killed more than 14,000 people and devastated Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, called Donbas. A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but skirmishes have continued along the line of contact and a political settlement has stalled. Ukraine and the West have accused Russia of shoring up the rebels with troops and weapons — allegations that Moscow has denied. The Kremlin sternly warned Ukrainian authorities against trying to reclaim control of the rebel east by force, saying it could be pushed to intervene to protect civilians there. Moscow also has bristled at NATO's joint drills with Ukraine, saying they reflect the alliance's aggressive intentions and give a boost to hawkish circles in Ukraine. Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, said Wednesday that the Russian military would closely monitor NATO's Sea Breeze exercise, which is set to be conducted jointly with Ukraine in June and July. Konashenkov charged that the maneuvers would serve as a cover for providing Ukraine with weapons and munitions. He warned in a statement that the Russian military would follow the drills and “respond in line with the evolving situation to ensure military security of the Russian Federation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/ukrainian-president-says-russian-troops-remain-near-ukraine/articleshow/83186677.cms||---

The gunman also wounded a fire captain at the station about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Los Angeles on Tuesday before setting his house on fire in a nearby community and apparently killing himself, officials said.  Preliminary interviews with other employees at Fire Station 81 indicate the shooter and the firefighter who was killed had "some workplace beef," said Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Brandon Dean, who is overseeing the homicide investigation.  "It sounds like they didn't like each other," Dean told The Associated Press, without elaborating about their problems.  He said investigators will comb through the Fire Department's personnel files to see if any official complaints had been made or disciplinary actions had been taken before the bloodshed. It was not immediately clear how long the two had worked together at the station in Agua Dulce, a rural community of about 3,000 people in the desert of northern Los Angeles County.  The coroner's office on Wednesday identified the firefighter who died as Tory Carlon. The 44-year-old fire specialist who drove the firetruck was shot several times in the upper torso, authorities said. He had three daughters and had been with the department for more than 20 years.  Hundreds of people honored him at a vigil Tuesday night at a park near the station, remembering him as a devoted father and committed firefighter who mentored younger colleagues.  The 54-year-old fire captain who was wounded was still in critical but stable condition. He is expected to survive his injuries, Dean said. Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the captain had previously been a deputy before transferring to the Fire Department.  Detectives believe the captain, who wasn't identified, heard the shooting and went to find the source of the gunfire, but it wasn't clear if he tried to intervene or the attacker turned the gun on him, Dean said. It was not immediately clear if the shooter also had a dispute with the wounded man.  Property records show that firefighter Jonathan Tatone owned the home that burned in the community of Acton, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the fire station. He bought it last July. Tatone is listed as a county firefighter since at least 2012, according to public payroll and pension records kept by Transparent California.  The coroner's office has not officially identified him as the shooter, and an autopsy is pending. Fire Department officials on Wednesday did not release more details about his employment.  The gunman was off-duty when he went to the fire station and opened fire, authorities said. He then drove to his house and set it on fire. He was later found dead in an empty pool of a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted because nobody else was there and deputies didn't open fire, sheriff's officials said.  Investigators seized a handgun at the home they believe is linked to the shooting at the fire station.  Fire Chief Daryl Osby said the small station - one of 172 throughout Los Angeles County - has only four firefighters per shift and was considered a second home by employees who typically work 24 hours at a time.  "As a fire chief, I never thought that when our firefighters face danger, that they would face danger in one of our community fire stations," Osby said.  Tuesday's shooting occurred less than a week after a man opened fire with three handguns at the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority bus and rail yard in San Jose, killing nine of his co-workers and then himself as law enforcement closed in. He had rigged his home to burn down before heading to his longtime workplace last Wednesday.  Acquaintances said 57-year-old Samuel Cassidy had a short fuse at times and a longtime grudge against his workplace, but the exact motive for the shooting was under investigation. Body camera footage from a Santa Clara County sheriff's deputy who went into a building as shots were being fired was released Tuesday.  A new FBI report found that California had the most mass shooting incidents in the last 20 years, aligning with the fact that it's the nation's most populous state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-firefighters-had-job-dispute-before-fatal-attack/articleshow/83186714.cms||---

Tunisian naval units rescued a total 109 people, the Defense Ministry said. Most of the migrants were from sub-Saharan Africa. The separate sinkings were the latest in a series of accidents involving migrant boats off the North African country. A ministry statement said rescuers moved into action after getting an alert from an oil platform, saving 70 migrants from Sudan and Eritrea and one from Egypt. They told officials they had set off from the Libyan town of Zuwara the night before. In a second operation, 39 migrants were saved off the port city of Sfax where they had embarked, the ministry said. The International Organization for Migration said 20 people were dead or missing in Tuesday's incidents. ``These tragic sinkings underscore the unfortunate conditions and the perilous trips of these vulnerable migrants,'' the IOM's Azzouz Samri said. Fifty migrants drowned off Tunisia in mid-May while 100 others were rescued at the end of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/2-migrants-dead-more-than-100-rescued-off-tunisian-coast/articleshow/83186832.cms||---

Like others, they were terrified by the heavy bombing in Israel's fourth war with Gaza's Hamas rulers that began May 10. The explosions felt more powerful than in previous fighting. At night, parents and children slept in one room so they would live or die together.  Yet the relatively well-to-do Rimal neighborhood where the family lived in a cluster of apartment buildings seemed somewhat safer than areas along Gaza's border with Israel, which had been devastated in this and past fighting.  Then one night disaster struck. Azzam al-Kawlak's four children had gone to bed, and he and his wife were preparing to join them.  At around 1 am on May 16, a thunderous boom shook his top-floor apartment, followed quickly by a second and third. "The floor cracked below our feet and the furniture was thrown to the wall," the 42-year-old engineer said.  The four-story building collapsed, with Azzam's apartment dropping to the ground. The family escaped through the kitchen balcony, now almost ground level. Bizarrely, the laundry hanging on a clothesline seemed untouched.  It took a day for the full horror to emerge, as bodies and survivors were pulled from the rubble. The family and neighbors used ropes to clear chunks of concrete, working alongside ill-equipped rescue teams.  By nightfall, the family's death toll stood at 22. Eight bodies were dug out of Azzam's building and 14 from the one next door. The dead included 89-year-old family patriarch Amin, his son Fawaz, 62, his grandson Sameh, 28, and his great-grandson, 6-month-old Qusai.  Just a day earlier, Qusai's parents had celebrated a small milestone, his first tooth. Azzam's two younger brothers were killed. Three nieces - 5-year-old Rula, 10-year-old Yara and 12-year-old Hala - were found in a tight embrace, their bodies the last to be pulled out, said Azzam's surviving older brother, Awni.  The bombing along several hundred meters (yards) of al-Wahda Street took just minutes. In all, it brought down three houses - two in the al-Kawlak compound and one nearby - and killed a total of 43 people, making it the single deadliest air raid of the 11-day war.  Israel said the target was a Hamas tunnel underneath the street, part of what it called a roughly 350-kilometer-long (220-mile) underground network. The tunnels served offensive and defensive purposes, military officials said, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields.  Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said during a war-time briefing that the military target in Rimal collapsed, causing nearby houses and their supporting structures to collapse as well. "That caused a large amount of civilian casualties, which were not the aim," he said.  He said the army was reviewing the incident and "adjusting the analysis and the ordnance used in the future" to prevent similar events from occurring again. "It's not a totally mathematic exercise in choosing the ordnance," he said.  He said Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes in areas just as densely populated, with far fewer casualties.  Defense Minister Benny Gantz told foreign journalists this week that Israel does everything it can to avoid civilian casualties, but Gaza's crowded urban landscape makes it virtually impossible to avoid them altogether.  "Hamas is aiming to hit civilians by purpose and we are trying our best for that not to happen," he said.  The fighting began May 10 after Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem in support of Palestinian protests against Israel's heavy-handed policing of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims, and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers. In all, Hamas fired more than 4,000 rockets toward Israel during the war, while Israel said it struck hundreds of targets linked to militants in Gaza.  At Gaza City's main police compound, Capt. Mohammed Meqdad picked through pieces of bomb fragments in a cardboard box labeled "al-Wahda Street."  Two had serial numbers identifying them as fitted with Joint Direct Attack Munition kits manufactured by Boeing Co. at its factory in St. Charles, Missouri, to make them so-called "smart bombs," able to be guided to a target by GPS or lasers. Boeing did not answer questions about the bombing, only saying in a statement: "In accordance with U.S. law, the U.S. government authorizes and provides strict oversight for all defense exports."  Meqdad said that based on the fragments, the bombs that brought down the al-Kawlak homes were likely GBU-31s, packed with 430 kilograms (945 pounds) of high explosives. The GBU-31 typically is used for large buildings, but also can destroy underground targets, said N.R. Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, a specialist arms investigations firm.  The bombs carry a powerful blast, meaning surveillance, intelligence-gathering, pre-planning and the correct choice and explosive punch of the weapon should be carefully considered before an attack, he said.  "The intrinsic wide-area effects of large explosive munitions mean they must be used judiciously in the urban environment," he said.  The Israeli military did not respond when asked what bombs were used in the al-Wahda Street strikes.  Earlier this year, the International Criminal Court began investigating Israel and Hamas for possible war crimes going back to the previous 2014 war. This includes random Hamas rocket fire toward Israeli communities - widely seen as a violation of the rules of war - and some of Israel's deadliest practices, such as the toppling of high-rises that killed entire families in pursuit of militants.  Two Gaza rights groups - al-Mezan and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights - have been documenting Israel's strikes and incursions for years. This time, they again interviewed survivors, including the al-Kawlaks, visited hospitals, took photos and collected death certificates, in preparation for possible new submissions to the ICC.  Samir Zakout of al-Mezan and Mohammed al-Alami of PCHR said they believe the al-Wahda Street bombings - along with other deadly airstrikes - violated the laws of war, arguing the value of any possible military target was dwarfed by significant harm to civilians.  Zakout accused Israel of intentionally using excessive firepower to sow fear, saying it was "one of the direct goals of the war."  The Israeli military does not recognize the ICC, but says its airstrikes are cleared by lawyers to make sure they comply with international standards. During the fighting the military released video of what it said were air force teams calling off strikes because they spotted children in the vicinity. In many cases, it ordered occupants to evacuate buildings before bombing them.  International law professor Paola Gaeta said that "certainly we are witnessing something which is wrong," referring to civilian deaths, but there is a high threshold for proving a war crime. This includes proving disproportionate use of force and intentional targeting of civilians, said Gaeta, who teaches at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva.  If Israel says it made a reasonable mistake in calculating the amount of explosives in the al-Wahda Street strike, this could serve as a defense, she said.  In all, 254 people were killed in Gaza in this war, including 67 children and 39 women. according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas has acknowledged the deaths of 80 militants. Twelve civilians, including two children, were killed in Israel, along with one soldier.  Awni al-Kawlak keeps 22 death certificates in a briefcase, along with the deeds for the two destroyed homes. A third family house was damaged and awaits demolition. The family business, a generator repair shop, was also destroyed. Two apartment buildings, including Awni's home, remain intact.  Sitting in a courtyard behind the rubble, the 49-year-old shrugged when told of Israel's apparent acknowledgement of error. "What will I do with this information?" he said. "I lost my livelihood and I lost my brothers and their children."  The fear that justice will never come makes it harder for the family to deal with loss, he said. He worries that Gaza and its problems, including a suffocating blockade enforced by Israel and Egypt since 2007 to contain Hamas, will soon sink back into oblivion.  "We know that the world is now empathetic, but after a while it will forget our problem," he said. "Even when they remember us again, they will remember us as numbers."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/gazas-bereaved-civilians-fear-justice-will-never-come/articleshow/83187482.cms||---
---||World||Netanyahu opponents reach coalition deal to oust Israeli PM||JERUSALEM: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opponents announced they have reached a deal to form a new governing coalition, paving the way for the ouster of the longtime Israeli leader. The dramatic announcement by opposition leader Yair Lapid and his main coalition partner, Naftali Bennett, came moments before a midnight deadline and prevented the country from plunging into what would have been its fifth consecutive election in just over two years. In a statement on Twitter, Lapid said he had informed the country's president of the deal. ``This government will work for all the citizens of Israel, those that voted for it and those that didn't. It will do everything to unite Israeli society,'' he said. Under the agreement, Lapid and Bennett will split the job of prime minister in a rotation. Bennett will serve the first two years, while Lapid is to serve the final two years. The historic deal also includes a small Islamist party, the United Arab List, which would make it the first Arab party ever to be part of a governing coalition. The agreement still needs to be approved by the Knesset, or parliament, in a vote that is expected to take place early next week. If it goes through, Lapid and his diverse array of partners will end the record-setting 12-year rule of Netanyahu. Netanyahu, desperate to remain in office while he fights corruption charges, is expected to do everything possible in the coming days to prevent the new coalition from taking power. If he fails, he will be pushed into the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/netanyahu-opponents-reach-coalition-deal-to-oust-israeli-pm/articleshow/83187488.cms||---
---||World||Jill Biden getting Delaware beach day for her 70th birthday||WASHINGTON: Jill Biden is getting a day at the beach for her 70th birthday.  President Joe Biden and his wife were heading to their Delaware beach house Wednesday evening to help the first lady celebrate that personal milestone on Thursday.  The trip makes for a rare midweek getaway from the White House by a president. It will also be the president's first visit to the couple's Rehoboth Beach home since he took office in January.  The Bidens were expected to be back at the White House on Friday.  Jill Biden, a longtime community college English professor, recently finished virtually teaching a course for Northern Virginia Community College. She also won't be teaching over the summer.  Biden often speaks about how proud he is of his wife of nearly 44 years.  "Teaching is not what Jill does. Teaching is who she is," Biden said last week, echoing his wife's own description of herself. "And she's done it her, her whole adult life, and she's still doing it."  Biden said his wife had pledged she would continue to teach as first lady.  "But I don't think she bargained for having to teach online initially," he joked, adding that she spent a lot of time, "four hours a day for about a month," learning how to teach virtually as most schooling was done that way during the pandemic.  Biden bought the beach house for $2.7 million in 2017, after leaving the vice presidency and aided by a $8 million multibook deal that he and his wife signed.  The house is on a cul-de-sac in North Shores, just north of the resort town of Rehoboth Beach. It has a swimming pool that overlooks Cape Henlopen State Park, is blocks from the Atlantic Ocean and a short drive from downtown Rehoboth Beach.  The Bidens moved in less than two years after their son Beau, a former Delaware attorney general and Delaware Army National Guard member, died of brain cancer in May 2015. One sign on the house says "Beau's gift;" another sign reads "Forever Jill."  Jill Biden told Vogue magazine that her husband had promised her that "when I write my book, I'll buy you a beach house."  She added: "I wanted it to be the kind of place where you can come in in your wet bathing suit and bare feet and I can just take the broom and brush out the sand," she told Vogue for the March 2020 article. "And that's what this is. Everything's easy."  Joe Biden spent time in Rehoboth Beach during the 2020 presidential campaign, including after the Democratic National Convention and after becoming president-elect.  Biden so far has spent most weekends as president at his home in Wilmington, Delaware.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jill-biden-getting-delaware-beach-day-for-her-70th-birthday/articleshow/83187547.cms||---
---||World||US official to firms: Don't game DOJ policy against multiple penalties||WASHINGTON: A Department of Justice official on Wednesday warned companies against seeking lower penalties for bribery and foreign corruption violations by abusing a government policy discouraging officials from pursuing multiple enforcement actions against a company for the same misconduct. Firms should not abuse the so-called piling-on initiative, launched in 2018, by pressing the Justice Department for no action after seeking deals with other enforcement authorities, said Nicholas McQuaid, acting assistant attorney general for the agency's criminal division. "That is not the sort of approach that the 'piling on' policy is designed to encourage, and it is not the sort of approach that will find a receptive audience at the Department," Nicholas McQuaid said in remarks at an anti-corruption event. The warning from a top leader at the Justice Department comes amid USPresident Joe Biden's push for a broad-reaching anti-corruption agenda. Companies need to make "good faith" efforts to coordinate with Justice Department officials if they want credit for resolving other investigations, McQuaid said after highlighting the increased collaboration between the agency and foreign governments. "We cannot and will not restrict the scope of our enforcement actions in response to tactically front-loaded resolutions," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-official-to-firms-dont-game-doj-policy-against-multiple-penalties/articleshow/83187841.cms||---
---||World||Largest meat producer getting back online after cyberattack||DETROIT: The world's largest meat processing company has resumed most production after a weekend cyberattack, but experts say the vulnerabilities exposed by this attack and others are far from resolved. Brazil-based JBS SA notified the US government of a ransom demand from the ransomware gang REvil, which is believed to operate in Russia, according to a person familiar with the situation who is not authorized to discuss it publicly. REvil has not posted anything related to the hack on its dark web site. But that's not unusual. Ransomware syndicates as a rule don't post about attacks when they are in initial negotiations with victims or if the victims have paid a ransom. It's not clear if JBS paid a ransom. The White House referred questions about the ransom demand to the company, but JBS hasn't discussed it in its public statements. Phone and email messages seeking comment were left with the company Wednesday. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US is considering all options in dealing with the attack. ``I can assure you that we are raising this through the highest levels of the US government,`` she said. Psaki added that the attack ``is also a reminder to the private sector about the need and importance of hardening their own cybersecurity protections.'' JBS said late Tuesday that it had made ``significant progress'' and expected the ``vast majority'' of its plants to be operating Wednesday. The attack targeted servers supporting JBS's operations in North America and Australia. Backup servers weren't affected and the company said it was not aware of any customer, supplier or employee data being compromised. ``Our systems are coming back online and we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat,'' Andre Nogueira, CEO of JBS USA, said in a statement. Ransomware expert Allan Liska of the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said JBS was the largest food manufacturer yet to be attacked. But he said at least 40 food companies have been targeted by hackers over the last year, including brewer Molson Coors and E & J Gallo Winery. Food companies, Liska said, are at ``about the same level of security as manufacturing and shipping. Which is to say, not very.'' The attack was the second in a month on critical US infrastructure. Earlier in May, hackers shut down operation of the Colonial Pipeline, the largest US fuel pipeline, for nearly a week. The closure sparked long lines and panic buying at gas stations across the Southeast. Colonial Pipeline confirmed it paid $4.4 million to the hackers. Cybersecurity experts said the attacks targeting critical sectors of the US economy are evidence that industry hasn't been taking years of repeated warnings seriously. Cybercriminals previously active in online ID theft and bank fraud moved into ransomware in the mid-2010s as programmers developed sophisticated programs that permitted the software's more efficient dissemination. The ransomware scourge reached epidemic dimensions last year. The firm CrowdStrike observed over 1,400 ransomware and data extortion incidents in 2020. Most targeted manufacturing, industrials, engineering and technology companies, said Adam Meyers, the company's vice president of intelligence. ``The problem has been spiraling out of control,'' said John Hultquist, who heads intelligence analysis at FireEye. ``We're already deep into a vicious cycle.'' Hultquist said ransomware syndicates are going after more critical and visible targets because they've invested heavily in identifying ``whales'' - companies they think will yield big ransoms. JBS is the second-largest producer of beef, pork and chicken in the US If it were to shut down for even one day, the US would lose almost a quarter of its beef-processing capacity, or the equivalent of 20,000 beef cows, according to Trey Malone, an assistant professor of agriculture at Michigan State University. Mark Jordan, who follows the meat industry as the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, said the disruption to the food supply will likely be minimal in this case. Meat processers are accustomed to delays because of various factors including industrial accidents and power outages. They can make up for lost production with extra shifts, he said. ``Several plants owned by a major meatpacker going offline for a couple of days is a major headache, but it is manageable assuming it doesn't extend much beyond that,'' he said. Critical US infrastructure might be better hardened against ransomware attacks were it not for the 2012 defeat of legislation that would have set cybersecurity standards for critical industries. The US Chamber of Commerce and other business groups lobbied hard against the bill, condemning it as government interference in the free market. Even a watered-down version that would have made the standards voluntary was blocked by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Right now, the US has no cybersecurity requirements for companies outside of the electric, nuclear and banking systems, said David White, president of the cyber risk management company Axio. White said regulations would help, particularly for companies with inadequate or immature cybersecurity programs. Those rules should be sector-specific and should consider the national economic risks of outages, he said. But he said regulations can also have an unintentional negative effect. Some companies might consider them the ceiling _ not the starting point _ for how they need to manage risk, he said. ``Bottom line: regulation can help, but it is not the panacea,``' White said. JBS plants in Australia resumed limited operations Wednesday in New South Wales and Victoria states, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said. The company hoped to resume work in Queensland state on Thursday, he said. JBS, which is a majority shareholder of Pilgrim's Pride, didn't say which of its 84 US facilities were closed Monday and Tuesday because of the attack. It said JBS USA and Pilgrim's were able to ship meat from nearly all facilities Tuesday. Several of the company's pork, poultry and prepared foods plants were operational Tuesday and its Canada beef facility resumed production, it said. The plant closures reflect the reality that modern meat processing is heavily automated, for both food- and worker-safety reasons. Computers collect data at multiple stages of the production process; orders, billing, shipping and other functions are all electronic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/largest-meat-producer-getting-back-online-after-cyberattack/articleshow/83188466.cms||---

Aggarwal said that according to Dominican law, any arrested accused has to be presented before the court in 72 hours and added that because Choksi was not presented in court within the prescribed time, the court has ordered to produce him before the magistrate at 4 pm (Dominica time).  "The only question before the court is that whether he entered Dominica illegally or not, whether he's liable to be detained. Whether Dominican police have the right to keep him in custody. How'll he be deported isn't a question before the court," he said.  "We said that he was kidnapped and didn't go to Dominica of his own free will. Here under section 6 of Dominica's Passport and Immigration Act, he is not a prohibited immigrant, therefore he has not committed any crime and Dominica police cannot arrest him," the lawyer added.  Aggarwal claimed that the hearing in Mehul Choksi matter in Dominica court is over.  "On the basis of Magistrate's order, the discussion will resume in court tomorrow. It proved our stand that Dominican police committed illegality by not producing him within 72 hours. The court agreed and said irregularity needs to be corrected," the lawyer added.  Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi are accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case. Choksi fled the country was granted citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda in January 2018. He is involved in a legal battle to prevent his extradition to India.  Antigua police launched a manhunt for Mehul Choksi last month after his lawyer said that family members were worried as Choksi was missing. He was apprehended in Dominica and is in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mehul-choksi-was-kidnapped-didnt-go-to-dominica-of-his-free-will-says-his-lawyer/articleshow/83188670.cms||---

Paul Hodgkins, 38, was the second person to plead guilty in what has been called an insurrection by supporters of president Donald Trump that shut down the Congress and stunned the country. The native of Tampa, Florida travelled alone to Washington on the day that President Joe Biden's election victory over Trump was to be certified by Congress. Encouraged by statements from Trump, he and several hundred others stormed the Capitol and broke inside, injuring scores of police officers. Wearing a "Trump 2020" T-shirt and waving a flag with the same slogan, he took selfies on the Senate floor along with several others. But he was not accused of assault or similar charges levied against many of those who took part. Hodgkins's crime brings up to 20 years in prison, but the court said based on his lack of a criminal record and other factors he could receive between 15 and 21 months in prison. With more than 450 people charged in the Capitol assault, the Justice Department is reportedly seeking plea deals to clear out many cases. Most are facing relatively minor charges of disorderly conduct and illegally entering a federal building. Several dozen, though, are charged with conspiracy and armed attack on law enforcement officials. The Justice Department is reportedly still considering whether to charge some, especially those affiliated with armed, violent groups like the Proud Boys, with sedition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/second-suspect-pleads-guilty-in-us-capitol-attack/articleshow/83188760.cms||---
---||World||UK hits vaccine milestone, warns of 'deadly' misinformation||Three-quarters of Britain's adult population has received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, the government said Wednesday, as it warned that ``deadly'' misinformation was undermining the global inoculation effort. The Department of Health said that 75.2% of people 18 and over in the UK have received a shot, and 49.5% are fully vaccinated after two doses. Britain is racing to vaccinate all adults and curb a more contagious delta variant of the virus, which was first identified in India and is spreading rapidly in the UK. The UK has recorded almost 128,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe. A mass vaccination campaign that started in December has brought new infections and deaths down sharply, but confirmed cases are once again rising, though daily deaths remain low. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock called the 75% milestone a big step forward, but he warned that "a worldwide pandemic of misinformation" threatened the vaccination campaign. "The speed of misinformation is a deadly threat," Hancock said at an international meeting organized by Britain to encourage vaccine uptake. The one-day Vaccine Confidence Summit, attended virtually by diplomats, politicians and academics who included U.S. coronavirus response chief Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers of Disease Control. Heidi Larson, a professor of anthropology who leads the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the pandemic had heightened issues around vaccine misgivings that had "been brewing for a while." "Covid has laid bare a lot of underlying issues of trust and distrust" Larson said, At the same time, the digital revolution sped information and misinformation around the world. She said when European nations flip-flopped on administering AstraZeneca shots -- which has been withdrawn or limited in some countries because of a link to rare blood clots -- it "shook the confidence of a number of African countries" in the vaccine. "That global knock-on effect is another phenomenon we're seeing in a different light," said Larson, who spoke at Wednesday's meeting. She said the best thing governments could do was to bridge "the massive divide in access to vaccines" around the world. Wealthy countries have scooped up hundreds of millions of doses, while supply problems and reluctance by nations, including Britain, to share doses before their own populations are fully inoculated has slowed a United Nations-backed effort to distribute vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. Vaccine supplies will be high on the agenda when Hancock meets Thursday with health ministers from the Group of Seven rich nations at Oxford University, where the AstraZeneca vaccine was developed. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to host US president Joe Biden and the other G-7 leaders at a summit in southwest England next week. Britain's government has faced strong criticism for missteps in handling the pandemic, including hesitation about putting the country into lockdown in March 2020 and testing failures that saw people with the virus released from hospitals to nursing homes, where thousands of residents died. But its vaccination campaign has been widely praised. Britain secured early contracts for multiple vaccines -- four of which have been approved for use -- and has used medics, soldiers and volunteers to give more than 65 million doses at thousands of sites. Hancock said Britain had bolstered vaccine confidence by using "trusted voices" -- including naturalist David Attenborough and Queen Elizabeth II -- to disclose that they had received a shot and to deliver a pro-vaccine message. He said another key factor was ensuring the process was fair, by giving vaccines first to the elderly and those at most risk, then moving down the age groups in an orderly way. "We Brits love queuing," Hancock said. `"And there's nothing more upsetting than someone jumping the queue."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-hits-vaccine-milestone-warns-of-deadly-misinformation/articleshow/83188944.cms||---
---||World||NASA announces two new missions to Venus||WASHINGTON: NASA announced two new missions to Venus on Wednesday that will launch at the end of the decade and are aimed at learning how Earth's nearest planetary neighbor became a hellscape while our own thrived.  "These two sister missions both aim to understand how Venus became an inferno-like world, capable of melting lead at the surface," said Bill Nelson, the agency's newly-confirmed administrator.  "They will offer the entire science community the chance to investigate a planet we haven't been to in more than 30 years."  The missions have been awarded about $500 million under NASA's Discovery Program, and each is expected to launch in the 2028-2030 timeframe. Both missions were picked from a competitive, peer-reviewed process based on their scientific value and feasibility of their plans.  DAVINCI+, which stands for Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging, will gather more detail on the composition of Venus' primarily carbon dioxide atmosphere, to learn how it formed and evolved.  The mission also seeks to determine whether the planet once had an ocean. A descent sphere will plunge through the dense atmosphere which is laced with sulfuric acid clouds.  It will precisely measure the levels of noble gases and other elements to learn what gave rise to the runaway greenhouse effect we see today.  DAVINCI+ will also beam back the first high resolution images of the planet's "tesserae," geological features roughly comparable with Earth's continents whose existence suggests Venus has plate tectonics.  The results could reshape scientists' understanding of terrestrial planet formation.  The other mission is called VERITAS, an acronym for Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy. This will aim to map the Venusian surface from orbit and delve into the planet's geologic history.  Using a form of radar that is used to create three-dimensional constructions, it will chart surface elevations and confirm whether volcanoes and earthquakes are still happening on the planet.  It will also use infrared scanning to determine rock type, which is largely unknown, and whether active volcanoes are releasing water vapor into the atmosphere.  While the mission is NASA led, the German Aerospace Center will provide the infrared mapper, while the Italian Space Agency and France's Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales will contribute to the radar and other parts of the mission.  "It is astounding how little we know about Venus, but the combined results of these missions will tell us about the planet from the clouds in its sky through the volcanoes on its surface all the way down to its very core," said Tom Wagner, NASA's Discovery Program scientist.  "It will be as if we have rediscovered the planet."  NASA's last Venus orbiter was Magellan, which arrived in 1990, but other vessels have made fly-bys since then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/nasa-announces-two-new-missions-to-venus/articleshow/83189086.cms||---

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said that some emergency call centres "are having difficulty receiving calls due to a technical problem from the operator".  "Everything is being done to resolve these malfunctions as quickly as possible," he tweeted.  Health Minister Olivier Veran said the breakdown was "obviously due to a maintenance problem" by French telecoms group Orange.  The maintenance carried out "by Orange would have caused fairly random breakdowns, with up to a 30-percent drop in some regions", Veran told the TF1 channel.  He added that Orange had said it was "working on it so that it is repaired in the evening". The minister called on "people to go to their prefecture's website to call local numbers".  Orange confirmed to AFP that a "technical incident on a router had greatly disrupted VoIP (voice over internet protocol), internet calls in some regions". A source close to the case ruled out any kind of "hacking".  Orange apologised for the inconvenience and said its teams had identified the problem and were "fully mobilised to restore services as soon as possible".  It urged people to call again, possibly by a mobile phone. Problems were reported across the country from 6 pm, causing havoc for emergency services.  Emergency doctor and head of the Samu-Urgences emergency medical services union Francois Braun said "people were unable to access the service, calls were not coming through, others were cut off in the middle of a conversation".  He said that almost all of France's departments were affected, adding that calls usually peak around 7 pm.  "We don't know what consequences this breakdown will have, it's too early to say," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/french-emergency-call-centres-disrupted-by-telecom-outage/articleshow/83189258.cms||---

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, L N Rao and S R Bhat said since the Centre has pre-negotiated price and quantity with vaccine manufacturers Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, it “casts serious doubts on the Centre’s justification for enabling higher prices as a competitive measure.” “Furthermore, the central government justifying its lower prices on account of its ability to place large purchase orders for vaccines raises the issue as to why this rationale is not being employed for acquiring 100% of the monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) doses,” the bench said. On the differential pricing of vaccines, solicitor general Tushar Mehta had said, “The Centre, by nature of its large vaccination programme, places large purchase orders for vaccines as opposed to state governments and/or private hospitals and, therefore, this reality has some reflection in the prices negotiated.” He had also told the court, “The liberalised vaccination policy was introduced to incentivise existing manufacturers and invite more manufacturers, which will ensure fastest vaccination of the majority of the population. Differential pricing has been introduced in order to instil a competitive market which will drive the market towards affordability and attract offshore vaccine manufacturers.” The bench also said, “Nevertheless, it is reiterated that the Centre should consider utilising its position as the monopolistic buyer in the market and pass down the benefit to all people.” Concerned by the additional financial burden on states because of higher priced vaccines, the bench said, “Even if states/UTs were to fund the higher-priced vaccines, a burden they were not discharging before the liberalised vaccination policy was introduced and potentially may not have planned in advance for, these funds are expended at the behest of the public exchequer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-casts-serious-doubts-on-vaccine-pricing-policy/articleshow/83189204.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The power struggle between the premier-designate, Saad Hariri, on one side and President Michel Aoun and his son-in-law Gebran Bassil on the other, has worsened despite warnings from world leaders and economic experts of the dire economic conditions tiny Lebanon is facing. The World Bank on Tuesday said Lebanon's crisis is one of the worst the world has seen in the past 150 years.  In a reflection of the growing turmoil, scores of Lebanese lined up in front of ATM machines late on Wednesday, after a top court suspended a Central Bank decree that allowed them to withdraw from dollar deposits at a rate two and a half times better than the fixed exchange rate.  The Lebanese pound, pegged to the dollar for 30 years at 1,507, has been in a free fall since late 2019. It is now trading at nearly 13,000 to the dollar at the black market.  Lebanon is governed by a sectarian power sharing agreement but as the crisis deepens, members of the ruling elite bicker over how to form a government that will have to make tough decisions.  Hariri, who was tasked by Aoun to form a Cabinet seven months ago, blames the president for the months-long delay, accusing him of insisting on having veto power in the upcoming government.  Aoun, an ally of the powerful militant Hezbollah group, has said that Hariri did not shoulder his responsibilities in forming a government they both can agree on. There is no legal avenue for the president to fire the prime minister-designate, who is chosen to the post by a majority of lawmakers.  The rift has paralyzed the cash-strapped country, delaying urgently needed reforms. The economic crisis, which erupted in 2019, has been compounded by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Lebanon and a massive blast at Beirut's port last year that killed over 200 people and defaced a big section of the capital.  The crisis has driven more than half of the population into poverty, caused the local currency to lose more than 85% of its value, and prompted banks to lock deposits through informal capital controls, eroding trust in a once-thriving banking sector.  The country's highest administrative court on Tuesday ordered the temporary suspension of a Central Bank circular that gave depositors a chance to withdraw at a rate better than the pegged rate.  The Central Bank announced late Wednesday it was accepting the decision, prompting the queues outside ATMS. One man said he went from one ATM to another to withdraw as much as he could. Another complained that people's savings are at the mercy of corrupt politicians.  "This is not resilience. We got used to being humiliated and controlled this much by the politicians," said Mustafa Taoush, a 23-year-old who failed to withdraw more than a weekly limit imposed on withdrawals.  A statement from Aoun's office on Wednesday accused Hariri of trying to usurp presidential powers, and coming up with "delusional propositions and insolent expressions."  "The prime minister-designate 's continuous evading of responsibilities ... constitutes a persistent violation of the constitution and national accord," it added.  Hariri and his political group, the Future party, responded by saying the presidency is "hostage to the personal ambitions" of Bassil, Aoun's son-in-law, alluding to his alleged presidential aspirations.  High-level mediation efforts from France and local powerful players, including the parliament speaker and the head of the Maronite Church, have faded without a breakthrough in the face of intransigence from the rival parties in Lebanon.  Amid the Aoun-Hariri barbs, caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab warned that a collapse of Lebanon could have consequences beyond its borders, hinting at a possible massive exodus of refugees.  Diab, whose Cabinet resigned days after the port explosion, appealed on politicians to make concessions so that a new Cabinet could be formed - one that could resume talks with the International Monetary Fund on how to get out of the crisis.  "The collapse, if it happens, God forbid, will have very grave consequences not only for the Lebanese or those living here but also on friendly countries from the land and sea," Diab said. "No one will be able to control what waves the sea bring."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/lebanese-leaders-exchange-barbs-as-country-sinks-into-crisis/articleshow/83189328.cms||---
---||Business||No recovery in global jobs till 2023: ILO||NEW DELHI: The labour market crisis created by the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over, and employment growth will be insufficient to make up for the losses suffered until at least 2023, a new assessment by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) showed on Wednesday. Global unemployment is expected to stand at 205 million in 2022, surpassing the level of 187 million in 2019. This corresponds to an unemployment rate of 5.7%. Excluding the Covid-19 crisis period, such a rate was last seen in 2013. The ILO’s World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2021 (WESO Trends) projects that the global crisis-induced ‘jobs gap’ will reach 75 million in 2021, before falling to 23 million in 2022. The related gap in working-hours, which includes the jobs gap and those on reduced hours, amounts to the equivalent of 100 million full-time jobs in 2021 and 26 million full-time jobs in 2022. This shortfall in employment and working hours comes on top of persistently high pre-crisis levels of unemployment, labour underutilisation and poor working conditions, the report said. The worst affected regions in the first half of 2021 have been Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe and Central Asia. In both, estimated working-hour losses exceeded 8% in the first quarter and 6% in the second quarter, compared to global working-hour losses of 4.8% and 4.4% in the first and second quarter, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-recovery-in-global-jobs-till-2023-ilo/articleshow/83189384.cms||---
---||World||Democrats seek momentum in lopsided US House victory||SANTA FE: A major Southwestern metro region delivered a resounding victory to a Democratic congressional candidate who embraced the Biden administration's prescription's for economic recovery, as voters rebuffed Republican overtures across Albuquerque's heavily suburban and Latino political landscape.  Tuesday's special election vaulted 42-year-old Democrat Melanie Stansbury, a second-term state representative, into the congressional seat held previously by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland.  The election is a precursor to a handful of races to fill vacancies in Congress ahead of 2022 midterm elections. Democrats held a 219-211 majority in Congress going into Tuesday's vote in New Mexico's 1st Congressional District.  Stansbury won roughly 60% of the vote in a four-way race, handing a stinging defeat to three-term Republican state Sen. Mark Moores.  Uncertified election results on Wednesday showed a victory margin of 24.5 percentage points for Stansbury - far greater than Haaland's 16-point win in 2020. That even edged past Biden's 23-point win in New Mexico last year.  Stansbury highlighted a working-class, public school upbringing in Albuquerque - her mother was a factor worker and crane operator - and she embraced top-line Democratic initiatives on pandemic relief, infrastructure spending and interventions to slow climate change.  State Democratic Party official say they used the special election to rebuild advocacy infrastructure and return to in-person political events, keeping in mind the party's narrow majority in Congress.  Stansbury leveraged fundraising drives by splitting contributions with other Democratic politicians. Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned in New Mexico alongside Stansbury during the final week of early voting.  The Democratic effort contacted voters 350,000 times in its largest field program for the district in more than a decade, state party Chairwoman Jessica Velasquez said.  "We know that we can't afford to lose a single seat" in Congress, Velasquez said. "I think that this race bodes really well for Democrats moving forward. We've seen a lot more Democrats turning out to vote early, a huge amount of enthusiasm, especially since we've returned to holding some in-person events and frankly it's been a great opportunity for us to continue to build Democratic infrastructure."  Republicans had little to salvage from the lopsided loss.  Moores focused on local concerns about the crime rate in Albuquerque over national politics, and he leveled criticism at New Mexico's delayed reopening of the economy as the pandemic wanes. The public safety mantra bore echoes of Trump and his condemnation last year of crime rates in Democrat-led cities as he dispatched federal agents to Albuquerque.  Rod Adair, a demographer and political consultant who previously served as a Republican in the New Mexico state Senate, noted that the Republican congressional nominee lost ground in voting margins for each of the five counties represented in the 1st Congressional District, compared with 2020 voting returns.  He described a "moribund" state Republican Party that was unable to help a skilled GOP candidate, and failed to link the economic distress of the pandemic to Democratic leadership in the White House and the New Mexico governor's office.  "The party was invisible," Adair said of the GOP. "Overriding all of this, New Mexico is migrating leftward, and we've seen that in the political demographics of the state and especially in" the 1st Congressional District.  Stanbury's victory preserves an all-female House delegation for the state. Republican U.S. Rep. Yvette Herrell last year ousted a Democratic incumbent from the conservative-leaning 2nd Congressional District in southern New Mexico.  The 1st Congressional District encompasses Albuquerque, rural Torrance County and other outlying areas that include the Indigenous community of Sandia Pueblo. Libertarian nominee Chris Manning won a little over 1% of Tuesday's vote, and independent Aubrey Dunn Jr. got nearly 3%.  The district's voters have heavily favored Democratic candidates in recent years. Prior to 2008, the district often backed Republicans for Congress, including Heather Wilson, who later became secretary of the U.S. Air Force under President Trump.  Democratic political consultant Sisto Abeyta says the state's Democratic voters remain highly averse to the Trump brand of politics that still overshadows GOP candidates.  "We're used to the Pete Domenici Republicans," Abeyta told KANW radio, in reference to the deceased six-term U.S. senator who retired in 2008. "The Republican brand kind of just wrapped themselves around the Trump brand, and they haven't shaken loose from it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/democrats-seek-momentum-in-lopsided-us-house-victory/articleshow/83189535.cms||---
---||World||Arizona Democratic secretary of state joins governor race||PHOENIX: Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs on Wednesday announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2022 while denouncing the Republican-controlled state Senate's ongoing audit of the 2020 presidential election that has brought her national prominence. Hobbs said in a statement she was running ``to deliver transparency, accountability, and results for Arizonans`` and would work as governor to ``put aside our differences and work to solve the serious problems facing Arizona.'' In an interview, she said she will have the resources to win a primary and general election and called herself a proven statewide leader who can work across the aisle. ``Arizonans are tired of the partisanship,'' Hobbs said. ``We are currently being led by a group of conspiracy theorists who are not in touch with everyday Arizonans, and that is holding us back. And I've always been able to break through that and get things done.'' The Republican-led Arizona Senate's recount of election results and review of ballot counting machines in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, was launched as supporters of former President Donald Trump criticized President Joe Biden's narrow win in the state and suggested without evidence that the election was stolen. As the state's chief election officer since winning office in 2018, Hobbs' defense of the state's election systems after the 2020 election has been broad and vocal and has included frequent appearances on national media. She has heavily criticized the unsubstantiated allegations that Biden won in Arizona because of fraud or other problems and brought in independent observers to view the partisan recount now underway. She said she expects Trump and his backers to continue to raise doubts but said she'll continue ``to tell the truth about the election, which that is that it was a free and fair election.'' ``It is a partisan attack on free and fair elections, and reasonable people understand that,'' Hobbs said. ``The folks who don't, are never going to believe anything I say.'' Hobbs also was a defendant in a series of lawsuits brought by Trump backers seeking to overturn the 2020 election results, putting her at odds with the Republican attorney general and some GOP lawmakers. The Republican-dominated state Legislature has moved to strip her of the means to defend lawsuits by removing her ability to hire outside lawyers. She vowed to fight that effort if it is included in the final state budget proposal. ``It doesn't just strip me of the ability to hire outside counsel, it strips me of any legal say at all, and it strips me of duties that are assigned in the (Arizona) constitution,'' Hobbs said. ``So what they are doing is blatantly unconstitutional, and if they do pass it, there will be a legal fight.'' She also touted her success in running the 2020 election in the midst of a global pandemic and as Trump fed voters ``misinformation'' about the election, which saw historic turnout. ``And we did our jobs, and we ensured that Arizona voters could vote, and that they didn't have to choose between their freedom to vote and their health and safety,'' she said. ``And that's what I'll bring to the governor's office.'' n a video announcing her candidacy, Hobbs ticked off a series of accomplishments as a lawmaker and as secretary of state, saying she wanted to work to make Arizonans' lives better. She vowed to rebuild the state economy after COVID-19, invest in health care and education and ensure that all state residents have the same ability to get ahead. Although Arizona has for been ruled by Republicans for more than a decade, Democrats made inroads in the last two elections, and Biden's presidential win was the first since Bill Clinton took Arizona in 1996. The state's most recent Democratic governor was Janet Napolitano, who was elected in 2002 and again in 2006 before leaving in early 2009 after then-President Barack Obama appointed her as Homeland Security secretary. Hobbs was a member of the state House and Senate for six years and served as minority leader of the Senate for two years before running for her current office in 2018. She was trailing on election night, but won her current post by less than 1% of the vote. Term limits bar current Republican Gov. Doug Ducey from running again in 2022. The only other Democrat in the race so far is Marco Lopez, a former mayor of the border city of Nogales, who rose rapidly to a senior position in President Barack Obama's administration. He joined the race in March _ kicking off his campaign with videos in English and Spanish that highlight his Nogales, Arizona, roots and described an Arizona he said was held back by Ducey's leadership failures. ``My message is very simple _ if we have healthy families, good education and quality jobs, Arizona thrives,'' Lopez said at the time. ``Sadly, that's not the case for many, many families in the state today.'' The son of Mexican immigrants, Lopez returned to Nogales after college and was elected mayor at age 22. He went on to serve Napolitano as head of the cross-border nonprofit Arizona-Mexico Commission that promotes economic prosperity and led the Arizona Department of Commerce. On the Republican side, state Treasurer Kimberly Yee and developer Karrin Taylor Robson announced plans last month to seek the Republican nomination. Former Phoenix television news anchor Kari Lake entered the GOP race on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/arizona-democratic-secretary-of-state-joins-governor-race/articleshow/83189346.cms||---
---||India||Govt unveils road map to set up centralised farmers’ database||NEW DELHI: The Centre has unveiled a road map for setting up a centralised farmers database, Agri Stack, as part of its effort to create a digital ecosystem for the farm sector, bringing all agriculture-related information to one platform. The database will eventually be linked with the land records of farmers across the country, generating unique farmer IDs (like ‘Aadhaar’) for over 14 crore landholding farmers in India. Under Agri Stack, information related to all benefits and assistance provided through various schemes of the government will also be kept at one place. “The dream of a self-reliant and digital India will only be realised by taking along the agriculture sector,” said agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar while unveiling the road map on Tuesday. “Its final document will guide digital farming in future,” he said. A database with the details of about 5 crore farmers has already been prepared. It is expected to be completed soon by incorporating details of all landholding farmers into it. Though available data related to PM-Kisan, Soil Health Card and PM Crop Insurance Scheme have been integrated, officials have been working on collating data from other databases of the ministries of agriculture, fertilizers, and food and public distribution. Officials believe that the information, based on analysing the databases, will help farmers make informed decisions on choice of crops, seeds' varieties, timing of sowing and other best farm practices to maximize yield. They believe the farmers with the help of aggregated data would be able to decide whether they have to sell or store their produce, and further when, where and at what price they have to sell it. The ministry had, in order to give a digital push to the farm sector, signed a MoU with Microsoft India to start the pilot projects in April. It has already selected 100 villages in six states — Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh — for the projects on digital farming, leveraging use of technology, data and artificial intelligence (AI) for supporting farmers in multiple activities. Many farm activists had, however, expressed their serious concerns over the development, saying the move would compromise the data privacy of farmers. “It will not be surprising that corporations will approach this as one more profit-making possibility, as a market for so-called ‘solutions’ which lead to sale of unsustainable Agri-inputs combined with greater loans and indebtedness of farmers for this through fintech,” said over 50 farmer organisations, including Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) - Kisan Swaraj, in their joint letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-unveils-road-map-to-set-up-centralised-farmers-database/articleshow/83189788.cms||Vishwa Mohan

Therefore, exports are driving capex spends in FY22. “In fiscal 2022, export demand is projected to increase by 6-8% on the back of recovery in key destinations. According to S&P, light vehicle sales are expected to increase by over 10% and 15% in Europe and the US, respectively. So, most domestic auto-component manufacturers are planning to increase their capital expenditure,” said Crisil Research director Hetal Gandhi. Already, the export pick-up is showing. India Ratings & Research associate director Shruti Saboo said, “CMIE data shows that from December 2020 onwards, monthly exports are higher than the last 3 years. In February, exports were up 20% YoY. Even as the second wave hit India, the EU and the US have recovered very well.” The performance is reflected by financial results. Wabco’s exports rose 70% in Q4FY21 as against around 8% in Q2, and Sundram Fasteners was up 33% as against a 10.5% fall in Q2. Rane Madras saw its Q4 international sales rise 74%, though it went up only 6% in Q2FY21. In some of these companies, new customers brought higher business. Rane, for instance, saw “commencement of supplies to new customer programme for steering products”. In others, export demand is driving new capex spends. Wabco India is lining up Rs 100-crore capex for FY21, a significant portion of which will be spent on a new export-focused factory in Mahindra World City near Chennai. “We have an export order pipeline of two months and strong demand from US and Europe,” said Wabco India MD P Kaniappan. Wabco exports mechanical & electronic compressors and braking solutions. Same is the case for Wheels India, which is ramping up its export plant. “This year, a significant part of our Rs 100-crore capex will be spent on increasing capacity in the newly commissioned cast aluminium wheel plant at Thervoy Kandigai (Tamil Nadu). Last year, the company began its first shipment of cast aluminium wheels to the US from this plant,” said Wheels India MD Srivats Ram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/auto-parts-export-pick-up-may-grow-8-in-fy22/articleshow/83184490.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Buses for other routes, which are being run from the Mithapur bus stand at present, are also likely to shift to the ISBT by July. Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh inspected the ISBT or the Patliputra Bus Terminal on Wednesday, after which it was decided to run more buses from there. Buses for Jehanabad and Gaya are already being run from the ISBT. Talking to TOI over the phone, Singh said, “We will ensure that by June 10 nearly 50 buses can be accommodated here. We are trying to expedite the construction work because the land in Mithapur has been allotted to different educational institutes.” Singh also instructed the officials concerned to make sure that basic amenities like water and toilets are provided to the travellers at the ISBT. He gave a one-week deadline to the officials of the Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BUIDCO) for finishing the construction work. The state-of-the-art terminus, which was inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar in September last, has four separate multi-storey blocks — A, B, C and D. Block A is used for the purpose of arrival of buses and block B for their departure. Block C acts as a connectivity between the two. Block D is for commercial purposes like restaurants, lounge, shopping complex and multiplex. A BUIDCO source said completion of block D will take more time. The entire bus terminus is spread over 25.2 acres of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/buses-to-four-more-districts-will-run-from-isbt-soon/articleshow/83183894.cms||Sheezan Nezami

However, her identity is yet to be ascertained. “The woman, whose throat had been slit, was spotted by the villagers at 10am. In her mid-20s, she was wearing a ‘salwar-kameez’,” Jadopur police station SHO Mithilesh Prasad Singh told TOI over the phone. He added that a pair of slippers and a plastic bag on which the address of a Kushinagar-based garment shop was mentioned were also recovered from the spot. Police suspect that the woman was brought to the murder spot from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and killed so that she could not be traced easily. “There were blood stains everywhere, but no sharp weapon was recovered,” the SHO said, adding that the murder could be the fallout of an illicit relationship or a case of honour killing. A police team is set to leave for Kushinagar in UP on Thursday morning for investigating the case and ascertaining the woman’s identity. Her photograph has already been circulated in all the police stations of Gopalganj. The SHO said, “The postmortem has been conducted at the sadar hospital where the body will be preserved for the next 72 hours.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/womans-body-found-in-gopalganj-village/articleshow/83184158.cms||Debashish Karmakar

According to a source, the footfalls at different vaccination sites have been low for the last four days. Instead of 4,000, only 1,500 people have taken part in the 40 inoculation camps organised in the district. “The vaccination drive for healthcare and frontline workers, senior citizens as well as people above the age of 45 and 18 years is going on at 17 places in the district. As many as 2,24,300 doses of Covishield have been given to them so far,” the district immunisation officer, Dr D N Jha, told this newspaper on Wednesday. He added, “In urban areas, on the other hand, people are receiving vaccine shots on the premises of hospitals, courts and electricity offices. A ward-wise inoculation drive will begin from Thursday so that maximum number of people are inoculated.” Meanwhile, Piramal Foundation handed over 27 oxygen concentrators to district magistrate Udayan Mishra on Wednesday.

While shops and markets are permitted to function between 6 am to 12 noon, police implementing curfew are unable to control the morning rush at marketplaces. A visit to markets in One Town revealed that locals have set aside Covid-19 guidelines. Consumers jostled against one another in Main Road, Pulipati Various Street, Brahmin Street, Chitturi complex and Kaleswara Rao Market. Many gathered around push-carts with little heed to social distancing and in the absence of monitoring by civic authorities. “Locals are not worried about Covid-19 it seems. Many vendors are not wearing masks. The situation is very pathetic at wholesale markets that are crowded with buyers. Social distance is not followed and many of them are not wearing masks. Police who are imposing huge fines on motorists for violating curfew norms are simply ignoring the shopkeepers. If this continues there is a chance of a huge outbreak of Covid-19 cases,” said N Satyanarayana, a retired teacher. Unlike last year, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation has not deployed special teams this time to enforce Covid-19 guidelines. “Closing shops will affect the livelihood of many. At the same time ignoring Covid-19 guidelines will open the doors for Covid-19 infection. This is high time that both the public and traders follow Covid-19 guidelines for their safety,” said Donepudi Shankar, CPI city secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/locals-in-vij-flock-to-markets-cast-aside-mask-covid-norms/articleshow/83185108.cms||Venu Lanka

Now, the government is mocking the families, who lost their sole breadwinners to Covid, by declaring a meagre compensation of Rs 2 lakh, said Goa Suraksha Manch president Nitin Faldesai. Such families should at least get a compensation of Rs 10 lakh so that they can tide over the difficult times, he said. “When cases were low, the government was busy singing its own praises and when they began to rise, it did not listen to pleas to impose a lockdown. Several innocent people lost their lives. With a meagre compensation, the government is now rubbing salt on the families’ wounds,” said Faldesai. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-10l-must-for-covid-hit-families-gsm/articleshow/83187041.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘39 kids lost both parents to Covid, 395 earning parent’||AHMEDABAD: Rewa Sorathia, 5, was orphaned in the Covid pandemic after both her parents Vinesh and Riddhi succumbed to the viral infection on May 8 and 26 respectively. Rewa is currently being raised by her paternal joint family in Bhuj. Parth Sorathia, Rewa’s paternal grand uncle says while the family is committed to fulfilling any emotional and financial needs of the little girl, the biggest hurdle in applying for government support for pandemic orphaned children would be the burden of proof of death due to Covid. “Death certificates of both Vinesh and Riddhi do not specify death due to Covid. We had made a specific request to insert Covid death in the special remarks section but municipalities in Gandhinagar and Kutch did not oblige. How will applicants prove that the child was orphaned due to Covid?” asked Sorathia. As both the state and central governments have announced schemes for the ‘Covid orphans’ – the kids who have lost both parents to the pandemic, or the earning parent due to Covid infection – activists point out that several of the deceased don’t have the death certificates mentioning Covid-19 as cause of death. An affidavit submitted by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to the Supreme Court on May 31 mentioned that Gujarat reported 39 kids who got orphaned due to Covid-19, whereas 395 others lost their earning parent. In all, 434 kids and teens were affected by the pandemic – the eighth highest in India according to the affidavit. “We have received at least two cases recently where the kids lost their fathers after a short illness. In both the cases, the death certificate did not mention them as Covid-19 patients,” said Smita Pandya, who heads the women's wing at Majoor Mahajan Sangh. “As several of the Covid patients have not mentioned Covid in their death certificates, they must be included for the initiative.” Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (social justice & empowerment), told TOI that the state is yet to come up with the GR on the kids affected by Covid-19. “The issue of non-availability of documents in some cases has come to our notice, and we want to assure all that we would try to help the families. Our priority is to identify these kids, which is going on across the state,” he said. “We will only ask for the death certificate. We are taking a liberal view.” In Ahmedabad, Nisha Chauhan who had lost her father when she was 1.5 years old lost her mother to Coronavirus on April 13. She was a minor who was orphaned and currently stays with her maternal aunt. “My mother’s RT-PCR report in a private laboratory and CT scan shows Covid-19 lung involvement but the death slip issued by Civil Hospital does not mention anything in the cause of death section. Death certificate is yet to be issued. How do I apply and prove I lost my surviving parent to Covid?” asks Nisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/39-kids-lost-both-parents-to-covid-395-earning-parent/articleshow/83185602.cms||Radha Sharma

The panel has also recommended initiation of legal action against the hospital. A resident of Baheri block, Dilip had been admitted to Paras Global Hospital in Darbhanga on May 21. The committee has mentioned in its report that the Covid patient was not treated according to the prescribed guidelines and administered plenty of unnecessary medicines. Although he was on ventilator for only three days, his father was charged money for nine days. He was also asked for money for “daily use of new PPE kits and other items”. The panel has also pointed out that the patient’s medical bill should have not exceeded Rs 1.18 lakh on the basis of the rates fixed by the state government for Covid treatment. However, his family was charged Rs 2.30 lakh. The DM told this reporter on Wednesday that the hospital had been told to return Rs 1.12 lakh to the kin of the deceased. “Legal action is likely to be initiated against the hospital,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hospital-faces-action-as-dead-covid-patients-kin-overcharged/articleshow/83184040.cms||Binay Kumar Jha

The accused were celebrating the birthday of Nandkishor Solanki at his residence in Kishanwadi late on Tuesday night. The Warasia police said that the accused flouted police notification about curfew after 9 pm and were not wearing face masks too. “As per Covid rules, they were supposed to follow social distancing norms and wear masks. They gathered after 9 pm when the curfew starts. All have been booked for flouting the notification,” a police official said. Apart from Solanki, the other accused have been identified as Chandrakant Parmar, Anil Maachi, Alpesh Thakore, Tarun Solanki and Kaushik Solanki. The cops swung into action after a video of the birthday bash went viral on Wednesday. Solanki is seen cutting the cake using a sharp weapon. The cops said that Chandrakant used to be a bootlegger several years ago. The police said that though the curfew hours have been relaxed, it has been ensuring that citizens don’t venture out of their homes late in the night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/six-arrested-for-birthday-bash-during-curfew-hours/articleshow/83183146.cms||---

This will be in addition to the three WIFs and six WICs the vaccine depot already has. “Each of the WIC and WIF that is expected to be installed soon have the capacity to hold between 60 lakh to 80 lakh doses at a time. So we will be prepared before we start getting an appreciable volume of supply,” said a source at the Bagbazar vaccine warehouse. All the parts of the two vaccine cold-chain storage equipment have arrived and engineers are expected to start working on installation in a few days. The existing WIFs and WICs were being used to store vials for routine immunization. At present, two of them are being used to store Covid vaccines. After arrival, the vials are taken to the Bagbazar depot, stored there before they finally being sent to other cold-chain points across the state. These points don’t have the capacity to store doses above a certain limit. “Since we are expecting to handle anything between 60 lakh to 68 lakh doses in June, many vials have to be stored here before other cold-chain points can create space. Therefore, the two new WIF and WIC will be of great help,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/depot-to-get-more-storage-space/articleshow/83185010.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Prasanth, who reached Vizag with his brother from Hyderabad on Wednesday, said he never expected to return to India and being reunited with his family was a surreal experience. A native of Vizag, Prasanth was captured by Pakistan security forces in 2017 when he got lost across the border while attempting to reach Switzerland via Pakistan on foot to meet the woman he loved. He was repatriated to India four years later after the Pakistan authorities came to realise that he was not a spy. Speaking to the media at his Mithilapuri Vuda Colony residence in Madhurawada, he said that after crossing the Indian border he walked for almost 40 kms into Pakistan territory before a patrolling team intercepted him at Bahawalpur on the second day. His family members thanked police officials, NGOs and external affairs ministry for securing his release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/never-expected-to-return-to-india-techie-prasanth/articleshow/83185311.cms||Siva G

After the state government gave permission to distribute Anandaiah’s medicine, preparations are underway by his team as they set up their cooking utensils and raw materials at CVR. Anandaiah held a meeting with Nellore district collector KVN Chakradhar Babu and sought support in procuring herbs and ingredients required for making the herbal paste. The collector said that some of the ingredients would be supplied from the Tribal Corporation Society. Anandaiah’s team would also be setting up their website under the name childeal.in for people interested in trying out his Covid-19 medicine. Speaking to the media, Chakradhar Babu said that they would not allow people to flock to Krishnapatnam village and made it clear that while Covid-19 patients cannot come to procure the medicine, they can send their relatives or friends to collect it for them. People who purchase the medicine online will receive it by courier. Officials said that the medicine is expected to be available starting June 7. The state government gave its green signal to the herbal concoction on May 31. While permission has been granted for the administration of P, L and F category supplements (in paste form) prepared by Anandaiah, the usage of eye drops has been stopped till the government receives a complete report from the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology and LV Prasad Eye Hospital. The move was taken based on a preliminary study report submitted by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS). Officials said the report, while concluding there is no harm in using the herbal paste, also states that there is no evidence that the medicine can reduce the effects of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/preparations-on-for-mfg-of-herbal-drug/articleshow/83185419.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

With help from an IITian from their parts and his crowd-sourcing network of friends spread out globally, this youthful group is now preparing, should that happen, to meet the third wave of the pandemic with the resilience of home-spun, community-driven action. “When three persons from one family died in Nabtole village, we realised that death is knocking at every door,” Ram Bahadur Choudhary, mukhiya of Sarisab-Pahi (paschim) panchayat told this newspaper. A few journalists belonging to our area put us in touch with Sanjay Jha in Mumbai, he added. The closed PHC at Sarisab-Pahi village.An IIT-Kharagpur alumnus, Jha too was gripped with worry from news reaching him from relatives in Madhubani and Darbhanga. “My sister got infected in Madhubani and even an Oximeter could not be found in the local market,” Jha, a director at Collateral Medical in Mumbai, one of India’s largest importers and distributors of medical equipment, told this newspaper over phone. “Clearly, people were deprived and I felt the urgency to reach out. Fortunately, friends and relatives told me about the Ayachi Nagar Yuva Sangathan at Sarisab-Pahi, epicentre of a hub of over two dozen villages,” he recalled, adding, “A group of dedicated youth was identified and I immediately contacted my IITian friends and also fellow-alumni of The INSEAD Business School (France). Friends based in the US, UK, France, Singapore and Dubai chipped in. Many non-resident Biharis too joined in.” Vicky Mandal (24) is one among two scores of youth who had been running awareness, education, plantation and blood donation drives. “Many non-resident villagers also donated money to help us begin a medical assistance drive for Covid patients. We arranged ambulances, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and blood for patients in Darbhanga and Madhubani hospitals,” he said. For Choudhary, the village head and mentor to the youth volunteers, it did not help that the primary health centre, though having received a fresh coat of paint at the launch of the Ayushman Bharat scheme years ago, lay padlocked. “After many years, a doctor was finally posted here in March. But within a fortnight, he was transferred to the Covid care centre at Rampatti, 30km away,” he rued. “ If the pandemic hits us with a third wave, our youth volunteers will only step up efforts to save our village folk,” Choudhary added. “There was no testing and many villagers showed Covid symptoms. We are now launching a door-to-door campaign to thermal scan all apart from motivating villagers to get vaccinated,” Choudhary said. Jha (45), whose professional career began with GE Medical in San Fransisco before returning home, meanwhile, shipped four oxygen concentrators, 20 thermal scanners, 30 oxymeters, 20 PPE kits and 30 sanitizer bottles. “We have today set up a four-bed facility supported with oxygen concentrators,” Vicky Mandal said on Wednesday, adding, “Sanjay Jha sir will get our volunteers trained to operate the concentrators on Thursday.” “Our service engineers will impart online training to the young volunteers of Sarisab-Pahi,” Jha said, adding, “We will send more equipment if the need arises. I am happy to find this group of young students in Sarisab-Pahi whose selfless dedication brings hope in these dark times.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/iitian-helps-madhubani-villagers-gear-up-to-tackle-3rd-covid-wave/articleshow/83183830.cms||Abhay Mohan Jha

This is in contrast to the state’s earlier decision of completing the ongoing immunisation drive for the above 45 age group first. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Anil Kumar Singhal, principal secretary, health and family welfare, asked the foreign education/employment aspirants to quote their passport numbers while receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. “Those who had earlier got the jab, had provided only their Aadhaar numbers. Some countries are verifying the vaccination status based on the passport numbers. But in the given situation, we are not in a position to issue a revised certificate due to the limitations in the CoWin software. The state government recently wrote a letter to the Union government, seeking an option to update the Covid-19 certificate with passport numbers,” said Singhal. He also said that the state has decided to increase the monthly stipend of senior residents to Rs 70,000 from the existing Rs 45,000. “The senior residents have also put in other requests, and we would examine those too. A government order pertaining to those requests, which can be implemented, would be released soon,” said Singhal. The principal secretary added that Andhra Pradesh drew only 443 tonnes of medical oxygen on Wednesday in view of the decreasing Covid-19 case load.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-seeks-linking-covid-certificate-with-passport/articleshow/83184129.cms||---

The Andhra Pradesh government had cancelled SSC examinations in 2020 and promoted all Intermediate students in view of the Covid-19 situation in the state at the time. The state government, however, had implemented an action plan to complete the syllabus on time and conduct examinations at any cost. Education minister Adimulapu Suresh had said the government would conduct examinations at any cost considering the future of students. After some teachers approached the AP high court, the government deferred examinations to July 2021. However, the Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU) demanded the state government consider the lives of students and teachers before moving forward to conduct examinations. “Many students and teachers in the state have fallen sick. Teachers associations announced that around 80 teachers died of Covid-19 related complications. But still the government is planning to go ahead with the examinations. This shows their stubborn attitude,” said A Ravichandra, president of PDSU. TDP national general secretary and MLC Nara Lokesh asked the government to cancel examinations and promote students. “Government should care about the lives of students and teachers. The state government is not superior to the Centre. It should at least follow the decision taken by the CBSE,” said Lokesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/students-call-for-cancelling-ssc-inter-examinations/articleshow/83185168.cms||Venu Lanka

This is the first instance of an auto company carrying out direct sales with the dealers and retailers — now known as franchise partners — getting engaged only for enquiry, customer experience, delivery and service support, earning a commission and incentive on the volumes they do.The company said that the new model, under its ‘Retail Of The Future’ (ROTF) programme, will ensure that customers get the same price and offers, through a centrally-controlled set-up, and do not face issues in getting access to any variant, colour or model type as direct billing is happening from the India headquarters. “The dealers will continue to provide brand experience, car showcase, test drives, engage in vehicle delivery, and after-sales. However, they will not be carrying out the billing for the cars, they will have no powers to offer discounts, and they will not be involved in stocking of the vehicles or their logistics,” Mercedes-Benz India MD Martin Schwenk told TOI.While the measure will ensure better dealer profitability by eliminating chances of any cut-throat price war between them, for the customers it brings in more transparency and convenience. The dealers also benefit by saving on the inventory holding cost that they currently have. Such expense generally runs into crores of rupees for each retailer, and carries an interest cost and potential penalties if stocks are not liquidated (sold) on time by them. Schwenk said that for the customers, the measure will not have any direct change in experience. “The customer still gets to choose the car from our online channels, or at the dealership. The new model will provide details about the pricing and any potential offers transparently directly by the company, and in case a customer does not get any particular model or colour at his/her local dealership, we can move the stock from another location.” Santosh Iyer, VP (sales & marketing) at Mercedes-Benz India, said that this is the result of a two-year effort made by the company and the model is already in place in Sweden and South Africa. All the dealers of the company have been on-boarded into the new plan that becomes operational from the fourth quarter of this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/merc-first-auto-co-to-sell-directly-no-dealer-offers/articleshow/83184544.cms||Pankaj Doval

---||Business||Banks list Rs 83k cr NPAs for bad bank||Mumbai: Public sector banks have shortlisted 28 loan accounts to be transferred to the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL). Of these, lead banks have completed the process of obtaining approval from co-lenders in 22 accounts with Rs 82,500 crore of loans due. Within this amount, borrowers such as VOVL, Amtek Auto, Reliance Naval, Jaypee Infratech, Castex Technologies, GTL, Visa Steel and Wind World account for 80%. Other large companies that are to be sold to the NARCL include Lavasa Corporation, Ruchi Worldwide, Consolidated Construction and a few toll projects. According to banking sources, work is progressing on multiple fronts to ensure that the bad bank starts operations as soon as possible. On Wednesday, bankers met to finalise the capital structure of the bad bank (NARCL). Sources said that the company would need at least Rs 6,000-crore capital of equity and debt to start operations. In terms of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations, asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) must pay 15% of the purchase consideration in cash upfront. Even if these 22 non-performing assets (NPAs) were valued at 50% of the loan amount, the ARCs would have to pay over Rs 12,000 crore to banks. The NARCL can, however, raise money on its own. Since all these 28 loans have been fully provided for, any consideration that the banks receive will go into their bottom line as profit. Once the capital structure is finalised, the promoters will seek a licence from the RBI. Lenders have decided to ask power finance companies to be the promoters as most other large lenders have a stake in existing ARCs. While all banks will hold just below 10% stake, Canara Bank and Bank of Maharashtra will hold just over 10% and may be given promoter status. Most other large banks will contribute to the ARCs’ equity. The articles of association of the NARC have already been finalised. Simultaneously, lenders are also discussing the setup of the asset management company that will do the recovery work. Lenders are hopeful of completing the loan transfer to the NARCL in July. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in the Budget the setting up of a bad bank (NARCL) to acquire the NPAs from banks. The NARCL was to be in the public sector so that lenders do not have any problems in selling their bad loans. The NARCL would pay 15% in cash and the balance in security receipts, which are similar to units in a mutual fund with the consolidated bad loan being the underlying asset. The government would provide a guarantee to the security receipts issued by the bad bank, which would improve their valuation. Besides the loans having been fully provided for, the other requirement was that each loan should be above Rs 500 crore. Also, loans that were classified as fraud or were in the midst of a liquidation process were not eligible. Many of these large accounts are undergoing recovery proceedings by banks and buyers have shown interest in these companies. The consolidation of loans will enable faster decision-making by the NARCL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-list-rs-83k-cr-npas-for-bad-bank/articleshow/83186133.cms||Mayur Shetty

But the good old sabbatical leave is still around and being availed, albeit for different reasons. In the pre-pandemic era, sabbaticals allowed employees to pursue their passion, be it hobbies like travelling or while going in for higher education. Although a world tour is now out of the question, the key reason why employees feel the need to take a sabbatical leave is to spend more time with their family. While most are working from home, experts said there is digital fatigue and people are keen on bonding better with family members while staying away from work. Kellogg South Asia director (HR) Nimisha Das said, “Despite the pandemic, it is unlikely that sabbaticals will go out of vogue. Working professionals will continue taking them, with the exception that the reasons for taking a sabbatical will change. For instance, one of the reasons earlier could be travelling. Now, it might be to deal with the challenge of digital fatigue, pursue a newly acquired passion, or to simply spend time with their families.” Bajaj Allianz General Insurance designed its sabbatical policy so that an employee can take time away from office (ranging from 6 months to 2 years) to pursue any of their personal or professional interests. The company’s MD & CEO Tapan Singhel said, “During the pandemic, we have observed that while working from home, employees have got a chance to introspect and have looked for education opportunities abroad. We do have one instance where the employee has taken sabbatical leave for education purpose. Given the current situation, employees (self or family) are facing several personal/health issues which has resulted in taking the sabbatical leaves. Another reason employees are opting for sabbatical leaves is to spend quality time with their family and loved ones.” During sabbatical leave, the employee continues to accrue the benefits of gratuity, health insurance and group term life insurance. Such leave can be availed twice during the employment period. Singhel said as the dynamics of the job market change, the firm’s focus has been to ensure that there is appropriate work-life balance, matching the employee’s changing working style. In the past, employees have also taken sabbatical leave for maternity and for any health exigency within the family. The pandemic has generated several such reasons for employees to take leave. There are companies which offer care-giver leave and even ‘unlimited’ leave. Wells Fargo in India provides 28 days of paid leave to those who test Covid-positive. Although it’s not termed as a sabbatical leave, the 28-day leave is aimed at helping Covid-positive employees to recover well without worrying about work commitments and deliverables.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/home-sabbaticals-help-boost-family-bonding/articleshow/83185959.cms||Namrata Singh

Muktyala Girijamma (62), a native of Jaggiahpet was admitted to Vijayawada GGH on May 12 with Covid-19 related complications. On May 15, Girijamma’s family received a call from GGH informing them of her death. Staff handed over a dead body to Girijamma’s husband Muktyala Gaddayya on the same day and he cremated the body. Later, his son M Ramesh died of Covid-19 at a private hospital at Khammam, Telangana. Family members completed the death ceremony of both on May 25. On Wednesday, Girijamma was discharged from the hospital and returned home, much to the shock of her family who had conducted her last rites. Gaddayya expressed his anger at the hospital staff. “I failed to identify the body as it was packed. Officials should take action against the hospital,” he said. Taking note of the issue, the district administration has ordered an enquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-victim-cremated-by-other-family-in-hosp-goof-up/articleshow/83183940.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Allahabad||Arrest should be last option for police, says Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court has held that arrest should be the last option for police and should be restricted to those exceptional cases where arresting the accused is imperative or his custodial interrogation is required. “Irrational and indiscriminate arrests are a gross violation of human rights,” the court added. While granting anticipatory bail to a police constable, Jugendra Singh, Justice Siddhartha quoted the case of Joginder Kumar vs State of Uttar Pradesh (AIR 1994 SC1349), where the Supreme Court has referred to the third report of National Police Commission (NCP), in which it is mentioned that arrests by the police in India is one of the chief source of corruption in the police. The report suggested that, by and large, nearly 60% of the arrests were either unnecessary or unjustified and that such unjustified police action accounted for 43.2% of expenditure of the jails. “Personal liberty is a very precious fundamental right and should be curtailed only when it becomes imperative. According to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the arrest of an accused should be made,” the apex court had added in the case of Joginder Kumar. In the present case, there was an allegation against the applicant that he was taking money from passing trucks. His counsel submitted that there was no forensic report nor recovery has been made from the applicant and the investigation was still underway. The applicant has definite apprehension that he may be arrested by the police any time. However, the state counsel opposed the request for the anticipatory bail of the applicant, contending that in view of the seriousness of the allegations made against the applicant, he is not entitled to grant anticipatory bail. “The apprehension of the applicant is not founded on any material on record. Only on the basis of imaginary fear, anticipatory bail cannot be granted,” the state counsel added. However, the court directed that the applicant is entitled to be released on anticipatory bail for limited period in this case considering the exceptions considered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Sushila Aggarwal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)- 2020 SCC Online SC 98.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/arrest-should-be-last-option-for-police-hc/articleshow/83183821.cms||---

The matter came to light after one of the customers reached the branch to get his passbook updated on Monday and found that money had been debited from his account and transferred to some other accounts without his knowledge. Some other customers soon reached the branch and found that their money was also siphoned off. Buxar’s lead district manager Anand Kumar Ojha visited the branch on Wednesday. “The bank authorities have launched an internal inquiry. They will have to lodge an FIR in connection with the embezzlement,” he said, adding customers’ passbooks were not being printed at the branch and they were also not receiving SMS alerts. Sources said the Asha Parari branch manager of the bank, Dr Ravi Shankar Kumar, was immediately placed under suspension on Monday and instruction was issued to DBGB Bhabhua regional manager Vikash Kumar Bhagat to get him arrested by police after lodging of an FIR with Simri police station. However, no FIR was lodged immediately and Ravi Shankar is currently traceless, bank sources said. Sources said the modus operandi was to tell customers that the passbook printer was not working so that none could get their passbooks updated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-rs-2-crore-siphoned-off-from-a/cs-of-rural-bank-customers-in-buxar/articleshow/83183988.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Kolkata||More vials arrive in West Bengal, vaccination drive to pick up pace||KOLKATA: With the arrival of 5.2 lakh Covishield and 2.7 lakh Covaxin doses arriving on Wednesday, the state now has more than 20 lakh doses in its kitty. The stock is now sufficient to last around seven to 10 days. Health officials are hopeful of scaling up the drive massively as Bengal is expected to get more vaccines. “The supply of vaccines is back on the track. We got about 5.2 lakh Covishield doses on Wednesday evening. We are expecting the supply chain to be seamless and more intent from now onwards. In such a case, we should be able to speed up our inoculation drive,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. “The current stock that we have should see us through about seven days easily. But given the kind of frequency in which vaccines have started arriving, we would be scaling up our drive to the maximum level,” said a health department official. While the supply from the central government has increased, the state government is procuring doses directly from the manufacturers. While the Covishield consignment that came on Wednesday was from the central quota, the Covaxin doses were purchased by the state directly from Bharat Biotech. On Monday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said the state had procured 18 lakh doses from the manufacturers in May and the government had plans to buy at least 22 lakhs doses in June. The state had administered close to 5 lakh doses on a number of days in March and April. But the drive had to be scaled down due to scanty supply. From the first week of May, the government started buying doses on its own, adding to state’s vaccine kitty. Vaccination had already started picking up pace over the past one week with many private centres getting their own supply. Currently, between 2 lakh to 2.5 lakh people are getting vaccinated a day. “With the kind of robust vaccination infrastructure we have in the state, we have the capacity to administer 5 lakh doses a day,” said a health department official. While the supply from the central government is being used in vaccinating people above 45 years, the state’s own purchase is being used mostly to vaccinate people between 18 and 44 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-vials-arrive-vax-drive-to-pick-up-pace/articleshow/83184974.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Rising fuel price makes essential goods costlier in Kolkata||KOLKATA: There is no respite from rising prices of essential commodities due to diesel cost climbing up. In the past year, the diesel prices rose by Rs 27.03 a litre in Kolkata, making transportation of goods a costly affair. Prices of essential commodities — from vegetables, pulses, edible oil and spices to soap and toothpaste — have been rising steadily, surpassing the household budget and forcing citizens to cut corners to strike a balance. “If the kitchen budget is perennially on fire, you have no option but to cut corners. I am now thinking of selling off my car as I cannot afford Rs 100 a litre of petrol,” said Abhijit Chakraborty, a lawyer from Behala. Rising prices of essentials is a bigger jolt to Dyutiman Sarkar, whose wife lost her job last year. “Suddenly, my household income shrank by 50%. Despite my best efforts, my household expenditure rose by 25% even after cutting corners, sometimes eating into the emergency fund we have managed to build over years,” said Sarkar, a school teacher from Belgharia. In the past year, diesel prices have gone up by 34%. Kolkata has been hit more because it is a consuming market — more goods come from the producing states in the west and south, and cost of incoming goods is higher than the outgoing goods. Because of the rising fuel cost, many truckers have gone out of business,” said Sunil Agarwal, general secretary, Calcutta Goods Transport Association. Prices of almost every commodity has risen in the past 15 days. “Transportation of goods is becoming a major issue. In May alone, diesel price rose 17 times, leading to a high spike in transportation cost. The common variety of masoor daal, which was being sold at Rs 70 on May 15 is now sold for Rs 100. The price of mustard oil rose from Rs 150 a litre on May15 to Rs 190 now. A section of traders are also taking advantage of the situation,” said Arjun Shaw, a trader at Posta. “I was checking my account book as I have a habit of writing down every rupee I spend every day and I saw a straight jump of 30% to 45% in just household expenditure,” said Abhirup Roy, a teacher of statistics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rising-fuel-price-makes-essential-goods-costlier/articleshow/83185031.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Patna||‘Covid vaccines should be given to Bihar free of cost’||PATNA: Even as most health experts have been unequivocally emphasising the need to vaccinate maximum number of people in the shortest possible time to ward off the existing crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the people of Bihar are anxiously awaiting their turn to get inoculated. According to reports, the state is facing acute shortage of vaccines for people of all ages as their supply is quite slow. Different health centres engaged in the vaccination drive, both in urban and rural areas, have not been getting the desired number of doses regularly. Consequently, it is stopped every now and then in the absence of vaccines. Bihar Public Service Commission’s former member Shiv Jatan Thakur expressed his grave concern over the central government’s abdication of its bounden duty to supply vaccines to all the states free of cost. “The Union budget has allocated a sum of Rs 35,000 crore to eradicate coronavirus from the country,” Thakur said. He alleged that it is “unethical” on the part of the central government to direct the states to purchase vaccines from pharmaceutical companies straightaway. Covishield and Covaxin are sold to the Centre at Rs 150 per vial, but the states pay Rs 300 and Rs 600 for these doses respectively. Referring to the affidavit submitted by the government of India in the apex court, Thakur pointed out, “The government has justified the supply of 6 crore dosages to foreign countries on the plea that if the virus is allowed to survive in any corner of the world, it is bound to travel to India and affect the national health and economy. The same is true for the people of India living in any corner of the country.” He called upon the political leaders and intellectuals of the state to come together regardless of their political affiliation and exert pressure on the Centre to supply vaccines free of cost to Bihar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-vaccines-should-be-given-to-bihar-free-of-cost/articleshow/83183793.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Vax number for 18+ nosedives from 97k on May 15 to 2k now in Bihar||PATNA: The state is facing an acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses for people in the age group of 18-44 years. While 97,092 people in this age group were inoculated on May 15, the highest in the state so far, the number came down to 2,216 on Wednesday. Health minister Mangal Pandey, however, said 5 lakh vaccine doses for 18+ people reached the state on Wednesday. “The fresh stock comprises 4 lakh Covishield and 1 lakh Covaxin doses. Vaccination for this group will resume from Thursday. The state government is also planning to include 18+ people in its vaccination drive through ‘tika express’. The drive will be launched for 45+ people in urban local bodies on Thursday. Altogether 121 vehicles will be used to vaccinate people, including 36 in Patna,” the minister said. “The state’s quota for the month of June, as fixed by the Centre, is 26 lakh vaccine doses for 18+ age group. We have placed orders and made advance payment for the same and five lakh doses have already reached the state. The state government is buying vaccines from two companies to inoculate people in 18+ age group,” the minister added. The inoculation drive for 18+ age group, which had commenced in the state on May 9, remained suspended for the seventh consecutive day in some districts on Wednesday due to lack of vaccines. The vaccination for people in the age group of 45-59 years, however, is being conducted smoothly. In May, the state had inoculated 16.05 lakh people in the age group of 18-44 years. Of them, 6,09,287 were inoculated in the first week of the month alone. In Patna, about 1.4 lakh people in 18+ age group have so far received their vaccine shots. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said the inoculation drive for 18+ group had been temporarily suspended due to non-availability of vaccines. “The district has the capacity to inoculate more than 20,000 people in 18+ age group per day at 62 selected sites. We want to increase the number of sites so that people at panchayat level can also get their jabs. However, we need enough vaccine stock for this,” he said. In Gaya too, the vaccination drive for this group has come to a halt. Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said they are expecting to get the fresh supply of vaccines for 18+ age group this week. The long wait for vaccines has left people wondering when their turn will come. Many are disappointed after spending hours to book their slots. Vaishnavi Priya (23), a resident of Rukanpura, said, “I regularly visit the CoWIN application to see the availability of vaccine at the nearby session sites. Unfortunately, there is no open slot for people in the age group of 18-44 years.” One Karthik Sinha (35) of Gardanibagh said booking vaccine slot is a herculean task these days. “Booking of slot is must for this age group. Walk-in is not allowed. However, despite registering myself and some of my family members on the portal around a fortnight back, we have not been able to book slots yet,” he added. Prashant Kumar, a resident of Budh Marg, said he was excited last week when he finally managed to book the slot. “The day I was supposed to get my first jab, the medical staff at the centre said there was no vaccine. Since then I have been contacting the centre every day, but to no avail,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vax-number-for-18-nosedives-from-97k-on-may-15-to-2k-now/articleshow/83183776.cms||Faryal Rumi

Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will lay the foundation stone for housing colonies in virtual mode from the camp office on Thursday. The state government will spend close to Rs 28,000 crore for the housing scheme which is considered to be the biggest to be launched in one go. The state government is planning to take up another 12.70 lakh houses in the second phase with a cost of Rs 22,860 crore after completing the first phase of the programme by 2022. The state government has readied the blueprint for the mega housing scheme to ensure all the poor who have been granted house sites recently will become house owners by 2023. In addition to extending support to beneficiaries in completing the housing units, the state government is spending huge monies for construction of dedicated roads, drains, electricity, drinking water, parks and open auditoriums in all the housing colonies. The chief minister told the officials to keep in mind that they were not merely constructing new housing units but new villages. “We are providing all the required infrastructure in the housing colonies to see that the beneficiaries would move into their own houses immediately after construction. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy had directed us to create the housing colonies as the best in the country,” said housing minister Cherukuvada Srirangantha Raju. He added that giving house sites to every eligible poor and making them house owners was one of the key promises of the chief minister and the government would cross another milestone in fulfilling poll promises. No poor would be left without their own house by 2023, said the minister. District collectors have already been directed to focus on creating basic infrastructure in the housing colonies. While water and electricity facilities would be provided before the commencement of construction of the units, line departments such as rural water supply, energy, roads and buildings, panchayat raj and municipal administration have been asked to take up infrastructure work on a war footing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/jagan-to-lay-stone-for-housing-scheme-today/articleshow/83184058.cms||Samdani MN

The company’s philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation will pay Rs 10 lakh to the nominees of the deceased off-roll members. An off-roll member is someone who is not on the payroll of the company but has been deployed by a third party to work for the company and pays his/her salary. RIL is perhaps the first corporate to extend financial support for families of ‘off-roll’ workforce. For the families of its on-roll staff too, the company has extended financial assistance. It will continue to pay the last drawn salary for five years to the families of all its employees who have died due to Covid. RIL has also pledged to bear 100% payment of premium for hospitalisation coverage for spouse, parents and children till their graduation. Additionally, it will cover the education costs (tuition fee, hostel accommodation and book fee) of the children of dead employees until they graduate. This week, the country counted 3.5 lakh dead from the virus, though experts warn the number is higher. “As ‘one Reliance family’, each one’s loss is irreplaceable and bears heavily on our collective consciousness. While nothing can compensate the loss of a loved one, we remain committed to helping each member of their family cope through this difficult period with faith and fortitude,” said RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani in their letter to over 2 lakh employees. Proposes drug for treatment RIL has submitted a proposal for the application of Niclosamide as a potential Covid drug, the company revealed in its FY21 report. It didn’t give further details. Niclosamide is an oral anti-viral drug and is on the WHO’s list of essential medicines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/covid-death-ril-off-rolls-to-benefit-too/articleshow/83186028.cms||Reeba Zachariah

A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of the PU syndicate held in virtual mode under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary. The promotions were cleared by the selection committee in its meetings on February 26 and 27 last. Those promoted to the post of professor included PU examination controller R K Mandal and retired sociology teacher Randhir Kumar Singh. The syndicate also endorsed the decision of the academic council regarding the abolition of entrance test for admission of students to the three-year degree courses both under the conventional and self-financing modes. Now, the syndicate’s resolution for a transitory regulation regarding the abolition of entrance test for one session in view of the Covid-19 pandemic will be sent to the Raj Bhavan. After the chancellor’s approval, admission to both the conventional and self-financing courses will be made on the basis of the marks obtained by the students in the Class XII examinations. Even the provision of holding viva voce examination along with entrance test for admission in self-financing courses has been scrapped. The syndicate also decided to change the nomenclature of some courses of the university in the larger interest of the students. The names of courses like MA/MSc in social work, music, personnel management and industrial relations (PMIR) will be changed to Masters in social work, music and PMIR respectively. The syndicate decided to implement the state government’s recent decision to enhance the rate of honorarium being given to the duly appointed guest lecturers. The issue of reappointment of already working guest faculty members, whose services were terminated before the summer vacation, was also discussed in detail at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/21-patna-university-teachers-promoted/articleshow/83183790.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||PMC rolls up sleeves as monsoon knocks on Bihar’s door||PATNA: As heavy rainfall led to waterlogging in some localities recently, the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has drawn out a plan to prepare the city for the monsoon season. It has initiated several measures like connecting vulnerable areas to the pumping stations and blocking the outfall drains. The civic body officials have taken stock of the situation in 12 vulnerable areas besides inspecting two more localities – Bhagwat Nagar and Nandnagar – where drains overflowed during the pre-monsoon showers. Municipal commissioner Himanshu Sharma said following the heavy rainfall triggered by cyclone Yaas, the outfall drains of Yogipur Nallah had overflowed in Bhagwat Nagar and Saidpur Nallah in Nandnagar. The city had recorded more than 140mm rain in a day then. “It took additional six hours for the PMC to drain out water from these two localities. To avoid overflowing of drains during monsoon, we have decided to block such outfall drains and pump out the water from localities by using portable pump sets,” he said. Explaining the reason behind the overflowing of drainage line, Sharma said when all the sump houses function to their full capacity, it takes time for water to recede from the big drains. “When there is a tremendous pressure on the main channel from different drainage lines, it causes the outfall sewer to overflow,” he said. The civic body claimed that water was drained out in 6-7 hours after the rain stopped from vulnerable areas like Rajendra Nagar, Nala Road, Patliputra Colony, Nepali Nagar, Indirapuri and Kadamkuan. Sharma said it took longer time to drain out water from few localities, including road numbers 1, 2 and 13 B of Rajendra Nagar, Old Patliputra Colony and Nala Road as these areas have no drainage line. “To resolve the waterlogging problem in road number 13 B, we are constructing a small drainage line, which would be connected to the R K Avenue sump house. Similarly, in two areas at Old Patliputra Colony, drainage network will be constructed to drain out water from Kurji sump house,” he said. Sharma added, “Our deadline for desilting of drain was May 31. We still tackle the waterlogging in a better manner this time as the drains are being cleaned properly.” According to a civic body official, the master plan for drainage system of Patna is nearing completion and it would help the municipal body tackle waterlogging in the long run. Seema Kumari, a resident of Rajeev Nagar, said even after heavy rainfall on May 27 and 28, water did not accumulate on roads in her locality. “There were only few pockets where stagnant water was seen. The situation, however, improved after the rain stopped,” she said. Shyam Kishore Sharma, a Patna high court lawyer, who had filed a writ petition against the state in 1997 for waterlogging in Patna, said, “It was unbelievable that even after 144mm of rainfall in a day, no waterlogging occurred on road numbers 1 and 2 of Rajendra Nagar.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Energy demand surges in May despite Covid||VISAKHAPATNAM: While energy demand in the country declined by about 14 per cent in May 2021 compared to the corresponding period last year, it has surged by 8 per cent in Andhra Pradesh in the same time, even amid the second wave of Covid-19 that swept the state in May. The AP Transco and discoms spent Rs 3,762 crore during the last two years to set up new sub-stations and erect electricity lines. Due to this, the utilities have reduced interruptions in power supply by 74 per cent in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20. During the meeting of the board of directors of the Transmission Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (AP Transco) held here at Vidyut Soudha on Wednesday, state energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said power utilities could supply round-the-clock quality power during May with the support of the state government and employees of power utilities. “Despite the concerns over the transmission of Covid-19, the personnel of power utilities, particularly, the field-level staff, did not hesitate to deliver their regular duties. They have rendered invaluable services as frontline warriors by not only putting their lives at risk, but also their family members as well. The utilities are putting maximum efforts to ensure uninterrupted supply to healthcare services and domestic sector during the Covid-19 crisis,” said Srikant. The energy department has decided to dedicate the upcoming Independence Day celebrations to Covid-19 fighters, to recognise the contribution and work of officials and staff of power utilities. Explaining the progress in the power sector during the last two years, officials said that the power utilities were able to save around Rs 2,350 crore by purchasing power in spot markets at cost-effective prices and utilising other low cost opportunities. “Perhaps, no state has achieved this kind of commendable success in such a short time. Achieving cheap power will benefit every consumer in the state and boost industrial and economic development,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/energy-demand-surges-in-may-despite-covid/articleshow/83185251.cms||---

The government has also chalked out ward-wise comprehensive development plans to provide basic facilities such as drinking water, electricity and other needs in the city and its surrounding. At a review meeting on Covid-19 control measures here at the collectorate on Wednesday, agriculture minister K Kannababu, who is district in-charge, said 113 black fungus cases, including 82 in King George Hospital (KGH), have been reported so far. The nine hospitals include KGH, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (200 beds each), ENT, Apollo, Pradhama, Gitam hospitals (100 beds each), Pinnacle and Care (50 beds each). “We are getting Amphotericin injections for black fungus treatment from the Union government and around 18,000 Remdesivir injections for Covid-19 treatment are available in the district. The death rate has come down and the discharge rate has also increased. The availability of oxygen and ventilator beds is also encouraging. All this is a reflection of the hard work the authorities have put in in controlling the virus,” he said. Kannababu also said penalties of Rs 57 lakh have been imposed against hospitals found overcharging patients.

---||Agra||Agra: Acid attack survivors get aid for shut cafe, use money to feed poor||AGRA: The pandemic forced Sheroes Cafe, the only one in the country run entirely by acid attack survivors, to shut down. The 30 survivors who worked there left but stayed in touch. As word got out, donations to revive the cafe started pouring in. But they decided they could help those more in need. They would feed the poor on the streets. On May 19, the “Sheroes” of Agra and Lucknow regrouped. Every morning since then, some of them meet at the cafe while others go to the mandi to buy vegetables for the day. The menu changes every day. Each person has a specific role — it’s assembly line cooking. Through the entire process — from handling the vegetables to cooking to packing — every person wears a face mask, surgical cap and gloves. Then, they step out with huge batches of hearty meals. Going around major hospitals and underprivileged areas of the city, they distribute these food packets to the homeless and the poor. “We reach out to at least 100 people a day, to start with. We are preparing to increase that number,” said Rupa, manager of Sheroes Cafe Agra and an acid attack survivor. “I oversee the hygiene when food is packed. We want the food to taste good and for there to be variation. We want them to like our food.” For now, they don’t know when they can revive the restaurant. “Shutting down Sheroes Cafe was very painful. After the pandemic struck, we tried online delivery for a while but got few orders. Both cafes (in Agra and Lucknow) incurred losses with about 80% drop in total revenues. We were left with no other option,” said Ashish Shukla, founder of Sheroes Cafe and director of Chhanv Foundation, the non-profit that backs the Sheroes initiative. “The idea to provide food to the homeless came from the cafe staffers. They wanted to help those in need. We are getting immense support for this from a Spanish NGO, Bekoz Neko.” In Lucknow, acid attack survivor Kunti is leading the food distribution programme. “The thought behind this was that we received a lot of love and support from people over the years. We had to do the same,” she said. The Chhanv Foundation has secured funding to see the 30 survivors through for 12 months with a Rs 10,000 monthly salary. In addition, some of the money is being used to pay for the treatment and rehabilitation of 70 other acid attack survivors. Shukla said, “The survivors (who run Sheroes Cafe) want to expand the food distribution initiative and keep it going. They want to do more. We hope we can help.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/acid-attack-survivors-get-aid-for-shut-cafe-use-money-to-feed-poor/articleshow/83183447.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Patna||Bihar: DSP faces arrest in 4-year-old rape case as wife spills beans||PATNA: Former DSP (headquarters) in Gaya Kamlakant Prasad, who is currently posted as officer on special duty (OSD) at Central Selection Board of Constable in Patna, is in trouble as an FIR was lodged against him on May 27 for allegedly raping a minor girl at his official residence in Gaya around four years back. Prasad’s act was disclosed to police by none other than his wife Anant Tanuja. The girl, then minor, was already a rape survivor. Prasad, according to police, had kept the girl in his house for a night before sending her to his Patna house to work as maid. Prasad’s wife used to live in Patna. It was CID (weaker section) ADG Anil Kishore Yadav who had begun an inquiry on the basis of Tanuja’s complaint that her husband had raped a minor girl in 2017. Sources said Tanuja had provided strong evidence of rape to CID. “She had also accused her husband of indulging in irregularities in constable recruitment in connivance with a retired IPS officer,” they said. It was a CID (weaker section) letter annexed with the written complaint sent to Gaya police that an FIR in connection with the girl’s rape was registered with Women’s police station there on May 27. Special public prosecutor (POCSO court, Gaya) Syed Qaiser Sharfuddin said the rape survivor’s statement before a judicial magistrate was recorded on Tuesday. “The matter is serious and cognizable. The accused can be arrested anytime even without warrant. The rape survivor’s statement against the accused before a judicial magistrate is strong evidence,” Sharfuddin said. SHO of Gaya Women’s police station Ravi Ranjana said the FIR was registered on the basis of a written complaint submitted by the rape survivor’s brother under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act as she was a minor in 2017. “The matter surfaced before CID during an internal inquiry against the DSP,” Ranjana said, adding the girl was already suffering mental trauma as she had become pregnant after being raped by a youth in her village in 2016. “She had lodged an FIR after which the accused was arrested. He was later convicted,” she said. The SHO added after the 2016 incident, the girl’s brother wanted to keep her at another location due to social stigma. “He came in contact with Prasad. The officer told him that her wife in Patna is preparing for competitive examinations and needs a maid. He offered free education and food to the girl. The girl was dropped at DSP’s official residence so that she could be taken to his wife’s residence in Patna the next day,” the SHO said, adding it was during this night stay that the officer raped her, as per the FIR. Gaya SSP Aditya Kumar said investigation in the case would be carried out by CID (weaker section) as FIR was lodged on its direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dsp-faces-arrest-in-4-year-old-rape-case-as-wife-spills-beans/articleshow/83183891.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Talking at a function held to distribute seedlings to farmers at Calangute, he said the coastal village has managed to retain its green cover over the years because people like to keep their trees. “A lot of old trees, especially mango trees, fell down during the recent cyclone. We need to plant new trees in places where old trees got uprooted as these new trees will give fruits in the years to come and also give shade and keep Calangute green,” Lobo said. He said the village panchayat has always supported agriculture and farmers and that this support would grow, even as he urged lay people to also grow kitchen gardens. “In my home, we have developed our own kitchen garden for the last five years and almost all our vegetables come from there. Most people have some open area next to their houses that can be easily converted into a small kitchen garden. The panchayat provides free seeds to anyone who wants to do that,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plant-new-trees-where-old-ones-were-uprooted-lobo/articleshow/83187098.cms||---

After visiting Jawahar Bagh on Wednesday on Mukul’s fifth death anniversary, Archana Dwivedi met district magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal and SSP Guarav Grover and gave them a letter of demands. Regretting that the government “failed to give due respect to her husband”, Dwivedi, who works as OSD in Greater Noida Industrial development authority, said that she has been only getting assurances till now. “Even after five years, the CBI has not completed its inquiry. Jawahar Bagh has not been named after my husband who sacrificed his life. Neither I got justice, nor the respect,” she said, adding that UP minister for Power, Srikant Sharma had assured her that the Bagh would be renamed soon but nothing has been done so far. “I just want to adopt a small area where my husband was killed. We will develop it as a memorial site and the maintenance cost will be borne by me and my family,” she said, adding that this demand should be accepted as a mark of respect to slain officers and for the morale of the police force. The violence that preceded the eviction of Yadav and his 2000 odd followers, had claimed the lives of 29 people, including the then SP (city), Mukul Dwivedi and SO Farah, Santosh Yadav. The CBI is investigating the case following orders of the Allahabad High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/jawahar-bagh-anniversary-give-me-a-piece-of-land-to-make-memorial-for-husband-says-wife-sp-killed-during-2016-clash/articleshow/83183474.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The bicycle revolution, which had started after nationwide lockdown last year in Himachal, has begun again as the state is observing corona curfew. Bicycles are again in high demand, but the shops have been asked to remain closed. However, most shops are out of stock. Pedalling through the steep and narrow hilly roads is a new trend in the state. Children, youth and elderly, all are riding bikes to keep themselves fit and busy. Vikas Anand, a youth from Kullu who found his love for cycling during pandemic, said, “Gyms are closed and sports activities are not allowed. Pedalling a bike on steep road for a couple of hours is as advantageous as sweating as gym. I and my friends pedal on a different trail every day. We have been doing this for over a year now. We took a small break during winter but resumed last week.” Many people visit markets for shopping during relaxation in curfew in bicycle. People have now become health conscious and everyone wants to stay fit to fight Covid-19. While some people are hesitating in going out of the house, a large number of people can be seen doing morning walk, yoga, and cycling in open spaces. Be it Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur, Shimla, Mandi or Chamba districts, the bicycle fever is spreading fast everywhere in the state. Many people have formed cycling groups and are exploring the unseen trails. As use of vehicles for non-emergency purposes is attracting huge fines, more and more people are taking up cycling for multipurpose uses, including transportation, sports, workout and time pass. Manoj Larje from Manali, who bought his first bicycle in pandemic, has explored almost all the trails of the valley. “Now I feel fit and energetic. I had given cycling a pause in winter season but my expedition has restarted. I choose a steep road or off-road trail every morning. This Sunday I and my friends reached Rohtang. Had I not bought the bicycle, I would have missed a lot of places around me. Pedalling has helped me in boosting my stamina,” he said. Whatsapp, Instagram and Facebook posts have been stormed with photos and videos of cyclists. According to bicycle sellers, the demand had surged last year after April and now again bikes in huge demand. “Unfortunately, we are not allowed to open the shops. I get regular phone calls from people who want bicycle for themselves or their children. The demand was such a high since last year that suppliers were not able to fulfill our demands,” cycle seller Vivek Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amid-2nd-wave-hp-pedals-for-health-safe-transport/articleshow/83190949.cms||Suresh Sharma

At present, these UPHCs run as OPD and also collect swab samples for testing. They will run round the clock afte being provided with staff and necessary infrastructure for projected third wave,” he said. Radhakrishnan issued a requisition order to RTMNU for taking over two floors of new administrative building constructed adjacent to campus at Ambazari. Ruling party leader Avinash Thakre said, “This hospital will be for paediatric Covid patients. Plan is to set up 200 beds. We have engaged an team of architects that is planning a hospital suitable and friendly for child patients. Designs will be made on walls. TV screens will be provided inside rooms and ICU. A special ward will be developed where parent will stay from where they can watch and give confidence to their kids. Architects and paediatricians are coming up with more such ideas.” Thakre added leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis has assured to provide all medical equipment for the hospital from National Cancer Institute (NCI). NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “RTMNU has started office on ground floor. We are planning to use 2nd and 3rd floor for the hospital without disturbing their work. Work will start soon,” he said. Launched three days ago, NMC’s five Post Covid Care Centres helped in detecting five suspected patients of mucormycosis. Joshi said, “Around 65 Covid recovered persons visited five centres complaining post-Covid problems. Medical officers and dentists examined these patients followed by ENTs. Five suspected patients of mucormycosis were identified and referred to GMCH,” he said. The district registered 204 positive cases on Wednesday. Cases had dropped to 203 a day ago, lowest in a day after 125 days. Tests increased to 13,419 on Wednesday from 10,545 on Tuesday. 11 patients succumbed to the disease while 649 recovered on Wednesday. Recoveries are more than new cases for 34 days running. Active cases dropped to 5,163 which are 1.1% of total positive cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/paediatric-covid-hosp-walk-in-o2-centres-in-offing/articleshow/83183547.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The reason? Many believed they would die if they got vaccinated. The vaccination drive in Uttar Pradesh’s rural areas has taken a hit and the reason is the proliferation of myths — that the vaccine reduces immunity, makes one sterile and, in the worst cases, kills. “People at Nayi Basti were not ready to get vaccinated. They thought they would die if they did … We tried to convince them but managed to get just 20 on board on Tuesday and Wednesday,” said Dr Bhudev Singh, in charge of the Covid control unit. Live updates: Coronavirus pandemicOf the nearly 14 crore people in the state who are older than 18, just over 1.9 crore have received the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and only 35.3 lakh have received two. While many districts have started walk-in vaccination for those 45 and older, slots remain unbooked — fewer still in rural areas. “If we open up even 10 slots, they remain unbooked,” a health official in Mathura said Coronavirus outbreak: Complete coverageThe problem runs deep. Ruksana, a domestic help from Jeevangarh in Aligarh, said, “I don’t want to die. Those who took it got corona and died after being hospitalised. I will not get vaccinated. None of my family members will either.” Another woman from the village, Mehrunisa, said, “If I get vaccinated, my immunity will go down and I will get Covid-19.” Mehrunisa, ironically, works as a nursing home attendant. “People in rural areas are not aware of the benefits of vaccination. It is because of higher awareness in cities that places like Noida have higher vaccination rates than Kanpur or Bahraich,” UP state immunisation officer Dr Ajay Ghai said. “The hesitancy is higher in those 45 and older, and among Muslims,” added Agra chief medical officer RC Pandey.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Social media, Prof Aftab Alam from Aligarh Muslim University said, has played a major role. “It is because of social media propaganda that many believe people die after getting their first shot or go sterile,” AMU vice chancellor Prof Tariq Mansoor added. For those who do decide to get vaccinated, a stumbling block has been the registration process. Singh said, “Registration is very difficult for those in rural areas. They are not familiar with the technology and, in some cases, unlettered. Many don’t even own smartphones.” To counter vaccine hesitancy, districts are getting local leaders on board. “We are engaging village heads, area councillors, imams and priests because people listen to them,” said Singh. Likewise, Aligarh chief medical officer Dr BP Kalyani said, “We are approaching prominent people from each community to address hesitancy. If they get vaccinated, it strengthens the message that the vaccine is safe.” In Aligarh, health officials have been focussing on Muslim-majority areas like Shahjamal, Upperkot and Jamalpur. Ghai said, “Sectoral approach always helps in mobilising people in such drives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fear-of-vaccine-death-big-stumbling-block-in-ups-covid-vax-drive/articleshow/83183516.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Nagpur||212 students going abroad for education to get vaccine in Nagpur||NAGPUR: 212 have applied for Covid vaccination under the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) special drive for students going abroad for education, according to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan M. As announced on Tuesday, this event will take place at Indira Gandhi Rugnalaya (IGR) and Pachpaoli Women’s Hospital. The NMC had circulated a Google sheet to be filled by interested students. “Those who submit it on Wednesday-Thursday, will get the jab on Friday,” said additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi. NMC officials expect less than 1,000 students to benefit from the drive. The civic body decided to do the special drive after requests from students who had confirmed admission from foreign universities. Though the state government had started inoculation for those in the 18-44 age group from May 1, it stopped the drive on May 12 citing shortage of doses putting the students in a fix. The NMC has also started asking flat schemes and housing societies to apply for vaccination of 45-plus. “Our vaccination team will go to their places for a special camp. Details can be had from Joshi,” said Radhakrishnan. Meanwhile, the number of beneficiaries continues to slide in the district. 3,517 healthcare and frontline workers, and 45-plus in the district took the jab on Wednesday. The number on the last two days was 3,539 and 3,687. For the first time, vaccination in other districts of Vidarbha is more than that of Nagpur. On Wednesday, in Gondia 4,961 took the jab. At Kingsway Hospital, which became the first in the private sector to start vaccination, 944 took the jab on Wednesday. “We have vaccinated 1,955 people in three days,” said director Amit Somani. Though vaccination of 45-plus free of cost at 98 centres in the city, 65 people from this age group took first dose at Kingsway Hospital in last three days. Remaining 1,890 beneficiaries were from 18-44 years age group. The Rotary Club of Nagpur Ishanya has reportedly started helping the NMC in vaccination at Dik Dispensary on VIP road. It has erected a shamiana at the centre and will also provide ambulance, pick up and drop facility for senior citizens and persons with disabilities on Saturdays and Sundays. In a press release, the NMC said that two doses of 45-plus will continue at all centres with Covishield on Thursday. Only the second dose of Covaxin will be available at GMCH, Mahal Diagnostic Centre and Khobragade Hall in Siddharth Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/212-students-going-abroad-for-education-to-get-vaccine-today/articleshow/83183536.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Viewers unhappy with quality dip in serials shot at home||KOLKATA: With shooting being stalled after strict restrictions were imposed on Bengal to check the spread of the novel coronavirus, viewers have started complaining about quality dip in the serials being telecast now. Even as producers, actors and technicians continued to trade allegations against each other over shooting at home and “job loss” of technicians, most viewers said they were peeved with the unnecessary use of sepiatoned flashback scenes and overlaps of scenes in consecutive episodes. The professional touch of makeup artists was missing and absence of proper lights in episodes shot from home looked pale, they said. Federation of Cine Technicians and Workers of Eastern India (FCTWEI) president Swarup Biswas said, “Producers forgot the high quality maintained by the crew members and brought in change. They did not think how inferior videos are becoming.” Biswas pointed to a recent episode of ‘Amader Ei Poth Jodi Na Shesh Hoy’. “It was not shot in designer Abhishek Roy’s warehouse on May 28-29. This warehouse shares its address with that of the production house’s office. What is the point of producers making false claims of shooting at home and shooting outside with multiple actors?” Biswas said. But Rupa Bhattacharya of Crazy Ideas Media that produces this serial, said, “We had feared shooting would get stalled and so, had kept some episodes ready in our bank. We are doing a mix and match of the old footage and what is being shot at home.” FCTWEI has also sent out a 15-page release—signed by 24 heads of various technicians’ guilds affiliated to it—protesting against producers’ and actors’ allegation against Biswas about his high-handedness. The technicians’ guilds claimed Biswas represented their sentiments that shoot-athome should be stopped as that rendered them unemployed. About accusations of FCTWEI threatening producers, the technicians’ federation claimed the situation was the opposite. “Producer Susanta Das spoke about wanting to shift out of Bengal for shooting. Is this not trying to pose a threat to our CM’s efforts to make this state shooting friendly?” Biswas said. Technicians have also taken offence to Welfare Association of Television Producers “going public with how they had offered financial support for three months last year”. “Producers had paid a retaining allowance to ensure technicians did not leave a production house. Raking up the issue is insulting,” Biswas said. FCTWEI has also sought clarity on technicians’ remuneration from producers. “They need to state whether the remuneration will be for those who are supposed to be on the shift or overtime will be considered,” the release stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/viewers-unhappy-with-quality-dip-in-serials-shot-at-home/articleshow/83185147.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

In capital Mumbai, 923 cases meant it was a tenth of the second wave peak of 11,200 cases on April 3. Data presented to the state cabinet on Wednesday shows the state has reported a decline in most Covid-19 indicators -- the weekly case growth rate has dropped to 0.3% and the doubling rate has gone up to 204 days. Also, the rate of recovery is 94.2%, higher than the national average of 92.4%. However, the case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.6%, higher than the national average of 1.2%. “Covid is under control in Mumbai,” said BMC’s additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “The number of cases, the number of deaths and the demand for hospital beds have all dropped, but we aren’t dropping our guard,” he said. For the last three days, the daily tally has been less than 1,000 cases. He said the BMC is studying ward-wise growth and fall in cases to map out plans for the third Covid wave. Maharashtra reported 285 deaths on Wednesday, and 268 old deaths were added to the cumulative toll which rose to 96,751. The total caseload touched 57.8 lakh on Wednesday. The number of deaths in Mumbai dropped to 31 on Wednesday, taking the total toll to 14,880. The BMC dashboard showed the number of critical patients in hospitals was around 1,000, less than half of the figure a fortnight ago. Active cases, which had risen beyond 91,100, are down to 18,478 now. “The number of people seeking Covid consultation has gone down and there is no longer a problem in getting beds in the city,” said infectious diseases specialist Dr Vasant Naghvekar, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid. Naghvekar said even the number of post-Covid patients coming in with mucormycosis has reduced in the last week. “At the same time, newly diagnosed patients seeking the new antibody cocktail treatment are doing well,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-at-923-new-cases-in-city-a-tenth-of-2nd-wave-peak-daily-tally-two-months-ago/articleshow/83187136.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Kolkata||Three heart recipients in Kolkata get their shots||KOLKATA: Three heart-transplant recipients, who are susceptible to contracting the novel coronavirus, were on Wednesday vaccinated on a priority basis by the city hospital, where they had undergone the surgeries. “I was a bit hesitant to take the vaccine but Dr K M Mandana assured it would provide me with good protection against the virus. I listened to the doctor and his team, who gave me a new lease of life. Three years down the transplant, I now lead a normal life. I am also feeling fine after taking the first shot,” said Dilchand Singh, who is now 42. The para-teacher from Jhanjhi village in Deoghar made it to the headlines in May 2018, when eastern India’s first heart transplant was conducted on him at Fortis Hospital, Anandapur. Singh, like other organ recipients, have to be on immunosuppressant drugs. “Immunosuppressant drugs make them susceptible to any kind of infection. We know how Covid can affect the coronary arteries and hence, if such patients are infected, their condition could turn serious and they can also develop serious thrombogenic events post the infection. That is why it was important to inoculate them,” said Fortis Hospital cardiothoracic surgeon Mandada, whose team had conducted the heart transplant surgery on all the three. “During the pandemic, doctors have regularly been educating us on the precautions to keep the novel coronavirus at bay. Now that I got my first dose of the vaccine, I feel a little more at ease,” said Tanaya Pandit of Murshidabad. The 32-year-old, who was detected with dilated cardiomyopathy in 2010, underwent a heart transplant surgery in November 2018. “I resumed cooking, which I love to do, four months after my heart transplant. But I have been stressed ever since the pandemic broke out, and more so after the second wave. Now after getting the first dose, I feel a little relaxed. I am looking forward to the second dose,” said Anusha Adhikari, another heart recipient. The 46-year-old homemaker from Dum Dum Cantonment underwent the surgery on May 28, 2019. While husband Goutam and son Anik also got their first doses, daughter Adina is yet to be eligible for the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-heart-recipients-get-their-shots/articleshow/83185206.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to Fazal Siddiqui, deputy CEO (operations), Hajj Committee of India, “This year, Saudi Arabia has announced that only 60,000 can go on Hajj. Out of which, 15,000 will be the residents of that country. Remaining 45,000 will be from all over the world. So if we calculate India’s quota according to the population, it will be around 4,500. Otherwise, in normal times, 2lakh used to go on the pilgrimage from India alone.” Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of the country, used to send close to 30,000 people on Hajj every year. Convener of the Hajj in Deoband, Faheem Siddiqui, said, “UP sends close to 32,000 pilgrims on Hajj every year. But this year, Saudi Arabia has fixed the number due to the pandemic. The cost of travel has also soared from Rs 2lakh to Rs 3.75lakh.” Several other restrictions to check the spread of pandemic have also been announced by Saudi Arabia. “The pilgrims must have received the full doses of approved Covid-19 vaccines in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The gap between the last dose of two doses of vaccine or the first dose of the single-dose should not be less than 14 days. All pilgrims must present a PCR examination certificate with a negative result that they are free of the emerging coronavirus, issued by a reliable laboratory from the country of the pilgrims. This should not exceed 72 hours from the sample collecting time until departure to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Pilgrims without certification of a negative test will not be permitted to board the plane,” the circular issued by the Saudi authorities said. Rahul Gupta, secretary/executive officer Uttar Pradesh State Haj Committee stated in his press release, “No official information has yet been given by the Saudi government regarding the distribution of the Haj quota for India. The procedure-related to going on Hajj will depend on the permission of the Saudi government.” According to an officer posted in Haj committee in Uttar Pradesh, who did not wish to be named,”6,390 applications for Haj were received and we will examine all applications as per guidelines, I do not think that every applicant will meet the requirements, so this time the figures of the pilgrims of India will remain very low.” Due to the pandemic, Haj in 2020 was cancelled by the Saudi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/less-than-5000-to-get-chance-to-go-on-hajj-pilgrimage-this-year-official/articleshow/83183584.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The officers also seized 40 litres of illicit liquor and 1,220 litres of wash from the centre that functioned in a house at Thattupalam near Madathara under Palode police station limits outside the city. The person who was running the brewing centre fled seeing the officers approaching. A search has been launched to track down the suspect, who has been identified as Irshad, a resident of Kochalummood. Vamanapuram excise range inspector G Mohankumar, who led the team, said Irshad was a habitual offender who was arrested by the officers of the same range during the first phase of the Covid-induced lockdown last year with 15 litres of illicit liquor and 1,050 litres of wash. “It turns out that the suspect had rented the house 20 days ago,” the inspector said. Irshad was also into the business of earth moving and owned a few excavators. According to the house owner, Irshad rented the house for providing accommodation for his employees. But there was no one else except Irshad in the house when the officers raided the house. The counterfeit currency notes were found from a secret compartment of a Suzuki Maruti Dzire that was parked on the house premises. There were 323 notes of Rs 500 denomination. Besides, cash worth Rs 35,000 was also found in the car. The fake notes were handed over to the Palode police, who registered a case and launched a probe to find out its source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/excise-seizes-illicit-liquor-fake-notes-worth-over-rs-1l/articleshow/83185242.cms||---

In a press note, the SWR said that it was “a very difficult and a challenging task to carry out the replacement work in this pandemic situation of Covid-19.” “With the help of these operating panels, the station master operates signal for the movement of trains i.e. receiving and departing the trains, etc. Railway carries out regular maintenance and replacement of its critical equipment on completion of codal life of such equipment to avoid repeated failures and train detention,” as per the press note. Sonaulim and Dudhsagar stations are situated in Braganza Ghat between Castle Rock and Kulem stations. “Transport of materials, wiring, fixing, testing and commissioning were done during the lockdown. All Covid-related precautions were strictly adhered to during the works,” the press note added. The replacement of old panel with new ones at Sonaulim and Dudhsagar stations was done under the supervision of Arvind Malkhede, divisional railway manager, Hubballi. Pawan Gadewad, senior divisional signal and telecommunication engineer, and Tarun Kumar Shukla, divisional signal and telecommunication engineer, took up the challenge of completing the work before the onset of monsoon, the note further said. The 26 km section of Braganza Ghats starts at Castle Rock in Karnataka and ends at Collem in Goa and has 3 stations en route - Caranzol, Dudhsagar and Sonaulim. The trains, however, do not have commercial halts at these three stations. The Braganza Ghats section has a ruling gradient of 1 in 37, considered to be among the toughest in Indian Railways, and which requires the use of bankers (extra locomotives to haul up a train).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/swr-changes-rail-panels-at-sonaulim-dudhsagar-stations/articleshow/83187142.cms||---

The state government did requisition the services of private hospitals, but 80 per cent of the state’s 288 assembly constituencies had insufficient beds, hospital staff and lack of oxygen and ventilator facilities. “Neither state government nor the union government have data or any mechanism to capture unemployment induced by the pandemic. Our survey indicates that 78% businesses were shut and there has been 72% rise in unemployment, which will severely hamper the growth prospects of the state. There was massive reduction in revenue collection in the state,” Public Policy and Governance’s Shardul Manurkar said. Sampark and Public Policy and Governance conducted a survey of legislators to understand and document the role played by elected representatives during the pandemic. As per the survey, 91% of legislators agreed that the onset of Covid-19 completely halted development work in their constituencies, 89% of constituencies experienced “medium to high impact” of Covid-19, where health infrastructure was grossly inadequate, and there was lack of trained staff (in 54% constituencies), lack of oxygen (in 54%) and lack of ventilators (57%). As per the report, the under-served health sector has severely dented the state’s ability to respond to any health emergency, and Covid-19 has not only exposed faultlines but presented an opportunity to reflect and rearrange the state’s priorities. “We found that onset of Covid-19 and sudden announcement of lockdown brought everything to a grinding halt, businesses were shut, supply chain went cold and service providers across urban and rural areas had to suspend their operation(s),” says the report. 91% respondents agreed Covid-19 had halted development work in their constituencies, and only 9% said their constituencies had had a minor impact and that existing health infrastructure was adequate. During the lockdown, while there was a health crisis coupled with migration and unavailability of food, elected representatives across political parties were the first to extend help - from providing food to medicines, augmenting health services, facilitating movement of migrants and bringing back people stuck in different places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/most-maharashtra-mlas-say-health-infra-fell-very-short-survey/articleshow/83187165.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Police, on being informed, rushed to the spot and started investigation in this regard. No explosive material was however recovered from the spot. The incident took place at around 12.30 pm while artisan Vigan Kumar, hailing from Sheohar Kasturia in Bihar, was making an idol at the under-construction park in Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ashram in Indira Nagar locality, said inspector Kotwali Dinesh Chandra Mishra. He said after conducting preliminary investigation it appears that the blast had occurred due to wrong mixing of chemicals used for preparing idols. “Seven artisans were working with the victim, when the blast occurred. As per the artisans, as soon as the victim mixed chemicals, a powerful explosion occurred, leaving him dead on the spot,” the police further said. “The body of the deceased has been shifted to the mortuary for post-mortem examination. With the help of forensic experts, the cause of the blast is being ascertained. No explosive material was found from the spot”, the inspector said. Only idols and chemicals were found on the spot, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/22-year-old-artisan-killed-in-powerful-blast-in-unnao/articleshow/83184691.cms||---

This is the first Christian school that has been converted into a Covid safe home and oxygen support centre. Under the supervision of Bishop Paritosh Canning,head of the Kolkata Diocese of the Church of North India, which runs the 134-year-old institute, a formal tie-up was done with the two state hospitals, which were overstretched for space. Doctors of the two hospitals will start sending patients to the safe home from Thursday. The home has been equipped with beds and oxygen cylinders as well as concentrators, flow meters with humidifiers, pulse oximeters and medicines under the supervision of the two hospitals’ medical teams. A students’ body, Quarantined Student Youth Network, helped coordinate between the two hospitals and the school. The safe home was inaugurated by Bishop Canning. “We are happy to offer our premises to the two hospitals in their corona fight,” he said. The unit has been set up in the church block of the middle school. “The students are not coming back now. So, this portion of the school could be offered to set up the safe home,” said Sanchita Biswas, principal of the school. The doctors, nurses and all medical attendants will be posted by the two hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/st-pauls-mission-starts-safe-home/articleshow/83185257.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Goa||Fulfil Parrikar’s legacy, remove VAT on fuel: Cong urges govt||Panaji: Instead of reducing the financial burden on the common man, the state government continues to pile on the misery in the form of rising fuel and domestic LPG prices, the Congress party said here on Wednesday. Congress questioned BJP’s intentions behind allowing fuel prices to keep soaring beyond Rs 90 per litre in Goa and beyond Rs 100 per litre in other parts of the country. The party also reminded BJP that former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had promised to keep fuel prices in check by nearly abolishing VAT on fuel. “International prices have come down sharply. The barrel prices are down and if you calculate, based on the crude prices, petrol prices should be between Rs 40 to Rs 50 per litre,” opposition leader Digambar Kamat said . “It is injustice on people as BJP is taking people for granted. They are not passing the drop in international prices to the public.” “Parrikar had assured voters that fuel prices would not cross Rs 60 per litre in Goa. Now that they are in power they have forgotten all promises,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said. He said that instead of providing people with relief during the pandemic and increasing their spending capacity, the government is “taking away money from their pockets” by keeping VAT on fuel on the higher side. Youth Congress president Varad Mardolkar said that high fuel prices have a ripple effect and lead to inflationary pressure. “If chief minister Pramod Sawant really wants to carry forward Parrikar’s legacy, he should abolish VAT on fuel and bring down fuel prices to Rs 60 per litre,” Mardolkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fulfil-parrikars-legacy-remove-vat-on-fuel-cong-urges-govt/articleshow/83187154.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Recovered Rs 3 crore excess charges from private hospitals||HYDERABAD: Telangana public health and family welfare department director Dr G Srinivas Rao on Wednesday informed the Telangana high court that they had recovered Rs 3 crore from the private hospitals that overcharged patients during the first wave of Covid-19. Rao had been summoned before the court as the judges were unhappy with an earlier affidavit that lacked details. Asked about the ongoing second wave exploitation, the director said that he ensured a refund of Rs 10 lakh to an exploited patient who was made to pay Rs 17 lakh to a private hospital. The bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy also sought to know why the state failed to comply with an order of the court asking them to bring out a fresh order capping various charges in private hospitals. The bench asked him to respond to the queries of advocates Karam C Kommireddy, L Ravi Chander, and N S Arjun Kumar who informed the bench that the Andhra Pradesh government was launching criminal proceedings against promoters of errant private hospitals. This is apart from slapping penalty equivalent to ten times of the excess charges and appointing nodal officers to oversee the payment at private hospitals. Rao contended that there are more than 1,250 private hospitals in Telangana and it was not possible to appoint nodal officers to each of them. The bench advised him to appoint one nodal officer for all corporate hospitals and similarly one for other categories. Rao explained that they received 174 complaints against private hospitals. “We issued show-cause notices to 139 hospitals,” he said. “Most of the complaints were about excess charging. After studying explanations, we were not satisfied with the replies given by 22 hospitals and hence we terminated their licenses. They crossed all limits. Some of them had even obtained prior undertakings from the patients that they will not take legal action on the hospital charges levied on them.” Chief Justice Kohli made it clear that such undertakings do not carry weight before the courts. The bench wanted the state to bring out a fresh order on capping charges for tests, treatment, stay at private hospitals. “We asked you to do so. Your affidavit is silent on this,” the bench said while adjourning the case to June 10. “Come with a copy of the GO on that day. Otherwise, the state health secretary has to appear before us on that day to explain the reasons for the failure,” the bench said. The bench said it would be better if the health director threatens the private hospitals with the cancellation of licenses and ensure recovery of excess money from them rather than straight away cancelling their licenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-recovered-rs-3cr-excess-charges-from-pvt-hosps/articleshow/83188833.cms||---
---||Allahabad||113 villages of Prayagraj to have pitched roads under PWD’s pilot project||Prayagraj: Intending to connect villages of remote areas of the district, which do not have pitched bituminous all-weather roads for connecting these villages to the main roads, the Public Works Department (PWD) has taken up a pilot project. Under this project, 113 villages have been identified in different assembly segments of the district wherein these pitched roads would be constructed. Of these, pitched roads in 33 villages would be constructed by funding through National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) while for the rest 80 villages, the state government would be providing the funds. These key roads would connect villages with a total population of 250 or more. While the length of roads under the NABARD scheme has to be a minimum of 1 kilometre or more, in the case of roads constructed by state government funds, these roads could be less than 1 km in length. Chief engineer, PWD (Prayagraj), AK Agarwal said, “Work for connecting these 113 villages would be taken up on high priority. We have submitted the estimates for the 80 villages under the pilot project and as soon as the approval is received, the department would start the work”. The assembly wise distribution of the 33 villages, which would be benefited through NABARD and where pitched roads of the length of not less than 1km would be constructed, four villages are from Karchana, two from Koraon, one from Bara, nine from Handia, eight from Soraon, two from Phulpur and seven are from Pratappur assembly seat. The population of these 33 villages is not less than 250 per village. Likewise, 80 more villages would be provided with pothole-free pitched roads and the length of these roads could be less than 1km, informed the official. “We have identified 80 villages from various assembly seats of the district and have submitted the estimate for the same”, said Agarwal. These villages include seven from Koroan, one from Karchana, three from Phaphamau, two from Bara, eight from Handia, nine from Soroan, 16 from Phulpur and 34 from Pratappur. The project would especially benefit the smaller villages of the different assembly seats of trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna areas of the district which are either devoid of any approach road or if there exist an approach road, commuting is the main worry for the villagers, especially in the rainy season. With the all-weather pitched roads, these villages would have better connectivity with the nearby main road of the respective area, says the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/113-villages-of-prayagraj-to-have-pitched-roads-under-pwds-pilot-project/articleshow/83183841.cms||---

SP Bhadohi RB Singh said, “The explosion took place in the explosives used in manufacturing fireworks and crackers stored in one Akram’s house. The impact of the blast was such that the boundary wall of the house was partially damaged and glass windows of Chhoti Masjid shattered.” Akram suffered injuries in this blast, he said adding, investigation in this matter is being conducted to know whether he had a licence for running the firecracker unit or was manufacturing the same illegally. Any action will be taken after investigations are over. Reports said that on Wednesday morning, when the villagers were busy in their work a massive explosion took place. It led to chaos in the village.

---||Goa||Let NIO prepare coastal plan, demands fish workers’ forum||Panaji: Claiming that the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) and the Chennai-based National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) have “consistently failed” to prepare a proper coastal zone management plan (CZMP) for the state, the National Fish Workers’ Forum (NFF) on Wednesday demanded that the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) be tasked with preparing the plan instead. “The NFF has welcomed the order of the NGT’s principal bench, New Delhi, to re-conduct the public hearing that was earlier violated by the GCZMA citing Covid-19 protocols,” said the forum’s general secretary, Olencio Simoes. He further said three fishermen’s organisations — Akhil Goa Kshatriya Pagui Samaj, Canacona Taluka Fishermen Trawler/Mechanised Craft Owner Cooperative Society and Goenchea Raponkarancho Ekvott — had filed a petition with the help of the NGO, Goa Foundation, citing basic procedural flaws in conducting the public hearing that had allowed just 100 participants at both venues in North and South Goa. “The NCSCM should be dropped and the NIO or any other Goan institution of repute should be given the task in accordance with annexure-I of the CRZ Notification 2011, which has laid down clear guidelines for the preparation of the plan,” Simoes said. Simoes said that since the fishing community is a primary stakeholder and the CZMP has to ensure livelihood security to fishing communities and other local groups living in the coastal areas while also conserving and protecting coastal stretches, GCZMA should conduct public hearings at multiple locations at the taluka level and on different dates. “By doing so, representatives of as many as 173 village fishing communities can attend and submit their objections so that a proper CZMP is finalised,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/let-nio-prepare-coastal-plan-demands-fish-workers-forum/articleshow/83187172.cms||---

Police traced the victims’ parents through the mobile phones found near the well. So far the parents didn’t shed light on the reason behind the three taking the extreme step. “We suspect that there may have been a love triangle, but it is too early to say anything conclusively. We are waiting for the parents to give their statements,” said inspector AB Jadeja of University police station. Preliminary investigation revealed that Pami was married off at an early age but she was still living with her parents.

---||Hyderabad||Covid-19: Children hit hard, over 37,000 infected in Telangana||HYDERABAD: Telangana health authorities on Wednesday said that 37,332 children in the 0-19 age group were infected with the novel coronavirus between March and May this year, even as they brainstorm ways to stop the virus from spreading further among the younger lot. Armed with statistics of the first wave of 19,824 children affected with the virus between August 15 and November 15, 2020, officials said they are getting ready with more beds, equipment, and awareness drives. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar had a series of meetings with doctors and experts on possible third wave and increase of cases among children. Plans are being laid to make at least 5,000 beds available for children. Coronavirus: Live updates“There is also a thought process in the government that there will be more MIS-C cases (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome) among children, even from July,” a top official from the health department told TOI. More MIS-C cases among children below 10 are being seen now, with 9,858 cases reported during the second wave as against 6,250 cases in the first wave. When contacted, the director of medical education (DME) K Ramesh Reddy said they are confident of tackling the situation when it comes to below 10 years age group. “During the first wave we saw about 1,000 children with MIS-C getting admitted in the Gandhi Hospital but now there are only 500 such cases, none of them has been serious,” he said. But he added that MIS-C among kids is a concern, as there are always a fear of more cases surfacing in future. “We are gearing up to face more cases and Niloufer and Gandhi Hospital will be nodal centres with1,500 beds in Niloufer hospital alone,” Reddy said. According to Dr Subodh Kanthmuthan, director at the Centre for Healthcare Management in Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), the more number of cases during the second wave in children is a result of adults roaming the streets without taking enough precautions. “More than medical reasons, the curbs that were observed during the first wave and last year lockdown are missing this year, and adults are moving around and in turn infecting children at home,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kids-hit-hard-over-37k-infected-in-t/articleshow/83188888.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Goa||Shareholders question Zuari Agro’s plans to sell Goa plant||PANAJI: Zuari Agro Chemicals Limited’s (ZACL) plan to sell its fertiliser plant at Goa and its associated businesses to its sister concern Pardeep Phosphates Limited for a value of around Rs 2,052 crore appears to have run into headwinds. Minority shareholders of ZACL, a part of the Adventz Group, have indicated that the transfer could be challenged before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). According to a filing before the bourses, ZACL has stated that a group of shareholders holding 10.69% of shares have expressed concern over the transfer of the fertiliser plant and another business transfer agreement (BTA) that were approved by the firm’s board earlier this year in February and in March 2020 respectively. ZACL believes that any petition filed before the NCLAT is not tenable, said executive director Nitin Kantak. “The company has received a requisition under section 100(2) of the Companies Act, 2013 from a group of shareholders holding 10.69% of shares, requesting the board to call for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to discuss matters, including proceeding against the two BTAs,” said Kantak in a statement on behalf of ZACL. The EGM will be held on June 23 where shareholders will discuss and decide whether to proceed with the BTAs after considering the factors behind the decision regarding the sale. The meeting will enable shareholders to seek clarity on the financial aspects of the sale and interests of the shareholders. “The company (ZACL) has also been intimated by the same group of shareholders proposing to file a petition before the NCLAT. The company, based on the legal opinion obtained, believes that the petition, if filed, would not be tenable and does not have any impact on the BTAs,” said a ZACL official. ZACL has a BTA to transfer its fertiliser plant at Goa to Pardeep Phosphates Limited and another BTA dated March 31, 2020, to transfer assets and liabilities of its retail, speciality nutrients, crop protection, seeds and blended businesses to Zuari Farmhub Limited (ZFL) with effect from the same date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shareholders-question-zuari-agros-plans-to-sell-goa-plant/articleshow/83187161.cms||---

Being a medical professional, I felt it not right to sit at home and I really wanted to serve the society,” says Gowri, who is one among the young professionals who run the corporation’s medical team for Covid-19 management. “In the present scenario, it would be difficult for the Covid-positive patients remaining in home isolation to meet the doctors in hospitals. This initiative of the city corporation will be beneficial to meet the concerns of such patients. And for patients staying alone, apart from medical support, they require mental support too,” says Gowri. The emergency medical team which works 24 hours will visit the patients directly, in case of any emergency. Apart from these services they also help the elderly and those without smartphones in vaccination registration. “In different areas, we have rapid response teams that play a pivotal role in the functioning of this system. We are all set with ambulances with oxygen cylinders and bags with life-saving drugs to rush to the Covid patients. Even though some callers react in a harsh way, we understand that their reaction is an outcome of their fear and anxiety. We always remain patient with them. At the same time, it is glad to attend calls that express happiness and gratitude for our service,” said Thomas, one of the volunteers. For each of them, every day is a learning experience; be it attending night calls seeking help or reviving a patient whose oxygen levels had dipped dangerously. “Every day I feel utmost pride and satisfaction to work with the city corporation’s Covid control room. Though some patients panic and require psychological support, they are unwilling to use the psychological on-call facility arranged by the government. We want to bring our system functioning with almost eight doctors, nurses, junior health inspectors (JHIs), and volunteers from various fields to reach out to as many needy people as possible,’‘ says Dr Anand, another young professional who was previously employed in a private hospital. The control room is operated by the green army and other volunteers, and medical teams were constituted to check on the Covid-positive patients in home isolation. Anagha P hailing from Vithura, a JHI student of Public Health Training School, who is also a part of the team, said that her family was all support for her decision to volunteer for the team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/these-professionals-join-covid-fight-with-pride/articleshow/83185315.cms||---
---||India||India may get Pfizer's vaccine against Covid-19 in July||NEW DELHI: The government's decisions to ease regulatory norms for clearing foreign-made vaccines for use in India and an in-principle consensus on an indemnity waiver are intended to facilitate supply of Pfizer's vaccine against Covid-19, which officials hope can be made by July. The final agreement between the government and the American drug-maker on indemnity and procurement norms are still pending, though the two parties have arrived at an in-principle consensus, sources said. According to a source, the government may give a complete waiver to foreign-made vaccines that have been approved for restricted use by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, UK., Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, Japan, or which are mentioned in WHO Emergency Use Listing. While Pfizer has been insisting on supplying the vaccines through the Centre, the government is working out a mechanism whereby the Centre can negotiate a price with the company and states and UTs can procure the jabs directly from the company at the pre-fixed price, the source said. However, final signing of the agreement may still take a few days. Besides, despite the waivers and agreements, any company importing the vaccines will have to make a formal application, with documents of approval secured abroad, seeking emergency use authorisation from the drug regulator. “Once all the documents are submitted and a formal application is made, the approval can come in around 10 days but supplies will take time to arrive and depend on the existing bookings and available stockpile with the company,” a senior regulatory official said. “Pfizer shots are likely to arrive by July-August. We are trying to expedite the processes so that the vaccines which have shown promise globally are also available for citizens of our country. Discussions are going on as certain issues need clarity. We will hopefully arrive at a final agreement very soon. Decision will be taken keeping in view a larger public interest,” a senior official told TOI. Pfizer too said it is in talks with the government to make its Covid-19 vaccine available in India. “Pfizer continues to remain engaged with the Government of India towards making its Covid-19 vaccine available for use in the government immunisation programme in the country. As these discussions are ongoing, we are unable to share any additional details at this time,” a Pfizer spokesperson said. The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Tuesday waived the requirement of conducting bridging clinical trials and testing of every batch of vaccine by the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL), Kasauli, for foreign-made vaccines, if the batch/lot has been certified and released by the National Control Laboratory of the country of origin. Apart from Pfizer, Cipla too has been negotiating with the government seeking fast-track approvals to bring Moderna's single-dose Covid-19 booster vaccine to the country. Cipla has requested the government for indemnification and exemptions from price-capping, bridging trials and basic customs duty, while stating that it is close to committing over $1-billion as advance to the US major. The availability of imported vaccines is also crucial to ramp up the coverage of vaccination drive against Covid-19 in the country. The government has estimated around 20 crore of domestic production of anti-Covid jabs in July, whereas it is targeting to inoculate an average of 1 crore people every day from mid-July or August onwards. To meet this target, it would need close to 10 crore more doses.

---||Allahabad||Akhara Parishad to spread awareness on river pollution||Prayagraj: In the backdrop of the fact that several burials were found along river Ganga during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and images of dead or half-burnt bodies floating in the river Ganga making national headlines, seers associated with the Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) have decided to make people aware about the importance of protecting and refraining from practices that harm the water quality of rivers. The high count of bodies found buried along the banks of river Ganga in Prayagraj also raised questions about the final rites being denied to the dead who had been buried. The seers would travel across the length and breadth of the country, preaching to rural folk as well as poorly educated residents of cities located on the banks of prominent rivers of the country against burying their dead along the riverbanks. They would motivate them to instead go for cremations using eco-friendly electric crematoriums. “We want to involve around 2.5 lakh seers who are members of the 13 akhara’s that forms ABAP and are spread across different parts of the country in this nationwide mission which would protect not only river Ganga but all the sacred rivers of the nation from pollution, especially in light of the recent incidences wherein dead bodies were found floating in the rivers or the same was buried beside the banks of the river”, said ABAP’s president Narendra Giri. ABAP aims to bring down the burials by one third within a year and further cut it down to half in another six months. ABAP plans to rope in seers and local religious leaders, who are revered and respected by locals, and these seers would preach and convince locals residing in cities and villages located along the rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Narmada and Kaveri among others to cremate their dead using electric crematoriums. This would not only protect these rivers but also save countless trees that are chopped to provide wood for traditional wooden pyre cremations, Giri explained. Likewise, general secretary of ABAP, Mahant Hari Giri, who is also chief patron of the Shri Panchdashnaam Juna Akhada, says, “Burying the dead on sandy riverbanks should be stopped as this results in polluting our scared rivers as when the sand gets displaced with time due to water current or strong winds, these bodies could get exposed or get drifted in the river”. He further suggested that even as saints strive to convince people to stop burying dead bodies on the riverbanks, efforts need to be also made to provide some land near villages etc. to enable Hindus to bury their dead bodies as this too would help curtail people from using riverbanks for this purpose. “The practice of burying dead bodies on riverbanks is an old tradition among many communities and sects of Hindus of some regions across the country. Also, death owing to some specific reasons like snakebites or certain skin ailments besides dead bodies of children prompt many to follow this practice as per their own beliefs. However, the threat of pollution due to these burials on riverbanks that rivers like the Ganga and Yamuna face cannot be denied,” said ABAP president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/akhara-parishad-to-spread-awareness-on-river-pollution/articleshow/83183834.cms||---

Lalpura claimed: "It is unfortunate how the SAD has used the august religious body to project a dummy social service, while the truth is that it is the humble sangat that has risen to the occasion in humanity’s hour of need." The BJP spokesperson also accused Punjab’s Congress government of robbing the sanitation workers of their remuneration. He said that the contractors had not paid these workers their exact dues, while the state government had refused to address this "loot".

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has funded the 1,200-seat ICC, which has been built in the shape of a Shivlinga. “The Rudraksh ICC was formally taken over from CPWD on May 31. Modalities to run it has also been finalised and a private company, Indian Sanitization Ward Boy and Horticulture Contractor (ISWHC), has been selected for its operations and maintenance for 10 years through tender process,” divisional commissioner and chairman of SCVL Deepak Agrawal told TO on Wednesday. After the foundation stone of Rudraksh was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on July 14, 2018, the Japanese company engaged by JICA had started work on this project, which was conceptualised as a symbol of Modi’s friendship with then Japanese premier Shinzo Abe. The project was part of the Kashi-Kyoto partnership agreement aimed at conserving the city’s ancient heritage and was signed by Modi and Abe in Kyoto in August 2014. The work on ground formally started in 2015 and it was made functional in May 2021. Regarding specialities of Rudraksh, municipal commissioner and SCVL chief executive officer Gaurang Rathi said, “The ICC has been developed to provide a platform for showcasing the spiritual and cultural heritage, music gharanas and many other forms of arts of Varanasi by establishing a confluence with modernity.” Built in the shape of Shivalinga, this unique ICC showcases the confluence of both Japanese and Indian architecture. A total of 108 symbolic Rudraksh have been installed on the external facade of the Rudraksh Convention Centre, which are made of aluminium. Spread over three acres, this convention centre is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, he said. “With a seating capacity of 1,200 people in the main hall, which can be divided into two parts according to the number of people, this fully air-conditioned ICC is equipped with modern building management systems through which all management can be closely controlled,” said Rathi. He added, “In addition to the large hall, a meeting hall with a capacity of 150 people has also been created, which could also be conveniently divided into two parts. Apart from this, a VIP room, four green rooms have been constructed here. Requirements for people with disabilities and all the criteria like ramps, wheelchairs have also been fulfilled.” “Rudraksh also has Japanese-style garden and landscaping,” said Rathi adding, “a parking facility for 120 vehicles has also been arranged in the basement. Entire campus is under CCTV surveillance. Along with conventional electricity, solar power has also been arranged to meet power supply requirements.” To mark the process of taking over Rudraksh from CPWD by SCVL a small function was organised at the commissioner’s auditorium in Varanasi on May 31, in which the transfer documents were signed. The details of drawings, floor plan, equipment installed, statutory approvals, door keys and other articles concerned were assigned to Varanasi Smart City by CPWD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/private-firm-gets-rights-to-run-rudraksh-for-10-years/articleshow/83184680.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Through VLTD, real-time arrival data can be determined. The tender was awarded to Accord Software Systems Pvt Ltd and the contractor has been given six months’ to set up service centres across the state to undertake the fitment process. “The work order has been given and only procedures like bank guarantee and security are being completed. The vendors are readying the service centres. Bus operators can go to the service centres to get them fitted with the VLTD, once the service centres are ready,” director of transport Rajan Satardekar said. Private buses as well as those operated under the Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC) will be eligible for installation. However, the new KTC electric buses will be exempted from having to install the device since they are pre-installed with technology similar to the VLTD. This will be for the first time that buses in the state will be monitored from a control centre with the help of data integration. The transport department is in talks with the Goa Electronic Ltd (GEL) to carry out the process of 24×7 monitoring and tracking of the vehicles.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||This LP school records over 230 new admissions||Thiruvananthapuram: After getting a record number of admissions for the academic year 2021-22, the teachers of Vellanad Government LPS are on cloud nine. Of the 233 new admissions, 153 were for Class I to Class IV and 80 for the pre-primary section. With this, the school now has a total strength of 528 students. The teachers said that 90% of the new admissions to Classes II, III and IV were from unaided schools. Success is not something new to this school. In the last academic year the school had bagged the award for the best PTA –– first position in the district and fifth in the state. The school’s headmaster V Nageshkumar, a former student himself, is indeed proud of this achievement. “Our school had often tried to balance academics and co-curricular activities. The support we get from the PTA is immense. The teachers and PTA worked together during the pandemic period. We also provided smartphones to deserving children with the support of local residents and the PTA. The teachers took extra efforts to explain the lessons and also gave revision materials to the students via WhatsApp,” he said. “We ensured that all normal school activities were conducted via online without fail. This academic year too, we plan to focus on academics by developing and nurturing the varied skills of the students. We would also like to give importance to their health,” said Nageshkumar. S Krishnakumar, panchayat ward member, said the school had incorporated various online recreational activities along with academics last year. The fact that many of the teachers and parents had been former students of the school also helped. “As the pandemic prevailed, our concern was not confined to students alone. We extended our care and support to their families too. During the first lockdown, even before the government started distributing food kits, we managed to distribute nearly 100 food kits to the students’ families. We are also proud that earlier, we were able to construct a house for one of our students. Last academic year we conducted an online arts festival for students and parents. We believe that the present demand for admissions is a result of all these efforts,” said PTA president Aneesh V N, a former student. “Being a parent I am happy that my son’s school is achieving great heights. I have enrolled my younger daughter too here. As former students, we parents are also emotionally attached to the school,” said Neethumol, a parent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/this-lp-school-records-over-230-new-admissions/articleshow/83185391.cms||---

Prima facie, cops said the victim, Puja Gayen, might have ended her life around 11.45pm on Tuesday. The viscera of the victim has been preserved as cops suspect that Gayen might have consumed sleeping pills to kill herself. Two of her close friends were at her residence when she died. They had a house party where they drank beer. There had been an argument over some issue, following which Gayen abruptly went to her bedroom and locked the door after driving her friends out. When she did not respond to their calls and repeated knocks, the duo was scared and called a neighbour. They broke open the door and found her hanging from the ceiling fan. The Netaji Nagar police were informed about the incident around 2am on Wednesday. Gayen was taken to Baghajatin state hospital where she was declared brought dead. “Enquiry revealed that on Tuesday, around 5.05 pm. Gayen had called up one of her friends — Jina Sarkar — to come to her flat. When Jina arrived, she found one of their common friends was already present there. The three had their food together. They kept chatting till 11.20pm. “Around this time, as Jina claimed, Gayen and the other girl had a fight over some issue. Both the women used abusive language. At this point, Gayen consumed some sleeping pills and lay down on her bed. The third friend splashed water on her face. An enraged Gayen asked both her friends to leave. Gayen went to her bedroom and locked the door from inside,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. “We heard a loud banging from the flat. The women knocked on our door and sought help. We told them we are unwell. We gave them a hammer, hoping they might break the door,” said a neighbour who resides on the same floor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/designer-found-hanging-in-s-kol-flat/articleshow/83185354.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

An artist herself, Zehra is the daughter of Himayat Ali Mirza, grandson of Moazzam Jah, the second son of the last ruler of princely Hyderabad state. Proceeds from the sale of her paintings have been distributed to various hospitals and charitable organisations that are working for the poor and Covid-19 patients during these hard days. So far, around Rs 4 lakh have been donated. She is the great granddaughter of princess Niloufer, whose charity led to the formation of Telangana's biggest government hospital for children and pregnant women - Niloufer Hospital in Hyderabad. Zehra is also an upcoming businesswoman and fashion designer. She has been working for the welfare of cancer patients and since the pandemic began, she is focussing on Covid-19 patients and people affected by lockdown. She said she will now channelize her charity through the proposed prince Moazzam Jah charity organization. “As an artist I have always seen beauty in life and am deeply rooted in charity, but the pandemic has created awareness that help is always needed, now more than ever. There are people with not the same kind of resources, suffering from Covid-19 and other ailments. It is my duty to help them in any way or form I can, be it distributing food or donating funds,” Zehra told TOI. Zehra is the founder of The Zehra Mirza gallery.

Just because it has been declared an urban area it does not mean it will be converted into a municipality,” he said while talking to reporters recently. “The locale is highly populated and business area where a lot of locals are self-employed. As an urban area, people in Calangute stand to gain a lot of benefits,” Lobo said. The state government had recently notified Calangute as an urban area for the purpose of the Goa Land Revenue Code. “In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (38) of section 2 of the Goa Land Revenue Code 1968 (Act No 9 of 1969), the government of Goa hereby notifies the village of Calangute as an urban area for the purpose of the said code,” the notification issued by the undersecretary, revenue, on May 27, stated. “Calangute was declared an urban census area 15 years ago because of its large population.

---||Goa||Qatar edge past 10-man India||Panaji: It’s hard defending against Qatar. The Asian champions scored 16 goals in their first six matches of the Fifa World Cup 2022 qualifiers, failing to find the target only in the goalless draw against India. When the two teams faced off again at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on Thursday, India braced for another tough night. The task only got tougher when Rahul Bheke picked up his second booking and was sent off in the 17th minute. For the remainder of the match, India tried to defend, bravely, with numbers at the back. Their efforts, though, were not enough as Qatar got the better of India 1-0 to open a seven-point gap at the top in group E. Qatar were dominant from start to finish and had 35 shots throughout the game. Gurpreet Singh Sandhu was terrific for the visitors, making countless saves, many from close range. The goalkeeper was beaten just once in the 33rd minute when Abdulaziz Halem found the back of the net from inside a crowded goalmouth. India didn’t have much to show, offensively. Coach Igor Stimac, understandably, started with five at the back and it was only Manvir Singh who had a look at the rival goal at the half an hour mark. The ATK Mohun Bagan striker, however, was dispossessed by Boulem Khoukhi inside the danger zone, before he could give the finishing touches to a cross from Ashique Kuruniyan. For the rest of the match, India were pinned inside their own half. With Rowllin Borges ruled out, Stimac handed Glan Martins his international debut. Alongside Suresh Singh, the FC Goa midfielder helped add muscle in the middle, trying to disrupt Qatar moves. Qatar were expected to dominate this game and they did exactly that. The likes of Abdulaziz Hatem, Abdelkarim Hassan and Hasan Al-Haydos were a constant threat. But whenever they drew close to the rival goal, the defence led by Sandesh Jhingan created a wall. With Bheke picking up his second booking – first for a foul and then a handball – India were left with a mountain to climb. Qatar’s only goal came just after the half an hour mark. It was initiated by Abdelkarim on the left whose ball inside the box was pushed towards Abdulaziz by Muntari. The forward was crowded by a clutch of defenders but still managed to push it inside the goal. The defeat leaves India without a win in six World Cup qualifiers and 11 games since the 1-0 defeat of Thailand in the King’s Cup. They are fourth with three points, behind Qatar (19 points), Oman (12) and Afghanistan (5). India now need to win their remaining games against lower-ranked Bangladesh (June 7) and Afghanistan (June 15) to finish third and secure a spot in the third round of the Asian Cup 2023 qualifiers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/qatar-edge-past-10-man-india/articleshow/83217171.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Orally observing that the patients are dying in the state due to this disease and some are losing out vital organs like eyes, the bench said the current situation demands war-like response, but it was found wanting. “Unless immediate steps are taken, the situation is not going to improve. We urge both governments to initiate immediate measures to increase production capacity of the Indian companies manufacturing ‘Amphotericin B Lipid complex’. Whatever help is needed must be made available by both authorities. The entire machinery can be pressed into service to augment the production, if required,” a division bench comprising Justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said before adjourning the hearing of a suo motu PIL till next Wednesday. Explaining concern over the growing number of black fungus patients in the city, the judges said there were 1,584 registered patients till May 29, of which 830 were operated upon so far. “Of them, eyeballs of 74 were removed to stop the infection from spreading, while 69 have succumbed to the disease.

According to Jamnagar police, 59-year-old resident of Snehdeep Apartment on Palace Road in Jamnagar, Manoj Shah lodged a complaint of cheating against nine persons and a few firms, which the police believe are bogus firms. Shah named Tracy Murphy, David Hillary, Sophia Kennedy, owners of MB Sharma enterprise, HM Enterprise, Wireless enterprise, Shiva enterprise, as well as Mungesh Yadav, Kunal Verma, Azhar Karim, Navin Sanker Sharma, Janak Patel and Kambel Yadav as accused. In his complaint, Shah said that he got attracted by a WhatsApp message sent to him by Tracy Murphy asking if he would be interested in doing business in chemical ingredients used in the making of antiviral vaccines for animals. Murphy allegedly promised high profits if Shah supplied raw materials which was to be bought from Mumbai and supplied to them in Delhi. She said that their company is based in London. “First she told me that I need to purchase one chemical which is priced at $3,499 per litre from a Mumbai-based firm and then supply it to Delhi for a laboratory test. If it passed the test, she would give me bulk order,” Shah told the police. As per instructions, Shah purchased the chemicals and personally collected it from Jamnagar, and later, he was given a 100 litre supply order, police said. Believing it to be his jackpot, Shah transferred 50 percent amount of the $7,500 per litre that Murphy had told him to pay on purchase of 100 litre chemicals. One Vin Sharma, who claimed to be the owner of the firm based in Mumbai, told Shah that a truck had left with the chemicals for Jamnagar. “But the next day, Shah received a call from the truck driver who informed him that RTO officials had seized his truck and that he needed Rs 10 lakh immediately to release it. Shah again transferred Rs 1.33 lakh, but he did not get the raw materials. Then he started suspecting of being duped and personally went to Mumbai to pocate the firms in the given addresses and found that no such firm existed in all the addresses. He realised that he was cheated by unknown persons,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-cheat-jamnagar-businessman-of-over-rs-1-crore/articleshow/83185400.cms||---

But the early morning timing wasn’t suitable to traders who said their customers come in the afternoon. Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal president Subhash Goyal said the morning timings will hamper sales. “Most of the wholesale shops including big showroom of clothes remained shut because their staff wasn’t able to reach so early. Some of their staff members live 20km away. It would have been better if the timings can be changed from 11am to 5pm,” said Goyal.Some shops selling coolers and other electronic items did see some rush due to the summer season. Traders had met the collector on Tuesday to request him to change of timing. Collector Antar Singh Nehra had said that changing the timings was a decision that had to be taken by the government. In Raja Park, most of the shops opened, but hardly saw any sales. Some street chat stalls operating in a corner of a road saw some customers. Most shopkeepers didn’t open because of guidelines confusion. Bittu Jain, who runs a clock shop in Raja Park said, “I was a bit worried of the guidelines. I just wanted to observe for a day to undersyand the situation. From Thursday, I am planning to open my shop.”Ravi Naiyyar, president of Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh, said there was a need to change the timing if the government was really interested in helping the traders. “Businesses are in loses due to the ongoing pandemic. If government wants, shops can open after 11 am when vegetable and grocery shops are closed. Our customers can come to the market conveniently and it will be our responsibility not to let the shops get crowded,” said Naiyyar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shops-open-after-a-month-big-stores-remain-shut/articleshow/83187311.cms||---

The notices issued to both the sadhus — Swami and Ghanshyamdas Swami — were served personally at a temple near Mansa in North Gujarat on Tuesday night by Gadhada police. With this, the duo has been barred from entering into Ahmedabad, Surendranagar, Botad, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Amreli districts.Earlier in March this year, Botad district collectorate had issued a show-cause notice to SP Swami asking him to explain why he should not be externed from the six districts. The notice had been issued amid the ongoing rift between two groups of Vadtal division of Swaminarayan sect, Acharya Paksh and Dev Paksh. SP Swami belongs to Acharya Paksh. The bitter rivalry has been going on between the two groups to take control of various temples of the Swaminarayan sect and had also often turned bloody in the past. Acharya Paksh had been managing the Gopinathji temple in Gadhada town but during the elections held in 2019, it lost to Dev Paksha and now Dev Paksh is managing the temple affairs. Police said that more than seven criminal cases have been lodged against S P Swami in the past 10 years including criminal intimidation. Earlier in October, 2018, SP Swami courted controversy by kicking an old man during a meeting in the temple. In the Swaminarayan sect of Vadtal division, Acharya Paksha members follow Ajendraprasad Maharaj while those of Dev Paksha are inspired by Rakesh Prasad Maharaj. According to the legend, Gadhada temple is an important pilgrimage spot for followers of the sect as it was this small town in Gadhada where Lord Swaminarayan lived for 28 years and breathed his last.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/controversial-sadhu-sp-swami-aide-externed-from-six-districts/articleshow/83185445.cms||---

Few employees were called to the RBSE office to take care of the records of students enrolled in class X and XII. The RBSE has not yet ordered cancellation or to conduct the board examination. An official said the decision is with the state government. More than 21 lakh students are registered for different board exams. The board also has to prepare for the REET examination which is scheduled on June 20. The CBSE already cancelled both class X and XII examinations. Similarly, the RPSC also opened as the commission had left the interviews of RAS-2018 in lurch because of the Covid. Few other government offices also opened but with limited number of employees. There was heavy rush seen in markets, mostly in vegetable outlets and grocery shops. Ever since the lockdown was imposed, most of the markets remained closed.Police were on their toes to control crowds at the markets and imposed challans on people violating social distancing and those not wearing masks. But most of the markets like Naya bazaar, Madar Gate, Purani Mandi, Ramganj were isolated and people were seen more near grocery and vegetable shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/edu-board-rpsc-offices-open-after-45-days/articleshow/83187330.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mahalaxmi jumbo centre plan on hold as cases dip||MUMBAI: With Covid-19 cases dropping drastically in the city and the number of beds vacant increasing, the BMC has put on hold its plan to build a new jumbo Covid centre at Mahalaxmi Race Course. While the BMC had floated tenders for the jumbo centre, it looked for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds for the project too. However, corporates found the centre too expensive. After dismantling the 900-bed jumbo Covid centre at Mahalaxmi Race Course without admitting even a single patient at the centre, the BMC was going to build a brand new one at the same location. While the earlier centre was built using CSR funds, the BMC had planned to spend around Rs 45 crore on the new centre for 200 ICU beds, 250 oxygen beds and a triage area. Three companies had offered to build the centre and had participated in the tenders. But officials said there was cost escalation during the bids. “The plan has not been dropped but just kept on hold for sometime. Also, since the costing is high, it can’t be done under CSR,” said Sanjeev Jaiswal, additional municipal commissioner (City). The BMC has been facing flak from the opposition for poor planning and having to spend Rs 45 crore for a new centre at the same location that it dismantled just six months ago. The Mahalaxmi Covid facility built by the Naman Group was handed over to the BMC in July 2020, but the centre remained unutilised. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said shutting down the centre was a waste of public money. “Even if it is CSR funds, it was money meant for the public. This shows lack of planning and poor coordination by the BMC. By the time the new centre is ready, it may not be needed again,” Mishra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mahalaxmi-jumbo-centre-plan-on-hold-as-cases-dip/articleshow/83187332.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: ‘Low infection rate and no deaths among fully vaccinated HCWs’||GURUGRAM: Four hospitals in the city saw a low infection rate and no deaths among fully vaccinated health care workers in a two-month period from March to May that coincided with the ferocious second wave of Covid that ravaged Delhi-NCR, according to data they have shared with TOI. Collectively, the data covers 9,383 health care workers. In all four hospitals – Medanta, Park, Narayana and the state-run Civil Hospital – the share of fully vaccinated healthcare workers with ‘breakthrough’ Covid infections despite the immunity shield was in the 6-7% range. Most of them were asymptomatic or had “mild to moderate” symptoms and very few needed ICU care, hospital officials said. The hospitals began looking at infections after 14 days of the second dose. At Medanta, the data is for the period between March 27 and May 21, at Civil from March 23 to May 19, at Park from March 26 to May 23 and at Narayana from March 28 to May 18. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram, said, “No deaths among health care workers were reported after full vaccination. If a person is infected with Covid after 14 days have passed since the second dose of vaccine, it is termed a ‘breakthrough’ infection. In such cases, mortality is negligible. Thus, vaccination is important for all to curb the spread of the infection.” Medanta’s data shows out of its 4,000 fully vaccinated health care workers, 250 were infected. Of them, eight had moderate symptoms and two had to be admitted in ICU. “Most of our health care workers had mild symptoms and recovered soon. This shows that vaccination provides protection against Covid,” said Dr Sushila Katariya, director and head of internal medicine at Medanta. Civil Hospital saw ‘breakthrough’ infections in 89 of its healthcare workers, among the 1,425 in inoculated. Three of them got a severe infection and had to be hospitalised. Fifteen had moderate symptoms. “90% were asymptomatic. Symptoms of infected healthcare workers were sore throat, body ache, muscle pain and gastrointestinal pain,” said CMO Yadav. At the Park group of hospitals, out of the 3,500 health care staff they fully vaccinated, 206 tested positive but none needed to be hospitalised, officials said. Park CEO Dr PN Kakar said, “Vaccines were never labelled as 100% successful. Health care workers went ahead with it as a moral responsibility and duty. End of the day, they all benefited as, though-post vaccination several doctors got infected and some even lost their lives, (those were) not in our hospital but other places.” At Narayana, 458 healthcare workers had completed both doses and 34 of them got infected. Dr Swadesh Kumar, consultant and head of emergency and medical services at the hospital, told TOI, “Health care workers are committed to their service 24 hours even in these unprecedented times. On our hospital premises, the total number of healthcare workers is 597, of whom 458 are fully vaccinated. Although 34 health care workers got Covid while treating patients, they came back to their jobs after recovery. Around 15-20% got post-vaccination symptoms after the first dose, and only 2-3% got symptoms after the second dose. No deaths were recorded. Vaccination is necessary in the fight against this pandemic.” Among private hospitals, Max Healthcare had last month released data on infections among its employees after both vaccine doses. The infection rate was similar. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare, said, “Since the vaccination drive commenced on January 16 for healthcare workers, close to 14,000 employees across our network hospitals received both doses. Of this set, 6% got the Covid infection and 90% of those infected were mild cases. Only 10% required hospitalisation. All of them recovered well except one elderly clinician who was admitted in ICU but unfortunately succumbed to the disease. This proves that the vaccine is effective and significantly reduces infection rates as well as severity of the disease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/low-infection-rate-and-no-deaths-among-fully-vaccinated-hcws/articleshow/83191313.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Focus shifts from home isolation to medical monitoring of cases||COIMBATORE: The district recorded 3,061 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 1,76,910. It is an 8% decrease compared to the 3,332 cases recorded the previous day. In further evidence of the curve declining, for the first time since March, the number of people discharged 4,488 was higher than the number of people getting admitted. The number of active cases also dipped below 40,000, to 39,112 the first drop after the second wave began. However, the number of deaths due to the virus remained high at 38, taking the toll to 1,345. The deaths included a 39-year-old man, who died 12 days after hospitalization in Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and a 39-year-old woman, who died four days after being admitted in CMCH. A 40-year-old diabetic man died within 24 hours of admission in CMCH. In a sign of more facilities being added, on Wednesday, 255 oxygen beds and two ICU beds were available in hospitals across the district. There were 926 ordinary beds available. The public health department is taking an aggressive approach to control the spread of the virus. Officials said that on Wednesday, they refused home isolation as an option to 80% of the fresh positive cases. “We have decided to refuse home isolation, to control spread to neighbours and their own family members. Also, the home isolation criteria is blurred now, because people in their 20s and 30s, without co-morbidities, are also succumbing,” said an official. “We want all new cases to be medically monitored for five days at least.” Since the district will need a lot more beds to accommodate 80% of the 3,000-odd cases for the next few days, officials have decided to activate Covid care centres that were ready but unused until now, like the one in the Sulur Government School. The district has 1,524 beds vacant in Covid care centres now. The district administration has decided to update details of fresh positive cases every hour so that medical officers, village administrative officers and sanitary officers would get to know new cases in their area and take action. “We would contact every positive case and assign them to a centre, so they don’t have to hunt for hospitals,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/focus-shifts-from-home-isolation-to-medical-monitoring-of-cases/articleshow/83185442.cms||---

During the Nawaz-E-Janaza, I made a video of the family appealing to the crowd to not to attend the procession. I had left the funeral in between. I am wondering how police can accuse me of drawing crowd for the funeral,” Khan said.He alleged that police did nothing from morning till 5pm and allowed people to join the procession from different areas. “The procession started on a small scale and swelled only after people started joining in as it was proceeding towards the final resting place,” said Khan. Throughout the day, Khan held meetings with councillors of JMC, Heritage who extended him full support in putting pressure on the state to tread carefully.Later in the day, these councillors held a meeting with Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas demanding that the charges be dropped against Khan. “Congress can go to any extent to appease one particular community. It was shameful to see that even police, which was supposed to stop the procession, was providing cover to the assembly,” said Satish Poonia, state president, BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/funeral-case-cong-mla-blames-cops-of-false-charges/articleshow/83187341.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Unemployment rate at 27.6% in May due to demand squeeze, says CMIE||Jaipur: Mirroring the reluctance of companies to hire in the face of demand squeeze, unemployment rate in Rajasthan remained high at 27.6% in May, slightly down from 28% in April this year, as per the CMIE data. Staffing agencies in the state said that recruitments are not going to increase anytime soon as companies are already sitting on large stocks, while malls and markets are yet to reopen. “We expect hiring to pick up couple of months before the festival season starts. Unlike last year, the companies are operational now and there is some stock to meet the demand which is very small now,” said N K Jain, president of Employers Association of Rajasthan.Gupta said while IT sector recruitments continue to happen, the initial overall demand for hiring is going to come from component manufacturers.“By the time the demand returns, the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) need to have their components ready. That’s why the component manufacturers will be the first ones to start hiring,” added Jain. In the last couple of months, the hiring in the manufacturing sector came to halt completely. Even the companies which have offered appointment letters have abruptly stopped taking in people.Alka Batra, CEO of Capacita Connect, another staffing firm in the state, said, “There was some recruitment happening for job roles that required work from home. These companies included IT, banks, insurance firms, etc. But the industrial sector saw almost no recruitments.” She said recruitments by the local companies were almost non-existent and the current month is not going to see an uptick. “The white goods sector used to absorb a lot of people during the summer months because of demand in ACs, refrigerators, coolers, etc. But we lost the opportunities due to the pandemic. We expect hiring scene to start seeing improvements from July incrementally,” added Batra. In May, Rajasthan had the fourth highest unemployment rate after Delhi (45.6%), Haryana (29.1%), and Tamil Nadu at (28%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/unemployment-rate-at-27-6-in-may-due-to-demand-squeeze-says-cmie/articleshow/83187367.cms||---

Police recovered 22 bikes from the suspects after they were first arrested on May 24. With the recovery of more bikes from the duo, the total count of motorcycles has gone up to 34. Senior inspector Sambhaji Pawar said, “Of all the recovered vehicles, we have managed to identify ownership of 26, including 20 from our police station and six from Begumpura police station. Efforts are on to ascertain ownership of other vehicles.” The suspects have been identified as Gauskhan Pathan and Nawabkhan Pathan of Godi, Bhokardan. They were arrested after multiple police teams were deployed in different bike-theft prone areas of the city. It was after keeping a watch for 23 days, the suspects were nabbed, resulting into detection of series of bike theft offences. The probe has revealed that the suspects would steal the motorcycles from Aurangabad city and rural areas apart from neighbouring districts before selling them out to gullible farmers by forging number plates and chassis numbers. They would assure their customers of providing documents in a few days, but would never return said police. Inspector Pawar said that the recovery of large number of vehicles has caught attention of police units from different parts of the state and they have expressed interest in taking these accused in custody to check their role in bike thefts committed in other districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/12-more-bikes-recovered-from-2-held-in-theft-case/articleshow/83181490.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Court: Use BMC’s Covid model in nearby places in Mumbai||Mumbai: Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday said Mumbai’s successful pattern of handling Covid19 cases has to be followed by municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The observation was made by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, hearing a clutch of PILs on Covid-19 management. They were told by advocate-general (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that “figures are going down drastically overall.” The HC had previously noted that efforts of the BMC commissioner to tackle Covid-19 have also been appreciated by the Supreme Court and the Mumbai model must be replicated in all other districts of Maharashtra. The BMC had said the state government should facilitate a meeting of civic body heads. “We intervened and got it done on May 31,’’ the AG informed. The judges then said the Mumbai model is more relevant for corporations in its immediate proximity, like Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayander, Kalyan-Dombivli and Ulhasnagar. “…For these corporations, the Bombay (sic) pattern must be immediately followed,’’ Justice Kulkarni said. The judges said it is not that citizens of those places are differently placed from Mumbai . “It ought to be done so that we get results like Bombay (sic). If this was to be done earlier, we would get better results,’’ Justice Kulkarni said, adding “it’s better late than never”. Quizzed about the shortage of Amphotericin-B injection for black fungus cases, additional solicitor general Anil Singh said the state has decided to manufacture it in-house at Haffkine, with a 20-day cycle of production. He said that in the first batch, some 40,000 vials will be available by June 10. He said that Amphotericin-B will also be produced at a facility in Hyderabad. To the judge’s query on whether the supply of Remdesivir injection and oxygen was sufficient, Singh said there is no issue regarding the same. “Central government has taken a decision not to control Remdesivir distribution because cases have reduced and there is sufficient availability,” he informed. The judges said the State must see to it that no patient is harassed or inconvenienced to procure medicines. The judges, in their order, said it appears that there have been significant improvements in the recent past so much so that supply of liquid medical oxygen and Remdesivir, being the immediate concerns raised in the previous hearings, can be put aside for the time being, “and the focus shifted to deal with newer diseases like mucormycosis and aspergillosis as well as the measures taken/ proposed to be taken by the respondents to contain the third wave which, as per the opinion of experts, is likely to affect the younger generation in particular”. They will hear the parties on these aspects on June 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-use-bmcs-covid-model-in-nearby-places-in-mumbai/articleshow/83187416.cms||Rosy Sequeira

According to the FIR, the burglary took place at house of ACP H division Prakash Prajapati. The house in the Vastrapur Sarkari Vasahat was locked as he was on duty and his wife was on pilgrimage to the Lord Dwarkadhish temple. Prajapati’s wife, Lata, a teacher with a primary school at Sadarav village in Aravalli district, stated in the FIR that she had gone to the Dwarkadhish temple on May 31. “At around 10.30pm on June 1, my husband called me and informed that some unknown person had broken into our house, ransacked it and stolen jewellery. As he was unaware of the value of the jewellery, he asked me the value. I told him I would be able to say only once I came home,” she said in the FIR. She rushed home on Wednesday and found that jewellery, a set of silver glasses and cash worth a total of Rs 13.90 lakh was missing from their house. She said in the FIR that Prakash had locked the house at around 11am on Tuesday and gone to work. He returned at around 10.30pm and found that the house had been burgled. Vastrapur police registered a complaint of burglary and criminal trespass and began an investigation.

---||Coimbatore||Don’t ignore flu-like symptoms, doctors tell expectant moms||COIMBATORE: In the backdrop of the death of a 24-year-old pregnant woman due to Covid-19 in the city on Sunday, gynaecologists say pregnant women must not ignore initial flu-like symptoms. They say even mild symptoms of sore throat, cold, fever and body pain must be assumed as Covid-19 unless proven otherwise with a RT-PCR test. Doctors say that while 99% of the patients escape with mild symptoms, 1% of them end up suffering a cytokine storm with 40% lung involvement and requiring oxygen, and sometimes even succumbing to the virus. Unlike the first wave when pregnant women remained asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, not requiring steroids or anti-virals, this wave is different, say gynaecologists. “We see women with mild, moderate and severe symptoms, becoming very sick and even dying,” the professor and head of obstetrics and gynaecology department at PSG Hospital Dr Latha Maheshwari said. Three pregnant women have died in the hospital due to the virus so far. “At least 20% of pregnant women admitted in our hospital are requiring oxygen by day six or seven, even if they seek medical care early. Even steroids don’t seem to be effective enough,” she added. The one pattern they seem to be noticing is that women are more susceptible between their fifth and eighth month of pregnancy. “They are at risk like any other young patient. Co-morbidities like diabetes, obesity and hypertension were also seen in patients who succumbed,” she said. Head of the gynaecology department at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital Dr Manonmani said in May, 385 pregnant women who tested positive for the virus were admitted to the GH. Around 80 of them are currently under treatment at the hospital. “Of this, nine women are on oxygen support,” she said. “They all have a lung involvement of 30% to 40% and are being given steroids and remdesivir if required,” she added. The 24-year-old woman who died on Sunday was eight-month pregnant and had 40% lung involvement and oxygen saturation of 80%. She was a resident of Udumalpet. Doctors said she was referred from another hospital. The family said the woman had been breathless for two days. But initial symptoms were not known. “We immediately delivered the baby hoping that it would help the lung. We gave oxygen and medications, but she didn’t improve,” Dr Manonmani said. Sources said at least two other pregnant women have died due to the virus in the hospital. Doctors also clarified that lung CTs can be performed on women who are more than five months pregnant and have had symptoms like fever and myalgia for more than five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dont-ignore-flu-like-symptoms-doctors-tell-expectant-moms/articleshow/83185459.cms||---

Residents in and around the lake, many of them fishermen, said the fishes might have died because of oxygen shortage that was caused by extensive water hyacinth growth and ban on fishing activities. D Shaful Ahmed, a local fisherman, ruled out the possibility of poisoning. "On a normal day, we catch more than 300kg. For the past 20 days, because of lack of fishing activities, there seems to have an unexpected increase in fish population, which combined with the water hyacinth proliferation, might have left them without adequate oxygen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/medical-waste-found-on-ukkadam-lake-bund/articleshow/83185486.cms||---

---||India||Cabinet nod for model tenancy law; Act to serve both owners and tenants||NEW DELHI: More than six years after it was first mooted by the Centre, the Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the Model Tenancy Act which aims to protect the interests of both tenants and landlords. The government expects this model law, which states can adopt and enact, will open up a large number of residential and commercial properties for rental purposes as the legal framework will eliminate the fear of owners losing their properties. While announcing that states have the option to adopt the policy, housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri said he expects BJP-ruled states to roll it out and that other states would also do so as it benefits the common man. He said the policy, once notified by the states, will cover urban and rural areas. The model law lays out the norms for establishing separate rent authorities, courts and tribunals in every district to protect the interests of owners and tenants. The model Act says that the rent and duration of tenancy will be fixed by mutual consent between the owner and tenant and there has to be a written agreement. It suggests that the security deposit for residential properties won’t be for more than two months’ rent and for commercial properties, it can’t be more than that of six months. For revision of rent, landlords need to give a written notice three months in advance and the new rent will be on mutual consent. To protect landlords, it suggests that if a tenant does not vacate the premises after the tenancy expires, the landlord will be entitled to compensation, which will be double the monthly rent for two months and four times the monthly rent after that. Similarly, the landlord can’t forcefully evict the tenant during the agreed contract period. The landowner has to approach the Rent Court for this by submitting a complaint of any default on the part of the tenant or if there is a bona fide requirement of the property by the legal heirs of the owner after his death. Since the law will be applicable for prospective contracts, owners of prime commercial properties in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, who had rented out properties decades back and have been getting peanut rentals, won’t get any benefit. Responding to a question whether the model law has been prepared considering the political implications it would have had if such properties were also covered, Puri said, “The law is aimed at dealing with vacant houses. We are not touching pagdi tenants.” According to the model law, all disputes would be heard at rent courts that states will have to set up and the cases will have to be disposed of in 60 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cabinet-nod-for-model-tenancy-law-act-to-serve-both-owners-and-tenants/articleshow/83191085.cms||Dipak K Dash

Weddings, conferences, exhibitions, leisure and business tourism that constitute a major part of the travel and tourism business have dried up in the last one year, it said adding that some restaurants have already folded up and now the healthy units are staring down the barrel. “Some states are already looking at lifting the lockdown and given that the Covid cases are also coming down here as well, the government should relax the guidelines so that the tourism industry can restart slowly. In the last one year, the industry has lost businesses worth over Rs 50,000 crore as weddings, conferences, and leisure tourism came to a halt,” said Kuldeep Singh Chandela, president of both Hotels Restaurants Association of Rajasthan (HRAR) and Rajasthan Association of Tourism operators (RATO). The representatives of the industry said the mandatory requirement of negative RTPCR report is a major deterrent to tourism and the state government should replace it with vaccination. HRAR joint secretary Ranvijay Singh Rathore said, “None of the European country or the US imposed RTPCR for travelling. Only in India, this practice has been adopted which has spoiled business for airlines and hotels.” He said repeated RT-PCR tests are not good for health and a financial burden on family tourists. “RT-PCR negative report criteria should be waived off for people who have taken single jab of vaccine. Those who are to leave state within seven days may be exempted from RT-PCR tests on showing return journey tickets,” he added. Chandela said no industry had suffered as many job losses as the tourism sector in the state. “People in hotels, restaurants, guides, folk artists, small handicraft makers, apparel sellers, camel owners, and many more in the tourism value chain have lost jobs because of the pandemic. So, the government has look at their plight and calibrate the restart of the tourism in a manner which also takes into account the controlling the pandemic,” added Chandela.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-tourism-sector-lost-over-rs-50000-cr-biz-in-1-year/articleshow/83187432.cms||---

---||Surat||Surat: Electricity bills power Rs 4 crore e-fraud||SURAT: City police busted a well-organized nationwide cyber fraud racket where electricity bills worth Rs 3.67 crore paid in cash by several customers of Torrent Power and state-run Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (DGVCL) were usurped and the bill amount fraudulently paid using credit cards of Mumbai-headquartered RBL Bank customers. Among those arrested include a tele-calling racketeer from Jamtara of Jharkhand that’s infamous for such cyber bank frauds. The racket was busted by Katargam police jointly with the cyber-crime police station. Police arrested Virbhadrasinh Jhala (29), Mehul Lakadiya (28), Yash Bhuptani (24), Manish Bhuva (34), Milan Chovatiya (34) and Jitendra alias Rahul Mandal. Jhala is from Bhavnagar and Mandal is from Jamtara while other accused are residents of the Surat city. Police investigation revealed that Bhuva worked with agents who provided service of electricity bill payment to various business establishments and individuals. He used to receive copies of electricity bills and cash. Instead of directly paying the bill, Bhuva sent the bill copies to Chovatiya and Bhuptani who sent them to Jhala over WhatsApp and Telegram. Jhala then sent the bill copies to Mandal. After receiving the bills, Mandal filled the details for online payment through any bill payment platform. Mandal or his associates then made calls to RBL Bank credit card holders and collected the card holder’s details like card number and birthdate. “Punching these details for payment, Mandal generated OTP for payment. The OTP went to the card holder’s registered mobile that Mandal collected and entered to complete the payment,” said a police officer. After the bills were paid, Jitendra sent the screenshot of payment to Virbhadrasinh. Once Virbhadrasinh verified them, Mehul paid Jitendra his share from the cash collected from the actual electricity customers. “The racket was so well planned that field work was done in Gujarat and the cyber fraud was executed from Jamtara. It would have never been detected but due to in depth investigation at initial stage police busted it,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. The accused were booked under Indian Penal Code for criminal breach of trust, cheating and sections of the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/electricity-bills-power-rs-4cr-e-fraud/articleshow/83184081.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

With this, Bihar will become the first state in the country to provide 33.3% quota to girls in the technical colleges,” a secretary-rank IAS officer, who did not want to be identified, told TOI on Wednesday. Chairing a high-level meeting through videoconferencing from his residence, Nitish said, “The reservation of minimum 33.3% seats for girls will lead to further increase in the number of women in all technical institutions. Women will be more motivated to pursue technical and higher education.” The CM said engineering colleges were being opened in all 38 districts of the state. Several medical colleges too have been opened in the state in recent years, he said. “Our main aim is to ensure that the boys and girls of Bihar do not go to other states to pursue engineering and medical courses,” Nitish said. The CM also reviewed two proposed Bills to be laid in the next session of the state assembly for setting up two new universities exclusively for engineering and medical science streams. After enactment of the proposed Bills, all engineering colleges across the state would be governed by the proposed ‘Bihar Engineering University’ and medical colleges by the proposed ‘Bihar University of Medical Sciences.’ The state currently has 38 government-run and 17 private-run engineering colleges. All these colleges will come under the command of the proposed Bihar Engineering University. The state has nine government and six private medical colleges. Works are going on to open 11 more medical colleges across the state. All these medical colleges would come under the command of the proposed ‘Bihar University of Medical Sciences.’ The state government has also planned to set up two more new universities for sports sector and art & culture sectors, respectively.

On Tuesday, the Class 12 board exams for Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) students had been cancelled. As for Gujarat’s decision, it was taken at the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday, state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama announced. A decision on whether to conduct the exams for Class 10 and Class 12 repeater students will be taken shortly, the minister said.

Of these students, 1,40,000 are in the science stream and 5,43,000 in the general stream. “In the larger interest of the state’s students, the Government of Gujarat, under the direction of chief minster Vijay Rupani, has decided to cancel the Class 12 board exams of GSHSEB,” Chudasama said in a media statement. “The next steps regarding the examinations of this board will be taken by the state government in line with the guidelines of the central government.” On Tuesday afternoon, the GSHSEB had announced the dates for Class 12 board examinations.

Comprising a core team with over 100 volunteers, Rashtriya Mahashakti Yuva Sangh, Rajasthan, distributes more than 2,000 packets of food daily. Deepak Dandoriya, who is part of the core team told TOI, “During the first wave too, we helped people and this time around, we wanted to increase our scope as people are scared of getting out. So we thought that the least we could do was ensure that no person has to sleep empty stomach. Hence, we got a cook to start preparing the food. We have no elaborate infrastructure, but cooking is done on the road itself near Nahargarh. Middle-class families from all over the city also come to us for free food.” The group has no external source of money as they dug into their own pockets to sponsor the food, although at times they do get grocery items from people who want to help in this initiative. “Our volunteers take the food and give it to attendants of patients in SMS and RUHS hospitals. While we take necessary precautions for protection against Covid, all our energy is invested in helping people in this time of crisis. We do not take any money from anyone and use our own income to keep this initiative active,” added Dandoriya. Besides, the of volunteers take vegetables, bread and biscuits every evening to various areas of the city to feed strays.

---||Pune||Educators advise dropping of min marks rule for post-Std XII studies||Pune: With the state cabinet on Wednesday recommending the cancellation of the HSC examinations amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, experts want the government to drop the “minimum 60% marks or minimum 45% marks in HSC” as a qualifying criterion for admissions to professional courses and allow all students a fair chance based on entrance examinations to opt for such programmes. At the moment, most of the national and even state entrance examination rules state that a student must obtain a minimum of 60% marks in their Std XII to be eligible for admission to professional courses. The students are allowed to appear for the entrance examinations and a merit list is prepared based on the entrance examination score, but to confirm admissions, a student needs a minimum of 60% or 45% marks based on the course chosen and reservation category, to be eligible.Nitin Karmalkar, vice chancellor of Savitribai Phule Pune University, said for all purposes of admission to professional courses, Std XII marks should not be a criterion. “I think we need to cancel the minimum 60% marks or 45% in Std XII examination criteria for admission to professional courses and instead allow all students who pass out to appear for the common entrance exams and then based solely on that score, to apply for admissions. This will ensure that all students will get a transparent and fair chance,” Karmalkar added.R M Jalnekar, director of Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, said, “The students and their families are going through various kinds of emotional, financial and other stress. By cancelling the Std XII marks criteria for admission to professional courses, we are removing their anxiety over how the assessment process will be so that they can concentrate on the entrance examination which are held in a transparent way and that score is all we require for admissions.”Anita Moodliar, principal of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology, also said by considering all Std XII pass students as eligible for admissions to professional courses based on their entrance examination score, no student will feel left out or unfairly treated in the assessment process. “Anyway, all students are allowed to appear for the CET exams even without Std XII marks as that criteria is applied only at the time of admissions. Now, all that needs to be done is to consider all Std XII-pass students as eligible and admit them based solely on the entrance examination merit list,” she said.Students told TOI their Std XI scores should not beconsidered as they may not have given their 100% for the exam.“As the focus is on board exams, the Class XI performance is never taken seriously,” said a student. Though most of the 2019-20 academic year was pre-Covid, students could not take their final exams and were promoted to Class XII for 2020-21.Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said, “CBSE and ISC schools are ready with their internal assessment plans. The state board does not have any fallback plan. Students do not take Class XI seriously, so they will again be at a disadvantage. For admissions to professionalcourses, they will require a minimum passing percentage.”(With inputs from Yogita Rao and Sandhya Nair )||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/educators-advise-dropping-of-min-marks-rule-for-post-std-xii-studies/articleshow/83185553.cms||Ardhra Nair

Thousands of teams compete in this challenge across the world and only 40 of them are awarded. With this award, the event will now move on to the first Global Innovation Awards Finals that will be held in June. This ‘Innovation Challenge’ was not just about designing and building a product, but also developing a business model for it and presenting a business pitch to capital investors. Teams that excelled on all these fronts progressed to the finals. Bishop’s innovation submission was an exercise-accessory that had been designed to be attach to exercise bikes and motivate students to learn, play and exercise, all at the same time. The product would encourage students to spend more time doing physical activity, while also learning and playing at the same time, leading to a smarter, healthier, and happier life. As this innovation has potential to become a real-life product and it is catering to a totally new business market, an application was made to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO patent number 63173650) to protect the innovation. The team comprised students from Standard VII, VIII and IX of The Bishop’s Co-Ed School Kalyani Nagar. The team’s Instagram handle was @bsrc_mad.about.robots. The mentors for the team were Sumesh Jaiswal (technical director, Broadcom) and Shayne McPherson (principal, Bishop’s Co-Ed School Kalyani Nagar). Month-long virtual summer camp held The teachers at Vidya Pratishthan’s Magarpatta City Public School are conducting a free online summer camp for their students. The camp is helping make up for the lost academic time for students because of Covid-19. The students also get to virtually meet and socialize with their friends and teachers. Mornings begin with aerobics and yoga. The science experiments offer children opportunities to learn, while having fun. During the ‘computer applications’ session, they learn coding with Scratch, Draw and Paint on the computer and create animations and games. Spell Bee and general knowledge activities keep their minds active and continuously help expand their knowledge.

More said that she visited the hospital in the morning and, after scrutinising her documents, she was given a shot. “The entire process was smooth and without any hurdles,” said More. Like her, over 441 youngsters received the vaccination dose on Wednesday at the camp. PMC has, so far, received about over 2,000 email applications from students looking forward to going abroad for higher education and plans are underway to vaccinate them. Dhruv Mitkari, who is planning to go to Canada for further studies, visited the camp on Wednesday morning and got the vaccine dose after completing all formalities. Aseem Visal, another student who got the jab on Wednesday, said that the arrangements were adequate, and the administration was issuing tokens to avoid a rush at the centre. Visal spent about an hour to get the vaccine after completing the required formalities. About 664 students have been vaccinated over the last two days at the camp. The number of vaccinations jumped significantly on Wednesday. On Tuesday, 221 students received the vaccine. A PMC official said, “For the vaccination session on Thursday about 500 slots have been set aside. The administration has set up an email id over which students can send their applications. Once the applications are checked by the authorities, tokens will be issued accordingly.” Students from other districts, including Satara, Kolhapur and Ahmednagar, have also approached the officials at the camp in the last two days. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said that the vaccination session for students going abroad will continue on Thursday. “We are ensuring that the students spend less time at the vaccination centre. Adequate staff has been made available at the hospital,” Mohol stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-learners-going-abroad-for-higher-edu-get-vaccine/articleshow/83185561.cms||Sarang Dastane

So far, such admissions were based on marks obtained in the Std XII board examination. Ravindrasinh Pardeshi, principal of Fergusson College, one of the most sought-after colleges in the state for degree admissions, especially in the arts faculty, said he gets about ten times more applications than the number of seats available in science faculty and the number of applications received in the commerce faculty is over 10 times the available seats. “Std XII board marks were the most trusted way to finalise the merit list for admissions. Now, it has become difficult for colleges to find an alternative, fair and transparent way of preparing merit lists. We will follow the guidelines issued by the state. If not a centralised entrance, we would need to at least to conduct an entrance test at the college level to have some base to admit students in the degree courses,” Pardeshi said. Anwar Shaikh, principal of Poona College of Arts, Science and Commerce, predicted that colleges will see a huge load of students seeking admission to degree courses. “The passing percentage will be almost 100%. Even if we take a 95% pass percentage, there will be a lot of students applying for traditional degree courses which will put pressure on the colleges. Hence, an entrance examination must be conducted at the central level because smaller colleges will not have the infrastructure. Universities can conduct such exams for colleges under their jurisdictions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/entrance-exam-best-for-degree-courses/articleshow/83185572.cms||Ardhra Nair

The victim was identified as Bhana Bariya. He was sleeping at his farm on the outskirts of Padiyarka village when the incident took place. “Bariya was sleeping alone at the farm and had got up to relieve himself when the leopard attacked him. The animal also ate part of Bariya’s hand,” R R Chauhan, range forest officer of Mahuva said. According to Chauhan, it is suspected that the leopard mistook Bariya for prey and attacked him. Bariya’s body was found by another villager early in the morning who informed the village sarpanch who contacted the forest officials. The body was sent for post-mortem and the cages have been set up to trap the leopard. There have been several cases of human-animal conflict in the forest areas of Gujarat in the recent past. Between 2015 and 2019, leopards attacked 718 people in different parts of the state resulting in 67 deaths, the government had told the state Assembly in March this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/70-year-old-man-killed-in-leopard-attack-near-mahuva/articleshow/83185581.cms||---

---||Chennai||M K Stalin starts on an inclusive note, how long will honeymoon last?||For all the standards and goals set by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam patriarch, M Karunanidhi struggled to expand the horizons of his party beyond traditional lines. Taking forward the DMK legacy, chief minister M K Stalin, through his inclusive gestures, seems to have managed to reach out to sections beyond party lines and earn encomiums even from opponents of the DMK. The limited scope of the DMK’s popularity could be assessed with the 1989 assembly polls in mind, when the AIADMK split after the death of its tallest leader MGR in December 1987. The DMK was elected to power, but secured only about one-third of the votes. In 2006, the DMK won on the strength of a strong alliance which included the Congress, the PMK and the Left, to touch 44% vote share .  In 2016, the DMK indirectly projected Stalin as the heir apparent to get close to 40% vote share but lost out to the AIADMK which boosted its own vote share to 41.1%, and J Jayalalithaa barely scraped through. The DMK only came close to the majority mark, but it was apparent that Stalin did attract a percentage of voters who wanted change. On Karunanidhi’s 97th birth anniversary on June 3, as the DMK takes stock of its gains after a month of being in power again, the critics of the party have been silenced by Stalin’s approach ever since he assumed office on May 7.  The subdued note of celebration was quickly replaced by action on a war-footing against the pandemic. In the past, the DMK and the AIADMK governments had been guilty of winding up or renaming pet schemes of each another soon after coming to power. Stalin has shown no keenness to alter the status quo, especially relating to Amma Unavagam. The arrest of DMK men who vandalised an Amma Unavagam outlet, seeking to remove the photograph of Jayalalithaa and the reassurance that the Amma Unavagam scheme would continue to reach out to the poor, the commitment to the Annadhanam scheme of temples, the quick steps to raise availability of vaccines and oxygen beds in hospitals, have all contributed to broaden Stalin’s support base beyond his party. The push to appoint efficient senior officers such as V Irai Anbu and T Udhayachandran has also gone down well with the bureaucracy.  Stalin has adopted a judicious style bringing in a new team of officers in crucial posts like Gagandeep Singh Bedi (Chennai corporation), and retaining the team led by the health secretary J Radhakrishnan. The move to set up a committee of MLAs from various parties has also created a sense of confidence in officialdom. These moves have earned the appreciation of a couple of the AIADMK. Former deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam has welcomed the government’s "acceptance" of some of his demands. Stalin’s refusal to be drawn into a slanging match with the AIADMK and other opposition parties despite provocative statements, has got him new admirers. Sections within the DMK are surprised over the "inclusiveness" and "maturity" of the CM. There is a new air of freedom in government complexes as compared to the slavish mentality among ministers noticed in the Jayalalithaa era as well.  Stalin comes across as first among equals at these meetings and in public appearances alongside ministers and officials. Ministers handling the portfolios of health, finance, education and transport have been allowed to hold discussions with their respective departments and interact with media, indicating greater democracy and transparency in the government than before. How long this approach will continue is anybody’s guess. Some of his critics believe this would last only during the "honeymoon" period, but Stalin watchers say his approach of dealing with issues on a non-party basis, is different from the Kalaignar era and would continue even as he keeps his doors open for suggestions. As for the DMK, Stalin has told his partymen that politics can take a backseat during the pandemic. The situation is not conducive to hold elections to urban local bodies, besides vacant rural bodies. The local councillors and the presence of elected representatives at the tier-3 levels, could also help in better governance. At least until then, Stalin would ensure that politics is kept away, and focus would be on dealing with the pandemic. Chambers of industries and commerce feel the new dispensation of proactive ministers and skilled officers in key positions could help accelerate growth through a new regime of incentives and concessions. They expect this to be ushered in once the pandemic is dealt with. While Stalin builds on the image of his father and draws support from the legion of Kalaignar fans, he has embarked on a new path of inclusive growth and diversified appeal, beyond religion, caste and community divide. Stalin has been careful to maintain a balance between the Dravidian plank of the party and the sentiments of Hindus, in a marked departure from the Karunanidhi legacy. Karunanidhi was known to make acerbic comments about Hindu gods and goddesses off and on, and this upset devout Hindus who saw the DMK as an anti-Hindu party. The BJP has been trying to build such a narrative, but the DMK under Stalin nipped it in the bud. Stalin has been keen to convey that he does not want to carry the baggage of the past, especially the picture of his party being anti-Hindu On the political front, he has proved to be bipartisan. Though hamstrung by a low resource base, he has begun implementing some of the poll promises. Work well begun is half done. Stalin has crossed more than the halfway period in a short span. In that sense, he has managed to overcome the stiff opposition from a section of the political spectrum and the electorate, and go beyond the confines of the DMK. Going forward, his government will have to come to grips with rising debts and aspirations.

---||Thane||No entry, exit: Maharashtra hamlet stays Covid-free for 425 days||THANE: Since the national lockdown was announced in March-end 2020, Maharashtra has been convulsed by the coronavirus, which has made over 57 lakh sick and claimed almost a lakh of those lives. But a nondescript village of over a thousand residents about 100km northeast from here has managed to stay Covid-free for more than 425 days, thanks to the practical wisdom of its elders and collective safety efforts. Kalbhonde, a tribal hamlet almost on the border of Thane and Nashik districts, first isolated itself. As soon as lockdown was announced last March, the village elders held a consultation and sealed the village. Next, they set up a makeshift isolation centre at the entry point, without government help, for the residents who mostly worked in neighbouring areas as farm hands. “The villagers are predominantly employed as farm labour in neighbouring areas and after the lockdown, many started returning home. The elders convinced the womenfolk that the isolation of their husbands and family members would benefit the village, ensuring minimal resistance,” said Prashant Marke, a zilla parishad gram sewak. The village has also unanimously decided to discourage inviting visitors unless in an emergency, a rule still being followed. The efforts of the villagers have drawn applause from government officials too. “The discipline and unity showed by the residents to keep their village virus-free for over a year now is commendable. It was heartening to note that the villagers here ensured strict compliance to safety protocols, something that is not seen in urban areas,” said Thane zilla parishad CEO Bhausaheb Dangade. It wasn’t all smooth sailing, said Bhalchandra Khadke, a villager. Panic set in with news of the unstoppable virus, and villagers barricaded the only road to their village by placing huge boulders and tree branches to deter any vehicle movement in or out. “The villagers initially refused to allow even government officials to enter, but we talked to them and made them aware of the precautions to be taken. The villagers promoted the use of sanitisers and masks and the protocol is still followed though there are no cases here,” said Marke. Khadke said the pandemic also made the villagers realise the importance of self-sustenance and many switched back to tilling their own lands and consuming food available in the forest. The villagers refused several NGOs that wanted to provide rations and suggested that they transfer funds to their gram panchayat. “We decided to avoid any outside contact and decided to rely more on homegrown vegetables and on wild fruits and roots,” said Khadke. The isolation helped bring the villagers closer as they, along with local health workers, began keeping a watch on the aged and those ailing and ensured that their health was monitored. Kalbhonde is not letting its guard down. “We have a network that alerts others if a stranger is spotted attempting to enter our village. However, no one is denied entry if they follow all safety norms,” said Khadke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/tribal-village-keeps-visitors-and-covid-out-for-425-days/articleshow/83189110.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has appealed to the students travelling abroad to contact Prashant Vanjari (Mb- 8788725881) at RCH office in Panchganga hospital, Kolhapur city, and provide set of documents like admission letter to foreign university, foreign visa, I-20 or DS-160 and other relevant documents. The data of such students will be collected on June 3 to 5 between 10am to 1 pm toarrange a vaccine session for such students Most of the students, travelling abroad for studies, want to get vaccinated before travelling. Patil said, “Academic year in many countries is set to begin from August and with control in the Covid situation, these countries are starting with offline education. Students take huge loans to confirm their admissions to foreign universities. If these students are not vaccinated in time then their admissions might not happen and it will affect these students financially, mentally.” Rohit Raut, an engineering student said, “My admission for masters of science (MS) has been confirmed with California State University in the USA and I will be travelling there early August.

Schools have started work on the results for the secondary school certificate students. The decision to cancel Std X examination was announced by the school education minister Varsha Gaikwad last week. It was then decided to assess students based on their marks scored in Std IX and assessments in Std X. Though Gaikwad said the records of all Std IX students and their marks were with the government through the SARAL software system, at least 80,000 were unavailable. Only 50% marks of the total scored in each subject would be taken for assessment for SSC, she said. For the remaining 50 marks, schools must consider the marks of the written exam for 80 marks and convert these marks to 30, she said. In order to explain the marking system to the school principals, the state board has engaged all their experts in preparing the videos, forms and other material through which the marks calculation would be easy, transparent and smooth, chairman of state board Dinkar Patil said. “We will release the details on Thursday for schools to start compiling the marks and enter them into the system. Since it will be a manual job, the school management will require at least a few days to complete the data management,” he said. Avni Patni, a Std X state board student, said, “This year, our results will be a big suspense. Without giving exams, we are going to get marks in a combination from two years. The basis for calculating marks is different and it will depend on how each school mark their students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-board-set-to-release-ssc-marks-process-today/articleshow/83185565.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The police rushed to the school to verify his claim and found the body of a man, Rajan Ramesh Sahani (27), in a classroom on the second floor of the school building. Sahani from Warje worked as a painter at construction sites and died of head injury. The police then arrested the jobless man, Kisan Prakash Varapa (21) of Shramik Vasahat, off Karve Road, on the charge of murder. “We have recorded Varapa’s statement,” said senior inspector Muralidhar Karpe of the Deccan Gymkhana police. Preliminary investigations revealed that Varapa and Sahani had sneaked into the school premises by scaling the rear compound wall for consuming liquor. The police said they had an argument well past midnight after getting drunk, triggering the murder. Sudhir Gade, the assistant secretary of the MES, said, “The persons involved in this incident had no connection with the school. The management had taken all precautions to prevent outsiders from entering the school premises, yet few notorious elements managed to get into the premises. The school is shut because of Covid restrictions and classrooms are not opened every day.” Gade said, “The office is functioning with very little strength. The school is undergoing renovation. So, some labourers work during the day. This incident came to notice this (Wednesday) morning. The police came and did their procedure.” Citing the statement of Varapa, Karpe said, “The duo entered the school by avoiding the lone watchman’s eye as he was manning the front gate. After consuming liquor till the wee hours of Tuesday, they started arguing. An enraged Sahani picked up a spade from the school veranda and hit Varapa on hand. In retaliation, Varapa hit on Sahani’s head with a fire extinguisher. Varapa dragged Sahani inside a classroom after the latter collapsed, slapped and punched the victim. He then closed the classroom door and left,” said Karpe. He said, “Varapa consumed more liquor on Tuesday and moved around the city before going back home in the night. On Wednesday morning, he went to the school and saw his friend lying motionless. He then walked into the police station.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-surrenders-after-assaulting-friend-to-death/articleshow/83185587.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government’s flip-flops fray nerves||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government’s abrupt decisions relating to the education sector, and its equally quick reversals of declarations, have been flummoxing all stakeholders in the pandemic era. On Tuesday, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the cancellation of the Class 12 CBSE board exams, political leaders across party lines welcomed the decision. In Gujarat, however, the state government officials decided to hold a meeting to reconsider their decision to conduct the Class 12 exams for the state board. The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) had earlier on Tuesday, hours before the Centre’s decision, announced the exams for Class 12 as well as Class 10 (for repeaters). The exams were to be held between July 1 and July 16. A day later, Gujarat education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said that the Class 12 board exams stood cancelled. It was another in a series of flip-flops from the Gujarat government. Last month, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani and Chudasama had announced that the government will conduct the board exams in July, in the larger interest of the students. Their announcement came when the Centre said it was exploring the option of cancelling the CBSE board exams. Last year in August, universities including Gujarat University and Gujarat Technological University announced exams for various semesters in the pen-and-paper format. But the University Grants Commission guidelines had suggested that only terminal semester and final-year exams are to be conducted by universities and institutions in September in the pen-and-paper, online, or blended modes. Also, the Centre’s Unlock-3 stipulations stated that schools, colleges, and other educational institutions were to remain closed till August 31, 2020. The two universities later deferred their exams. “The government had to also scrap its decision to open schools and colleges after Diwali. The reopening decision had been made even when there was no clear indication in this direction from the Centre,” said an academic expert. “The state should have consulted the central government before taking such important decisions.” Earlier in April, when the CBSE cancelled the Class 10 exams, the Gujarat government sought to only postpone them. It was only after a lot of pressure from parents and schools did the government recently announce the cancellation of Class 10 exams. “The next steps regarding the examinations of this board will be taken by the state government in line with the guidelines of the central government,” Chudasama said in a media statement on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-governments-flip-flops-fray-nerves/articleshow/83185595.cms||Bharat Yagnik

A Jaipur-based firm N S Gadhiya, which quoted the lowest bid of Rs 266 crore against the Rs 280 bidding price has been awarded with the work. Its nearest competitor bid to construct the project in Rs 336 crore. An official source said, “Making optimum use of pandemic, the tender work was completed and work was awarded to the firm. It was a tight competition as 17 firms participated in the pre-bid. The firm has also started the digging work on ground and we are hoping to complete the project before the deadline of 30 months.” The RHB has also successfully acclaiming the land on which these apartments will be constructed. The board has taken possession and demolished 54 bungalows of MLAs. In the project, the RHB proposed to construct an eight-storey building in the periphery of the legislative assembly to accommodate 160 MLAs. Each flat will measure 3,200 square feet and comprise four bedrooms, one drawing room, a kitchen and a one room for domestic help. As per the previous design, the JDA had proposed 176 flats. However, the idea did not go well with the committee which is overseeing the project as the open area was less. Now, 16 flats have been reduced in the project to develop a central lawn measuring 36,000 square metre. In the project, the RHB has earmarked parking for 1,200 vehicles and a 12-room guest house. RHB has been appointed as the nodal agency for constructing MLA apartments. An official said the revenue earned after selling the land at Lal Kothi and Jalupura will be utilized to construct the apartments. Sources said, considering the project as a special case, the 28-metre building has been proposed against the 15-metre rule mentioned in the building bylaws. The RHB has proposed to construct the apartment till the base height of the dome. This proposal has been cleared by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rhb-starts-construction-of-luxurious-mla-flats/articleshow/83187450.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Coaching classes focus on host of admission tests in online mode||PUNE: After the announcement of the cancellation of CBSE and ISC Std XII board exams, students have begun their preparations for the common entrance test (CET) or various courses including engineering, architecture, hotel management among others. Coaching classes have started taking mock tests, online crash courses for the last-minute preparations of the entrance examinations. State board students are also joining the preparations for entrance exams. Director of IITian’s Prashikshan Kendra, Durgesh Mangeshkar, said, “The board exams’ cancellation was expected when the government had decided to call off the Std X exam. Hence, we had told students to focus on the entrance exams. We have been providing lectures plus doubts sessions along with on-demand tests to students all along and shall continue till the entrance exams are held. We expect them to be held before September-end. Centre head of Allen Pune, Arun Jain, said the focus is now entirely on the entrance examinations like the JEE and medical exams. “Although, there could be some objective-based tests for Std XII, in case the government comes up with a similar approach for the three majors in Std 12. The chances are bleak,” he added. Sumedh Bhave, who is preparing for the medical entrance test, said, “Usually, we have our targets for every month with respect to the modules that we need to cover. Now, the burden is less as we clearly know we do not have to prepare for the theory exam of Std XII. The entrance exam will happen so we will be planning our days accordingly for the next two months.” Law aspirant Veda Joshi said, “Most of the arts and commerce students in our study group felt there would be no exams after the Covid cases started rising. Many of us are worried about admissions. For courses like law, hotel management, agriculture, architecture, there is a set entrance but for undergraduate courses like arts, commerce, business administration, the admissions are based on Std XII results. I am focusing on my entrance exam for law, my friends are disoriented.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/coaching-classes-focus-on-host-of-admission-tests-in-online-mode/articleshow/83185584.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

The police also arrested the man who had escorted the drug-laden vehicle from Jhansi. According to police sources, of the four accused involved in the murder, two, including Jaipal Bhullar, might have separated from the two who were arrested from MP.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Raikot Sukhnaz Singh said on Sunday, they had arrested Manjeet Singh, an ex-serviceman of Burj Nakliyan and his neighbour and helper Pala Singh, who works as class IV employee at cooperative society and seized 70kg poppy husk that was in five bags from their possession. He added that on questioning Manjeet, they came to know that the consignment was given to him by Darshan (who is his cousin) and Baljinder Babbi on May 12 evening. Police officials said during questioning of Manjeet and Pala, they further found out that Darshan and Baljinder had brought the consignment from Jharkhand. They added that apart from bags of poppy husk, vehicle had wires in it that were to be supplied by the driver to a firm at Kandrori in Himachal Pradesh and from probe it has come to fore that those wires were delivered by the driver at that industrial town. Darshan and Baljinder were nominated in the poppy peddling case. Manjeet and the other accused had also allegedly revealed to the police that one Gurmukh Singh of Kabbar Bacha in Ferozepur had helped Darshan and Baljinder to smuggle the poppy husk consignment from Jharkand by driving along the consignment vehicle in his car. Police officials said he was arrested from Ramgarh Seeviyan on Tuesday and poppy husk was recovered from his car. A police source also said the Ludhiana rural police will bring Darshan and Baljinder, who are with OCCU (organised crime control unit) team at Chandigarh, on Wednesday or Thursday for questioning. He added that they suspect that the accused had brought more consignment in canter, as they wouldn’t have Gurmukh moving ahead of the vehicle (by around 15-20km) to see if there is police checkpost ahead) if the consignment is of lesser value.Police officer said they are probing to see where part of the consignment was delivered.Meanwhile, another police officer involved in the probe of the murder case of two ASIs, said preliminary questioning of Darshan and Baljinder has revealed that the other two accused involved in the crime might have separated from them in Rajasthan and moved to another state. He added that the raids are being conducted in a religious city in Maharastra apart from other places there and in other states to nab Jaipal and Jassi Kharar. CASE FILEOn May 15, the accused had allegedly shot dead ASI Bhagwant Singh of Jagraon and ASI Dalwinderjit Singh of Sarali in Tarn Taran. Homeguard Rajwinder Singh of Dola village in Gidderbha area of Muktsar district had escaped unhurt. The three-member team of crime investigating agency (CIA) had gone to New Grain Market following a tip off about liquor smuggling. Initially, the police had identified the four accused in the murder case as Jaipal Singh Bhullar of Ferozepur, Baljinder Singh Babbi of Mahlla Khurd in Moga, Jaspreet Singh alias Jassi Kharar of Civil Hospital Road in Kharar and Darshan Singh of Sahauli village in Ludhiana.

---||Ahmedabad||Govt yet to fix assessment criteria for Class 12||Ahmedabad: After its decision to cancel Class 12 board exams for Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) students, the state government is faced with the issue of deciding the assessment criteria. The Gujarat government’s decision to cancel the exams is on the lines of central government’s decision to cancel Class 12 exams of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). “The next steps regarding the examinations of this board will be taken by the state government as per the guidelines of the central government,” state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said in a press statement. On Tuesday, members of GSHSEB and other officials of the education department discussed the option of evaluating the performance of Class 12 board students based on their scores in internal tests or unit exams, said an official aware of the development. Most of the CBSE schools are in urban areas as compared to GSHSEB affiliated schools, a majority of which are in rural areas. “Conducting online unit test for Class 12 GSHSEB students may not have been possible at many places amid Covid-19 pandemic when schools in Gujarat have switched to online studies,” said an education expert. There are connectivity issues and many students may not have access to mobile phones or other gadgets used for online education and online exams, he added. Among other options, one of the criteria explored by CBSE is to make an academic assessment of Class 12 students based on their performance in Class 9, Class 10 and Class 11, said sources. This could work with Gujarat education board too, sources added. “For CBSE, Class 12 results will be derived in line with well-defined objective criteria in a time-bound manner,” according to a press release issued by the Centre on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-yet-to-fix-assessment-criteria-for-class-12/articleshow/83185607.cms||---

The organisation is in talks with vaccine manufacturers to procure 10 lakh doses of the Covid vaccines and will be administering them at concessional rates. The IMA’s national general secretary Jayesh Lele said, “We aim to vaccinate about five lakh relatives of our members. But the execution of this plan depends on procurement of the doses.” The IMA is a charitable organisation and members said the drive is being held as a welfare activity on a no-loss, no-profit basis. "We have requested the vaccine manufacturers to give us the doses on a no-loss, no-profit basis so that we can pass on the benefit to our members. We are yet to hear from them (manufacturers),” Lele said. The medical body primarily aims to cover families of members in rural areas. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India (HBI), Pune branch, said, “Many family members of our doctors, especially those in the 18-44 group, have not yet received the shots. The drive will benefit many and foster the confidence among doctors that like them, their family members are also being protected against the contagion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ima-set-to-vaccinate-5-lakh-kin-of-members/articleshow/83185606.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||International schools hold special camps, give foreign-bound pupils shot in arm||MUMBAI: International schools are now stepping in to bail out their foreign-bound students, whose academic plans were impeded by the vaccine shortage. Schools are collaborating with private hospitals to hold immunisation camps for these students and their staff. Many of these students are expected to fly out in the coming months, but the mandated 84-day gap between doses of Covishield vaccine may still delay them, unless the rule is relaxed. About 98% of students from the graduating class at Dhirubhai Ambani International School are planning to study abroad. The students and parents had got in touch with the administration to facilitate a vaccination drive for them, said a school spokesperson. The Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital was roped in to organise a drive on May 24 to get over 100 students immunised. Surabhi Goel, the CEO Of Aditya Birla World Academy, said they had multiple requests from students through class representatives. “Fortunately, the (Birla) group was holding a drive for our staff and we managed to include students too. Around 60 students had shown interest when we floated the plan, so we set up a separate counter for them,” said Goel. She added that a few alumni, who had deferred their joining plans last year, also participated in the drive. The Cathedral and John Connon School has about 97 students in the graduating class who are scheduled to fly out in August-September. The school helped the students to get vaccinated at a drive organised at GD Somani Memorial School last week. Around 60 students from the class participated in the drive. The delay in getting the vaccination slots was only adding to their anxiety, said principal Meera Isaacs. Bombay Scottish School in Mahim will also be organising a drive in coming days. Another principal pointed out that the 12-week gap between doses of Covishield needed to be relaxed, to help students get fully vaccinated before they travel. Though first doses are made available now at private hospitals, many will not be able to get their second dose if the 84-day rule applies, she added. The BMC, too, has allowed foreign-bound students to walk in at centres for their vaccine shots since Monday. In three days, the municipal corporation has vaccinated 2,586 students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/intl-schools-hold-spl-camps-give-foreign-bound-pupils-shot-in-arm/articleshow/83189125.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Lucknow||Mission June: Lucknow betters Day 1 record with 20,000 jabs||LUCKNOW: With over 20,000 people taking the jab against Covid-19, the number of vaccinations increased further on Day 2 of ‘Mission June’ mass inoculation campaign on Wednesday, breaking the record set on Tuesday. Of the total 20,409 people who took the first or second shots, 78% (15,876) were from the younger lot of 18-44 years age group followed by 15% (3,087) in 45-59 years age group and 5% (969) in 60-plus category. The remaining were healthcare and frontline workers. Women continued to be behind men in taking vaccines across all age groups and categories. Among beneficiaries, 12,154 (60%) were men as compared to 8,225 (40%) women. Similar trend was witnessed in the drive since the start of inoculation in January this year. While people in the category of 18-44 years had to come after booking their slots on Co-Win 2.0 portal, those above 45 were allowed walk-in registration for vaccination. Separate booths were made for guardians having a child aged up to 12 years. Nearly 24% of Wednesday’s vaccinations were done at three mega centres at Ekana stadium, KD Singh Babu Stadium and Chhota Imambara where the situation as compared to Tuesday was better with lesser complaints of overcrowding and lack of social distancing. “The reason for this was fewer people above 45 years of age, for whom walk-in registration was available, came to these three centres for vaccination. Those in 18-44 years category came on the time slot they were allotted after booking on the portal,” a senior health official said. Beneficiaries said on some occasions, particularly in the first couple of hours after the drive started, there was lack of social distancing, which was later sorted out by senior officers. As tents with chairs were put up at mega centres, people did not have to stand in the open. Tauseef Khan, who got inoculated at the centre at Chhota Imambara, said there were only three rows when the vaccination began due to which social distancing was not possible. “Later, another queue was made when the district magistrate arrived and directed officers to ensure Covid protocol,” he said. Most people at the vaccination centres wore masks and brought their own hand sanitizers. Some were seen with face shields. Many youngsters came in groups and were spotted taking selfies. Some families also came together to get the jab. No serious adverse impact was reported from any centre. At KD Singh Babu Stadium, Saruthe, a resident of Bakshi Ka Talab area availed the bus service provided by the administration for villagers. “It took us two hours to come here. There was a separate waiting area for people from rural areas at the centre,” he said. One of the beneficiaries at KD Singh Babu Stadium, Chitra Shukla from Munshipulia, experienced dizziness after vaccination. She was immediately attended by the doctors and later sent home after she felt better. At Ekana stadium, the crowd was better managed because the majority of the beneficiaries were in the age group of 18-44 years who arrived at their scheduled time. “Things were better managed, but hot and humid weather was a problem for many,” said Pragati Gupta, a Mahanagar resident.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Class 11 reopening likely to be delayed||AHMEDABAD: Weeks after announcing Class 10 mass promotion, the education department is yet to finalize the criteria for the assessment of students. As a result, the mark-sheets for Class 10 students have not been prepared and this is likely to cause delay in reopening of schools for Class 11 students. On Wednesday, the state government in said in an official communique that online education for the new academic session will start from June 7. The state government had in May this year announced cancellation of Class 10 board exams due to the Covid-19 situation. The decision, taken on the lines of CBSE’s decision to cancel its exams, was aimed to give relief to about 8.7 lakh regular students in Class 10 at schools affiliated with the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB). So even as the state education department has warned schools of strict actions if they are found to be enrolling students in Class 11 without their Class 10 mark-sheets, the government is facing the challenge of declaring the academic assessment criteria of the Class 10 students. A decision on ‘repeaters’ or students who had failed in earlier attempts and were to retake the exams this year, will be taken later on. According to initial estimates by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), about 2,000 new classrooms will be needed to accommodate the higher number of students in Class 11 due to mass promotion. This will also require 3,500 more teachers for Class 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/class-11-reopening-likely-to-be-delayed/articleshow/83185647.cms||---

Meanwhile, an audio clip of the purported conversation between Praseeda and Surendran has emerged in which she is heard telling Surendran that Janu had sought Rs 10 lakh for her return to the front and Surendran is heard agreeing to hand over the money in Thiruvananthapuram on March 6. Janu had returned to NDA after two years at the public meeting held on March 7 to mark the conclusion of the pre-election ‘Vijaya Yatra’ headed by Surendran that was inaugurated by home minister Amit Shah. Praseeda told the media in Kannur on Wednesday that during the discussions between JRP and BJP leaders on the party's re-entry into the front in Kottayam earlier, Janu had demanded Rs 10 crore to join NDA. Since it was unacceptable she raised the interim demand to Rs 10 lakh to sort out some financial constraints. Praseeda told the media that the audio clip of the telephone conversation between her and Surendran was genuine In the audio clip, Praseeda is heard telling that Janu wanted the Rs 10 lakh before joining NDA to repay the money she had borrowed from some persons. She alleged that Surendran had handed over Rs 10 lakh to Janu in Thiruvananthapuram. Meanwhile Janu refuted the allegations and said Praseeda's allegation was baseless. "If I wanted to engage in financial dealings with Surendran, I do not need an intermediary like Praseeda. I can talk to anyone in the state on my own. Then, what is the need to do things with the help of an intermediary," she said. Janu said that the allegations are part of a move by some persons to wrest control of the party and that she would take legal action against those who raised false allegations. Janu had contested in the recent assembly polls as the NDA candidate in Sultan Bathery for the second time.

However, for arts and commerce colleges, the decision brings the challenge of adding 1.25 lakh seats for the academic year 2021-22. This is to be done in anticipation of the large number of students who are likely to pass this year due to the cancellation of the Class XII board exams. “Last year, some 34,000 seats at engineering colleges went vacant after the admission committee and the private colleges could not fill them. This year, more students will qualify for engineering courses due to which the number of vacant seats may fall substantially,” said an education department official. This is expected to benefit private colleges which were left with more than 50% of all seats vacant last year, he added. Approximately 1.40 lakh science stream students and 5.43 lakh general stream students were expected to take the board exam. Wednesday’s decision applies to only regular students and the government is yet to take a call on ‘repeater candidates’, who number 1.25 lakh students for Class XII general stream. Last year, about 3.71 lakh students took the Class XII (general) board exams of which 2.87 lakh cleared it and took admission in commerce and arts colleges. “This year about 1.25 lakh more students are expected to apply for admission to arts and commerce courses. The education department will have to ensure addition of almost 1,000 divisions to accommodate the huge additional number,” said Jayvantsinh Sarvaiya, president of Gujarat State College Principals’ Association. About 53,000 students of Class XII science (Group A) were expected to take the board exams this year. Students who have opted for Group A with mathematics can qualify for engineering courses after fulfilling other criteria. In comparison, there 56,000 students in this group last year of whom about 42,500 cleared the exams. While the board is yet to announce assessment criteria for students, experts feel the overall number of students clearing Class XII and applying for college admissions will far exceed that of last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/relief-for-engg-colleges-worry-for-others/articleshow/83185621.cms||Bharat Yagnik

---||Delhi||RML doc suggests use of cheaper alternative||New Delhi: Can potassium iodide (KI), a cheap and easily available drug, help treat black fungus, also known as mucormycosis? Dr Kabir Sardana, professor of dermatology at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, thinks so. “We recently had a 54-year-old patient who was suffering from mucormycosis. She was administered amphotericin B. But, despite the medication, the fungal infection continued to spread and affected her skin. KI was used to salvage her condition successfully,” Dr Sardana said. Amphotericin B forms the first line of treatment for mucormycosis along with surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. The RML doctor said liposomal amphotericin was started in the 54-year-old patient but the dose could not be increased to the standard dose of 5 mg/kg due to low levels of potassium secondary to the drug and insulin. That’s why she was put on potassium supplements and the infection was successfully treated. Though KI has been used widely for treatment of fungal infections like sporotrichosis and subcutaneous zygomycosis, its use in mucormycosis is limited to solitary case reports. Dr Sardana said the drug has the potential to be repurposed for in the current Covid-19 epidemic to treat mucormycosis cases as there is paucity of the listed antifungal drugs. KI is an oral solution that is administered usually with a fruit juice to mask the taste and costs around Rs 200 for a 100 ml bottle. On the other hand, drugs like amphotericin B, voricanazole, posaconazole are very expensive, priced for thousands of rupees. Delhi High Court had recently directed the government to address the shortage of medicines to treat black fungus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rml-doc-suggests-use-of-cheaper-alternative/articleshow/83217342.cms||---

His family approached the court following which a warrant officer visited the SBS police post, which is under Dugri police station, and got the man released. Police officers, refuting the allegations, said the man was involved in a drug peddling case and was called to the police station on Tuesday to join the investigation. Dharminder Kumar, 40, who is a salesman, said on May 27 he was going from Samrala Chowk towards Dugri Road on his scooter. Near Dugri Road, a few men in civil dress stopped him, slapped him and snatched his mobile phone. Initially he thought they were robbers, but when the accused took him along on their bike to the SBS police post, he learnt that they were cops. Dharminder alleged, “The cops tortured me in the lockup. They kept forcing me to accept that I am a drug peddler. I requested them to let me talk to my family, but they paid no heed. On Sunday, my family got to know my whereabouts, but the cops did not allow them to meet me. They also demanded Rs 3 lakh to release me. But I am a salesman and don’t have the money to give them.”On Tuesday, Dharminder’s family approached the Punjab and Haryana high court, after which the warrant officer visited SBS police post around 9:30pm. Thereafter, Dharminder was released.Dugri SHO inspector Surinder Chopra said, “A few days back we had arrested a drug peddler who revealed that he purchases drugs from Dharminder. Thereafter, the police asked Dharminder to join the investigation. On Tuesday, he came to the police post to join the investigation and in the meanwhile his family approached the court. We neither tortured him nor demanded money. He came on Tuesday morning, not on May 27.”“Dharminder will be nominated in the NDPS Act case,” added Chopra. On the other hand, Dharminder said, “I will complain against the Dugri police as they tortured me for six days. If not given justice, I will immolate myself outside the office of commissioner of police.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/40-year-old-accuses-police-of-illegal-detention-torture/articleshow/83183904.cms||Payal Dhawan

The kin also demanded action against the Congress councillor, his two sons and other on-the-run accused. Mani Khehra, brother of Rinkle, said, “Earlier, too, it was said that Rinkle was murdered due to his rivalry with the Congress leader and his sons. Now, main accused Sunny Nai has also confessed it in his videos and that he was a friend of Neetu and his sons and due to the friendship, he had agreed to kill Rinkle. But the SIT had given a clean chit to Neetu. In the wake of Sunny’s confession, police should nominate him and other accused in the case and arrest them.” “A copy of the letter given to the commissioner of police has also been sent to the CM, the DGP, the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana high court and the chairperson of Punjab State Human Rights Commission. I have also shared the videos of Sunny with them. We also demand a fresh probe by an IPS official and quick action against the accused,” he added. Mani said if police failed to arrest the accused, he would move the high court against them.In September 2018, Rinkle, a BJP supporter, was assaulted to death at his house in Amarpura. It was alleged that Rinkle had a fight with Congress councillor Neetu in February 2018 during elections and that led to a rivalry between the two. The SIT formed in the case is tightlipped after the video went viral, with no official ready to give a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/kin-seek-fresh-probe-action-against-accused/articleshow/83183866.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Delhi||No compromise between Sushil Kumar and Jathedi gang?||NEW DELHI: Dubai-based gangster Kala Jathedi and his Man Friday, Sonu Mahaal, seem to be in no mood to mend fences with arrested wrestler and two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar. Mahaal, who was among those assaulted by Kumar on the night of May 4, has been nurturing a grudge against him and his aide, Ajay, since March. The investigation has revealed that the two factions had clashed two months ago over a girl. Jathedi’s nephew, Mahaal, had celebrated his girlfriend’s birthday at a flat in Model Town during which Kumar’s best friend, Ajay, had allegedly misbehaved with her and also clicked her pictures. This outraged Mahaal who, along with Sagar Dhankad, got into a verbal spat with Ajay and Kumar. Read AlsoPolice plea for extension of Olympian’s custody junkedNew Delhi: A city court on Wednesday dismissed the police plea seeking three more days of custody of wrestler Sushil Kumar and another accused arrested in an alleged murder case of wrestler Sagar Dhankad. Metropolitan magistrate Rashmi Gupta noted that the accused had already been in police custodyTaking advantage of the situation, Kumar asked Mahaal and Sagar to vacate the flat. This angered Jathedi even more because he had helped Kumar usurp the disputed flat and wanted a share. Sources said the assault was a second blow to the Jathedi gang that had been wanting to avenge the ill treatment meted out to Mahaal’s girlfriend. This was why Jathedi refused to compromise with Kumar while he was on the run. TOI was the first to report that Kumar faced a threat to his life from Jathedi and not just police, but the gangster’s men were also after him. Kumar’s counsel on Wednesday requested the court to ensure his security in jail, while informing that his life was under threat from “big gangs”. A demand for a separate cell was also made. Trouble became manifold for Kumar after a video surfaced allegedly showing him assaulting Dhankad at Chhatrasal Stadium on the night of May 4. Dhankad, who was seen lying on the ground in the video, died later. In the video, the wrestler could also be seen holding a stick/baseball bat. There were a dozen others in the frame too. The video was shot by Kumar’s associate Prince, who was also arrested. Kumar allegedly wanted to circulate the video in the wrestling circle, apart from rival gangs, to “send a message across” and prove his dominance. Prince had shared the video with a few of his friends. Police had also stumbled upon another picture that showed Kumar with Jathedi’s brother. Jathedi has a reward of Rs 7 lakh on him. He had been grabbing disputed properties in Delhi. Kumar allegedly joined hands with him a while ago and landed the flat in M2-Block of Model Town, which was at the centre of the entire controversy. This flat was used to shelter criminals belonging to the Jathedi-Lawrence Bishnoi gang and many crime plots had been hatched there, said an officer. Kumar later joined hands with gangsters Neeraj Bawana and Naveen Bali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-compromise-between-sushil-jathedi-gang/articleshow/83185683.cms||---

A police team, led by senior inspector Sudhakar Kate, recovered 16 four-wheelers worth Rs1.2 crore from Kalpesh Pangekar (33) of Yerawada and Naman Sahani (39) of Lohegaon and their accomplices, Sunny Kamble (29) of Khadki and Sandip Gunjal (37), Hitesh Chandaliya (27) and Ronit Kadam (28) from Yerawada. “The suspects had sold off these cars in and around Pune by accepting a token amount from Rs1 lakh to Rs2 lakh.” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. The commissioner has announced a cash reward of Rs50,000 for the Chinchwad police team. Sunil Rakhpasare, a resident of Chinchwad, had filed an FIR on May 19, claiming that Pangekar and Sahani had promised him a monthly income in the form of rent for his car. The duo took away his car four months ago. They neither gave him any money nor returned his car. Only once Rakhpasare managed to trace the duo and at that time they abused and threatened him. “The duo were initially not traceable. We finally arrested them on May 30. Pangekar and Sahani revealed the names of their accomplices, who would work as agents to identify the car owners in need of money and potential buyers,” Krishna Prakash said. The suspects would identify the car owners in need of money, as their vehicles remained idle due to the lockdown. They would promise the owners a monthly income of Rs25,000 as rent of their car. “Worried about EMIs and vehicle maintenance, people would easily fall prey to the offer. The suspects then would make an ‘agreement’ with the owners and collect the original vehicle documents,” Kate said, adding that the suspects would never pay any money to the car owners. If anyone persuaded them, they would threaten them with consequences. The suspects would then disappear with the vehicle. “Using the original documents, they would sell the car. They would promise to complete the necessary formalities post lockdown,” Kate said, before adding that the police expect to recover more cars from the suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-bust-gang-of-car-rental-cheats-recover-16-vehicles/articleshow/83185708.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Delhi||Police plea for extension of Olympian’s custody junked||New Delhi: A city court on Wednesday dismissed the police plea seeking three more days of custody of wrestler Sushil Kumar and another accused arrested in an alleged murder case of wrestler Sagar Dhankad. Metropolitan magistrate Rashmi Gupta noted that the accused had already been in police custody for 10 days. “It has been correctly submitted on behalf of the accused that no new ground has been raised for seeking further police remand of three days... No ground for grant of further police custody of the accused is made out,” the court held. The order further underscored, “As per settled law, police custody should not be granted in a mechanical manner. It should be granted only when the situation so warrants and is justified. The application prays for further remand of the accused for three days for recovery of mobile phones used by them, clothes they were wearing at the time of incident, digital video recording of the CCTV camera installed at Kumar’s house and the danda that was used.” Additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava sought the extension of Kumar’s custody terming a purported video of the incident to be “clinching evidence” in which the wrestler could be seen holding a stick in his hand. He said the stick was yet to be recovered and labelled the crime as “cold-blooded murder”. He further claimed that the clothes worn by the accused were yet to be recovered. Appearing for Kumar, advocate Pradeep Rana submitted that the wrestler was a “victim of circumstances”. “No firearm was used in the crime. The prosecution says it is a crystal clear video. You have the video and the alleged eyewitness, then why are you running after the clothes? They are simply beating around the bush. There is no ground given. In all, 240 hours were given to the investigating agency. Police remand cannot be without any special reason. Out of the 11 accused, nine have been arrested. From the last 10 days, have they been recovering a danda?” asked the counsel. Rana said if the court was not granting police custody and Kumar was being remanded to judicial custody, then a separate cell should be provided and he should be allowed to take supplements to maintain his physical health. The counsel also pointed out that Kumar had already spent 10 days in custody and the contentions raised in the remand plea could have been taken care of in that time. Advocate Sumit Shokeen, who appeared for Ajay Kumar, also opposed the police’s remand plea arguing that the accused had been taken to different cities, as sought again in the present hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-plea-for-extension-of-olympians-custody-junked/articleshow/83185766.cms||---

The fare for Type B, C and D ambulance service includes oxygen, ambulance equipment, PPE kits, gloves, mask, face shield, sanitiser, driver, emergency medical technician and doctor. Principal secretary, transport, Rajesh Kumar Singh said that ambulance has been kept out of the ambit of permit and tax regulations in the MV Act as its operation is a social service and not a commercial use. Though there have been notifications issued by the districts from time to time to control the fare of ambulance services there is a variation in the rate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pvt-ambulance-service-fare-fixed-by-state-govt/articleshow/83187508.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao plans reshuffle of top officials||HYDERABAD: With major elections over in the state and the Covid-19 cases graph witnessing a decline, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is set to undertake a major reshuffle of bureaucrats soon. The last major reshuffle was effected last year, in which about 50 officers were transferred. Government officials said the proposed rejig was supposed to happen after the March budget session, but the CM could not go ahead due to a surge in Covid-19 cases and urban local body elections in April. Seemingly unhappy with the performance of some senior officers, the CM is likely to shunt them out, and also fill some of the vacant slots. Apart from the rejig in IAS ranks, the government is also likely to shift IPS officers. Sources said the government is likely to transfer GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar. “There were allegations that the GHMC commissioner had failed to take relief measures during the last October floods. The government is also not happy with Covid-19 containment measures, and also poor sanitation drive in Greater Hyderabad,” a senior CMO official said. Minister KT Rama Rao had instructed zonal municipal commissioners to buck up, and take up massive sanitation in the city during the pandemic, the official said. With the new kharif season beginning this month and Rythu Bandhu disbursement set to start in next two weeks, filling up agriculture secretary post assumes importance. Principal secretary, agriculture, B Janardhan Reddy has been made chairman of the Telangana State Public Service Commission and panchayat raj commissioner M Raghunandan Rao, who is holding the additional charge of agriculture secretary, is likely to be shifted to the agriculture department. After special chief secretary Chitra Ramachandran superannuated from her office on April 30, Sandeep Kumar Sultania has been holding the additional charge as principal secretary of education. The government is looking out for a new face to fill the important post in the education department. Key posts like HMDA metropolitan commissioner have been lying vacant for more than three years and principal secretary Arvind Kumar is in-charge metropolitan commissioner for more than two years. Sandeep Kumar, who is acting chief for several departments like panchayat raj, animal husbandry, energy and education, will be relieved from some of the departments, sources said. Chief secretary Somesh Kumar has been holding additional charge of departments like land revenue, stamp and registrations, excise and commercial taxes. “Since KCR is focusing on revenue issues, a senior officer would be made incharge,” sources said. Among district collectors, Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri collector Anita Ramachandran has completed four years there, and is likely to be made panchayat raj and rural development commissioner. Collector posts for Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Bhadradri-Kothagudem, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Adilabad (leave) need to be filled. The government is also likely to shuffle IPS officers. These include police commissioners and SPs, who have completed two to four years in their present postings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-plans-reshuffle-of-top-officials/articleshow/83185688.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kochi||Kerala: Had met accused, admits BJP leader||THRISSUR: The team probing Kodakara heist case questioned BJP’s Thrissur district president, advocate KK Aneeshkumar, on Wednesday. Later, Aneeshkumar said he told the police that he had met one of the accused in the case after the incident, and that the party district committee had arranged rooms for Dharmarajan, the complainant in the heist case. Aneeshkumar conceded that BJP had conducted a parallel probe in the heist case. He alleged that BJP was not aware that Dharmarajan had sent money in his car and denied involvement of BJP leaders in the transportation of money or its looting. He also clarified that he had asked Deepak, an accused, to come to the district committee office based on the complaint given by Dharmarajan to the committee. “Dharmarajan had said police told him that Deepak, who was a BJP activist, and his brother-in-law Ranjit were part of the team who executed the looting plan. Media reports had alleged that BJP leaders in the district were behind the highway heist. So we had to find more details. Based on the information provided by Deepak, we also went to Kannur to explore the possibility of getting some more information in the case. These steps were taken to establish that BJP leaders were not behind the attack,” he said. SIT headed by Thrissur DIG A Akbar tried to get CCTV visuals from BJP district committee office to know about the alleged visit of the looting case accused there. But party officials said the CCTV was not working. Aneeshkumar claimed that Dharmarajan was assigned by BJP to bring election materials like emblems, election slips. When asked about Dharmarajan’s reported statement that he brought the money for BJP, Aneeshkumar said, “Police is claiming that Dharmarajan told them so. If he made such a statement to the police, he must have been trying to hide something.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/had-met-accused-admits-bjp-leader/articleshow/83185697.cms||T Ramavarman

In one of these actions, the Bhosari MIDC police arrested a four-member gang and recovered 24 stolen motorcycles worth Rs16 lakh from them. “The kingpin of the gang, Akash Badhe (22) of Moshi, is a computer engineer and was selected for the Amy recruitment in Bengaluru. He, however, did not join the Army. He used to steal motorcycles for easy money,” Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner Krishna Prakash said. Badhe, along with accomplices Vilas More (22), Akshay Jadhav (21) and Hrishikesh Pingle (21), used to steal the motorcycles by using master keys. “They had sold off these motorcycles in Solapur district at throwaway prices,” Krishna Prakash said. He said the police have traced the owners of 20 motorcycles. “We are yet to trace the owners of the remaining four motorcycles,” he said. In another action, the Bhosari police have recovered 21 stolen motorcycles, worth Rs17.5 lakh. The Bhosari police have arrested vehicle thieves (on their record) Akshay More (24), Rahul Patil (23), Akshay Khose (21) and Ganesh Janrao (22) and recovered 11 stolen motorcycles.

The suspended cops include SHO (Kudi Bhagtasni) Julfikar Ali and three constables — Sardar Singh, Gyan Chand Meena and Shanti Lal, from the same police station.According to the sources, the three constables had apprehended a drug smuggler and recovered 2kg opium from him. After this, they began negotiations with the accused and not only extorted a hefty amount from him, but also kept the opium with them and let him off.“When the complaint in the matter reached the police commissioner, he got the matter investigated and on finding it to be true, suspended the three constables on Tuesday night,” said an officer, adding that none of the three appeared before the investigating officer despite summoning them.Though SHO Ali was not found to be directly involved in this negotiation, it was learnt that he had the knowledge about this deal by his constables, but he did not take any action against them. “So, considering this act as his connivance into the matter, police commissioner Jose Mohan suspended him, too, on Wednesday,” said the officer.Though the exact amount extorted by the trio from the accused smuggler is not yet known, it is believed to be about Rs 4-5 lakh.“We have handed the investigation to an officer of the rank of ACP. Their headquarters would now be the office of police commissioner, Jodhpur,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sho-3-cops-suspended-for-extortion-from-peddler/articleshow/83187512.cms||---
---||Delhi||Govt seeks closure of 10 thermal power plants in SC petition||New Delhi: Delhi government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking closure of the ten thermal power plants situated in the vicinity of Delhi that have been using old/outdated polluting technology. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that 10 coal-fired thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were contributing significantly to the air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Rai said the government had been taking several steps to improve the air quality of Delhi under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal. “We have been writing to the government of India and requesting their cooperation regarding pollution from thermal plants. However, no action has been taken against these thermal plants, and instead, they are being allowed to pollute with total disregard for the health of citizens. We hope that the Supreme Court will take the necessary steps and direct closure of these plants on an urgent basis,” he added. The Union ministry of power had revised the timeline given to these thermal plants for compliance to December 2019 as against the earlier deadline of 2018. “However, the CPCB arbitrarily extended the deadline for compliance with the emission norms beyond December 2019 to 2022. Further, according to the new notification, non-compliance by these power plants will not lead to the closure of the polluting units but they would continue to pollute subject to the payment of a mere penalty amount,” said Rai. The environment minister said various studies had highlighted the effects of the pollutants from such coal-fired power plants on the health of communities. The ill-effects are more pronounced for vulnerable individuals, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and persons suffering from asthma and lung diseases. He also quoted a 2018 study by TERI, which stated that 60% of the PM 2.5 in Delhi originates from sources outside Delhi. The ten thermal power plants are—Dadri NCTPP and Harduaganj TPS in UP; GH TPS (Lehra Mohabbat), Nabha TPP, Ropar TPS and Talwandi Sabo TPP in Punjab; and Yamunanagar TPS, Indira Gandhi STPP, Panipat TPS and Rajiv Gandhi TPS in Haryana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-seeks-closure-of-10-thermal-power-plants-in-sc-petition/articleshow/83217459.cms||---
---||Nashik||‘Focus on testing relatives of patients in home isolation’||Nashik: District health officer (DHO) Dr Kapil Aher said the health department will be focusing on the relatives of the Covid patients, who are placed under home isolation, to prevent the spread of the infection.Concerned with the rise in case while patients are in home isolation during the second wave across Nashik, the district health authorities have decided to ensure each of the relatives of the Covid patients in home isolation are retested after few days despite the relatives testing negative earlier. “Since entire families have tested positive during the second wave, the observations have made it clear that the relatives of patients who tested negative in the first test often test positive after 10 days and that’s when symptoms start showing up,” he said. The officer said after an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic person tests positive, the RT-PCR tests of the relatives is also conducted. “Many times they test negative. After the patient is advised home isolation, the lack of infrastructure or not sticking to the guidelines leads to the spread of infection,” Aher said. Since they test negative, the relatives discard any kinds of symptoms they may be experiencing after few days despite having told them to consult the doctor and not take any self-medication during these times. The symptoms sometimes grow from mild to moderate requiring institutional isolations like dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC). This ‘denial mode’ has been the basic reason for the occupancy in DCHC.The health department will now focus on ‘negative’ tested relatives of the patients and conduct their Covid tests on the fifth day for early intervention, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/focus-on-testing-relatives-of-patients-in-home-isolation/articleshow/83181987.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Responding to an appeal from New Market traders, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) on Tuesday evening extended the three-hour business window granted by the state to individual retail shops to stores in the heritage market as well. Around 70% of the 2,500-odd shops in the market opened around noon and spent the three hours dusting and cleaning the stores. Though the grocery, vegetable, meat and spice range at the market had been doing business during the morning hours (7am to 10am), the rest of the market situated in the main heritage block with retail stores that sell apparel, saris, jewellery, cosmetics and food items has been shut since May 16 when the enhanced restrictions were announced. The recent relaxations granted on May 31 came into effect on Tuesday with retail shops across the city opening for business between noon and 3pm. “The market department of KMC has allowed us to open during the restricted retail hours. However, other markets in the vicinity, including Sriram Arcade, stayed shut as it was awaiting clarity. While business will be slow to pick up, keeping the stores operational will ensure that there is no damage to goods from seepage during rain,” SS Hogg Market Traders’ Association president Ashok Gupta said. New Market depends largely on Bangladeshi shoppers for business. Nearly half the customers are Bangladeshis. For a year and a half now, this clientele has disappeared due to restrictions on travel during the pandemic. The local customers who were visiting the market also stopped after restrictions were introduced on May 1. The state had then announced curbs that allowed only standalone shops and KMC local markets to operate for three hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. In New Market, vegetable, spice and meat ranges were allowed to open but the rest of the market had stayed shut. Prior to Eid, KMC granted permission for New Market to open for two hours in the evening following a plea from traders so that they could cater to Eid shoppers and earn some revenue. Other markets in the vicinity were also allowed to operate between 5pm and 7pm. On May 1, the state had announced curbs that allowed standalone shops and KMC local markets to operate for three hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. It had then again shut down on May 16 following the imposition of stricter curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-mkt-reopens-after-16-days-goes-empty/articleshow/83185725.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad spends Rs 1,800 per water link, Bengaluru Rs 19,000||AHMEDABAD: Just metering municipal water connections in a city does not guarantee efficient water use or reduce water wastage, argue economist and former planning commission member Y K Alagh and planner at Cept University, P Sampath. But proper water distribution through a designed pipe network backed by water accounting, efficient operation and maintenance can address accountability. In their recent research paper, presented at the sixteenth World Water Congress, the authors compare two cities, Bangalore, which has a near 99% metered water connections and Ahmedabad, where metered connections are in minuscule numbers.  In Ahmedabad, where 1,369 million litres of water (MLD) is supplied to citizens each day, there is a wide difference in distribution of water. For instance, Navrangpura, Paldi, SP Stadium, Chandkheda and Motera wards, which are under the West Zone, are supplied 278 MLD, the North Zone is supplied 207 MLD, South Zone 223MLD , the posh North West and South West zones combined get 278 MLD, according to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) water supply department. The research emphasised the need for water audits. “Water audit provides information to control subsidy and to keep equity in distribution of water as a natural resource. Subsidy should be given to the poor only,” the paper says. It also added that for Ahmedabad and other Gujarat cities, the state government should declare water quantification mandatory and establish a control mechanism. “Bengaluru has very limited groundwater because of its hilly topography; more than 900 MLD raw water is procured from the Cauvery, 97km away, and is pumped, treated and supplied at a cost of Rs 19,000 per connection, while in Ahmedabad, which draws its water from the Narmada canal 5km away, the cost comes to Rs 1,800 per connection,” the paper says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-spends-rs-1-8k-per-water-link-bluru-rs-19k/articleshow/83185731.cms||---
---||Pune||Man held for cheating aspirants seeking Army, government jobs||Pune: The city crime branch on Wednesday arrested Bharat Krishna Kate, proprietor of a private coaching academy in Solapur, and booked three others on the charge of cheating four aspirants from Udgir in Latur district of Rs13.5 lakh on the pretext of helping them secure jobs in the Army or Indian Railways since August 20 last year. One of the three booked in the case has also been detained for questioning. The four suspects are also accused of having created a fake website of Head Quarter and Territorial Army, besides taking the job aspirants to Delhi, Jhansi, Jabalpur, Jharkhand, Ranchi and other places as part of the ‘recruitment process’. City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “We have registered an FIR for cheating and forgery with the Mundhwa police on the basis of separate inputs shared by military intelligence (under the Army Southern Command). This input is not related to the two FIRs registered with the Vishrantwadi and Wanowrie police stations regarding the army question paper leak case.” “In this case, we have found that the coaching academy and Army websites were fake. The suspects also forged documents for cheating job aspirants. A few youths have approached us with complaints but the actual number of people getting duped is more. We expect more details to emerge during further investigation,” Gupta added. The Army too issued a release stating that the racket was busted jointly by the Army and police authorities based on a tip-off provided by the Southern Command intelligence agencies. “The aspirants were made to bear expenses for travel, boarding and lodging at different dubious locations and appear for fake written exams, medical tests and training,” the release said. “These touts were charging Rs4-5 lakh from the aspiring candidates. The aspirants were made to believe about their selection through fake call letters, admit cards, joining letters, medical tests and training at dubious locations. They are part of a bigger racket which is being probed by crime branch and the Army,” the release said. Senior inspector Hemant Patil from the crime branch (unit VI) said, “The case came to light after Salman Shaikh (21), who doubted the joining letter issued by the suspects, approached the Territorial Army unit in Ghorpadi to get it verified.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-held-for-cheating-aspirants-seeking-army-government-jobs/articleshow/83185789.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||Now, Santhosh hails Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath's government vaccination plan for under-12 kids’ parents||LUCKNOW: A day after hailing Yogi Adityanath government for bringing down the daily Covid count by 93%, BJP national general secretary (organisation), BL Santhosh on Wednesday termed the UP government's decision to vaccinate parents of children aged below 12 years as "wise" given the chances of a possible third wave, which is expected to affect the children. Santhosh's statements were seen with much curiosity within the saffron camp as it marked an endorsement of the Yogi government by a top BJP leader who also happens to be a close affiliate of the RSS. As general secretary (organisation), he acts as a bridge between the BJP and the Sangh and is responsible for coordination between the government and the party's organisational machinery. Political experts said that Santhosh's stance vis-a-vis UP government was a clear indication of the Sangh coming in defence of CM Yogi Adityanath who has not only been in the line of fire of the opposition but also some dissenting voices within the saffron camp over alleged mishandling of pandemic. This comes after Santhosh and BJP vice-president Radha Mohan Singh camped in Lucknow for two days and personally met party's organisational leaders and ministers separately as part of a wide strategic exercise to begin the spadework for the high-stake UP assembly elections due next year. Santhosh is also learnt to have taken the feedback about the party MLAs and MPs who spoke openly against the state government in the peak of crisis. Sources said that the two top BJP leaders are expected to meet PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda later this week to give their feedback. The prevailing political situation in UP, sources said, is also expected to be taken up for discussion by senior BJP leaders with the RSS brass as well. “We have provided our inputs to the two senior party leaders. The ball is now in the court of national leadership,” said a senior UP BJP leader. He said that the exercise of sprucing up organisational machinery for the assembly elections got delayed because of the pandemic. According to him, Nadda who visited Lucknow in January was expected to come back in March or April but could not because of the pandemic. Speculations are rife about Nadda and Shah’s visit soon after the second wave subsidies. “The national leadership has been reaching out to the UP unit virtually,” the leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-santhosh-hails-yogi-govts-vax-plan-for-under-12-kids-parents/articleshow/83187530.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Kolkata||225 roads on Kolkata traffic police one-way list||KOLKATA: Darga Road that was made one-way with vehicles being allowed to move from CIT Road towards Rifle Range during the construction of the Maa flyover has finally been reverted to a two-way street. Till now, only buses were allowed to ply on the road in both directions. Also, buses have been allowed to turn in to New Park Street from AJC Bose Road near Mullick Bazar between 7am and 1pm along with autos when other vehicles are only allowed in the opposite direction. After 1pm, all vehicles will be allowed to move towards Park Circus seven-point crossing. These are among the significant changes made by traffic cops on Wednesday after a four-month review of the one-way traffic flow system in the city. The complete list has designated around 225 roads as partly or completely one-way. The notification on several streets formalises traffic flow practices that already exist. For instance, Strand Road has followed the oneway rule in the direction of Howrah Bridge from Babughat for years like Thackeray Road in Alipore, where traffic plied in both directions. The notification issued by traffic police has only made them official. What may pose a problem for motorists is the varying oneway timings of streets excluding major throughfares across the city. While the one-way rule was till now applicable from 7am to 1pm in one direction and from 1pm to 10pm in the opposite direction, the timings have been changed with some roads like Sukia Street changing direction at 2pm, instead of 1pm. Another complication is in New Alipore. Traffic on Nalini Ranjan Avenue currently flows towards Majerhat from 7am to 1pm and in the opposite direction from 1pm to 10pm. Now New Alipore-bound traffic will be allowed all the day while traffic towards Majerhat will be allowed twice a day — once between 6am to 4pm and then between 10pm and 6am. Roads in and around Burrabazar-Posta will see one-way timings between 8am and 9.30pm. “A few traffic guards like the ones at Howrah, Ultadanga and Metiabruz will witness more changes,” said DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/225-roads-on-kp-one-way-list/articleshow/83185819.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

He then dragged her body 70-80 metres on the street, harbouring panic and terror across the area. The couple’s 9-month-old son was also injured in the attack and succumbed to injuries during treatment in a hospital on Wednesday. The accused, who fled after committing the crime, later surrendered. Pintu, alias Sunil Valmiki, killed his wife Seema (35) with an axe at his house on Tuesday, DSP and CO of the area Ramkalyan said. Sunil then dragged his wife body for about 70-80 metres on the street and left it at a place when people came out of their houses, he added. Following a complaint about the incident, police reached the spot and recovered the body and sent it to a mortuary for post-mortem, he added. The couple’s son, Avinash, who also sustained serious injuries in the attack, succumbed during treatment in a hospital on Wednesday, the CO said. The motive behind the murder is yet to be probed. Sources said Sunil killed his wife after a brawl. Initial investigation revealed the couple was married around 15 years ago and had two sons, one 9 years old and other a toddler. According to police, the couple was not on good terms for the last few years and the woman was at her brother’s house on Tuesday afternoon when her husband reached there and brought his wife and the younger son with him to his house in Bhatapada, Rampura SHO Hansraj Meena said. The accused man was a daily wage laborer and was an occasional consumer of liquor and was not drunken at the time of crime on Tuesday late evening, he further said. “After initial investigation, Pintu was arrested for the double murder. The accused reached the city police station after the crime on Tuesday evening and admitted to the crime following which he had been detained,” Kota city SP Vikas Pathak said.

The government will purchase every single grain of wheat, the CM added. His statement gained significance in the backdrop of the scheduled wheat procurement season coming to a close by June 15. Reiterating his stand of safeguarding the farmers’ interest, Yogi said that the wheat procurement was not merely limited to the prescribed procurement target. Till Wednesday, the state government managed to procure 41.56 lakh metric tonnes of wheat, which was nearly 63% more than last year when 24.76 lakh MT was purchased. Food commissioner Manish Chauhan said that around 8.83 farmers have already been benefited from the ongoing procurement operations. “We have made a payment of Rs 6355.45 crores directly into bank accounts of farmers against sale of their wheat crop on the directions of the Centre,” Chauhan said. The state government had nominated seven purchasing agencies, including the Mandi Parishad and Food Corporation of India. He said that all precautions, including setting up of a Covid desk at all purchase centres, were being taken in the wake of the pandemic to prevent farmers from getting infected. He also maintained that the state government was taking all precautions to save the wheat from getting damaged in rains. Meanwhile, the state government will start providing free foodgrain under Prime Minister Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) to about 14.71 crore beneficiaries from Thursday. The beneficiaries and migrants would be eligible to get foodgrains from any fair price shop only from June 13 to 15, a state government spokesperson said. Yogi said in a statement that no eligible beneficiary be left out of the free ration distribution scheme in the state. Under the scheme fivekg free ration (three-kg wheat and two-kg rice grain) will be given to the beneficiaries. In May, over 7,04,518 metric tonnes of ration was distributed under the scheme to over 14 crore beneficiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-single-grain-of-wheat-to-be-purchased-says-yogi/articleshow/83187562.cms||---

The police lodged a case of unnatural death under Section 174 of CrPC and handed over the two bodies to respective family members after postmortem later in the day on Wednesday. The deceased couple was identified as, Om Prakesh Saini (22) and Khushbu Saini (aged 18 to 19 years), residents of Kothyapapdi village in Lakheri area of Bundi district.

---||Goa||Tejpal acquittal like manual for rape victims, says Bombay high court||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday issued notice to Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal in the state’s appeal challenging his acquittal by a trial court in an alleged rape case, and said some observations in the judgment regarding the conduct of the survivor after the alleged incident were “kind of a manual for rape victims”. “There is a prima facie case for consideration of leave to appeal under Section 378 of the Criminal Procedure Code,” justice S C Gupte said. The notice is returnable on June 24. During the hearing, solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta raised the point that the judge discussed the conduct of the survivor and how a victim of a sexual offence should behave. He also took strong objections to the observations made by the trial court regarding conduct of the survivor when she was kissed by the accused. Mehta told the high court that on perusal of the judgment, “one cannot make out” if the survivor or the accused was on trial. “The entire judgment proceeds as if the victim is on trial,” he said. “It is not possible to believe that the prosecutrix (survivor), a woman who is aware of laws, intelligent, alert and physically fit (a yoga trainer), would not push or ward off the accused if she got pushed up against the wall, especially when she was facing him, and especially when she saw the accused coming uncomfortably close to her in her private space,” Mehta quoted the sessions court judgment as saying. The solicitor general said trial judge Kshama Joshi remained a mute spectator and didn’t prevent the defence from raising questions about the survivor’s previous conduct. Mehta also said that the judgment states that the survivor consulted certain people (lawyers), and that has been held against the survivor. He then asked the judge to redact the name of these “eminent lawyers” from the judgment. “We have redacted most of the direct references to the victim’s identity”, justice Gupte said, adding that this matter (of deleting the lawyers’ names) can be raised during the next hearing. Earlier this month, Joshi acquitted the accused, stating, “Upon considering the other evidence on record, the benefit of doubt is given to the accused, as there is no corroborative evidence supporting the allegations made by the prosecutrix, and the deposition of the prosecutrix also shows improvement, material contradictions, omissions and change of versions, which does not inspire confidence”. She had also said, “It is crucial to note that the contradictions are often so glaring that the exact opposite of what the prosecutrix is claiming actually happens on the screen, yet the investigation officer didn’t even question the prosecutrix on the same”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tejpal-acquittal-like-manual-for-rape-victims-hc/articleshow/83187553.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Pune||Over 70% work of removing loose boulders completed: CR||Pune: The Central Railway has completed over 70% work related to the removal of loose boulders on the south east and north east ghat sections, an official said, adding that the entire maintenance work of both sections would be completed before the arrival of monsoon. “The tenders for different kinds of work on both ghat sections were awarded in December last year and the work started in March. Loose boulders on the hills are a major risk and they need to be removed. Over 70% of the work has been completed, so far and we are sure that all the work will be completed before the monsoon set in,” Shivaji Sutar, the chief public relations officer (CPRO) of the Central Railway told TOI. During the monsoon, both ghat sections become increasingly susceptible to major landslides and boulders falling off on the tracks and the trains from the adjoining hills. While there were no major incidents last year, in 2019 and 2018 there were instances of major rail traffic disruptions on both ghat areas because of many landslides and boulder falling incidents. “The removal of loose boulders is important and a boulder special train is being used for it. The train comprises flat wagons and two diesel engines in the front and rear. Trained men ride on the train and carry on the work of identifying and scanning for such boulders and then removing them. At present, two such trains are being used in both ghat sections,” the CPRO said. With the pandemic resulting in the train movements dropping considerably, the rail officials said that they were not taking chances. “The work on the cleaning of drains near the tracks is also being done. Even with less rail traffice, we cannot take any chances as there are still trains that pass continuously on both the ghats,” another official told TOI. The south east ghat section, also commonly known as the Karjat-Lonavla section, is around 28km-long and comprises around 28 tunnels. The north east ghat section is around 14km-long and comprises around 18 tunnels. In 2017, a big boulder had slipped and crashed through the roof of one of the compartment of the Hubballi-LTT Express near Lonavla, injuring three passengers. “Drones are being used to monitor the ghat section and the mountains. At present, the south east ghat section has 82 CCTV cameras, while the north east section has 48 cameras for continuous monitoring. The equipment is being checked too so that they work fine and don’t develop snags once monsoon sets in,” the CPRO said.

In fact, just one child succumbed to the disease during this period. Official data revealed that more than 13,000 children in Nashik district, aged up to 12 years, were infected, which is more than twice the number of cases in the first wave. “In the first wave, we had 6,108 children suffering from the infection and there were two deaths. In the second wave, the number of infections increased 125% but the death count reduced from two to one,” said civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat. He has appealed to citizens to take necessary precautions and not worry about the infection among the children. Moreover, more than 95% of the infected children were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. A large number of the patients were treated at their home. Even today, as many as 676 patients in this age group are taking treatment and almost all of them are at home. Very few of them are admitted to hospitals and no child is currently critical. “Children have strong immunity and the immunization programmes carried out in the recent past helped them fight the infection. Hence it is important for the parents to understand that they need to take care and not worry about the treatment,” he said. Dr Thorat said the three children who died due to Covid had some other health problems too. They were unable to fight the disease like other children. The district authorities have already set up a taskforce of paediatricians to deal with Covid cases among children, especially in the third wave. Few of the paediatric hospitals have already started applying for the permission to treat covid patients. The administration has said that the permissions would be given only after certain conditions – isolation of wards, arrangement for parents etc are met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/13000-kids-got-covid-1-died-during-2nd-wave-in-nashik/articleshow/83182013.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops likely to grill Ukrainian||KOLKATA: The city detectives may question a Ukrainian national arrested by Faridabad police and now lodged in prison in connection with Man-In-The-Middle cyber attack on ATMs leading to over Rs 2-crore fraud. According to inputs received from the Faridabad police, the accused, about whom TOI reported in its Tuesday edition, has spoken of his gang having members from UP, Jharkhand and Meghalaya. The fact that many of them are on the run makes them prime suspects. Lalbazar officers have learned that before the attacks in the city, similar crimes were committed by that gang in Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Delhi. “We still need confirmation that the same gang was involved here. But given that the gang had last been stuck in NCR last month and the first crime in Kolkata was committed on May 14, the links are too strong to ignore. The fact that some of the suspects — hailing from western UP and Jharkhand — have broken the Haryana police radar soon after is also crucial information,” explained an officer. The cops in Kolkata have now traced a hotel in the Topsia-Park Circus area where the accused might have put up while they were in Kolkata. The cops say that the original interstate gang stayed at hotels and travelled extensively for recce. “The same modus operandi was likely to have been used here too,” said an officer. CCTV footage from the hotel where the suspects had allegedly stayed has been collected. The third lead has emerged from the money trail in these cases. “As with any financial fraud, the money trail is important. We have sought help from Faridabad police and the private bank whose ATMs were attacked to help us trace similarities. A team that was likely to travel out of the state in this regard will also be looking after these crucial needs,” the officer added, stating that this process might take some more time as other financial institutions need to join the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-likely-to-grill-ukrainian/articleshow/83185838.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||NGO flooded with SOS calls for food from people battling pandemic||New Delhi: For Ravindar Kumar (52), life was never this bad. He says that he had to recently beg for money from his relatives to feed his seven-member family living in Devli of south Delhi. “I have been in a really bad state of mind. During the first wave of Covid-19 , I remember standing in front of so many ration centres waiting for my turn and then getting turned away. However, on days when I was lucky, I did get ration. A few NGOs helped us survive the lockdown and gave us food for some weeks,” Kumar said. The last year-and-a-half have been extremely tough for the poor with many of them struggling to arrange food. Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan (DRRAA), a food security-based NGO, has been receiving umpteen number of SOS calls from people enquiring how they can get food. The poor are still not getting ration in the city, claims the organisation. According to data provided by the NGO staff, 72.7 lakh people have been issued ration cards in Delhi. Many migrant workers still don’t have ration cards. For 43-year-old Mani, a worker at a local store, the last one year has been tough. “I can’t even explain the kind of hardships I have faced. In the last two months, I have not got any food from anyone and with the meagre savings I have, I have to feed everyone in my family. Recently, my mother was infected with Covid and we had to spend a lot of money on the treatment as well,” said Mani. “I had to sell most of my belongings as we didn’t even have the money to buy ration. We have seen terrible times and I don’t know when the situation will get back to normal. We were living a tough life before Covid, but it wasn’t as bad as the life we are living right now. The poor are the most neglected,” said Gautam Sonu, a migrant worker. DRRAA had recently written to the chief minister to highlight the plight of the poor. It also carried out an audit, which revealed that, between May 15 and 29, only 44 out of 110 ration shops were distributing ration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ngo-flooded-with-sos-calls-for-food-from-people-battling-pandemic/articleshow/83217580.cms||Pankhuri Yadav
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: One week delay to re-open Hughes Road||MUMBAI: The BMC will open N S Patkar, or Hughes road, completely for traffic from June 10. Malabar Hill witnessed two landslides last year in a space of 50 days, resulting in a cave-in on N S Patkar Road and also damaging Ridge road (B G Kher Marg). Repairs to Ridge road are to be carried out after monsoon. The reconstruction of the retaining wall, the road repair and laying of drains was to be completed by May-end, but has now been delayed by about a week. Monsoon is expected to hit Mumbai by June 10. Times ViewEvery year, the monsoon exposes the BMC’s claims of preparedness. Cyclone Tauktae showed that Hindmata will continue to flood despite all efforts of the BMC to prevent it. The BMC in a very short time has carried out the restoration and stabilisation of Malabar Hill using the latest engineering technology available. The intensity of rainfall though for a very short period has only been increasing and this monsoon may not be any different. BMC's work will be put to test this monsoon.P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), said the embankment work will be completed by June 8, cement concreting of the road is complete as also drain work. The restoration and rejuvenation plan has been designed by IIT Bombay. The plan was to construct 2,000 piles that will bond the earth to the rock. Traffic police said while BMC had not given them any particular date for throwing the Kemps Corner stretch fully open for traffic, they had been informed that it would take around a fortnight to do so. Local resident Mukul Mehra said the BMC has done a good job in the span of time available to them. “The civic body has not only widened the road and concretised it, but also used the opportunity to complete the storm water drain that was incomplete and not connected,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-one-week-delay-to-re-open-hughes-rd/articleshow/83187661.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Delhi||Exams Cancelled, 12th Students And Schools Await Result Criteria||New Delhi: As the Central Board of Secondary Education works out the criteria for assessing Class XII students without a final exam, the biggest concern is about ensuring fairness in the eventual marks. Amid differing views on the assessment process, there is a consensus on moderation to prevent marks being inflated and the need not to give equivalence to online and offline pre-board exams while computing scores. There is also a clear division between parents and principals on whether the Class X board exam scores should be part of the Class XII assessment. Rajpal Singh, principal, Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Surajmal Vihar, believes strongly in giving weightage to the classes X, XI and XII results. “Going only by the assessment in Class XII will not be fair because children mostly attended online classes and were in an environment where they might not have performed to full potential. For their emotional and mental well-being, the difference in performance can be evened out by their Class X board results,” reasoned Singh. Ashutosh Bhardwaj, a parent and a teacher at Delhi University, agreed with Singh. “I think that the Class X result should be included given that the assessment should reflect the consistency of a student’s performance in 12 years of schooling. Besides, Class X is a public exam,” said Bhardwaj. However, Suruchi Gandhi, principal, Bal Bharti School, Dwarka, countered, “Class X is very basic and the argument that it is a public exam so should be a factor in the Class XII assessment makes no sense. I think the Class XI annual performance and the assessment of the entire Class XII year should be considered because these cover the more specialised course and subjects opted for by the students.” Khurram Nayab, whose daughter studies in Delhi Public School, offered another solution: the average of the marks obtained in classes IX, X, XI and the Class XII pre-board scores. However, there is some uncertainty because some schools held online pre-board exams, others, including most government school, offline. Singh’s suggestion: “The moderation system that CBSE implements for Class X can be replicated here. So, the schools take the average of the best performance of one of the last three years. This way, schools will also remain unable to inflate marks.” However, this criterion has been challenged in Delhi High court. Whatever the method chosen, speed is essential. As Rajiv Bansal, director (Operations), Global Indian International School, said, “The marksheet is just one of the yardsticks for evaluating an individual’s knowledge. Top notch institutions across the globe have a very comprehensive approach to evaluation and offer admissions based on a competitive exam, group discussions and personal interview where the relevance of Class XII is just as a qualifying mark.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/exams-cancelled-12th-students-and-schools-await-result-criteria/articleshow/83186045.cms||Shradha Chettri

Following the intervention of Child Protection Committee (CPC) members and their counselling on Tuesday, the 16-year-old girl’s parents dropped the idea and allowed her to pursue her academic dreams. During the Telangana state formation day celebrations on Wednesday, the teenager was felicitated for her courage and for stopping the marriage from taking place. The girl, who wants to become a doctor, called 1098 for help as soon as she came to know about her parents’ plans. “Please stop my marriage. I do not want to get married,” the girl from Mannegudem village in Dornakal mandal told the officials. The CPC members swung into action and reached her house on Tuesday. The girl, who has completed her Intermediate first year, told the CPC members that she intended to pursue her studies but her parents were forcing her into a marriage. Telling her parents that it’s a crime to get their daughter married at a young age, the members counselled them to allow her pursue her academic pursuits. The parents came round and said they would not force her into a marriage now. At a function in Mahabubabad, women and child welfare minister Satyavathi Rathod honoured the girl with a shawl and lauded her. “When the parents did not pay heed to her request, she called up 1098,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/forced-into-marriage-girl-calls-childline/articleshow/83185862.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Goa||Goa cancels Class XII exams, marking likely on Class X lines||PANAJI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the cancellation of the Class XII CBSE exams, Goa followed suit with chief minister Pramod Sawant declaring on Wednesday evening that the Class XII state board exams for 2021 stand cancelled. The decision brings relief to 19,200 students across four streams who had registered to appear for the exam conducted by the Goa board of secondary and higher secondary education. The CM said a “well-defined objective criteria” to assess Class XII students will be declared by Friday by the Board. Sawant also said that one option under consideration is allowing students to choose whether they want to be assessed based on their school internal evaluation marks or want to appear for an exam when the pandemic situation eases. “After extensive consultations, it has been decided that the Class XII exams shall be cancelled, as the health and safety of our students is of utmost priority. This will also help put an end to the anxiety amongst students, parents and teachers. The results will be declared as per a well-defined objective criteria,” Sawant tweeted at 8.50pm on Thursday. Later in the night, Sawant said that the prediction that a third wave of the pandemic may hit soon was one of the reasons behind the decision to cancel the Class XII exams. “It is assumed that a third wave will hit us and it is expected to affect children more. But the detailed circular on marking system for students, etc, will be declared by Goa Board tomorrow (Thursday),” said Sawant. On Thursday morning, the chief minister held a discussion with officials of Goa Board, the director of education and the director of technical education. “From the discussions held, three suggestions have come up after the director of education and Goa Board chairman carried out consultations with parents and teachers,” Sawant had said post the meeting. “One option is to cancel the Board exam and allow those who want to appear for the exam to appear for it, while others can opt to be evaluated based on their school internal assessment marks. Both the results can be declared on the same date, in this case.” The chief minister said a criteria for admissions to general stream undergraduate programmes would be worked out by the directorate of higher education following the cancellation of Class XII exams. Students aspiring to join professional programmes will not be affected, as they will have to answer competitive entrance tests like the Goa common entrance test, for seats. “If the choice is provided to students to opt to appear for a Class XII exam, the decision on the logistics will be taken based on how many students opt to appear for the exam. For some students who want to apply for scholarships, etc, their Class XII scores are important,” said Sawant. Earlier, the state had already cancelled the 2021 Class X public exam. Officials said that the Class XII evaluation policy for students is likely to be along the lines of the marking scheme based on internal assessment marks just announced for Class X students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-cancels-class-xii-examsmarking-likely-on-class-x-lines/articleshow/83187589.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The problem is more severe in the Peth areas and localities around them. The absence of road signs and alternative routes has caused problems not only to the residents in the city’s core areas, but also for those who have to visit the jumbo Covid hospital at Shivajinagar or municipal health hubs such as Naidu and Kamla Nehru hospitals. Civic activists and experts said the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) must follow the Indian Road Congress norms to ensure quality road repair work. “We have instructed to all the contractors to finish the work. The office heads of the departments like road and drainage have been asked to make sure that the works are complete,” PMC additional commissioner Kunal Khemnar said. “Work is on across the civic areas. Along with the routine pre-monsoon work, the 24x7 water supply work is also on,” said V G Kulkarni, head of the PMC’s road department. The PMC has allowed citizens to go out with their routine work from 7am till 3pm. The non-essential shops have reopened after remaning closed for around one-and-a-half months for the restrictions. People were already allowed to move around for essential services and medical reasons. All this are adding to the vehicular load in the city. “Many citizens are complaining about the unplanned road digging. Waterlogging is another concern,” said Vishal Dhanawade, a corporator. “The civic administration has not followed the deadline for the work,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch. He said information about the road work, contractors and their contact details should have been mentioned at site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dug-up-roads-welcome-citizens-stepping-out-after-restrictions/articleshow/83185881.cms||---
---||Nashik||Nashik pvt hosps put decision to stop Covid treatment on hold||Nashik: Private hospitals in Nashik, which had earlier decided to stop admissions and treatment of Covid patients “to have a break”, reversed the decision. A delegation of doctors, under the banner of Hospital Owners’ Association of Nashik (HOAN), met Nashik Municipal Corporation chief Kailas Jadhav on Wednesday evening and discussed why they had sought the state government’s permission to stop admissions and treatment of the Covid patients. The municipal commissioner, however, turned down the request of the 172 private Covid hospitals. Talking to TOI, Jadhav said the delegation talked about the inability of many private Covid hospitals to install medical oxygen plants on their premises due to lack of space and funds; protests by “social activists” against alleged discrepancies in billing; auditing of the bills by the competent authorities appointed by the NMC etc. “I have assured them that the civic body will look into the genuine problems as soon as possible, but issues like setting up of the oxygen plants can be done collectively by them in some common areas. I have also warned them that they cannot take any unilateral decision on stopping the admissions and treatment of Covid patients,” Jadhav said. He added the delegation has been told that the administration would be forced to take legal action under the Disaster Management Act against any private hospital refusing to comply. “I am the licencing authority and the delegation has not raised issues with the NMC so far. I told them that legal fora exists for all their hassles,” the civic chief added.On May 29, the HOAN had written to chief minister Uddav Thackeray seeking his permission to stop admission and treatment of Covid patients. The reason cited in the letter was that the hospital doctors, staff and nurses “were tired and needed a break.” They also said that since the cases in Nashik had declined, the NMC hospitals and the Nashik Civil Hospital could easily handle all the fresh Covid cases. Both the district administration and the NMC apparently have taken an exception to the letter. District collector Suraj Mandhare said that at a time when the government has ordered for the acquisition of 80% beds, the hospitals cannot deny treatment to patients. “Any move to stop admission and treatment will attract action,” Mandhare warned. Dr Raj Nagarkar, the vice-president of HOAN, said they have decided to put their decision of not admitting patients on hold. “We had a fruitful discussion with the NMC commissioner who assured us that our issues would be resolved,” he said. The 172 private hospitals have handled more than 70% of Covid cases in the district during the first and second Covid waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-pvt-hosps-put-decision-to-stop-covid-treatment-on-hold/articleshow/83182028.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Each Covid-19 patient’s bill audit a big challenge for Pune admin||PUNE: The district administration has started the humungous task of appointing auditors for all hospitals in its jurisdiction to check bills of each Covid-19 patient getting discharged from health hubs. District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said the process of appointment of auditors for the health centres was on. “It is a huge task as appointments have to be made for all the facilities. The Pune collector has issued a directive to check all the bills,” said the health official. “The auditors would have to pre-audit the current bills and submit a detailed report according to the charges levied by the state government. If any complaints are raised regarding old bills, those also have to be checked,” he said. At present, the Pune district administration has a team of over 60-70 auditors. They were appointed to check hospital bills above Rs1.5 lakh. After the new directive from the state government, the district administration would have to ensure that independent auditors are appointed for all the 609 designated Covid health centres and 64 dedicated Covid hospitals in the district. Against this backdrop, the state government on Tuesday issued a fresh notification spelling out the bed rates for hospitals in cities and rural areas. State health minister Rajesh Tope said any hospital found overcharging would face severe action. Representatives from hospitals claimed that the rates were not practical for small and medium facilities offering Covid care. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Hospital Board of India, IMA, Pune, told TOI that small and medium hospitals were becoming financially weak and many hospitals might even be forced to stop Covid admissions because of the constant revision of treatment rates and in the absence of any help from the government to run them. “Overall, such excess regulation decreases the morale of private hospitals and that of all healthcare workers. The government should revise these charges for all cities according to the ground reality. Second, it has to control the rate of oxygen, equipment and biomedical waste disposal. Finally, avoid over regulation by auditing each bill because most of the hospitals are in self-regulatory mode,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/each-ncov-patients-bill-audit-a-big-challenge-for-dist-admin/articleshow/83185888.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The hospitals run by Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) provides Covid treatment facilities for its residents, but many people from rural areas of Malegaon and neighbouring talukas got get themselves admitted to the the corporation hospitals. “The number of active cases has come down to 517 from 1,012 just five days ago. The health care workers are much relieved during the current times as number of new cases being reported have reduced,” Sapna Thakre, medical officer health of Malegaon Corporation, said. Malegaon corporation has its own hospitals along with state-run General Hospital that are treating the Covid patients. The corporation-run hospitals witness good number of people coming in for treatment of Covid because of lack of the infrastructure in the rural areas. It should be noted that Malegaon was the hot-bed for Covid patients during the early stages of first wave and the administration had a tough time in bringing the situation under control. As many as 11,544 patients have so far been discharged from hospitals across Malegaon town. Also, a total of 315 people have succumbed to the infection. The mortality was higher during the first wave. The rate of recovery in the corporation areas is pegged at 93.28 per cent — a significant jump from 89 per cent five days ago. The situation in the town and the neighbouring areas has improved remarkably and hence the flow of patients to the city has also dropped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/active-cases-drop-to-517-in-malegaon-in-five-days/articleshow/83182053.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Students worry Class XI marks may be used in HSC evaluation||MUMBAI: The cabinet decision on Wednesday to not go ahead with the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams has made students anxious about the methodology that would be used to grade them. The 14 lakh students who had registered for the exams saw their 2020-21 academic year stretch to more than 14 months as the state had reserved its decision on offline exams in the second wave of the pandemic. Although the state is still to decide on the evaluation policy, students dread that 50% weightage may be given to their Class XI results. In the case of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students, 50% weightage is being given to Class IX and Class X scores to mark them. Students told TOI their Class XI scores should not be considered as they may not have given their 100% for the exam. “As the focus is on board exams, the Class XI performance is never taken seriously,” said a student. Though most of the 2019-20 academic year was pre-Covid, students could not take their final exams and were promoted to Class XII for 2020-21. Sudha Shenoy, a parent representative, said, “CBSE and ISC schools are ready with their internal assessment plans. The state board does not have any fallback plan. Students do not take Class XI seriously, so they will again be at a disadvantage. For admissions to professional courses, they will require a minimum passing percentage.” While HSC students are waiting for their marking policy, their Indian School Certificate (ISC) counterparts are ready with admissions to foreign universities, said the principal of a junior college in Thane. A college principal said students joining Class XI are excited about college life and studies take a backseat. “The initial months after joining college are filled with excitement. They start getting serious only in Class XII. Even the internal exams in Class XII are not taken seriously,” said the principal. Parents said the state should have conducted HSC exams after watching the Covid situation till next month. “A crucial exam has been cancelled. And if students are evaluated based on the previous year, it will be an unfair evaluation,” said one. The state, in an affidavit, had told the Bombay high court Class XII exams were an important milestone for students as their careers depended on them. “The state is contradicting itself,” said a college principal.  Dr Ganesh Tendulkar, a parent, said the decision should have come in April. “This would have helped avoid uncertainty. The state should take into account the third wave before fixing entrance exam dates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-worry-class-xi-marks-may-be-used-in-hsc-evaluation/articleshow/83186170.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Nashik||Ahmednagar ZP to keep eye on kids’ health||Nashik: Ahmednagar zilla parishad has initiated steps to keep a tab on the health of the children in rural parts of the district as there is a prediction that the third wave of Covid could impact children. Rajendra Kshirsagar, the CEO of the ZP, told TOI that the Anganwadi workers, Asha workers and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANMs) have been instructed to educate parents about Covid symptoms and they should promptly consult a paediatrician when needed “The parents will also be educated how the children should be isolated at home or if needed they should be admitted at the nearest Covid facility for treatment,” he said “The beds at the 24 rural hospitals located in various talukas are being ramped up. These hospitals have beds ranging from 30-50 at present and it will be increased to 100. All of them will be oxygen beds. The public works department is creating temporary structures at these hospitals so that the beds can be increased,” he said. Over 9,800 children under the age of 18 years in Ahmednagar district were infected in May. However, most of them were asymptomatic and the mortality rate was extremely low. He said children constituted only 11.5% of the total 86,000 cases registered in May. He said, the district administration has started the process of establishing a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plant at 17 rural hospitals, which are likely to be commissioned by the end of this month. The administration has set up a district paediatric task force, which is guiding the paediatricians of the district about the treatment protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ahmednagar-zp-to-keep-eye-on-kids-health/articleshow/83182064.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Goa||Now, doctors in Goa grapple with MIS-C in post-Covid kids||PANAJI: The state has seen around 20 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) since the first wave of the pandemic. In this rare but serious complication associated with Covid-19, different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs. It usually happens post-Covid recovery, and is due to immunological reasons. While the state has seen four casualties so far, MIS-C is a curable disease if diagnosed on time. Paediatricians and general practitioners have been sensitised about MIS-C, so that such cases are picked up quickly and treated correctly. “Children with MIS-C may have a fever and various symptoms, including abdominal (gut) pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, or feeling extra tired,” according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “There is no need for parents to be panicky, but if a child gets a high-grade fever for more than 48 hours, they should contact a paediatrician,” said senior paediatrician Dr Harshad Kamat. “MIS-C is a very uncommon condition, and most children will recover if diagnosed in time.” Kamat is a member of the expert committee that is helping the government prepare for a possible third wave, that is expected to affect children. While MIS-C is seen in children after they are cured of Covid-19, the time frame for the condition to develop may stretch up to three months, though normally, it may be evident 2-4 weeks post-recovery. Dr Maria Silveira, head of paediatrics at GMC, said that the institute has seen 20 cases and some casualties, but one or two had comorbidities. “One child died within 24 hours of admission, as when she was brought to us, she was in a critical condition and could not be saved,” said Silveira. Dr Shivanand Gauns, a leading paediatrician and an executive member of the Indian Academy of Paediatricians (IAP), said that MIS-C is now their major worry. “It is a condition in which a child’s defence mechanism, which is otherwise regulated, goes out of control. It starts producing antibodies targeting the child’s own system, and will lead to multi-organ dysfunction. If not treated on time, it can lead to mortality,” said Gauns. During the first wave, he said, he treated two children who had MIS-C — a seven-year-old and a 12-years old — both of whom fully recovered as they were referred in time. Kamat said that while children with MIS-C usually present with fever, red eyes, rash on body/mouth or abdominal pain, patients can also present with cardiac problems, since multiple systems in the body are attacked. There could also be neurological or GI (gastrointestinal)-related complaints. Kamat has seen three patients so far, including one during the current second wave. Gauns said that though MIS-C is seen post-recovery among children, in some cases, it can overlap when a child is diagnosed with Covid-19. “Child can have acute Covid and MIS-C simultaneously, but mostly, it occurs two to four weeks after recovery,” he said. Kamat said that one problem could also be that some parents may not know if their child had Covid-19 in the past as they were not tested. “This could happen because many times, children are asymptomatic and there is no reason to do a Covid test,” he said. “I have seen one such case. After the antibody tests, it was confirmed that the child had Covid-19 in the past.” While MIS-C is specific to children, the CDC reports that in the US, since June 2020, several case reports and series have reported a similar multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-docs-grapple-with-mis-c-in-post-covid-kids/articleshow/83187618.cms||Bindiya Chari

The KMC board of administrators (BOA) chairperson Firhad Hakim on Wednesday held a meeting with KMDA officials, traders and transport associations at the civic body’s headquarters to discuss the plan. “Posta flyover will be dismantled as desired by the CM. The flyover will be dismantled in four phases while the work will be done under the supervision of RITES. We had called the members of Posta market association and transport operators on Wednesday to discuss how the dismantling work will be done following a traffic planning,” Hakim said. Officials said that with trucks entering the wholesale and retail fruit and other markets in the area daily, there will be a traffic diversion plan. The traders will also be temporary shifted to another place. The traffic guard is likely to recommend a trial run before the actual work progresses. The Howrah Bridge and Jorabagan guards will work jointly on two crucial issues like parking and loading and unloading of the trucks as well as providing alternate routes to other vehicles heading towards Girish Park and Posta. “We will stop parking at a 200-meter stretch on Strand Road so that the agency can begin its work. This is where the major loading and unloading work of the aloopatti takes place at Posta,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/posta-flyover-to-be-razed-from-june-15/articleshow/83185911.cms||Suman Chakraborti

As per state health department data, 3.33 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in past 24 hours, taking the total tests undertaken in the state to 5.07 crore. This is over 14% of total tests done in the country since the onset of pandemic. In terms of technique, two crore tests which is 40% of total tests done — were conducted through RT-PCR method. Principal secretary medical education, Alok Kumar II said: “UP has achieved another milestone and come a long way in Covid-19 testing. Earlier, samples would be sent to NIV, Pune, but infrastructure was quickly ramped up to set up testing centres here.” UP has dramatically raised its capacity to conduct RT-PCR tests. From a capacity to undertake 8,000 RT-PCR tests per day, we are now in a position to do 2 lakh tests every single day. This speaks for a 25-fold rise in the state’s capacity to undertake RTPCR tests,” he said. State government officers stated over 65% tests conducted during the second wave were done in rural areas with help of rapid response teams. In fact, more than 61 lakh tests were done in April of which 63% were in rural areas. Likewise, in May, 70% of 85 lakh tests were conducted in villages. Additional chief secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal, said, despite being the most populous state, Uttar Pradesh has outpaced other states, including Delhi, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. “Compared to 3.52 crore tests in worst-hit Maharashtra, UP conducted 30% more tests,” he said. Stating that UP is often compared to several nations like Brazil in population figures, Sehgal said: “Despite having a lower pandemic burden than Brazil, UP has conducted more tests than the South American nation.” Officials also said tailormade containment plans had been made for urban and rural areas and patients were tracked through surveillance committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-becomes-first-state-to-conduct-5cr-covid-19-tests/articleshow/83187652.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Pune||Will not dismantle jumbo units despite less demand: PMC||PUNE: The civic administration has decided to continue with the operation of jumbo hospitals despite a drop in number of positive patients. The new policy of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is different from its earlier strategy when a decision was taken to dismantle the jumbo hospitals. Due to less demand now, the PMC has reduced 300 beds from the jumbo facility at CoEP. On the other hand, augmentation of two jumbo facilities has also been planned, including a proposed hospital at Baner. The contract of the existing jumbo hospital at Baner has been renewed, despite there being no demand for the same. According to PMC officials, the decision to continue the jumbo hospital has been taken ahead of talks of likely third wave. Preparations have been taken to ensure that the civic body keeps the infrastructure ready for days to come. “The occupancy of the oxygen beds and normal hospital beds has gone down. So, we have decided to bring down the total number of beds,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner, PMC. Agarwal said the demand for ventilators at the jumbo hospital is very high. So, these beds will not be reduced. All ventilators in the hospital were full most of the times in the second wave. As per the PMC data, the hospital at COEP has 800 beds, out of which 700 were occupied. Now, only 400 beds have been kept available. The old facility at Baner has 450 beds. The proposed facility in this area will have around 300 beds. “The contract of the jumbo hospital in Baner has ended and an extension has been given for three months. A proposal regarding the same was tabled before the standing committee and has been approved,” said Hemant Rasane, the standing committee chairman. He said that the reaction time for dealing with future surge in positive cases will be less as the infrastructure has been kept ready. The PMC will procure oxygen beds for the new facility that will come up at Baner. This new hospital is being built using around Rs11crore from the corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. The civic body had planned to dismantle the jumbo hospitals in January. A committee of experts was formed for the same. This team of experts had given suggestions for sharing the infrastructure of jumbo hospitals with the local civic hospitals. Even the government hospitals in rural areas were to get some equipment and other materials for strengthening the government health facilities. But the plan was put on hold after the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/will-not-dismantle-jumbo-units-despite-less-demand-pmc/articleshow/83185915.cms||---

It is alleged that the government intends to provide pension and other benefits to madrasa teachers by introducing such a legislation. Madrasas are institutions imparting only knowledge about Islam and using government funds to provide benefits to teachers of madrasas is unconstitutional and against secularism, the petitioner said. A member of the welfare fund who has remitted contributions for not less than five years is eligible for receiving a fixed amount and a pension as per the Act and government funds are being used for such a purpose, the petitioner alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/high-court-seeks-governments-views/articleshow/83185945.cms||---
---||Jaipur||CBSE XII board cancellation: Parents happy but say move will harm bright students||Jaipur: The cancellation of CBSE class XII board exam has brought a sigh of relief for some students but for others, it has become a tense situation. Some parents and students welcomed the decision stating the danger to the students’ life, but other students are worried about the formula of marking. CBSE has indicated to count last three years’ (class IX, X and XI) marks or class X board marks and class XII internal marks, to set the result, but the final decision will be announced soon. Students who have scored less in previous classes or class XII internals are opposing this move saying this will not be a fair evaluation and will impact their future. These students are ready to take the exam even in late October. Kavish Yadav, a class XII student from science stream said, “I wasn’t that focused on internal exams because I was preparing for JEE. I worked really hard for the boards but if I will be evaluated on the basis of internal marks, that will be a loss to me. I want to take the exams even if they are held after a few months.”Some parents however, are happy considering the danger to their ward’s life. Sarita Redh, mother of a student of class XII humanities agreed that this will not benefit good students but she supports the decision. “The situation is such across the entire nation that it will not be possible to conduct the exams. This is a major risk to students’ lives and I am really glad that exams are cancelled,” said Redh.There have been examples in the past when students were not able to score well in class X board but they were state toppers in class XII boards. Taking into consideration the injustice to students who worked hard, KB Kothari, an education expert said that there are students who worked hard this year to improve their percentage to get into better colleges. “I am tutoring a kid who scored very low in class X boards but now, he is working hard and is expecting to get above 75% this board. If his internal marks or previous years’ marks are counted, then he won’t be able to score even 60%. We understand the dilemma of the government, but this will be injustice to students,” said Kothari. The decision of which formula will CBSE take into consideration in evaluating marks remains to be seen. Vox Pop - Ashok Vaid (Secretary to Jaipur Sahodaya School Asso) – The students who are weak will be benefited but good students who prepared well, will be in loss. Many students couldn’t score well in class X due to presence of other subjects, but in class XI they become more focused and scored well. Although I agree it was due to necessity. Archana Mangkotia (Principal, MGD Girls School) - The decision to cancel the boards has been a wise and a sensible one looking at the present Covid situation. Students can now concentrate on the entrance exams. However, now the worry is about the assessment method which will be used to evaluate their results. Sunil Yadav (President of All Rajasthan Parents’ Forum) – We have received a good response from parents who were worried about children’s safety. But students who were preparing for the entire year to get into good Delhi University colleges or IITs will now be evaluated on internals’ or previous year’s marks, that will be unfair. Such students must get a chance to appear for exams later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cbse-xii-board-cancellation-parents-happy-but-say-move-will-harm-bright-students/articleshow/83185953.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Covid, cyclones sparked by injustice to Muslims, says Samajwadi Party’s MP ST Hasan||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party’s Moradabad MP ST Hasan kicked up a row on Wednesday when he described the devastation caused by recent cyclones and the pandemic as a result of aasmani aafat (divine intervention) against injustice being meted out to Muslims in the form of Citizen’s Amendment Act (CAA) and similar interferences with the Sharia. Reacting to SP MP’s statement, UP’s junior minister for minority welfare, Muslim waqf and Haj, Mohsin Raza described Hasan’s approach as similar to that of the ISIS. “…. dunya ke sabse bade loktantra mein particularly ek community ko keh diya gaya ki unko nagrikta nahi milegi … yani ke Musalaman ko nagrikta nahi milegi baaqi sabko mil jayegi … ye to nainsafiyan hui hain … uske ewaz mein aapne dekha ki humare desh ke idhar asmani aafatein kitni aa rahi hain … dus dus din mein do do toofan aa gaye … humne dekha hai ki corona ke andar gareeb admi ka kya hashar hua hai (In the world’s largest democracy, it has been announced that only one particularly community … that is Muslims will not get citizenship and everyone else will. Such injustice has resulted in devastation that has descended from the skies in the form of cyclones and poor people have died in pandemic),” Hasan, who happens to be an MBBS by qualification, said. Lambasting the SP MP for his comments, minister Mohsin Raza said: “It is more than clear from his statements that people like him don’t have faith in the Constitution of the country. They want Samajwadi Party to form the government and introduce Sharia law thereafter. Their language is identical to ISIS. Such people only believe in Sharia law,” Mohsin said. “The problem of ST Hasan and Samajwadi Party leaders is that Holi is being celebrated in a big way in Barsana, for them CAA being introduced is injustice and so is abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir,” Raza said. Hasan further attacked the BJP government for what is described as a ‘total failure’ to provide the people of the state with an opportunity to perform the last rites of those who died of Covid-19 infection in the recent past. “Has anyone ever seen dead bodies of human beings being abandoned and dogs feeding on them. Where else in the world are bodies thrown in rivers instead of being cremated? Cremation grounds facing shortage of wood for funeral pyres? What kind of government do we have?” Hasan asked. On drawing a link between government decisions and natural calamities, Hasan said: “We Indians are a very religious lot and strongly believe that some supernatural being exists which controls the world and imparts justice.” The SP MP courted controversy in October 2019, when he compared Parliament to a religious congregation stating that the environment inside resembled that around a religious group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-cyclones-sparked-by-injustice-to-muslims/articleshow/83187693.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Initially when the public examination was postponed, I was happy because I thought I could use the time to prepare. But as Covid cases were high, I could not focus completely on studies. Even though I regularly attend online classes, I was really stressed and confused last month,” said S Swathi, a Class XII student. “As I have no computer, I keep staring at the small screen of mobile phone to attend online classes and refer notes sent by teachers on WhatsApp, which is hurting my eyes. Following CBSE’s example, the government should cancel the examination,” she told TOI. Students are struggling with depression and anxiety, said T Arulanantham, state auditor of the Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association. “Unlike the private school students, who have access to online education, many of the government school students, especially those from rural areas, did not have access to smart phones. More than half of the students did not attend online classes regularly. Even when schools were reopened, we had a lot of absentees and the government directed us not to compel them to visit schools due to the pandemic. It was particularly difficult to reach out to some students last month,” he said. A few days ago, the chief educational officer (CEO’s) office directed schoolteachers to submit marks obtained by students in last seven examinations to assess their performance, the official said. “The government should cancel the examination and use such indicators to analyze their performance.” S Arunan, president of Tamil Nadu Government Employees Teachers Welfare Association agreed. “Currently, we don’t know when Covid cases will come down. We can’t risk conducting exams any time soon. But if we delay it, the next academic year will be delayed. So, it is wise to cancel the exam.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cancel-class-xii-examination-students-teachers-tell-tn-govt/articleshow/83194266.cms||Nivedha Selvam

---||Jaipur||Bars & restaurants seek licence fee relief||JAIPUR: In September last year, when the excise department offered relief of 25% on the licence fees for restaurants and bars, many could not avail the benefits because of the conditions attached. Now, as they demand relaxation on licence fees for the April-June quarter, they want the government to offer the same with an intention to help, not with riders to deprive the benefits. “Last year, the government extended the 25% licence fee exemption to those who had paid before September. By that time, there was no clarity on the tourist movement or the local people visiting restaurants due to fear of the virus so many had not paid the licence fees. So they were deprived of the benefits,” said Abhishek Mishra, director at a city hotel. He said that since the restaurants and bars have remained closed, the government should exempt them of the licence fees for the three months, added Mishra. Another representative of the industry, Kuldeep Singh Chandela, president of Hotels, Restaurants Association of Rajasthan, said that the government should also scrape the clause that mandates bars and restaurants to sell 10% more liquor. “When the outlets are closed, how can anybody sell 10% of more liquor? That’s why putting penalty on them for selling less defies all logic. The government should correct this anomaly, instead of trying to justify it,” added Chandela. In fact, in February last year, hearing a petition one Hotel Mahaveer International Rajasthan High court had ordered that no coercive measure be taken for recovery of the penalty until further order. Petitoner had said that the condition requiring enhanced sale and penalty on failure has no legal basis and the same is contrary to a part of the Liquor Policy itself, inasmuch as, the petitioners have been restrained from advertisement and/or attracting people for sale of liquor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bars-restaurants-seek-licence-relief-from-govt-for-april-june-qtr/articleshow/83185942.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CET for degree colleges may ensure fair merit list, says Principals||Mumbai: As the state cabinet has decided to cancel HSC exams, city colleges are keen on a Common Entrance Test (CET) for degree college admissions on the lines of the one announced for FYJC.The state has not worked out its grading policy for Class XII students yet. Sources said like the Class X assessment methodology adopted by the state, HSC students could be evaluated based on their performance in both Class XI and XII. In case of SSC, equal weightage is being given to Class IX and X marks.College heads said marking students on their Class XI performance will not be a fair assessment as they may not have given their 100% for that exam. “Students tend to take it easy in Class XI. Marking them will be difficult,” said the principal of a city college. A CET may be the only solution to ensure a fair merit list, the principal added.Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal at Kelkar-Vaze’s junior college, said scores given by schools are good for in-house admissions to regular courses. “But the CET is the only fair solution for admissions to self-financed courses and vacant seats in regular courses after in-house admissions, especially in popular colleges. Since it will be based on the Class XII syllabus, it can be used for admissions across all boards. If colleges plan to conduct their own entrance exams, it could become difficult for students to attend multiple entrance exams, as the timings and dates could clash,” said Joshi.Another principal said they would decide on their admission strategy once the state announces their formula. Some others said universities should actively participate in deciding the admission process.Taking a CET, though, will be a herculean task, said the principal of a Sion college. “A separate CET will have to be taken for the science, commerce and arts streams, unlike in the case of Class X where a single CET is needed,” said the principal.In case of HSC students, too, the state may seek a feedback on CET, said sources in the state education department. The state had asked SSC students whether a CET would be feasible. Students had responded positively. The state has now decided to hold a CET for Class X students of all boards. The state board syllabus will be followed for the 100-mark CET for Class X students. The exam will be a two-hour paper. The dates of the exam will be finalised depending on the Covid situation. Meanwhile, students have already turned to their coaching classes for help in preparing for a CET. “My son was attending coaching class for science subjects. We are now asking them to prepare him for CET,” said the parent of a student in Navi Mumbai. Students scoring well in board exams need not necessarily do well in CET, said a principal. He said students have to be given enough time to prepare for CET.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cet-for-degree-colleges-may-ensure-fair-merit-list-says-principals/articleshow/83186385.cms||Sandhya Nair

Resuming non-Covid treatment in these facilities will be after two weeks on reviewing the Covid situation in the district. When the hospitals resume normal operations, treatment for category-C Covid cases, which need oxygen support and better treatment will be centered in three facilities — BPCL, Samudrika Hall in the city and Adlux Convention Centre in Angamaly. “After one or two weeks, we will resume the non-Covid treatment in taluk hospitals and medical college in view of the monsoon season and declining new positive cases. Even though cases are declining, we continue to get patients requiring hospitalization and this trend will remain for another one week. Even if another wave hits us, the district can manage it as most of the facilities including community health centers are equipped with oxygen beds. When there was surge in cases, our plan was decentralized Covid management system. The situation has changed and we are now focusing on centralized method by focusing effective treatment facilities in three centres. Domiciliary care centers and first-line treatment centers will also be closed when the number of inmates come down,” said Dr Mathew Numpeli, district programme officer of NHM. There were 497 cases under ICU treatment in Ernakulam on Monday. Meanwhile, authorities will relieve health workers hired during the second wave when health system struggled without adequate health staff due to sudden spike in cases. “We will hire HCWs again if need arises. We do not expect similar situation will arise further. The problem we faced during the second wave was that most of our health staff in peripheral facilities were not experienced enough to handle Covid cases,” said Numpeli. Covid maternity section in the medical college will be shifted to Aluva district hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mch-taluk-hospitals-to-resume-non-covid-ops/articleshow/83155096.cms||T C Sreemol

The judge said advocates and their staff must show identity cards issued by their respective associations. They have to follow norms like social distancing, wearing masks, etc and should not misuse them. “If any police or revenue officer misbehaves with advocates even after the identity was established, such instances would be taken seriously and will be dealt with in accordance with law,” the judge warned. The judge, in his order, said that advocates defend the rights of the citizens. “Section 41(D) of the CrPC deals with the right of an arrested person to meet an advocate of his choice during interrogation.

Gurdwara Alambagh has made a provision of 50 emergency beds in advance in case the need arises. The Kendya Singh Sabha (Gurdwara Alambagh) has been working religiously on the ground for the last one month, providing oxygen cylinders and concentrators, ration kits, medicines, masks, steamers, ambulance and hearse service free of cost to the needy. Not only in Lucknow, they have also extended help to people in Lakhimpur Kheri, Rae Bareli, Sitapur, Unnao and other districts. “We will also start ‘oxygen langar sewa’ in Lakhimpur on Saturday. By the end of the coming week, we will also begin services in Ayodhya. Thankfully, we have been recieving donations from people and volunteers are joining us in our endeavour to reach out to a number of people,” said Nirmal Singh, president of the gurdwara. “Those who bought oxygen concentrators in the past for their kin affected by Covid are coming forward to donate it to us for other patients,” he said, adding that the gurdwara volunteers provide at least 30-40 oxygen cylinders daily to the patients in need. The Kapoorthala Jama Masjid has also started making arrangements of mid-size oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrations and other medical equipment. “The mosque already has an ambulance and is trying to arrange for another vehicle.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan: Only Centre can ensure affordable petro products||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the assembly on Wednesday that the price of petroleum products wouldn’t be affordable, unless the Union government stops the practice of increasing the excise duty when the price of the same goes down in the international market. The state government could do little to make any tangible change in the prices, he said. Replying to a calling attention motion by MLA C H Kunjambu, Vijayan said the benefits of the petroleum price rise mainly goes to the Union government. “As per details released by the central government in February 2021, of the Rs 67 excise duty on petroleum products, the Centre needs to share only Rs 4 as basic duty with states,” he said. A look at the last six years of Centre’s accounts show that central tax on petroleum products has increased by 307%. The prices of petroleum products increased 19 times, so far, in 2021. “There are four components in the central excise duty on petroleum products. They are basic excise duty, special additional excise duty, agriculture infrastructure development cess and road infrastructure development cess. None except the basic duty is shared with the states. In this background, the central government’s claim that states should cut the taxes on petroleum products to make it more affordable appears strange,” he said. Contrary to the claims made by the central government in 2010 and 2014, the benefits of the fall in petroleum prices in the international market is not transferred to domestic consumers, he said. “Since Centre keeps on increasing the excise duty to offset the benefit of price fall in the international market, the price always remains high,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-only-centre-can-ensure-affordable-petro-products/articleshow/83186054.cms||---

The survey will be taken up in 27 villages, including three from Gajwel assembly constituency, represented by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. The CM has asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to identify the villages in the state. The CM held a review meeting with officials and representatives of survey agencies on the comprehensive digital land survey at Pragati Bhavan on Wednesday. The chief secretary had held a meeting with representatives of 17 survey agencies on Tuesday and took their suggestions. KCR said the government had created Dharani portal to protect the land rights of the poor. “With an intention to make Telangana a land disputes-free state, the government is conducting the digital survey of agriculture land. The government’s aim is to conduct digital survey of agriculture land and fix coordinates. Finally, to provide total security and protection to pattadars on a permanent basis,” the CM added. He said the survey agencies should conduct the digital survey efficiently as it was aimed at providing protection to people’s right on land and also understand the good intention of the government behind it. He also advised them not to view the assignment from a commercial point of view alone but also treat it as a social service being rendered to the farmers. On the pilot survey, the CM said it should be done in villages where there were no land disputes. Later in villages where there were government and forest department land parcels. “The survey should be conducted in a mixed bunch of villages where there are no disputes and where there are disputes and get field-level experience on the matter. After this, guidelines on the digital survey should be prepared for the total survey in the state. In the later stage, survey of urban land parcels would be taken up,” KCR said. The CM discussed technologies available and proposed action plan in depth with the representatives of survey agencies. He suggested to them that state-of-the art technology should be utilised so that there should not be any dispute over even an inch of land. He also said that it would be responsibility of the survey agencies to conduct the survey perfectly and any laxity, on their part, the government would not hesitate to take action against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farm-land-digital-survey-in-state-to-begin-from-june-11/articleshow/83185978.cms||Koride Mahesh

After the increase in cases of black fungus among post-Covid patients, district collector Ashish Modi called a meeting of expert doctors to chart a strategy to identify black fungus symptoms in patients and on the arrangements that can be made for primary treatment. Modi also directed to start a public awareness campaign about black fungus in urban and rural areas.The collector said that a monitoring drive has been launched for Covid patients who have recovered and gone home. A call centre has been set up for the purpose through which information about the patients is being collected.He said till now around 484 Covid recovered patients have been contacted on phone and eight patients were found to be having symptoms of breathlessness, pain in chest and some other symptoms. Of them, two suspected cases of black fungus were found and have been referred to Jodhpur for treatment. As many as 164 patients have been totally cured, while 140 could not be contacted and efforts are being made to contact them.The CMHO has been directed to make people aware about black fungus and its symptoms by distributing pamphlets at village level so that people are alert and start treatment at the earliest, he added.According to doctors, patients who have recovered from Covid and have received many doses of steroids are vulnerable to black fungus. Health officials have been directed to contact such patients on phone and apprise them about the symptoms of black fungus. CMHO has been asked to hold meetings with ANM and doctors at health centres regarding the issue, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/call-centre-to-assist-in-post-covid-care-in-jaisalmer/articleshow/83186008.cms||---

The case was booked under IPC sections of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and using forged document as genuine against three accused — managing partner of Janaki Agro Ramjee Adalla, Padmavathi Peddapati of Kanchanbagh and Santosh Yadav. It all started in 2017 when Ramjee, a resident of SR Nagar, approached Syndicate Bank (now merged with Canara Bank) and applied for a working capital limit of Rs 3 crore for procuring agro products. Ramjee took a vehicle loan of Rs 8.5 lakh in 2018, while the company availed a temporary overdraft of Rs 30 lakh on the working capital in 2018. As the company defaulted on loan payments, the account was classified as a non-performing asset in April 2019. The CBI said the agro firm gave collateral security of an open land in Kondapur. The land was owned by K Vijaya Lakshmi but could not be auctioned as Padmavathi impersonated as Vijaya Lakshmi and helped Ramjee secure the loan from the bank. Padmavathi admitted in writing that she impersonated as Vijaya Lakshmi upon the directions of Santosh to help Ramjee. She also admitted that she handed over her KYC documents, house documents and a photo to Santosh. Padmavathi went to the sub-registrar’s office and impersonated as Vijaya Lakshmi and signed the collateral security documents. Even Aadhaar and PAN card details were manipulated by the accused, the CBI alleged. Later, Ramjee forged various documents and applied for the loan from the bank, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-books-agro-firm-for-siphoning-off-rs-3-5-crore/articleshow/83186004.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

UB-612 is a multi-tope, synthetic peptide-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate that Aurobindo is developing in collaboration with US-based Vaxxinity, which was formerly known as COVAXX. The vaccine candidate needs just normal refrigeration for distribution. “If everything goes well, we can even look at launch approval in India towards the end of the year or the beginning of next year,” Aurobindo Pharma’s managing director N Govindarajan said in a recent earnings call. Aurobindo has exclusive rights for developing, commercialising and manufacturing the vaccine in India and UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund). Pointing out that the company had just applied for Phase II/III trials approval for UB-612 and also held pre-submission discussions with the regulatory authorities, he said the company does not expect too many queries from the regulatory authorities and hopes to kick off the Phase II/III trials as soon as they get approval. Govindarajan also indicated the company expects to begin commercial manufacturing at its viral vaccines facility in Hyderabad, which is coming up at an investment of around Rs 250-275 crore and will have a capacity to manufacture around 480 million doses per annum. “Our viral vaccines facility, all the equipment will be installed and all the qualification for the equipment will be completed by June and from July onwards, our process validation would start. We can start with our commercial batches after the process validation is completed,” Govindarajan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aurobindo-eyes-eua-nod-for-its-vax-by-end-of-year/articleshow/83186793.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Hyderabad||Queue for plastic surgeries gets longer with rise in mucor cases||Hyderabad: With a large number of patients having to undergo surgeries for mucormycosis, majority are being left with deformities that require surgical reconstruction. As a result, currently, there is a long queue for plastic surgeries, say doctors. While these surgeries are likely to keep plastic surgery departments busy for the next six to eight months at least, post recovery prosthetics (fake eyes, in some cases eye with eyelids, etc) will be required by a large number of people. So far, over 250 removal surgeries have been performed in the city, doctors add. “Patients with the most severe presentations are going to need plastic surgeries and prosthetic devices,” said Dr Tarjani Vivek Dave, ophthalmic plastic surgeon, LV Prasad Eye Institute. “In such cases, not only the eye but a large part of the eyelids is removed. Some cases have exposure of the bare bone. These kinds of cases require plastic surgeries before moving on to prosthetics,” he added. A large number of eye removal surgeries have been performed in the past many months at the eye institute. Dave said many patients are now reaching out early due to rising awareness, and in such cases, doctors are able to save the eye. However, requirement of surgeries and prosthetics is likely to increase. This is especially because a lot of youngsters are contracting mucormycosis. “We anticipate somewhere around July a large number of patients may require prosthetic rehabilitation,” Dave said. Dr V Rajalingam, superintendent, Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, which has now begun mucormycosis surgeries, said: “While currently our goal is to control the spread of the infection by removing the infected part, the external reconstruction, artificial eyes and other things, which are for appearance, will take place three to six months after the surgery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/queue-for-plastic-surgeries-gets-longer-with-rise-in-mucor-cases/articleshow/83186625.cms||Amrita Didyala

This, as against a target of 7.55 lakh beneficiaries expected to be covered in the first few days. As per a strategy charted out by the state health authorities for controlling the spread of the virus, a special vaccination drive covering 7.55 lakh of high risk people (possible super spreaders) including auto and cab drivers, LPG cylinder distributors, kirana shops, fruit and vegetable vendors, workers at meat and chicken shops, salons and journalists is currently underway. While the beneficiaries falling in this category have been identified with the help of concerned departments, many of those who are in rural areas are unable to access the vaccines as these are not being given in government vaccination centres. Having become completely city centric, the drive is now moving very slowly, said an official. “Currently vaccines are not available in majority of the rural areas but we are working on making it available. Presently beneficiaries in the city have been covered to a good extent,” said an official from the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/super-spreaders-drive-losing-steam/articleshow/83186477.cms||---
---||Mumbai||CET for degree colleges may ensure fair merit list: Principals||MUMBAI: As the state cabinet has decided to cancel HSC exams, city colleges are keen on a Common Entrance Test (CET) for degree college admissions on the lines of the one announced for FYJC. The state has not worked out its grading policy for Class XII students yet. Sources said like the Class X assessment methodology adopted by the state, HSC students could be evaluated based on their performance in both Class XI and XII. In case of SSC, equal weightage is being given to Class IX and X marks. College heads said marking students on their Class XI performance will not be a fair assessment as they may not have given their 100% for that exam. “Students tend to take it easy in Class XI. Marking them will be difficult,” said the principal of a city college. A CET may be the only solution to ensure a fair merit list, the principal added. Vidyadhar Joshi, vice-principal at Kelkar-Vaze’s junior college, said scores given by schools are good for in-house admissions to regular courses. “But the CET is the only fair solution for admissions to self-financed courses and vacant seats in regular courses after in-house admissions, especially in popular colleges. Since it will be based on the Class XII syllabus, it can be used for admissions across all boards. If colleges plan to conduct their own entrance exams, it could become difficult for students to attend multiple entrance exams, as the timings and dates could clash,” said Joshi. Another principal said they would decide on their admission strategy once the state announces their formula. Some others said universities should actively participate in deciding the admission process. Taking a CET, though, will be a herculean task, said the principal of a Sion college. “A separate CET will have to be taken for the science, commerce and arts streams, unlike in the case of Class X where a single CET is needed,” said the principal. In case of HSC students, too, the state may seek a feedback on CET, said sources in the state education department. The state had asked SSC students whether a CET would be feasible. Students had responded positively. The state has now decided to hold a CET for Class X students of all boards. The state board syllabus will be followed for the 100-mark CET for Class X students. The exam will be a two-hour paper. The dates of the exam will be finalised depending on the Covid situation.  Meanwhile, students have already turned to their coaching classes for help in preparing for a CET. “My son was attending coaching class for science subjects. We are now asking them to prepare him for CET,” said the parent of a student in Navi Mumbai. Students scoring well in board exams need not necessarily do well in CET, said a principal. He said students have to be given enough time to prepare for CET.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cet-for-degree-colleges-may-ensure-fair-merit-list-says-principals/articleshow/83186019.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: No more ICU wait lists but docs still working sans break||HYDERABAD: For the first time in several months, intensive care units (ICUs) have started sporting an empty bed or two on a regular basis. This has come as a relief to doctors, who are seeing the long list of patients on wait lists for ventilators, come down to almost zero. In some cases, patients may have to wait for a few hours but according to doctors, patients are at least not being sent back for a lack of beds now. But while tension arising from critical patients being on the wait list for beds has dropped — showing first signs of pressure easing— intensivists and critical care specialists are still working without breaks, at many hospitals for 45 to 50 days at a stretch. “We are at least able to accommodate patients now and although beds continue to fill up quickly, on rare occasions, we do have a bed or two vacant in the ICU. However, when it comes to workload, there is not much change as patients remain on ventilator for 30 or more days. Also, they require continuous monitoring ,” said Dr Shwetha Ram Chandankhede, critical care consultant at Care Hospitals, Banjara Hills, who has been working without a leave for 45 days. While admitting to seeing ICU numbers gradually dropping, head of department of critical care at Medicover group of hospitals, Dr Ghanshyam Jagatkar said, “The overall number of Covid-19 admissions have definitely come down. But ICUs will continue to be busy for some more time as patients are coming with delayed presentation and are being transferred from small hospitals for high-end support. Our ICUs are still full.” Similarly, critical cases transferred from smaller hospitals are being received at the state-run Gandhi Hospital and Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) too. “Earlier we did not have even one bed in the ICU; now we may have one or two on certain days. At present there is no wait list. The hectic activity in ICUs has also reduced. However we are still receiving a lot of critical cases, mostly patients who were under treatment at private hospitals so far but are not able to pay the bills there any more. They are coming to us,” said a senior doctor from the nodal centre. While state health authorities had indicated that numbers will decline in next two week, doctors are still wary saying nothing can be predicted as numbers might increase after the lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-more-icu-wait-lists-but-docs-still-working-sans-break/articleshow/83186564.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Nagpur||Cashless mucor treatment at empanelled Nagpur hospitals only, but all may not have expertise||NAGPUR: Under Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY), the state government has given unlimited coverage for the treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus. However, right now patients can avail the cashless benefits only at select hospitals. Doctors treating black fungus cases say the expertise, surgical instruments and diagnostic investigations needed to treat the patients, who require a range of surgeries and medication, are generally available only at limited hospitals in the city. The treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach with pulmonologist, endocrinologist, ophthalmologist, and dental surgeon being part of the team. ENT surgeons are at the core of such team. Head and neck cancer surgeon Dr Shailesh Kothalkar said surgical instruments and medicines are major challenges right now. “The flow of incoming patients is now less as compared to those coming for redo surgeries. They got operated somewhere, but didn’t get complete relief from the fungus,” he said. Dr Kothalkar said instruments alone cost over Rs 35,000, which are not covered under the scheme. “While instruments too must be covered, government should make medicines available wherever the disease is covered,” said Dr Kothalkar, who is a director at Seven Star Hospital. Endocrinologist Dr Pramod Gandhi, who is heading the black fungus team at Kingsway Hospital, said it is a highly virulent disease. “If aggressive treatment is not done, it affects patients badly in no time. With availability of modern medicines and mutli-specialists, 95 to 98 mucor patients have been treated at our hospital. Of them, only four patients couldn’t be saved. Only because of availability of a good team, aggressive approach and advanced equipment the outcome is good,” he said. Retina surgeon Dr Sandeep Anjankar said surgeries and diagnostic investigations are easily facilitated at big hospitals. “Treating mucormycosis is a super speciality task. Hence, all facilities should be available for patients. As far as involvement of eyes is concerned, CT scan and retinal investigations are needed. Unless it is a dedicated ophthalmic operation theatre or clinic, patients may have to run pillar to post and lose crucial time,” he said. Dr Anjankar added that a microscope for eye surgery may not be available in small set-ups. “Early diagnosis saves vision and also prevents disfigurement. Advanced technology helps in preventing removal of eye balls. We performed surgeries on 150 patients and only one or two eye balls were removed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cashless-mucor-treatment-at-empanelled-hosps-only-but-all-may-not-have-expertise/articleshow/83184348.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Biological E starts at risk manufacturing of Corbevax||HYDERABAD: Vaccine maker Biological E has begun at risk manufacturing of its recombinant protein Covid-19 vaccine – Corbevax that it is developing in tie-up with Texas-based Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), TOI has learnt. The company has already begun churning out doses of the vaccine as part of plans to create a stockpile ahead of an emergency use approval (EUA), sources said. However, the actual quantum of doses that has been manufactured so far could not be ascertained. Corbevax, which is slated to be the most affordable vaccine to hit the market with an estimated production cost of around $1.5 per dose, is expected to be available for use in the country by August. Biological E is looking at hitting a capacity of 75-80 million doses per month for this vaccine candidate from August this year. “It’s a significant capacity and we have already scaled up. We have confidence in our manufacturing capabilities to be able to deliver that number from August onwards,” Biological E managing director Mahima Datla had told TOI earlier. At present, only three vaccines have got EUA in the country – Bharat Biotech and ICMR-NIV’s Covaxin, AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine being made by Serum Institute of India (SII) under the Covishield brand and Russian vaccine Sputnik V. The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing phase-III trials on 1,268 healthy volunteers in the 18-80 years age group at 15 centres across the country as part of a larger global Phase III study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine against Covid-19. Apart from the two-dose Corbevax, Biological E has just joined hands with Providence Therapeutics Holdings Inc of Canada for licencing the latter’s mRNA vaccine candidate PTX-COVID-19-B for the Indian market as well as some other markets. The Hyderabad-based vaccine maker will be manufacturing up to 1 billion doses per annum of the mRNA vaccine in 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/biological-e-starts-at-risk-manufacturing-of-corbevax/articleshow/83186640.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

---||Hyderabad||Several hand sanitizers fail to make grade in JNTUH & BITS efficacy tests||Hyderabad: Next time you pick a hand sanitiser from the local pharmacy or kirana store, make sure it’s from a reputed company as analysis of some bottles revealed it isn’t that effective with the composition of the product varying from what’s mentioned on the label. Two reputed institutes, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTUH) and Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani- Hyderabad campus got five different sanitizers analysed, four of them had very low alcohol content, despite the label of the sanitizer bottles claiming otherwise. Even the ingredients present inside the bottle are different from what’s on the label. One sanitizer manufactured by a paint company, was the only exception as it maintained the alcohol percentage in its sanitizer. Sample this: A sanitizer sold by a pharmacy chain mentioned on the label that it contains ethyl alcohol 95% along with other ingredients. However, when V Himabindu, professor, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad (JNTUH) and her team tested a sample to estimate alcohol content using gas chromatography, they found out it had only 50% of ethyl alcohol. The same is the case with a sanitizer being sold at another chain, which had only 5.46% of alcohol against 80% mentioned on the label. The tests were repeated multiple times by the team to ensure that there is no error in the result. To check the effectiveness of sanitizers, the team has conducted microbiological analysis by cultivating mixed bacterial culture. “It is concluded from the results that 200uL of sample volume has very less effectiveness for bacterial reduction whereas on increasing sample volume to 400uL a considerable effectiveness for bacterial reduction can be observed,” the report read. Another set of samples were tested by BITS Pilani- Hyderabad campus. Sanket Goel, a professor, and research scholars Jayapiriya U S, P Sai Kumar, and Avinash Kothuru conducted Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), Contact Angle Measurement and Surface Tension, and UV-Visible Spectroscopy, and Gas Chromatography to find out composition and effectiveness of six sanitizers. “From our analysis, we found out that the sanitizer, manufactured by a paint company, has the highest concentration of alcohol content which directly implies the efficiency in action against the bacterial and viral constituents,” said Goel. He said that three out of six samples had a mixture of both Ethanol and Isopropanol. The team said that only one of the six sanitizers—the one by a firm known for its antiseptic, has low surface tension, which implies that it can spread faster and kill more germs. When it comes to contact with hands, the sanitizer by a pharmacy chain was found to be good and is effective.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/several-hand-sanitizers-fail-to-make-grade-in-jntuh-bits-efficacy-tests/articleshow/83186749.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

By evening however, all his excitement vanished. “I have just been informed about a tweet from the mayor stating that salons, spas, gyms, etc, cannot open. I had opened my shop after almost two months as the state government had not specified the kind of non-essential shops that could open. The message has left me aghast,” shared Fayaz. With quite a few salons opening shutters on Tuesday, the message from Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, left owners disappointed. Kiran Shinde, who runs New Delight Men’s Parlour at Kasba Peth, didn’t even open his shop on Tuesday. “I cannot risk opening and paying hefty fines when I am neck deep in debt. Last year, salons were closed for around six to seven months and, after we could open, I was able to save some money, which is sustaining me presently. However, rent, staff salaries, bill payments, etc, have taken a backseat,” said Shinde.

However, it said that it is unlikely that the third wave will predominantly affect children. “If Covid-appropriate behaviour is not followed, a third way is very much likely,” the booklet says. “In the first wave, the disease occurred primarily in the elderly and those with co-morbidities. In the second wave, large numbers of younger individuals (30-45 years) have developed severe disease, as also those without co-morbidities. Fortunately, children have been relatively less affected so far...” A very small percentage of infected children may develop moderate-severe disease, the booklet released by Medicover Group of Hospitals says. Most affected children may get a mild disease with fever and need supervised home care with monitoring. Meanwhile, guidelines are in place on the management of Covid in children, and paediatricians have been sensitized and trained on Covid management. “The need is to be ready for significant number of patients seeking consultations, educating parents regarding illness and warning signs, arranging more Covid wards for children with more special wards such as high-dependency units (HDU) and intensive care units (ICU)...,” suggests the booklet. “There is a possibility of a third wave, but it is difficult to predict its timing and severity. However, there is no reason to panic,” as per the document, which was released by Cyberabad police commissioner, VC Sajjanar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/educate-parents-to-shield-kids-from-virus/articleshow/83186683.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad still behind major cities despite special vaccination drive||HYDERABAD: An ongoing Covid-19 vaccination special drive being carried out for high-risk groups (possible super spreaders), has seen 10.87 lakh people take jabs, but Telangana lags behind many states. As many 31,869 persons were administered doses on Wednesday as daily vaccine doses picked up from below 10,000 as a result of the vaccination drive. Despite the vaccination rate picking up, Hyderabad still lags behind other major cities. Mumbai leads the vaccine administration charts, having administered 34.35 lakh doses till date, followed by Bengaluru (30.33 lakh doses), Chennai (20.75 lakh), and Kolkata (18.22 lakh) while Jaipur has administered 11.7 lakh doses. Even Pune (29 lakh doses) and Thiruvananthapuram (11.51 lakh) have administered more doses than Hyderabad. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Visakhapatnam — a much smaller city than Hyderabad — has also administered 9.2 lakh doses. In Hyderabad, 8.45 lakh have been given their first dose while 2.72 lakh have been given both doses. While there is no vaccine hesitancy, stocks available with the state, changes in vaccination drives, and a temporary halt have contributed to the slowing down of vaccinations. Experts have said that vaccination definitely prevents complications among infected persons. “A study published in International Journal of Health and Clinic Research on infection status among vaccinated and non vaccinated Covid-19 patients at Nizamabad Government Hospital clearly showed that among vaccinated patients, lung infection is found only in 12 per cent of cases and very mild while among non-vaccinated patients the infection rate was 88 per cent and (in some cases) not mild,” explained associate professor at Nizamabad Government General Hospital, Dr Kiran Madala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-still-behind-major-cities-despite-spl-vax-drive/articleshow/83186459.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Activists wary, but experts cheer Model Tenancy Act||MUMBAI: The Model Tenancy Act approved by the Union cabinet on Wednesday will unlock vacant houses and ensure speedy redressal of disputes between landlords and tenants, say property market experts. In the state, though, the issue could become a hot potato for political parties if it fails to protect the rights of lakhs of tenants, say activists. In the city, 25 lakh tenants in 14,000 buildings and chawls are protected under the Rent Control Act. “This act can fuel the rental housing supply pipeline by attracting more investors, and more rental housing stock will help students, working professionals and migrant populations to find urban accommodation. Once implemented across states, it will formalise and stabilise the rental market,” Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock Property Consultants, said. Niranjan Hiranandani, national president, Naredco, said there was a need for a new law which would make things easier for all stakeholders —tenants, landlords and investors — to transact and deal in rental housing. “This will help overhaul the legal framework with respect to rental housing across the country, which would help spur its overall growth,” he said. Former Congress MP from Mumbai South Milind Deora said the state, while examining and adopting the Centre’s Model Tenancy Act, must ensure safeguards to protect tenants in Mumbai. “Congress will not allow the government to compromise on the issue in any way whatsoever,” Deora said. Housing activist Chandrashekhar Prabhu, who has been fighting for tenant rights, said Mumbai and Maharashtra have a legacy in the rent laws. “Had it not been for the protection given by the Rent Act, Mumbai would never have been what it is today. Any tampering with tenants’ rights as they exist now would render millions homeless and bring them on the streets. Under existing laws, new tenants in new premises are already exempted from the purview of the Rent Act. Leave and licence laws fulfil all requirements mentioned in the draft model. A separate Rent Act may not be required. The L&L agreement can be strengthened. The old act should continue to protect the millions of tenants,” Prabhu said. Samantak Das, chief economist, JLL India, said: “The Model Tenancy Act is going to give a guiding framework to all states to make their tenancy acts contemporary. Current acts will give way to the new ones where uniformity will prevail, and it will give confidence to homeowners for renting out of existing vacant properties.” Shishir Baijal, chairman and MD, Knight Frank India, said: “While tenancy in the commercial real estate segment has been a well-established tenet of the market model, the fractured landlord-tenant relationship in case of the housing segment has discouraged development of market model and obstructed institutionalisation of a rental housing market. The Model Tenancy Act has provisions to regulate the rights and duties of both the landlord and tenant and this shall balance the scale between both these counter parties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-activists-wary-but-experts-cheer-model-tenancy-act/articleshow/83187877.cms||---

This was done to avoid him clashing with other criminals. Sources said Kumar demanded better food than what he was being given and expected a high protein diet because his dietary needs as a sportsman were different. The wrestler is likely to move an application in court regarding his food requirements, especially a high-protein diet. According to sources at Mandoli jail, Sushil Kumar reached the jail around 9pm on Wednesday after a city court remanded him for nine days in judicial custody. “He did not shed tears, but was visibly upset. Keeping in mind concerns about his safety and the other criminals lodged in the jail, he was incarcerated in a separate cell in Jail No 15,” a source said. “He ate the regular meal, but said he needed more high-protein food and that he would submit an application in the court about this.” On Thursday, Kumar wanted to make a video call to his lawyer and he was allowed to do so. He also wanted to talk to his family members. In jail, each inmate is allowed to mention two phone numbers of family members which he or she can call. One of the numbers Kumar had submitted was of his brother, with whom he also spoke on Thursday. Kumar was arrested on charges of thrashing wrestler Sagar Dhankad to death on May 4 at Chhatrasal Stadium, aided and abetted in the assault by some of his associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/separate-cell-for-sushil-in-mandoli/articleshow/83217783.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Father-son threaten dispensary staff member for a Covid negative certificate||COIMBATORE: A father-son duo have been booked for threatening a staffer of a tea estate dispensary to issue a Covid negative certificate at Valparai on the outskirts of the city on Monday. The Valparai police said 26-year-old P Sivakumar, son of 49-year-old G Palanisamy, a resident and labourer of Akkamalai tea estate, had tested positive for the virus 10 days ago when he returned to the hometown from Coimbatore city, where he was working as a labourer. “While Sivakumar was admitted to the government hospital for treatment, his family members were asked to remain in home quarantine. He was discharged three days ago after testing negative for the infection with an advice to isolate himself at home,” a police officer said. However, the father-son duo refused to remain in home quarantine and approached the estate dispensary staffer A Murugesan on Monday, demanding Covid negative certificate for Palanisamy so that he could return to work. “When Murugesan refused to provide the certificate and asked them to come back after completing their quarantine period, the argument between them turned into a quarrel and the father-son duo threatened Murugesan with dire consequences and assaulted him,” the officer said. Murugesan lodged a complaint with the Valparai police, who registered a case under Sections 294(b) (uttering obscene words) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code on Tuesday. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/father-son-duo-threaten-dispensary-staffer-for-covid-ve-certificate/articleshow/83186059.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Dahisar woman had tried to kill hubby twice’||MUMBAI: Dahisar resident Shahida Shaikh, arrested for allegedly killing her husband, Raees, with the help of her paramour and burying the body in her kitchen, told investigators that she had made two previous attempts on his life. Shahida and her paramour, Amit Vishwakarma, then decided to come up with a far more sinister murder plot, said the police. Vishwakarma, who was in hiding since the murder on May 22, was tracked down to Aarey Colony and arrested early on Wednesday. Married for nine years, Shahida (27) and Raees (28) lived with their two children at Khan compound in Dahisar’s Rawalpada. The police said Shahida and Vishwakarma, a security guard, were in a relationship for the past three years. “On two occasions, Shahida had mixed sleeping pills in her husband’s food, but it had no effect on him,” said an investigator. Shahida and Vishwakarma then plotted to strangle Raees and bury the corpse. They got new kitchen tiles of the same size and colour, cement, a spade and tools for digging. “It was a well-planned murder,” said Dahisar police senior inspector Pravin Patil. “After the murder, the duo had decided to wait till things cooled down and then move out of the neighbourhood.” On May 22, after her husband and children had gone to sleep, Shahida allegedly let Vishwakarma into the house. “He strangled Raees with a cable, with Shahida’s help. For the next three-and-a-half hours, the duo dug a 5-ft deep chamber in the kitchen after breaking the tiles,” said an officer. Neighbours claimed that Shahida threatened her children, who caught them digging, to keep mum. The duo then allegedly placed the body in the chamber and covered it with gunny bags and layers of mud, before laying new tiles with a fresh coat of cement. Shahida then filed a missing person’s complaint with the police. But a local resident who had noticed sacks of cement making their way in and out of the house a number of times on May 22 alerted the police when they came enquiring about Raees. The police dug out the body late on Tuesday. “We did not use tools and dug out the body with bare hands as we did not want to lose any forensic evidence. It took us four to five hours,” Patil said. After Shahida was arrested, sleuths set out to look for Vishwakarma. They learnt that he was going to travel from Worli to Malad by train on Tuesday. A police team was waiting for him in Malad, but Vishwakarma got off the train at Jogeshwari and switched off his phone. The police later tracked him to his uncle’s house in Aarey Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dahisar-woman-had-tried-to-kill-hubby-twice/articleshow/83186092.cms||Nitasha Natu

When a doctor examines such children, they do not find the virus in the body through RT-PCR test. But when an antibody test is conducted, it shows that the child had been infected by Covid. “We have admitted children with MIS-C and they are undergoing treatment in the hospital,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. In the second wave, such MIS-C cases have increased with the mortality rate as high as 30% to 40% among children. “So far we have reported 42 cases in the second wave with maximum cases being reported in May. Currently, we have 21 children with MIS-C admitted to the hospital,” said Dr ML Gupta, professor and head of the department (pediatrics), JK Lon Hospital. Dr Gupta said, “MIS-C is an after-effect of corona, in which excessive cytokines are released causing inflammation affecting heart, gut, kidneys, brain involving multisystem in the body. It becomes serious when it dilates coronary arteries, formation of thrombus. It also affects heart’s pumping of blood and BP falls down. Such patients require ventilator support.” Not only in government hospitals, but such cases have been diagnosed in private hospitals. On suspicion of appendicitis, an 8-year-old boy was admitted to gastrointestinal surgery department, but doctors did not find any evidence of appendicitis or other intra-abdominal surgical problem. The child was shifted to pediatric medicine department of the private hospital.On day 2, the child developed cracked lips, rashes all over body mainly trunk with palmer and soles erythema and swelling. He also developed non-purulent conjunctivitis and sterile pyuria as urine culture was sterile. No obvious cause of fever was evident in the child at that time and provisional diagnosis of post-Covid MIS-C was made. On day 3, he developed sudden onset breathlessness and pallor so he was shifted to ICU and put on BIPAP (non-invasive ventilation) and antibiotics were empirically upgraded as per the clinical condition of the child by that time investigations came, the doctors were surprised to see the report as it was indicating towards MIS-C. “His inflammatory markers were elevated such as IL-6 was 638.1, D-Dimer was 2790,CRP was 303.76, ESR was 49, Ferritin was 586, Procalcitonin was 9.65, which were in favor of MISC syndrome,” said Dr SD Sharma, director and head, department of pediatrics & neonatology of the private hospital. “We started medicines such as IV immunoglobulin along with low molecular weight heparin with parents’ consent and methylprednisolone was continued. For sudden onset breathlessness, cardiac opinon was taken with all the medication and treatment child improved on the given treatment and inflammatory markers were reduced and respiratory support was weaned off. This was the first case of MIS-C successfully treated at this hospital,” said Dr Sharma. In another case, doctors saved life of a 45-day-old child from Sikar. Child’s grandparents and guardians had tested Covid positive two weeks before the child’s admission to a hospital. Initially, the child was diagnosed for post DPT vaccination pneumonia, but after three days, his medical condition worsened. The child was then taken to the private hospital’s emergency on May 11. “It was diagnosed that only 20% of the child’s heart was pumping. Acid level was high to an extent that hands and feet turned blue. There was low saturation with grunting and high pulse rate. The blood inflammation markers were high with Covid PCR negative but very high antibodies. The case was diagnosed to be a post-Covid MIS-C,” Dr Anupam Chaturvedi, senior pediatrician of the hospital, said. The children recovered as multi-disciplinary team including consultant paediatric intensivist Dr Ravi Sharma, cardiologist Dr Praveen and physiotherapy expert Riti Vashistha provided the treatment.BOX:Clinical criteria for Covid-related MIS-C syndrome1) Fever ≥3days,2) Rashes all over body, non-purulent conjunctivitis3) Multisystem involvement (skin, GI, heart, blood & lungs) in any of the two4) Raised inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, D-Dimers, Ferritin, Pro-calcitonin)5) Deranged coagulation profile (Deranged PTINR)6) Covid RT-PCR positive/contact to a Covid positive or suspected Covid case within 30 days7) No obvious other cause of fever or the illness.MSI-C can be categorised as mild, moderate and severe, according to which treatment is provided. Severe cases come in shock, they require ventilator support, moderate cases get hospitalised and mild cases get treatment at home — JK Lon Hospital assistant professor Dr Dhanraj Bagri||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/post-covid-ailments-increasing-among-kids/articleshow/83186039.cms||---
---||Pune||Cases of a post-Covid syndrome in kids have risen: Docs||Pune: A particular post-Covid-19 syndrome in children, medically termed as “multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children” (MIS-C), has been keeping child specialists across the city on their toes.MIS-C can trigger high-grade fever, rashes, eye redness, vomiting and loose motions. Occasionally, children may also suffer low blood pressure, which will need ICU care. Doctors have urged parents to be vigilant and identify these signs early. Recovery, they said, is 100% if there’s swift treatment. “The number of children presenting with Covid or Covid-like symptoms has reduced drastically in the last week. But we are seeing quite a few children with post-Covid problems such as MIS-C,” said paediatrician Sachin Shah, director of the paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit at Surya Mother and Child Super-speciality Hospital, Wakad.Parents, especially of those children who have had Covid or were exposed to people with the infection, have been asked to stay alert. “Seek immediate medical care if the symptoms are seen in children two to four weeks after recovery from Covid. Sometimes, a child may not have had symptomatic Covid but may still have features of MIS-C. This is because asymptomatic/silent carriers (children) can also develop MIS-C. So awareness and vigilance are key,” Shah said.Last year, during the first round of the pandemic, there were fewer cases of MIS-C in Pune. But cases have increased this year. The rise has been linked to the overall surge in Covid cases. “We had around 15 patients with MIS-C last year. But in just 5 months of 2021, the number has already crossed 30. Cases are likely to stay high for the next 4-6 weeks,” Shah said.Paediatric rheumatologist Jitendra Oswal said, “Cases of MIS-C are likely to rise over the next few weeks. This is because those who were either Covid positive or asymptomatic, but never tested, may be developing the syndrome within 4-6 weeks after Covid recovery.”Doctors said parents should be alert if a child suddenly develops fever along with gastrointestinal symptoms, rashes or changes in eye/tongue/lip colour, especially if the family has had a brush with Covid in the recent past, Oswal said. Paediatric intensivist Sumant Patil of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital (DMH) said, “All parents should keep an eye out for MIS-C, especially those who have had Covid or whose children have recovered from it. Because these children have had confirmed exposure to the virus, there are high chances of MIS-C, which can develop in children even if they weren't patients.”DMH had 12 cases of MIS-C during the first wave and has recorded nearly 20 over the last six months, Patil said, adding that the good news here is 100% recovery “if diagnosed early and treated in time”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cases-of-a-post-covid-syndrome-in-kids-have-risen-docs/articleshow/83186057.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Business||PMLA court: Banks can take over Vijay Mallya properties worth Rs 5,600cr||MUMBAI: In two separate orders, the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court has allowed the plea of the SBI-led consortium of banks to restore to it properties collectively worth Rs 5,600 crore of absconding businessman Vijay Mallya. Through an order on May 24, the court restored assets worth around Rs 4,233 crore. Tuesday’s order related to assets worth Rs 1,411 crore. In both orders, the court held prima facie Mallya and his companies were involved in falsification of accounts and funds misappropriation. The assets include under-construction properties in Kingfisher Tower, Vittal Mallya Road, Bengaluru, spread over 2.45 lakh sq ft and worth over Rs 564 crore, multiple floors of a tower at UB City, Bengaluru valued at Rs 713 crore (as per the ready reckoner rate in 2016) and a land parcel along with a farm house at Mandwa, Alibaug, worth around Rs 25 crore. In addition, bank deposits and pledged shares are also to be restored. While some of the assets are in Mallya’s name, others are held through his companies. In 2019, the SBI-led consortium of 12 banks had submitted the application seeking “restoration” of the properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the provisions of the PMLA. It was alleged that the banks that had disbursed loans to Mallya and his companies had suffered losses of over Rs 6,200 crore due to their criminal actions. Mallya’s defence had opposed the plea stating he had given only a personal guarantee and that could not connect him to the alleged money laundering. Refuting the arguments, the court said that Mallya had full control and command over Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. It said that despite having no offshore operations, its accounts indicated expenditure of fuel for ‘aircraft operating offshore’. The court further said between 2009 and 2011, though the company’s financial condition was poor, it transferred money received through loans to Mallya’s Force India. “The transferred amount was shown as payments for operating expenses in relation to flight operations,” the court said. The court said the losses were not imaginary. “The accused Dr Vijay Mallya himself placed a proposal for replacement of dues. Had there been no loss to the banks, why is Dr Vijay Mallya ready to repay the loss,” the court said. It also pointed out that the properties were insufficient to meet the losses suffered by banks. In the orders, the court also remarked that it was surprising to note that Mallya’s legal team was demanding information from the ED about when he would come to India. “Ironically, the absconding accused himself is asking the court to get confirmation from the investigating agencies as to when they would secure the custody of the accused. Dr Vijay Mallya should come with clean hands,” special judge Jayendra C Jagdale said. The court also said that restoration can take place on the banks executing a bond, undertaking to produce the properties before it as and when required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pmla-court-banks-can-take-over-vijay-mallya-properties-worth-rs-5600cr/articleshow/83191796.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Trade marks registry certified that the emblem, the abbreviation KSRTC, logo and the name Aanavandi shall belong to Kerala Road Transport corporation. Karnataka had given a rude shock to Kerala in 2014 when it sent a notice saying that Kerala should stop using the name KSRTC. Karnataka had registered and won ownership over KSRTC brand with the Gandaberunda icon (two-headed mythical bird) in 2014. Kerala then filed an appeal with the trade marks registry. Karnataka had sent a communication to Kerala furnishing evidence and certificate issued in its favour and requested Kerala not to use the name KSRTC anymore. Former KSRTC MD Antony Chacko started off a legal battle to win back the brand name for Kerala. KSRTC minister Antony Raju said that this was an honor to KSRTC and that all officials who worked for this deserve praise. “The history of KSRTC is interwoven with the lives of the people. KSRTC has left its imprint in cinema, literature and culture,” said Raju. KSRTC MD Biju Prabhakar said that the recognition from trade mark registry is a major boost to Kerala road transport corporation which is on a path of revival. He said that notice will be sent to Karnataka citing the order. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/brand-ksrtc-is-keralas-own/articleshow/83186148.cms||---
---||Pune||272 inmates over 65 years of age identified for bail||Pune: The Supreme Court-mandated high-powered committee (HPC) and the state prisons officials have identified 272 jail inmates above 65 years and with comorbidities for release on temporary bail or emergency parole on priority as a part of the ongoing exercise to decongest jails across Maharashtra.According to the SC directives, undertrial prisoners (UPs) facing trial and convicts serving sentences of not more than seven years’ imprisonment are entitled to temporary bail or emergency parole relief, respectively, as per the recommendations of the high-powered committee set up in respective states.The relief is not available to UPs or convicts involved in heinous crimes or in special enactment crimes like the UAPA, MPDA, MPID, MCOCA etc. “Inmates above 65 years involved in UAPA cases like the Elgar Parishad or senior economic frauds are not eligible for relief,” additional director general of police (prisons) Sunil Ramanand told TOI.Post-resurgence of Covid cases this year, the HPC headed by a sitting Bombay HC judge and comprising additional chief secretary (home) and the additional director general of prisons met physically on May 7 and through video conferencing on May 11 to further review the need to release prisoners and decongest jails.Ramanand said, “Among other things, we decided to focus on the vulnerable groups this time. The age factor and the nature of crime was considered at our last two meetings. It was decided to identify inmates of 65 years and above with comorbidities certified by the medical authorities.”“Out of the 272 inmates, which include the UPs, 25 have got bail, 27 have been refused bail by the courts while 220 bail pleas are pending for final hearing before the sessions courts in respective districts. No convict has applied for emergency parole so far,” he said. The relief is also to be granted on a case-to-case basis by the concerned court, he added.Explaining the procedure, Ramanand said, “Eligible senior jail inmates can file interim bail pleas through the jail superintendents or through their lawyers before the sessions courts of the concerned districts. The bail pleas are registered. The courts then issue notices directing the police to file written statements. The courts after receiving written statements hear the arguments of the prosecution and defence lawyers as to whether the inmates are entitled to bail or not. While considering the bail pleas, the sessions courts are expected to take the HPC recommendations into account for treating the inmates favourably and taking a lenient view because of the pandemic.”The high-powered committee also noted the fact that the prisons department had isolated the inmates above the age of 60 in separate barracks or hospital ward with special facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/272-inmates-over-65-years-of-age-identified-for-bail/articleshow/83186115.cms||Asseem Shaikh

His remarks came a day after the Centre announced cancellation of Class 12 board exams by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in view of the pandemic situation. Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) also cancelled its Class XII examinations. “It is time to move on to next year. We cannot deny that another academic session could be Covid-affected and we need to plan before it’s too late once again,” Sisodia told PTI in an interview. He stressed on the need to be ready with a “foolproof formula” for next year to avoid scope for any “knee jerk decision”.  “Now is the right time. A foolproof plan should be ready about how will assessment be done in March 2022, and according to it, the current session should be planned and students should be prepared. Internals, online and semi online activities should be as per that plan rather than preparing students differently and then saying we will not pass them without taking exams. “I feel if we do not start now, it will again be too late for next year and will then lead to an unprepared and knee-jerk decision,” he added. Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said his team is working on a draft plan in this regard and he will share the recommendations with CBSE and the central government. “A team is working on a plan on how the academic session can be conducted for board and non-board classes and how can the assessment be done. Once we are done with the draft plan, I will share the recommendations with CBSE and the Centre,” he added. Sisodia, who had earlier told the ministry of education that going ahead with exams before vaccinating the students would be a disaster, said there could be no second thought about it. “Exams or no exams, there cannot be a second thought about need to vaccinating students. The stocks are so low that we are not able to vaccinate people within age group of 18-44. All of this has to be done soon, the trials for vaccines for children and getting Pfizer vaccine for them, all of this has to be done on priority,” he said. The Centre on Tuesday decided to cancel the CBSE Class XII board exams amid the continuing pandemic across the country, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserting that the decision has been taken in the interest of students and the anxiety among students, parents and teachers must be put to an end. Sisodia also reiterated that CBSE should announce its policy for evaluating students of Class XII at the earliest. “They should come up with an unbiased and objective criteria at the earliest so students can start looking forward to undergraduate admissions,” he said.

Police said Prathamesh Parmar lived with family friends and had left home the previous day to play, but did not return. His father, who works in Goa, is on his way to Mumbai. Around 12.20am, Parmar was on the south-bound arm of WEH. He was near Patra Gate, when a vehicle hit him and sped off. “A police vehicle attached to Andheri police station was passing by the stretch, escorting an accused person for a medical examination. The vehicle driver, who spotted the injured child, quickly lifted him into the vehicle. Parmar was rushed to V N Desai Hospital, where doctors tried to treat him for more than two hours but he succumbed to injuries,” said a police officer. Parmar had suffered multiple injuries on his head and torso, besides some internal injuries.  “There was no identification on him. Cameras on WEH captured him walking around for a while. He appeared tired. But there was no camera at the location where he was hit,” said the officer. Vile Parle police took photographs of the body and sent them to all police stations in the city to identify him. They received a call from Samta Nagar police station, where a child had been reported missing on Wednesday. “The boy’s parents had separated in 2017. For some time, his father had enrolled him at an ashram school. Presently, he was living with family friends in Kandivli. It is not clear why he did not return to his family friends’ home and where he was heading to. His father said the child knew his way around WEH as the two of them used to travel to Mahim Dargah in the past,” said a senior official. Police officials observed that had a passing motorist stopped to ask the child why he was walking alone on the WEH at night or took him to the nearest police station, he could have been alive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-10-yr-old-walks-10km-along-weh-killed-in-hit-and-run/articleshow/83186516.cms||Nitasha Natu

There are 2,500 undertrial prisoners (UPs) lodged at the Arthur road jail. The jail had first reported Covid cases among inmates and prison staff when the lockdown was enforced last year. Additional director general (prisons) Sunil Ramanand said, “We have taken a number of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 at Arthur Road jail like opening a temporary jail and Covid care centre in BMC-run E S Pathanwala High School in Mumbai. Whenever we notice symptoms among inmates, we shift them to temporary jail or the Covid care centre and offer them the best possible treatment. After they completely recover from the contagion, we shift them back to the main jail.” Ramanand said, “We do not directly lodge the accused arrested by the Mumbai police in Arthur Road jail. We have issued instructions to the police to subject the accused to RT-PCR test. We lodge the accused in temporary jail, if the reports are awaited. If the accused tests positive, then he is admitted to the Covid care centre or hospital for treatment. If he tests negative, then he is lodged in the jail.” “This has reduced the possibility of inmates getting infected. We have started this practice across Maharashtra. The system has worked wonders. Active cases in eight other central jails in the state have also reduced among the inmates and jail staff. No deaths have been reported,” he added. Last year, maximum number of positive cases were reported from the Arthur Road Jail, where 185 inmates and 39 prison staffers were infected. This prompted the state government to remporarily release inmates to decongest jails.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbais-arthur-road-jail-becomes-contagion-free/articleshow/83186156.cms||Asseem Shaikh

NSS general secretary G Sukumaran Nair on Wednesday said according to the high court order, the list was to be published on April 23 this year. The NSS will take legal measures as the list has not yet been published even two months after missing the deadline, said Nair. The notice says that government’s failure to publish the list has rendered the 10% economic reservation for the economically backward in the forward communities provided by the Constitution fruitless. The notice warns the chief secretary that NSS will go ahead with contempt of court charges if the list is not published without any more delay. NSS had moved the court in February this year questioning the delay in publishing the list. The court had directed the state government to publish the list within a month on March 24. The court had also dismissed the argument put forward by the government that the delay was due to the election code of conduct. The list of forward communities is based on the Kerala State Commission for Economically Backward Classes among Forward Communities Act, 2015, which was for the economically backward in the forward communities in the state. Since the government had approved the forward community commission report which include the list on May 5, 2020, publishing the list did not come under the purview of the election code of conduct, the court had observed. It was based on this observation the court had directed the government to publish the list within a month, Nair said. The court also observed that the beneficiaries of the reservation will be affected by the delay in publishing the list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nsss-contempt-notice-to-chief-secy/articleshow/83186162.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Santacruz greens give a fresh lease of life to 3 uprooted trees||MUMBAI: Three 50-year-old trees that were uprooted during Cyclone Tauktae last month have got a fresh lease of life, thanks to the efforts of green crusaders from Santacruz. On May 17, residents noticed a full-grown peltophorum tree on the main Church Avenue Road, a few meters from the arterial Khar subway. The BMC cut the branches and cleared the road to allow traffic traffic movement soon after, which upset the locals who decided to try and save the tree. “We mobilised a small group and got in touch with a tree expert firm,” said Neil Lobo, a local resident. “A team inspected the tree and started to work on a plan to transplant it in the nearby civic playground near Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana. The entire activity needed money, equipment and permissions and above all, a desire to save the tree.” Lobo added that while locals donated funds for the transplant, local corporator Alka Kerkar helped expedite permissions from the BMC. Lauding the citizens’ efforts, Kerkar told TOI: “With BMC’s help we managed to get a JCB and the permissions for translocating the tree.” Inspired by the initiative, the nearby Sacred Heart Parish approached the group and sought help to save two uprooted trees on its premises. Lobo said the same process was followed and a peltophorum and an Ashoka tree were transplanted in the school grounds adjoining the church. Ashok Jain of Terracon Ecotech Pvt Ltd, an expert in natural resource management and biodiversity, said that before transplanting the trees they ensured that they had been trimmed. “It was done a day before to make sure the trees were well balanced. In case of the tree at Khar subway, we faced a challenge as the roots were deep inside a water pipeline and utility lines. So, while transplanting the tree we had to ensure that the remaining intact roots were taken safely,” said Jain. The group is now working on saving two more fallen trees in the area. Next week, said Lobo, they will be transplanting two decades-old trees that have tilted precariously on Sacred Heart Grounds. “With this, we hope to save five trees in a city starved of oxygen,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/santacruz-greens-give-a-fresh-lease-of-life-to-3-uprooted-trees-in-mumbai/articleshow/83188027.cms||Richa Pinto

As per the action taken report tabled by the government in the assembly on Tuesday, along with the report of inquiry commissioner justice K Narayana Kurup, the six officers who face dismissal are: Sub-inspector K A Sabu, ASI Roy P Varghese, police driver Niyas S, civil police officer Jithin K George and home guards Rejimon and James As per Section 311 (2) of the Constitution, the state can dismiss, remove or reduce in rank any government servant on the basis of an inquiry after giving him a reasonable opportunity for being heard. They will also be prosecuted under Sections 302/304, 166, 201, 330, 331, 342, 348 and 471 of the IPC. In addition, major penalties will be imposed on a senior woman civil police officer Rajani, woman civil police officers Geethu Gopinath, Ambili T and Anju and civil police officer Santhosh. The government will also hold an inquiry as part of disciplinary action against the doctors and officials of the three government hospitals---taluk hospital Nedumkandom, taluk hospital Peerumed and Medical College Hospital, Kottayam---who had refused to admit and treat Rajkumar. The government has given strict instruction to the state police chief to follow the guidelines laid out by the Supreme Court in D K Basu vs West Bengal case, to avoid custodial deaths in the future. The government has decided to grant Rs 45 lakh to Rajkumar’s family members, including Rs 10 lakh to his wife, Rs 5 lakh to his mother, Rs 5 lakh to son, and Rs 15 lakh and Rs 10 lakh to witnesses Salini and Manju, respectively. In one-and-a-half years for which the commission had functioned, as many as 73 witnesses were summoned and their statements recorded. Besides finding that Rajkumar died of police torture, the commission had also pointed out the connivance of officials who conducted the initial post-mortem, and also that they did not cooperate with its probe. The commission had submitted its report to the government in the first week of January this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/six-cops-to-be-sacked-over-prisoners-death-in-custody/articleshow/83173816.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||BJP: Delhi govt fudging death counts||New Delhi: The BJP on Thursday accused the AAP government in Delhi of fudging the Covid death figures to keep the official tally down and sought a white paper on the management of the pandemic in the capital. Referring to media reports, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra lashed out at chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over what he alleged were "unaccounted" deaths. “We want to hold the AAP accountable for what has happened,” he said. Addressing a digital press conference, Patra quoted the media reports that the municipal corporations in Delhi had issued 34,750 death certificates for April and May while the official Covid tally for the period was 13,201. “The number of death certificates for the corresponding period last year was 9,916, marking a rise of about 250 per cent this year. April and May saw the peak of the second wave of the pandemic,” Patra said, asking, "Who are these people, whose deaths remain unaccounted for?” “The fatality rate of 2.9 per cent in Delhi is more than double the overall national rate of 1.3 per cent,” pointed out. The BJP member also wondered why Delhi recorded over 14.25 lakh Covid cases when a state like Haryana, which has more population and area, has only 7.55 lakh cases. The BJP spokesperson asked if Covid testing was kept deliberately low when the pandemic was at its peak during April-May to "protect" the AAP government's image. He also questioned the government on why no new hospital was opened in the city during 2015-19. Patra dubbed the Delhi government minister Gopal Rai's reported comments about planting trees to avoid an oxygen crisis "ignorant and insensitive".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-delhi-govt-fudging-death-counts/articleshow/83217825.cms||---

Under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana—Gramin (PMAY-G) in Kerala, it was intended to provide houses to 42,431 identified beneficiaries in rural areas. The project was to be completed within 12 months from the date of sanction. The report said non-assessment of housing shortage, lack of convergence and shortcomings in technical and quality supervision, persisted in the project implementation. The grama panchayats had failed in selecting eligible beneficiaries and creation of permanent wait list (priority list), assisting the old and infirm in construction of houses, identifying land to landless and converging the schemes for access to basic amenities. The auditor also pointed out irregular sanctioning of houses and block panchayats’ failure to facilitate loans to beneficiaries. There were also instances of construction of houses without obtaining building permits from GPs and clearances from Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority. The state lost central assistance of Rs 195.82 crore during 2016-18 due to its failure to attain physical and financial progress prescribed by it. Monitoring was also deficient at various levels of programme management units, the report said. The report pointed out instances where funds released by the state government for creating public assets for the benefit of the community remained unutilised or blocked due to indecisiveness, lack of administrative oversight and concerted action at various levels. Failure to adhere to provisions and lax supervisory controls resulted in misappropriation of Rs 1.84 lakh in General Hospital, Neyyattinkara, Rs 6.46 lakh in the District Hospital, Mavelikkara and suspected misappropriation of Rs 0.83 lakh in Taluk Hospital, Fort, Thiruvananthapuram. The purchase of a mobile incinerator for Rs 2.14 crore by the local self-government department without assessing its economic viability resulted in its under-utilisation and consequent decommissioning. The failure of Kolazhy grama panchayat to adhere to the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Property Tax, Service Cess and Surcharge) Rules, 2011, led to revenue loss of Rs 37.71 lakh. Failure on the part of Thiruvananthapuram Corporation to safeguard blasted rubble obtained from the Vilappilsala Solid Waste Management Project resulted in loss of Rs 31.02 lakh and failure of Kothamangalam Municipality to collect and remit service tax in time led to a loss of Rs 23.64 lakh. The construction of a modern fish market by the corporation without proper study and correlating its design with the requirements of the vendors resulted in non-utilisation of the modern fish market constructed for Rs 23.25 lakh. The report also pointed out the failure of district collectors and the central plan monitoring unit in complying with the Centre’s directions to convert members of parliament local area development scheme savings bank accounts into Savifix/Saviplus accounts resulted in loss of interest of at least Rs 4.76 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cag-finds-lapses-in-pm-housing-scheme-rollout/articleshow/83173831.cms||---
---||Kochi||IUML moves SC against MHA order||Kozhikode: IUML has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the recent order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) allowing authorities of 13 districts in five states to grant citizenship to non-Muslim persons hailing from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The petition said that the order issued on May 28—which empowers collectors to grant citizenship to applicants belonging to minority communities (namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christians) from the three countries under Citizenship Act of 1955—was manifestly illegal and runs counter to the provisions of the Act itself that does not allow classification of applicants on the basis of religion. The MHA order empowered authorities of Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab to grant citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from the three countries who have been residing in specified districts. The petition said that the Act allowed any person (except an illegal migrant) to apply for citizenship by naturalization. IUML, which had earlier challenged the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) in Supreme Court, said that the recent order was an attempt by Centre to implement its mala fide designs envisaged under CAA. The new order issued by Centre comes even as it is yet to frame the rules for the controversial CAA. “Furthermore, the order does not withstand the test of Article 14 in as much as it treats people within a particular class i.e. persons entitled to apply for citizenship by registration and naturalization unequally by virtue of their religion,” the petition said. It further pointed out that the petitioner (IUML) had filed a writ petition against CAA for being violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 and the basic structure of the Constitution for discriminating among persons on the basis of their faith and religion and Centre, during the course of the hearing, had submitted in Supreme Court that staying of the Act was not necessary since the rules of CAA was not framed. “However, the Respondent Union, in a roundabout way, and in an attempt to circumvent the assurance given to this Hon. Court, have sought to implement their mala fide designs envisaged under the Amendment Act through the recently issued order dated May 28,” the petition said. The petition sought a directive to the Centre to stay further proceedings on the MHA order till the matter is decided by the court. The petition was drawn by advocate Haris Beeran and filed by advocate Pallavi Pratap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/iuml-moves-sc-against-mha-order/articleshow/83173847.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

For the past 10 months students in the region, including girls, have been walking over 6km from Rajamala to Eravikulam National Park to attend online classes. After the students’ struggle with the digital divide came to limelight, the district collector had sought a report from Devikulam sub-collector S Premkrishnan who recommended that the authorities set up a mobile tower in the region. "The district administration has identified the land to set up the tower. Reliance Jio will set up the tower within 15 days and ensure uninterrupted 4G data in the region," said S Premkrishnan. Officials said efforts are on to resolve network issues in other regions as well. According to data with Samagra Shiksaha Kerala, over 2015 students in the district do not have access to online education. People of Pettimudy still struggling: Meanwhile, 10 months after the landslide that claimed 70 lives, people of Pettimudy are still struggling without mobile connectivity. “There is a BSNL tower in Pettimudy but even a minor rainfall causes service outages," said Selvakumar, a resident of Pettimudy who moved to Rajamala after the landslide. Devikulam sub-collector S Premkrishnan said now with the government deciding to set up a tower in Rajamala the issue will be resolved. “A repeater can be fixed in the tower in Rajamala to ensure proper connectivity in Pettimudy as well,” he said. In addition, BSNL sources said optical fibre cable connections have been set up in association with Kannan Devan Hills Plantations in Rajamala and Pettimudy. A government report had stated that though the landslide occurred around 10:30pm on August 6 last year at Pettimudy, the outside world came to know about it after a survivor informed about it to forest officers a the checkpost at Eravikulam National Park at 7am the next day. The rescue team could reach the spot only by 11am on August 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/digital-gap-to-be-bridged-soon/articleshow/83186387.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Maharaj met chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Wednesday and after a discussion, said that the government has decided to identify land for the project.“Earlier, I had a meeting with union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and we had a detailed discussion about having an international airport in Uttarakhand. There are some technical issues at Jolly Grant airport in Dehradun and both its terminals may not be able to handle the international rush,” Maharaj told TOI. He added that having an airport in Haridwar was important as crores of devotees, from India and abroad, visit the holy town each year. “Therefore, I have directed DM Haridwar to search for land on which we can build an international airport. Once the project is approved by the Centre and the state, we will be able to complete it by 2030,” he added. Incidentally, Maharaj’s announcement came at a time when the expansion work of Dehradun airport is already going on. When contacted, state government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “When the tourism minister made the announcement, there were no talks in the cabinet or government for a new airport. The CM and ministers will take a call when the issue is brought before the cabinet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-initial-confusion-govt-gives-nod-to-identify-land-for-new-airport/articleshow/83184524.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Dehradun||Already-used antigen kits used again for tests to give Covid -ve report, 8 held||RUDRAPUR: Udham Singh Nagar police arrested eight staff members of a private company, which was given contract to perform Covid-19 tests of people entering Uttarakhand via the UP border. The accused utilised already-used rapid antigen kits to perform the tests and would give false negative reports to the people. Police and health department officials recovered 343 testing kits, out of which 167 were already used at Kumbh Mela in Haridwar in March this year, as the company had a testing contract there too. The accused have been identified as residents of Rudrapur, Haridwar, Bijnor and Sonepat towns. According to the district's chief medical officer (CMO) Dr DS Panchpal, a firm based in Delhi was given a contract for Covid-19 testing in Haridwar for Kumbh Mela. The firm got a contract in US Nagar, too, following the Covid curfew in the state in April. They had set up a testing camp at Pulbhatta border on the Bareilly highway. “On Monday evening, Dr HC Tripathi, medical superintendent of the Kichha community health centre, received information that false tests were conducted at the camp. Dr Tripathi along with a police team reached the spot and inspected the camp. The team found that on Monday, as many as 103 antigen tests were conducted as per records, but only six kits have been used,” Dr Panchpal said. "The accused had utilised the used swab sticks for the rest of the 97 individuals and provided them false negative reports. The samples were never processed and positive or negative status was given randomly. They would throw the sticks in the dustbin and later use them again. None of the accused held a mandatory diploma in medical laboratory technology for conducting such tests. They were arrested and taken into custody," the CMO added. SHO of the Pulbhatta police station, Vinod Joshi, said that during interrogation, one of the arrested staff told that officials of the firm had asked them to throw the swab sticks in the dustbin. "We have issued a notice to the company's management and asked them to appear before police, health and administrative officials," Joshi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/already-used-antigen-kits-used-again-for-tests-to-give-covid-ve-report-8-held/articleshow/83184538.cms||Aakash Ahuja

At Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), however, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar issued a statement saying that the entrance exams could be delayed. Jamia PRO, Ahmed Azeem, however, clarified that this was a tentative date, and the university might change it depending on the Covid condition and the lockdown situation in Delhi. “We do not rely on CBSE marks anyway as we have an entrance test where the eligibility is often as low as 50%,” he added. JNU VC said that the entrance exam, which is conducted by National Testing Agency, would be conducted whenever it was safe for the students to take the test. Welcoming the government’s decision to not conduct CBSE XII exams, Kumar said, “The decision is pragmatic and rational considering the pandemic is a once in a century occurrence. The health and safety of the students are of paramount importance.” He added that, if the entrance was delayed and admissions pushed to a later date, the university would adjust its academic calendar to take care of the lost time. Kumar also suggested that, for undergraduate admission based on Class XII marks, universities could devise appropriate procedures, which were fair and transparent. “We need to find optimal solutions than feel anxious about the challenges faced by the pandemic. Our educational system is capable of meeting these challenges,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jamia-entrance-likely-on-june-22-jnu-may-delay-it/articleshow/83186254.cms||---

With the southwest monsoon near, the city is witnessing active pre-monsoon showers, which are likely to continue till June 8. “This year, the maximum temperature remained below normal for many days during peak summer. This could be attributed to increased western disturbances,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad. IMD, Hyderabad said that from March to May, the maximum temperature breached the 40 degree Celsius mark only on one day—April 4. The summer heat is now paving way for the onset of southwest monsoon, with the city recording light to moderate rains for the last two days. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures as of 8 am on Wednesday, Jeedimetla recorded highest rainfall of 58 mm followed by 57.3 mm at Rangareddy Nagar in Quthbullapur. Heavy rain bands developed by Thursday afternoon in the western parts of the city resulting in 45.3 mm rainfall in Serilingampally and over 20 mm rainfall in Chanda Nagar, Gachibowli, Madhapur, Shaikpet, Manikonda among others. The rainfall activity led to a sharp drop of up to four degree Celsius in mercury levels. While the city recorded a maximum temperature of 34.7 degree Celsius, the minimum temperature dropped to 22 degree Celsius. IMD-Hyderabad has extended the thunderstorm warning accompanied with lightning and gusty winds of up to 30-40 kmph till June 6. “The onset of southwest monsoon is expected around June 12 over Telangana.

---||Mumbai||HC suggests roping in Maharashtra doctors for temp duty in prisons||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday said the state government may consider roping in doctors from state hospitals for temporary duty in prisons till vacant posts of medical officers are filled. The state said it intends to fill the vacancies and advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said a new proposal is likely soon. Senior counsel Mihir Desai appearing for an NGO said the concern is that allopathic medicines should be prescribed by MBBS doctors and not ayurvedic doctors, but several prisons, including Taloja, are staffed with non-allopathy doctors. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni, was hearing a suo motu PIL on decongesting prisons in the wake of Covid cases among inmates. The state’s director of health services had in 2017 and 2018 issued circulars to all civil surgeons and government hospitals deans to organise weekly OPDs in prisons in their jurisdiction, pointed out professor Vijay Raghavan of TISS. The bench suggested to the AG that till appointments are made, civil hospital doctors be placed on rotation for a couple of hours daily or more regularly at prisons, to check if inmates are responding to treatment in prison hospitals. “You (state) have so many doctors,” said the bench. Kumbhakoni said a weekly OPD is being conducted. The AG submitted a chart to show active Covid cases among prisoners were down from 311 before May 12 to 114 now. Appreciating measures taken by the prisons department to decongest jails, the HC suggested that more temporary jails should be set up. The HC sought to know the vaccine policy and called for prioritising elderly inmates. The state told HC said that of the 33,832 prisoners across the state, 4,359 were vaccinated after May 12 and 2,208 prisoners earlier. Also, while 3,598 jail staffers had been vaccinated after May 12, 3,217 were immunised before that. The bench also sought information on undertrial inmates accused of offences that attracted maximum imprisonment of seven years, stating many petty cases may be due to penury. The bench said this factor must be considered as “arresting and putting them in jail is not going to serve any purpose,” adding, “if crimes are committed to satisfy hunger.” Raghavan, assisting the HC, said as there was no government or civil hospital in Navi Mumbai, the state-run JJ Hospital faced immense pressure. The HC suggested amending the law to including civic hospitals. “Why not change colonial rules of the jail manual and bring some amendments so municipal corporation hospitals can also take in patients?” The matter has been adjourned to June 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-suggests-roping-in-maharashtra-state-docs-for-temp-duty-in-prisons/articleshow/83188148.cms||Swati Deshpande

---||India||Tarun Tejpal verdict like a ‘manual for rape victims’, says HC||PANAJI: The Goa bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday issued notice to Tehelka founder-editor Tarun Tejpal in the Goa government’s appeal challenging his acquittal by a trial court in a rape case and said some observations in the judgment regarding the conduct of the survivor after the alleged incident were “kind of a manual for rape victims”.“There is a prima facie c ase for consideration of leave to appeal under Section 378 of the Criminal Procedure Code,” Justice SC Gupte said. Referring to the additional sessions court judgment, Gupte said, “The prosecution case is not only fully stated, the gist is given straightaway, and comments are offered on the witnesses of the prosecution”. During the hearing, solicitor-general of India Tushar Mehta raised the point that the judge discussed the conduct of the survivor and how a victim of a sexual offence should behave. He also objected strongly to the trial court’s observations regarding the conduct of the survivor when she was kissed by the accused. Read AlsoGoa govt seeks retrial in Tejpal case; cites trial court's observationsThe Goa government in its appeal before the Bombay high court against journalist Tarun Tejpal's acquittal in a rape case said it was a fit case for retrial, citing the trial court's lack of understanding of a victim's post-trauma behaviour and censuring of her character.Mehta told the high court that on perusal of the judgment, “one cannot make out” if the survivor or the accused was on trial. “The entire judgment proceeds as if the victim is on trial,” he said. “‘It is not possible to believe that the prosecutrix (survivor), a woman who is aware of laws, intelligent, alert and physically fit (a yoga trainer), would not push or ward off the accused if she got pushed up against the wall, especially when she was facing him, and especially when she saw the accused coming uncomfortably close to her in her private space,’” Mehta quoted the sessions court judgment as saying. The solicitor-general said trial judge Kshama Joshi remained a mute spectator and didn’t prevent the defence from raising questions about the survivor’s previous conduct. Mehta also said that the judgment states that the survivor consulted certain people (lawyers), and that has been held against the survivor. He then asked the judge to redact the name of these “eminent lawyers” from the judgment. “We have redacted most of the direct references to the victim’s identity,” Justice Gupte said, adding that this matter (of deleting the lawyers’ names) can be raised at the next hearing. Earlier this month, Kshama Joshi had acquitted the accused, stating, “Upon considering the other evidence on record, the benefit of doubt is given to the accused as there is no corroborative evidence supporting the allegations made by the prosecutrix The trial court judge had added, “It is crucial to note that the contradictions are often so glaring that the exact opposite of what the prosecutrix is claiming actually happens on the screen, yet the investigation officer didn’t even question the prosecutrix on the same.”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tarun-tejpal-verdict-like-a-manual-for-rape-victims-says-hc/articleshow/83192250.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Delhi||DU hopes CBSE will find a ‘good’ scoring system||New Delhi: Determining the cutoff marks for admission to the undergraduate courses in Delhi University this year looks problematic if the Central Board for Secondary Education fails to come up with a scoring system that will prevent schools from giving unwarranted marks to their students. Having cancelled the school-leaving Class XII exams, CBSE has to now come up with an assessment system to grade the students. DU vice-chancellor PC Joshi told TOI, “As per practice, we conduct admissions on merit and whatever CBSE determines are the Class XII marks, we will consider them.” Rajeev Gupta, chairman of admissions at the university, however, pointed out that it would be tough to decide the qualifying marks for admission in such circumstances and hoped that the board would come up with “a good system taking into account the country-wide processes”. DU college principals apprehend a tough time ahead discerning the actual capacity of students from their scores. Many principals felt the university should employ benchmarks other than the Class XII marks, perhaps entrance tests. As Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College, pointed out, “Our difficulty every year is tyring to distinguish merit among high-scoring students. The problem this year is that we don’t even know how they marks they will be determined by CBSE.” Sinha feared, like other principals, that schools, if given a free hand by the board, could modify the marks to ensure their students scored high. “We used to rationalise the marks of the various state boards while finalising the cut-off points,” he said, adding that he hoped CBSE would create an algorithm that kept the marks released by schools as close to the students’ capacities as possible. Ramjas College principal Manoj Khanna was explicit that if the Class 12 results were school-dependent, then “we cannot decide the cutoffs”. He reasoned, “When CBSE conducts exams, it is a uniform system. But schools may each have their own criteria for marks and there will a big disparity in marking. We may even see hundreds of students with 100% aggregates.” Khanna suggested that DU should opt for another basis for admission and not rely on Class XII merit alone. On such an alternative mechanism to benchmark students, Debraj Mookerjee, associate professor at Ramjas College, DU should have an autonomous position, free from the central government’s or CBSE’s. “The Union ministry of education had proposed the Central Universities’ Common Entrance Test (CUCET) and knowing that there was a pandemic on, the ministry could have pushed for the test. They could have conducted the exam online.” Mookerjee said even now DU could use this opportunity to install a new model for admissions. “The university can ask the parent department to formulate entrance tests common to all colleges. This has happened in the past with entrance tests for English courses,” he said. “Some colleges had their own individual tests until their discontinuation in 2009.” At Ambedkar University Delhi, registrar Nitin Malik said, “Universities can consider the assessment factor defined by CBSE to determine merit determination.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-hopes-cbse-will-find-a-good-scoring-system/articleshow/83186399.cms||Mohammad Ibrar

They said that it would be better if guidelines are announced at the earliest so that students, especially those planning to go abroad for graduation, can choose their next step. “Due to second wave of Covid pandemic prevailing in India, there were no better ways to conduct final board exams, however, Grade XII marks are crucial in child’s career as they are the deciding factor to enter into top colleges for undergraduation in India and overseas,” said K Srilatha, principal, Global Indian International School-Uppal Campus. “The entire academic fraternity, especially students and parents, is eagerly waiting for guidelines from the board about awarding grades. The sooner the guidelines are announced and grades are awarded, students can choose the next step of the future,” the principal added. Praveen Raju, vice chairman, Suchitra Group, said that CBSE should ensure students don’t get affected due to the methodology of awarding marks and added that modalities should be worked out in consultation with all the stakeholders involved. Parents said that deciding to cancel class 12 exams is the right decision as there is no way to conduct exams without compromising the safety of children. They said that it is important for the government to announce how they plan to calculate students’ grades at the earliest as it already a little late for the Indian students to apply to foreign universities and students might have to defer to January/winter intake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/announce-criterion-for-class-12-marks/articleshow/83186389.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Aurangabad||Govt cancels HSC exam, some relieved, some upset||Aurangabad: The Maharashtra cabinet’s decision to cancel the Std XII or higher secondary certificate (HSC) examination, in line with a similar call taken by the CBSE, evoked mixed reaction from the students and parents. Anuj Chavan, a Std XII student from Nashik, said it was a judicious decision. “Since the virus is extremely virulent, there is a chance of students getting infected while appearing for the exams,” he said. Moreover, many students have to travel by public transport to exam centre and it can also lead to students getting infected. “Students and their parents are more concerned about the safety. The evaluation of the students can be done based on the performance at internal exams,” he said. Vijay Mote, whose child is in Std XII in Aurangabad, felt that the Covid curve has flattened only due to lockdown-like restrictions since April 14. “As the restrictions are partially lifted, I fear that cases may go up again. It would pose a rise to the safety of students appearing for HSC exams,” he said. Maharashtra school education minister Varsha Gaikwad in a tweet said, “There is no doubt that Std. XII exams are an important milestone in a student’s life, but given the current circumstances, the health and mental well-being of our children should be prioritised.” A section of parents and teaching community felt that the exams for this key academic year can be held now that the pandemic has ebbed a bit. Aarati Wadekar, whose daughter was preparing for her HSC exam in Aurangabad, said she did not appreciate the stand to cancel the Std XII examination as it would create issues in the admission process for degree courses. “Students were preparing for HSC examination throughout the year and their hard-work should not go to waste,” she said. Abhiman Mali, a class XII student of DRK College of Commerce, Kolhapur, said that science students have the option of entrance tests to get admission to graduate courses but it is not the case for their courses. “There are limited colleges and seats for commerce stream. I want a common entrance test for Std 12 commerce students. I have heard that marks will be given on some internal assessment, but it needs to be done carefully so that hard-working students do not suffer,” he said. A principal of an engineering college in Aurangabad said HSC examinations can be held safely by increasing the examination centres to avoid crowding of students. “Every year, SSC and HSC exams are held simultaneously. It is not the case this year as the former stands cancelled. The centres used for SSC can be considered for HSC exams,” he said, adding that the exam is a must as it is a gateway to higher education. Kritika Sharma from Nashik felt that the authorities could have chosen to hold online examination to gauge the performance of the students. “There are several institutes that are having online examinations. Moreover we have been preparing hard for the exams and I feel our efforts have gone to waste,” she remarked. A teacher of a CBSE school, Sangeeta Kulkarni, said that she is concerned about the evaluation system that would be in place to assess the examinees. “The evaluation system should be such that the meritorious students are not at a loss. It would have a demoralising effect on them,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/govt-cancels-hsc-exam-some-relieved-some-upset/articleshow/83182544.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Agri dept advises against early sowing amid pre-monsoon showers||Aurangabad/Kolhapur: Pre-monsoon showers have been lashing several places across the state — including the Marathwada region as well as Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts — sparking excitement within the farming community. The state agriculture department, however, has advised farmers not to start sowing early. The farmers have been asked to wait till there is at least 100mm rainfall so that there is the desired moisture-level in the soil. In some parts of western Maharashtra, the pre-monsoon showers were heavy and inundated localities and farms. Karad, Satara, Miraj, Kurundwad and Shirol got a good spell of rain, but the day was dry in Kolhapur city. The city is expected to get some heavy showers after midnight. The district disaster management has issued advisory to local teams to be on alert at night for heavy downpour and inconvenience to the residents. Many places in the Marathwada region, including Aurangabad,too have received the pre-monsoon showers in the 48-hour period ending on Wednesday morning. As per official data, Aurangabad district received 25mm average rainfall between June 1 and 10 am on June 2 (Wednesday), which accounts for almost 20% of total rainfall for the first month of the rainy season. Among different areas in the city and outskirts, Bhawsingpura reported 127mm rainfall, Osmanpura 31mm and Chikalthana 35mm during this period. The India Meteorological Department, said Aurangabad and many parts of the Marathwada region are likely to have rain or thundershowers with strong gusty winds for at least the next 48 hours.There is a similar prediction for Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts too. Kolhapur district agriculture department clarified that the advisory is applicable for dry and arid regions such as Maan, Khatav tehsils in Satara district and Jat, Kavathe Mahankal and Atpadi tehsils in Sangli district. These areas receive less rainfall and depend on monsoon for irrigation activities. Dynadeo Wakure, the Kolhapur district agriculture superintendent, said, “Kolhapur has irrigation facilities. Already, sowing of soyabean and rice on over 1,000 hectare has been completed. The irrigation facilities ensure that the soil conditions are proper for sowing.” He added that in the dry and arid areas, there are chances of failure of germination if the soil conditions are not proper. Therefore, to avoid re-sowing, farmers are advised not to rush with sowing activities. Tukaram Mothe, the Aurangabad district superintendent agriculture officer, said early sowing before the proper arrival of monsoon can lead to the need for resowing in case the monsoon plays truant. Adding that the Aurangabad region is known as a major cotton cultivation belt during the kharif season, Mothe said early sowing of the cash crop should be strictly avoided even if irrigation facilities are available. “As per official studies, sowing for cotton crop before June 15 can invite the menace of pink bollworm, which had destroyed cotton crops on large tracts of land in Marathwada in the recent past. The pest is found to have a more active life cycle if cotton sowing takes place between the last week of May and early June,” he said. As per official estimates, Aurangabad district is likely to have cultivation of kharif crops on an increased 6.81 lakh hectare area with tur, soyabean, and maize being major crops, along with cotton.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/agri-dept-advises-against-early-sowing-amid-pre-monsoon-showers/articleshow/83182573.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt plans 24x7 remote access for Covid patients||NEW DELHI: Preparing for a possible next Covid-19 wave, Delhi government is going to create a privately run 24x7 health system that will allow suspected and confirmed coronavirus patients to hold tele- and video consultations with doctors and also access ambulances, oxygen, hospital admission, medicines and other services. This system can be accessed through a helpline number and will be integrated with government platforms, including those at the district level. The new system will have modules for triaging patients into pre-defined categories, identifying patients suitable for home isolation or for transfer to Covid care centres, health centres or to hospitals. Triaging is considered key in checking mortality because it provides patients immediate and required level of care. A government official admitted that the proposal was at the initial stage, and will take a final shape after consultations with the private service providers with expertise and knowledge of the field. Delhi government’s department of health and family welfare has invited firms with experience and capacity in providing tele-consultation services using digital technologies for Covid management to submit an expression of interest. A meeting is scheduled for June 10 to discuss the prospects and further steps, according to Sandeep Mishra, special secretary, health and family welfare. “The expression of interest is a means to identifying available and easily customisable solutions and to get inputs from private partners to firm up the design and scope of outsourcing of services,” said Mishra. Under the new system, an adequate number of lines will be established for tele-consultations, enough to cater to peak pandemic load, with some lines kept in reserve. The inbound calls will be segregated on the basis of service sought. The official explained, “The idea is that the agency should have real-time information on the availability of beds, ICU and ventilators in hospitals and Covid care centres. The agency will take necessary measures to assess and triage the patients. If need be, it will recommend a move to a certain hospital with an available bed.” The patients identified for home care will be assigned to an identified pool of doctors for regular tele- and video consultations, which will commence within an hour of the individuals being assigned. The patients will also be guided on the essential usage of medical devices, etc. The system will capture hospital bed status and coordinate the shifting of patients requiring hospitalisation at any stage. Those needing hospitalisation will be assisted in coordinating with ambulance services and in securing admission in Covid facilities. Critical alerts will be generated and notified to doctors and other stakeholders, including command and control structures, through SMS, phone calls and other methods, integrating with existing government platforms, including those at the district level, whenever required. The new tele-Covid centre will be adequately staffed with qualified and experienced tele-callers, paramedics and doctors including specialists like pulmonologists, psychiatrists, critical care experts, intensivists, gastroenterologists and cardiologists. The system will also make arrangements for an adequate number of doctors and healthcare workers to manage peak loads. It will be scalable and more than one agency could be engaged to create a robust setup that is ready to effectively manage the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-plans-24x7-remote-access-for-covid-patients/articleshow/83184568.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Dehradun||Iconic Doon musician Ajit Singh, one of few proponents of Vichitra Veena in India, dies aged 88||DEHRADUN: Iconic Doon-based musician and owner of the Pratap Music House, a landmark music shop at Astley Hall, Ajit Singh, passed away of a cardiac arrest aged 88 on Tuesday. He was one of the few people in the country who could play the Vichitra Veena and played for The Beatles when the band visited Rishikesh in 1968. He also performed abroad on several occasions. Singh was also one of the top-graded artistes with All India Radio. Unlike “rudra veena”, the more popular version of the instrument, “vichitra veena” is a fret-less instrument and rests horizontally before the musician. Playing it requires extreme precision. Singh was also known for his extensive knowledge of musical instruments. Speaking to TOI, Doon-based heritage activist Lokesh Ohri said that The Beatles had found out about the musician through his music shop, Pratap Music House (which is named after Singh’s grandfather, who was also an accomplished musician, who lived in Afghanistan, and later Lahore). “When the Beatles visited Singh’s shop, they got to know about the brilliant range of instruments there. They also found out about Singh’s extraordinary talent and invited him to perform with them in Rishikesh. Even to this day, his shop serves as a go-to place for all musicians, as it has a range like no other shop in Dehradun,” Ohri said. Ohri added that Singh was a childhood friend of Ruskin Bond, as they both grew up in Astley Hall before the latter moved to Landour. “I used to look forward to our meetings where he used to tell me stories about Ruskin Bond,” Ohri reminisced. Brijpal Aneja, Singh’s sister and an accomplished classical dance teacher, said he loved teaching music to youngsters. “He taught at The Doon School, the Wellham Girls School as well as at a US-based university.” “He developed some health issues, which did not allow him to play instruments. This caused depression and he started losing weight severely,” Aneja said, holding back tears. Mercy Phuntsog Nath, a play school teacher in Rajpur, who had struck up a life-long friendship with the musician, said, “I used to tell Ajit uncle to pen down his experiences for posterity and write a book. He would nod his head and say, ‘I am writing.’ He was an institution in himself who will be sorely missed by all music lovers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/iconic-doon-musician-ajit-singh-one-of-few-proponents-of-vichitra-veena-in-india-dies-aged-88/articleshow/83184563.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Delhi||Tweak CoWin app to make it easier to access, says HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Centre to tweak the CoWin App for vaccination against Covid-19, to enlarge its reach and make it easier to access. It also directed the government to place before it the data privacy policy with regard to the portal, even as the Centre said it will also upload the policy online. A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh pointed out that at present only four people can log in by one number to register and several people who own smartphones may not be able to operate the app. When the government explained the limitation was to prevent hoarding and middlemen taking over the vaccination process, the court asked it to re-examine the position since there “may be need to enlarge number of registrations per mobile to cover more population.” It also said the current requirement of a security “captcha” needs a relook since many disabled people may be unable to operate it. After the amicus flagged the issue, the high court suggested that some voice enabled log in or an OTP might be more accessible. During the hearing, the bench also expressed dissatisfaction over the steps taken by the AAP government to aid differently-abled people, orphan children and senior citizens in the pandemic. “As of now it is totally dissatisfactory, absolutely dissatisfactory. Why do you need prodding from us,” the bench said seeking to know what steps are being taken by the government departments. “Senior citizens, children and people with disabilities are the people otherwise neglected and we need to look after them in this pandemic. We want you to tell us what the bottlenecks are because we want nothing but the best for them,” it said, adding that the court wants to see results within three days. The court’s comments came after advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, appearing for NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, said it received 30 calls in a day for help and there is not a single helpline number for persons with disabilities. She said the problems are peculiar to them and simply appointing nodal officers is not going to help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tweak-cowin-app-to-make-it-easier-to-access-says-hc/articleshow/83186410.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Hyderabad||Students going abroad air vaccine worries||Hyderabad: Telangana government is set to commence vaccination drive for students going abroad for further studies from June 5. The health department is launching a separate facility wherein students will be able to book online slots from June 4. The link will be made available on www.health.telangana.gov.in. Even as the government has decided to commence vaccination drive, students are in a dilemma over the duration between the two doses. With majority countries recognising Covishield, students have raised concerns over the three-month duration between the two doses. Others are worried that Covaxin is yet to be recognised by several countries. More than 70,000 students from Telangana go to various countries, including the UK, the US and Canada every year. With classes for the fall semester set to commence from September first week, many are expected to report to their respective institutions by mid-August. Although the state government has decided to commence vaccination from June 5 for students going abroad, many fear they may not be able to take the second dose. While students will be able to take their first dose in India, they have to travel to respective countries by the time they are due for their next dose. “If we don’t get vaccinated before travelling, we will be expected to undergo mandatory institutional quarantine, which is very expensive. I plan to go to Canada by mid-August. If I don’t get vaccinated before that, I will have to shell approximately Rs Rs 1.5 to Rs Rs 2 lakh towards quarantine,” said Ashish Patnaik, a student. He said, the government should issue guidelines and commence the vaccination drive for students at the earliest. Many others who have taken Covaxin are worried as it is not recognised by several countries, and are taking to social media to express their concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-going-abroad-air-vaccine-worries/articleshow/83186412.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: These doctors are helping patients tackle mental health||NEW DELHI: For doctors engaged by Delhi’s three municipalities to help Covid patients in home quarantine through tele-counselling, every minute counts these days. They start receiving calls from Covid patients from as early as 9am and this goes on for the entire day. Apart from counselling patients for their psychological wellbeing, the doctors also prescribe medicines to them, suggest nearby hospitals or tertiary care centres for immediate medical attention and keep an online record of their health status. A total of 78 doctors have been engaged by the three corporations to run Covid helplines in shifts and since April 19, they have attended to about 20,000 calls. “Since a majority of allopathic doctors are engaged in Covid ward or multiple duties, we took the help of 29 ayush doctors for tele-counselling. They even contact the people specified in the list of Covid-positive patients received from the Delhi government or public health department to verify their health status. Each of them attend to at least 10-15 calls every day and this is in addition to their regular duties,” said a senior official from East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). The civic body has uploaded mobile numbers of all the 29 doctors on its website. They are available from 9 am to 9 pm. Yogesh Kumar, chief medical officer of EDMC’s ayush department, said that besides giving medical prescriptions, these doctors also suggest home remedies to help asymptomatic or mild patients recover post Covid. “We first understand the person’s situation and calm him/her down as people tend to get confused and feel depressed or panicky on testing positive. We later recommend certain home remedies to treat sore throat, mild fever and running nose,” he explained. In the north corporation, the helpline facility started on May 1. “We have a team of 15 ayush doctors working in three shifts. We also have 15 teams of allopathic doctors or faculty from a medical college working in three shifts, each having two members. Callers have the option to pursue any of these ayush and allopathic doctors as per their requirement,” said a north corporation official. Of late, some random queries have also flooded the helplines. “We started the helpline to help people deal with psychological issues. Now, the doctors are even receiving calls regarding waste collection, bus and train services, quarantine centres, hospitals, testing centres, sanitisation of houses, vaccination centres, plasma banks, Covid-related drugs, etc,” said a senior south corporation official. “In a month, we received 4,339 calls,” the civic official stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/these-docs-are-helping-patients-tackle-mental-health/articleshow/83184601.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Chandigarh||Grim truth: Covid snatches parents of 23 kids in Punjab||CHANDIGARH: As many as 23 children have been orphaned in Punjab after losing one or both their parents during the Covid-19 pandemic. As per the state government data collected till Wednesday, the parent/parents of these children died due to Covid between March 31, 2020, and May 31, 2021. There were some who lost their surviving parent to the virus. Raji P Srivastava, principal secretary of the social security and women and child development department, said the state government is ensuring that the benefit of all ongoing schemes is extended to orphaned children without any difficulty. Being the nodal department for the care of orphaned children, it has issued a set of instructions to all concerned departments of the state government on May 25. "In all cases of children orphaned by Covid, the proper procedure is being followed, social investigation is being conducted, the child and his close relatives are interviewed and their views are ascertained," she added. The senior IAS officer further added that initially most such children have been taken in by their close relatives and those who are not accepted by their relatives or those who do not have relatives, will be taken into state government’s children's homes. Siblings will stay in the same child care institution. Such orphaned children would also be produced before the child welfare committee of the relevant district. Child development project officers (CDPOs) of each block have been designated as special mentors for each such child and they will act as counsellor-cum-motivator for the child till they grow up. The state government has constituted a monitoring committee under the chairmanship of Aruna Chaudhary, cabinet minister of the social security and women and child development, which would at least meet once a month and review in detail the relief measures being put in place for every single case. The department would maintain the record of all such affected children and apprise them in writing of the welfare measures being offered to them. The SC has already taken suo motu notice in the case and is monitoring the measures being taken by various states and UTs to extend benefits to the orphaned children. There are 7 cases in Bathinda district where the child has lost one or both the parents to Covid-19. The district administration is working to send these children to the child care home as there is no one left to take care of them. The district administration is providing food to such families. At Barnala, two sisters lost both their parents to the virus. Now, the girls, aged 17 and 12, are being looked after by their married brother. Barnala district child protection officer Abhishek Singla said that all benefits admissible in this case will be provided to the children and a case is being prepared for assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/grim-truth-covid-snatches-parents-of-23-kids-in-punjab/articleshow/83190648.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Delhi||Plea filed in SC against Delhi HC order allowing Vista work during Covid||New Delhi: A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday challenging an order of Delhi High Court which had refused to stay construction of the Central Vista redevelopment project during the Covid-19 pandemic. Terming it as a “vital and essential project of national importance", the Delhi High Court on May 31 dismissed a plea against the Central Vista project. The court had also imposed a cost of Rs one lakh on the petitioner for filling the frivolous and motivated petition to stay the ongoing construction work. "The present petition has been filed to stop with immediate effect the work of the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue. This work is part and parcel of the Central Vista project and is of vital public importance. The construction of the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project cannot be seen in isolation. In fact, the whole Central Vista project is an essential project of national importance, where the sovereign functions of Parliament are also to be conducted. Public is vitally interested in this project," the HC had said. Challenging the HC order, advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav filed a petition in the SC. Yadav, who was not a party in HC proceedings, alleged that that the HC erred in allowing the construction works to go on during the pandemic. He said that allowing a big construction work, with large number of workers, to continue during the pandemic period is a serious public health concern.

As her new academic year is about to begin, the family is scrounging around for her fees. A social worker, working with the family closely, said Hiralal first exhibited signs of fever. When he was taken to a nearby hospital due to shortness of breath, it was already too late. “The family does not have any proof that he had died of Covid-19. The death certificate doesn’t mention it. Would she be covered under the new scheme?” asked a family member. As the central and state governments announced schemes to support children who have been orphaned by Covid-19, activists and NGOs say the task is not easy – primarily due to the fact that many of these families do not possess documentary proof that their family members died of Covid. Experts pointed out that often the deaths took place after their discharge due to post-Covid complications. “Would they be included in the list? We got to know that the rules are still being formed. We are hopeful that such cases would find a place in the register,” said another official working with a child NGO who did not wish to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/orphaned-by-covid-dazed-by-aid-complexities/articleshow/83186468.cms||Radha Sharma

"…in a patriarchal society, it is fairly common to cast aspersions on the moral character of a woman. More often than not these allegations are made without any basis or foundation.” “Even assuming a woman is or has been in an extramarital relationship, the same by itself cannot lead to the conclusion that she would not be a good mother to deny her the custody of her child," Justice Anupinder Singh Grewal observed while hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by a woman from Fatehgarh Sahib, in Punjab, who is now an Australian citizen. The judge also ordered that custody of the four-and-a-half-year-old daughter be handed to the woman. In her petition, the woman petitioner (name withheld to protect her identity) said she had got married in 2013. Her husband, a native of Ludhiana, was an Australian citizen, and she later joined him in Australia. They had a daughter in June 2017. The couple developed differences and when they were visiting India in January 2020, her husband allegedly took away the child on February 2, 2020 when she had gone to her parental village. He contended that the minor child had been residing with him and her grandparents in a cordial family environment for almost a year and that change of custody at this stage would not be in the interest of the child, especially when the petitioner is living alone and, thus, would not be in a position to take care of the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cant-deny-woman-kids-custody-due-to-extramarital-affair-punjab-and-haryana-high-court/articleshow/83192276.cms||---

The case is presently being probed by the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which recorded Pujari’s formal arrest on February 19. Additional chief judicial magistrate court in Kochi had on Monday granted custody of Pujari till June 8 to the police. The petition seeking Pujari’s custody was considered via online on Monday. The case pertains to the incident on December 15, 2018 when two bike-borne assailants fired from a pistol near a salon run by actor Leena Maria Paul. A few days later, a man who claimed to be Pujari called up a local news channel, taking responsibility for the incident. It was later revealed that Pujari reportedly sought money from the actor, a month before the incident. The gangster was arrested in Senegal in January 2019 and was later handed over to Bengaluru police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gangster-pujari-brought-to-kochi/articleshow/83186462.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Families staying in over 30,000 apartments and waiting for their vaccination jabs can register their details through smartphones by downloading the app (Android) after its formal launch. “We are planning to name it I-VACCINATE mobile app,” he said. Another UFERWAS member, RSV Badrinath, said, “We are facing vaccine hesitancy. To instil confidence in the residents, we have initiated this mobile app. A proposal is also under active consideration to extend the app to across the country with the coordination of Confederation of RWAs (CoRWAs), a nationwide network of resident welfare associations. After UFERWAS took up the initiative of vaccinating its members, half-a-dozen reputed private hospitals in the city have come forward to inoculate citizens. “We are signing memorandum of understanding (MoU) to organise vaccination camps,” another member, BT Srinivasan, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-vaccine-app-designed-exclusively-for-societies-in-city/articleshow/83186444.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Over 50% of Hyderabad’s home-buyers are below 35 years||HYDERABAD: The city’s post-Covid-19 market has found a new set of home-buyers — millennials. While prior to the pandemic, this group — largely between 25 years and 35 year of age — comprised only a small section of the clientele, most developers are now seeing that percentage touch 50% or more. In fact, Anarock Property Consultants’ recent consumer sentiment survey found that Hyderabad has the “highest number of property seekers (55%) aged within 25 to 35 years among all cities in India, including metros and smaller ones”. This is followed by Pune, where it stands at 45%. Reason: Both cities have a large pool of young people who now aspire to own a home earlier in life, the survey stated. “The fact that the IT industry, despite the challenges of the pandemic, has managed to stay stable is also a reason for this trend to pick up,” said R Suresh Kumar, senior vice-president (business operations), Prestige Group (Hyderabad). The Bengaluru-based developer has seen a pronounced jump in its 25 to 30-year-old home buyers’ numbers. “The importance of a home that has dawned on many, post Covid-19, has hit this generation as well. So those with financial stability is looking at parking their money here,” Kumar added. It’s also the safest investment option now feel those like Suresh Kumar, a 31-year-old IT professional from Jharkhand. He has recently invested in a house in Hyderabad’s Financial District. “With this pandemic I have realised that returning to my home state, at least till I am employed, is not an option. So, if I eventually want to live in Hyderabad — a city I like — I might as well buy a home here and start my loan early so that I can pay it off faster. It’s an asset that won’t depreciate in value soon,” he said. Agrees Veera Babu, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield (Hyderabad). “And given the current situation coupled with very low interest rates, the conditions are even more appropriate for these buyers, with larger disposable incomes, to take a decision,” he said adding, “Also, Hyderabad’s residential market has been heating up for the last couple of years and there is general concern among buyers on losing out on opportunities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/over-50-of-hyderabads-home-buyers-are-below-35-years/articleshow/83186481.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Dehradun||No doctors in Red Cross hospitals since 2008||DEHRADUN: Days after Bollywood singer Jubin Nautiyal highlighted the condition of a hospital run by the Red Cross Society in Nagthat area of Chakrata in Jaunsar Bawar, where no doctor has been appointed in the past 13 years, TOI took stock of other institutions run by the international society in the Himalayan state and found that either they had shut down or were lying unused. As per the documents accessed by TOI, the Red Cross Society was operating four hospitals, five sub-centres and five childcare centres (balwadi kendra) across Uttarakhand (then in Uttar Pradesh) since the late 1970s. All the sub-centres and childcare centres along with two hospitals were shut down in 2019 due to scarcity of funds. The society currently is running only two hospitals -- in Nagthat and Chamba -- but no doctor has been appointed in these facilities in the past decade. “We had four 20-30 bed hospitals in Nagthat (Dehradun), Chamba (Tehri), Gulbharoj (Udham Singh Nagar) and Balwakot (Pithoragarh). All of them were established during the1970s. The hospitals in Nagthat and Chamba were built on land owned by the Red Cross Society and the rest were on rented property. The hospitals in Balwakot and Bulbharoj – both tribal areas -- shut down some time back,” said a senior official from Red Cross Society, Uttarakhand. There are no other hospitals in Balwakot and Bulbharoj. He added that five sub-centres and balwadi kendras, which had staff of around 86 people, shut down in October, 2019. The existing hospitals in Nagthat and Chamba have had no doctor or even a pharmacist since 2008, he said. The hospitals which were shut down have left the neighbouring villages in desperate need of medical care. “The Red Cross Society hospital in Nagthat was catering to at least 50 villages with a population of over 15,000. Although it shut down, the government is under the impression it’s still running and has not built another hospital. The nearest big hospital is in Dehradun, five hours by road. The women in our villages are forced to deliver in ambulances. People die before they reach hospitals,” said Jaipal Singh, headman, Nagthat. The Red Cross Society hospital in Chamba was also the only healthcare option for at least 20 nearby villages. It still has a midwife, peon and driver but no doctor or pharmacist. Almost half of the area of both these hospitals, built on land donated by the villagers, has been converted into guest houses for the Red Cross Society, and the furniture meant for patients is rusting. “We have written to Red Cross Society India several times but have not received clearance regarding appointments so far. All these institutions were running with funding from Canadian Red Cross Society. Currently, we are using the existing hospitals to create awareness about Covid-19 among villagers and we are also distributing masks and sanitisers,” said Dr M S Ansari, secretary, Red Cross Society, Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-doctors-in-red-cross-hospitals-in-ukhand-since-2008/articleshow/83184689.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Delhi||Traders seek phased reopening of Chandni Chowk market||New Delhi: Amid declining fresh coronavirus cases and the positivity rate in the capital, traders in Chandni Chowk market have sought phased reopening of the business hub. Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal has written a letter to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in this regard. “The positivity rate has been less than 5% for over 12 days now. World Health Organisation recommends that before reopening, rates of positivity should remain at 5% or lower for at least 14 days. Delhi needs to restart economic activities in a phased manner so that the traders who have been seriously affected due to the lockdown are allowed to open their shops and establishments,” said Sanjay Bhargav, head of the traders’ body. Traders have suggested two options for the market’s reopening. “Shops can open between 11 am and 7 pm on main roads or streets, which have 10 metres or above ROW (right of way), while keeping Sunday as mandatory off across Delhi. The administration can allow shops in lanes and katras with less than 10-metre width to open on odd-even basis on all days between 9 am and 5 pm, keeping Sunday as mandatory weekly off,” said Bhargav. As per experts’ opinion, aerosol particles can remain suspended up to 10 metres, which can have serious implications in closed and congested areas, the letter states. Under the second option, the letter suggests that all shops may be allowed to open for three continuous days in a week with conditions of strict compliance to Covid norms. “If any person gets infected with the virus in those three days, they can be asked to isolate themselves at home and given appropriate medical treatment,” Bhargav explained. For the past few days, many traders have been demanding phased reopening of markets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-seek-phased-reopening-of-chandni-chowk-market/articleshow/83186489.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Those arrested included two white-collar professionals — a stock trader and a woman fashion designer.

The investigation has been handed over to Amroli police station. Police investigation so far revealed that Kheni, son of a diamond artisan, is a BBA degree holder. He also underwent a diamond processing course in Mumbai. Unable to sustain in the diamond industry, Kheni started stock trading. Later, he developed a friendship with Chodvadiya through social media. Chodvadiya was working as fashion designer till the start of 2020 but the global pandemic left her jobless. Chodvadiya had divorced her husband seven years ago. “Kheni went to Kasol for a college tour during which he tried charas for the first time. He brought some quantity back home and sold it. He might have done this in the past too,” said a police officer in SOG. “It is a major catch by police and Surat police is continuing its drive against drugs. Police will ensure that the city remains drugs free,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/three-caught-with-charas-worth-rs-24-lakh/articleshow/83184323.cms||---

The virtual meeting will be held at 3:30 pm on Friday. The high court last Friday cancelled a government order issued in 2015, under which 80% of scholarships for the minority went to the Muslim community, while the rest 20% went to the Christian community, including Latin Catholics and converted Christians. The high court bench consisting of chief justice S Manikumar and justice Shaji P Chaly, while quashing the government order, had directed the state government to provide merit-cum-means scholarships to the members of the notified minority communities equally. As part of the scheme, the state government had provided 5,000 scholarships for degree and post-graduate Muslim women students. In 2011, the benefit of the scheme was extended to students belonging to Latin Catholic and converted Christian communities. The government order in 2015, then said that the reservation among Muslim and Christian students would be in the ratio 80:20. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/minority-scholarship-all-party-meet-soon/articleshow/83186488.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The decision was made at a meeting held on Wednesday night with a few representatives meeting at a guest house in Kochi and others joining through video conferencing. “There was a suggestion to observe a day’s fasting as a mode of protest but we did not take a decision on it. For the time being, we have decided to approach the Union government and to explore all legal options. We would decide on further actions based on the government’s response. We have been getting positive feedback on that front,” said UCK Thangal, convenor of the forum. The draft laws in question that are set to be implemented in the islands include Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, which envisages a ban on sale of beef, Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, which makes any person with more than two children ineligible to contest panchayat polls, Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation, which provides arbitrary powers to the administrator of the island and Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation, which gives sweeping powers to the administration over the land in the islands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/exploring-all-legal-options-protesters/articleshow/83186537.cms||---

Schools have started work on the results for the secondary school certificate (SSC) students. The state board is making the process simpler by creating videos and forms. The decision to cancel Class X examination was announced by the school education minister Varsha Gaikwad this past week. It was then decided to assess students based on their marks scored in Class IX and assessments held during the entire year in Class X. Though Gaikwad said the records of all Class IX students and their marks were with the government through the SARAL software system, at least 80,000 were unavailable. Only 50% marks of the total scored in each subject would be taken for assessment for SSC, she said. For the remaining 50 marks, schools must consider the marks of the written examination for 80 marks and convert these marks to 30, she said. In order to explain the marking system to the school principals, the state board has engaged all their experts in preparing the videos, forms and other material through which the marks calculation would be easy, transparent and smooth, chairman of state board Dinkar Patil said. “We will release the details on Thursday for schools to start compiling the marks and enter them into the system. Since it will be a manual job, the school management will require at least a few days to complete the data management,” he said. Avni Patni, a Class X state board student, said, “This year, our results will be a big suspense. Without giving exams, we are going to get marks in a combination from two years. This has probably never happened before. The basis for calculating marks is different and it will depend on how each school mark their students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-board-to-release-schedule-process-for-ssc-marks-today/articleshow/83184705.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Covid-19 positive woman infects daughter-in-law by embracing her forcibly||HYDERABAD: In an incident played straight out of a ‘saas bahu’ soap opera, a Covid-19 positive woman in c, furious with her daughter-in-law for maintaining a distance, forcibly held and hugged her, resulting in the daughter-in-law testing positive just as the elder woman allegedly wanted it to happen. After the daughter-in-law, who is in her mid-20s, became infected, she was reportedly thrown out of the house in Somaripeta village. On learning this, her sister brought her to their parents’ house in Thimmapur village in Rajanna Sircilla district on May 29. The upset woman complained to revenue department officials, who visited her on May 31 in a video interview. “My mother-in-law hugged me saying that I should also get infected with Covid-19,” the woman told health officials who visited her on May 31 in a video interview. “She was upset that I was maintaining a distance from her after she had tested positive,” she told them. As the younger woman did not allow her two children to go anywhere near her mother-in-law and she was also asked to take her food from a designated place, the older woman felt discriminated against and was upset. “Do all of you want to live happily when I die?” she reportedly said and started hugging her daughter-in-law suddenly, with what officials say was the obvious intention that the daughter-in-law too should be affected by Covid-19. Now affected, the daughter-in-law is under treatment in home isolation at her sister’s house. The woman’s husband works as a tractor driver in Odisha where he had gone to work some seven months ago. The woman, got married three years ago and was staying at her in-law’s place at for the last three years. According to sources close to the woman’s family, the woman’s mother-in-law tested positive for Covid-19. The mother-in-law noticed the sudden change in behaviour of the daughter-in-law who was maintaining a distance, providing food from a distance and not allowing her two children to go near her. This reportedly hurt her ego, officials said. Two revenue department officials who visited the house of the aggrieved daughter-in-law and provided her the medication required for her Covid-19 treatment said they are ready to take her complaint. “We told her that if she intended to pursue a case against her mother-in-law, she would be guided on what steps to take,” said one of the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/peeved-mom-in-law-infects-bahu-in-covid-embrace/articleshow/83186558.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

During the hearing of a PIL on fire safety that was filed after the Shrey Hospital fire tragedy, the bench of Justice Bela Trivedi and Justice Bhargav Karia on Tuesday asked the state government about progress in implementing the newly adopted act. In response, the advocate general said that framing of the rules is “on the verge of completion so far as to implement the same”. The HC has recorded the AG’s submission in its order that was released on Wednesday. After the issue of fire safety at Covid-19 hospitals came to the high court, the state government stressed on adopting the Clinical Establishments Act. On February 26, a division bench insisted that the state government adopt the central law. The state assembly passed a bill in this regard five days later. In February, the HC even expressed apprehensions that private healthcare providers may create hindrances for the government in implementing the law. The court had said, “The pressure from private healthcare providers who deliver the bulk of healthcare may create hindrances in the way of the state government in the implementation of the Act 2010.” The court also advised the government to overcome the hindrance that it apprehended would be created by private players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/finalizing-rules-for-clinical-establishment-act-soon-govt/articleshow/83186542.cms||---

Providing figures, Patel said that since its inception in 2007, the 108-service has ferried 1.22 crore patients to hospitals. “During the pandemic, over 2.15 lakh Covid-19 patients were shifted to hospitals in 108 ambulances. When the second wave was at its peak, many Covid-19 patients were treated and given oxygen in 108 ambulances itself as they waited for their turn to get oxygen beds in hospitals,” he said. ‘CM will decide on when to relieve Jayanti Ravi’DyCM Nitin Patel was, on Wednesday, asked when principal secretary (health) Jayanti Ravi — who has been transferred to Auroville — will be relieved of her charge.

Nearly a dozen cases have been treated by city physicians and surgeons. Sunil Gavali, 58, is one recent case treated at Andheri’s Holy Family Hospital. He came to the emergency ward with severe abdominal pain and had been vaccinated with both doses of Covishield. Scan showed multiple clots in the main artery to the intestine. Vascular surgeon Dr Aniruddha Bhuiyan said clot had led to intestinal gangrene, which could turn fatal. The surgeon dissolved the clot, avoiding a surgery. “It was my tenth case in the past 8-9 months where Covid and intestinal clot have presented together,” he said. “Stomach pain was their only complaint,” he said, adding Gavali later tested positive for Covid. Studies have shown around 16-30% of Covid-19 patients have gastrointestinal symptoms and have minimal to no signs of respiratory problems. Patients with intestinal clots can come with acute mesenteric ischemia, a rare abdominal emergency associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Dr Bhuiyan said if gangrene is not tackled in 24hours, chances of survival drop to 50%. Gastrointestinal surgeon Dr Hemant Patil has diagnosed five cases of intestinal gangrene, of which one succumbed to Covid complications. “They all came with acute abdominal pain and were later detected with Covid,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-clots-now-causing-intestinal-gangrene/articleshow/83192063.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Thousands of informal sector workers are finding it difficult to survive due to lack of ability to self-finance and access medical care in the current Covid-19 outbreak, and the UFERWAS has come forward to provide help and services to this vulnerable section. “As they do not have the money to feed themselves due to no work, we are trying to ease the distress of such marginalised individuals during this lockdown and pandemic. We have decided to distribute dry groceries kits, which is sufficient for a month by raising funds within RWA community,” according to a UFERWAS member.

Though the state government extended night curfew for another week, it has allowed restaurateurs to continue with takeaways till 10pm while traders have been allowed to keep shops open from 9am to 6pm. The move, according to industry players, will bring in much needed relief to industry players. “The relaxation in timings will certainly help traders as customer footfalls will increase. We only hope that the decision is properly executed and there is no harassment from police and civic authorities force-shutting shops,” said Jayendra Tanna, president, Gujarat Traders’ Federation (GTF). Industrialist Naresh Sharma said, “Allowing shops and establishments to continue operations till 6pm will help improve demand and aid in faster revival of trade and business. While order negotiations have moved online to a great extent, easing of curbs will make doing business much easier.” Meanwhile, restaurateurs too feel the decision will help revive their business. “This will go a long way in boosting order volumes for takeaways as we will now get a lot of dinner orders due to extension of timings. People can get home from work and place their orders, which was not the case earlier,” said the owner of a cloud kitchen. However, restaurateurs are still irked with dine-in not being allowed. “Dine-ins continue to be a major source of business and continuation of curbs is a clear loss for the industry. If people can go to roadside stalls and eat, then why the restrictions on restaurants? There must be some relaxation in this regard,” said Dilip Thakkar, partner at a city-based restaurant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/relief-for-traders-restaurateurs/articleshow/83186623.cms||---

The HC had shifted to virtual mode of hearing since lockdown last year, and decreased the number of benches with the rise in Covid cases in the city. In the first week of April, it suspended its regular sitting by roster and limited the number of benches to five or six. It decided to hear only urgent matters. Two weeks ago, when Covid cases began declining and the state government permitted commercial activities for six hours, the Gujarat High Court Advocates Association requested the chief justice to end its summer vacation and start regular functioning of the court through video conference from May 24. The vacation is ending this week. The HC administration has declared that its standing committee and chief justice have decided that HC will start functioning regularly through video conferencing from June 7, the first day after summer vacation. At present, there are only two single-judge benches available for hearing extremely urgent matters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/regular-hc-hearing-to-start-virtually/articleshow/83186638.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand govt’s decision to cancel UBSE Class 12 boards ‘well received’||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government's decision to cancel the Uttarakhand Board of School Education (UBSE) Class 12 examinations has been received well by several stakeholders, including parents. and students. “The government has taken a good decision by cancelling the exams because holding them would have been like putting the lives of the children in danger as the Covid-19 crisis hasn’t been under control yet,” said Arif Khan, president of the National Association for Parents and Students’ Rights. “Also, a large section of the students were not able to access the facility of online education and asking them to write the exams would have been a complete injustice,” Khan added. Many students told TOI on Wednesday that apart from the Covid-19 situation in the country, there was hardly any momentum for exam preparations this time since “all of us were unsure whether it would be held or not”. However, some students showed their concerns over what type of evaluation formula will be opted by the state and the boards. A lot of students look forward to scoring heavily in their board exams in order to get admission in a college of their choice for their undergraduation. “I am hearing that the CBSE and other boards are going to give us marks based on our performance in classes 9, 10, 11 and half-yearly exams of Class 12. I have reservations about this decision since most of my colleagues didn’t have a great result in classes 9 and 10. Also, there is a huge difference between the final marks which we get in Class 11 and the one which we get in Class 12 boards," said Zaina Aman, a Class 12 student of a Dehradun based school. "A lot of students look forward to hitting a home run in the Class 12 boards which ultimately decides our admission in our respective dream college. Though, it is likely that the government will give us a chance to reappear for the exam if we are not satisfied with the end result, but everyone usually struggles to prepare for the same exams again,” added Aman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-govts-decision-to-cancel-ubse-class-12-boards-well-received/articleshow/83184837.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Kochi||Monsoon onset over state by today, says IMD||Kochi: The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday said conditions are favourable for the onset of monsoon over the state in the next 24 hours. “Rainfall distribution has been widespread and has increased over Kerala. Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels over the south Arabian Sea and deepened,” it said. As per satellite imagery, there is an increase in cloudiness over Kerala coast and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea. The above conditions are likely to favour further enhancement in rainfall activity over the state, IMD said in its bulletin. Under the influence of a trough at mean sea level off Karnataka-Kerala coasts and strengthening of westerly wind in lower tropospheric levels, scattered to widespread rainfall accompanied with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds and isolated heavy rainfall are very likely over parts of south Peninsular India till June 4. As a result, isolated heavy rainfall of 7-11cm has been predicted in Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki while the rest of the state will receive light rainfall. A thunderstorm warning has also been issued for the state for Thursday and a heavy rainfall warning for June 4. Seas could be rough with strong wind (speed reaching 40-50kmph) is likely over southwest Arabian Sea. Fishermen are advised not to venture into these areas. Meanwhile, Kudlu recorded the highest 24-hour rainfall of 5cm while Haripad Mancompu, Perumbavur, Hosdurg and Cheruthazham recorded 2cm rainfall each. This year, the state received its highest pre-monsoon rainfall (March-May) in the past 50 years (75 cm). The previous highs were in 1999, 2004 and 2006. According to IMD data, this year’s pre-monsoon rainfall is the fourth highest ever rainfall in the last 100 years (1922-2021).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/monsoon-onset-over-state-by-today-says-imd/articleshow/83186646.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Hyderabad||Patient load basis for mucor drug supply: Centre||Hyderabad: Stating that the prevailing active patient load in each state is the basis for supply of medicines for treating black fungus cases, the Centre on Wednesday informed the Telangana high court that it had allocated 11,320 vials of amphotericin B to Telangana up to May 31. “We informed the manufacturing companies on the allocations. As and when a request from a state comes, the medicines will be supplied by these companies,” T Surya Karan Reddy, additional solicitor general, told a bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy. The bench was seeking an answer from the Centre on the alleged short supply of black fungus vials. Mylan, Bharat Serum, Sun Pharma, BDR and Cipla are manufacturing the black fungus medicine. Telangana ran short of these medicines on account of inability of some of the firms to supply and also on account of not receiving the procurement order from the state in some cases, director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said and informed the bench that they received the details of allocation very late.  The state was able to procure medicines on its own in addition to the central allocations, he said. The state cabinet has resolved to equip the health sector with better infrastructure to face the third wave, the health director said. “We hope there would be no such wave. Yet, we have decided to strengthen the health infrastructure in the state. Every hospital bed in the state-run hospitals would henceforth be converted into an oxygen bed,” he said. The bench asked him to file an affidavit on the resolutions taken by the council of ministers in this regard. The bench wanted him to explain why the government had failed to constitute an experts committee under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act. “Your chief secretary is an important authority under this Act. If he still dodges the issue, then we will proceed to form the committee. We are waiting for you to act because it is in the executive domain. Don’t make us cross that line,” the bench warned. Referring to the vaccination drive, the director of public health said the state had received a positive response for its global tenders. “Our global tender has received a good response from AstraZeneca and Sputnik companies. On June 4, we are going to complete the tender process,” he said. The bench asked the health director to specify the court about the tender in the next affidavit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/patient-load-basis-for-mucor-drug-supply-centre/articleshow/83186633.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Attrition rises, IT firms go extra mile to retain talent||AHMEDABAD: Battling a high attrition rate, IT companies in the city are going the extra mile to retain their workforce. Apart from higher annual increments, companies are also doling out other financial incentives such as ex-gratia bonuses or salary adjustments to ensure that their employees stay with them. “Salary corrections are being done to match industry standards as much as possible. This is besides annual increments which have already been given,” said Tejinder Oberoi, executive director of Ahmedabad-based Cygnet Infotech. “We are also offering financial support to staff and members of their family for Covid-related expenses,” he added. Another IT firm from the city, Tatvic Analytics, has a taken a similar initiative by giving higher increments. “Average increments to our employees for fiscal 2020-21 was double than that of 2019-20. In some cases, it has gone as high as 100% or more. Additionally, we have extended profit-linked incentive to employees, which motivates them to work well and drive the company’s growth,” said Ravi Pathak, CEO of the company. To retain talent, different types of financial incentives are offered in the IT space. “Our employees will be given ex-gratia payment linked to performance as an additional incentive. We are also helping them take certain training courses to upgrade their skills and will reimburse the fees. This way professionals can strengthen their skill sets and this will accelerate their growth in the company while the company benefits too,” said Maulik Bhansali, CEO, NetWeb. Manpower requirement in the IT sector has gone up significantly since the pandemic with increased adoption of digitisation across various sectors. With more demand and remote-working roles, IT professionals have multiple opportunities at hand. “Hence, the offer decline ratio has risen as high as 20% for IT companies. This has compelled IT companies to offer hefty perks and incentives over and above increments to keep their workforce,” said Samir Parikh, founder, NamanHR, a recruitment consultancy firm. “We have increased sum insured for our employees to take care of healthcare expenditure. Moreover, we have also announced profit-linked incentives for each of our teams,” said Jaimin Shah, MD and CEO, Dev IT. “In many cases, salaries are restructured and increased just before appraisal cycle. So, this will be as good as two increments given to employees in addition to perks, which include work from home expenses such as laptop, workstation, internet and inverter costs,” said industry source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/attrition-rises-it-firms-go-extra-mile-to-retain-talent/articleshow/83186954.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: R A Rajeev bows out as MMRDA chief after extension is denied||MUMBAI: Retired bureauc-rat R A Rajeev, who was in the running for a second extension as MMRDA commissioner, had to make way for a successor in the face of growing opposition within the bureaucracy to officials holding onto key posts after superannuation. Rajeev had a three-month contract to continue at the helm of the planning ag-ency after he retired on February 28. Additional metropolitan commissioner Sonia Sethi will take over for now. Matters had come to a head on this issue in May after retired irrigation secretary V K Gautam was appointed as officer on special duty in the same department a week after receiving notice of an inquiry against him. As reported by TOI, the appointment went ahead despite objections raised by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte and the general administration department . Rajeev’s extension was the first under consideration after the controversy.  Sources say senior bureaucrats and a senior cabinet minister opposed Rajeev’s extension. The MMRDA chief’s position can only be filled by an official from the IAS cadre according to IAS Cadre Rules, 1954. To allow a retired officer to continue in the post, the state would have had to seek approval from the Centre or convert the post of MMRDA commissioner into a non-cadre post.  During his tenure, Rajeev paved the way for the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to shift the Metro 3 car shed from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg. This had been a flashpoint between the BJP and Shiv Sena in the previous regime. Rajeev had played a key role in enabling the shift to Kanjurmarg by merging the Metro 3 car shed with the one for Metro 6.  Senior officers have complained to the political leadership about the growing practice of retaining retired bureaucrats on contract though they are no longer accountable. Serving officers are governed by the rules which include declaring assets, foreign travel and hospitality received. They are also accountable for financial and executive decisions unlike retired officers who don’t sign on the files. Many within the bureaucracy also feel that pliable officers who are willing to push decisions that please the political dispensation are favo-ured for post-retirement contracts. Such contracts seal off senior positions for serving bureaucrats and reduce their opportunities for growth.  After retiring as chief secretary, Ajoy Mehta was hired for a stint as principal advisor to the CMO. Radheshyam Mopalwar heads the MSRDC which oversees major road projects in the state despite retiring in 2018. Defending the appointment, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had pointed out that the MSRDC chief’s post was not a cadre post. “MSRDC is a company and right from the beginning, it has a provision to appoint a serving or retired officer as MD.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rajeev-bows-out-as-mmrda-chief-after-extension-is-denied/articleshow/83188465.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Delhi||Pride month is here. But this year’s parade has to go virtual||NEW DELHI: For many members of the LGBTQI community, stepping out of the house is the only way to be themselves, explained Anmol, their homes not being the friendliest of spaces for the visibly queer. Being locked in due to Covid-19 with people who do not accept them has left them stressed and angst-ridden. Pride Month may have come at just the right time for the community, giving members the opportunity to celebrate their identity and join in discussions with like-minded people. A community individual revealed how they sought friendship among more accepting people, who may not necessarily share the same sexual orientation. But ensconced in the house, all they could do was go online, though that space too wasn’t free from biases or abuses. A counsellor who works with the community said that no one has ever given a thought to assisting LGBTQI people cope with the lockdown. “Due to all sorts of pressures, they will never state their trauma openly on a social platform,” the counsellor said. Rafiul Alom Rahman, founder and executive director, The Queer Muslim Project, revealed having a partner in social media platform Instagram for the Digital Pride Festival, which will see talks, workshops, artist collaborations and discussions online. The aim of the festival, Rahman explained, is to provide engaging and meaningful conversations that don’t add to people’s anxiety. While it has been a tough time, many community conversations have moved online and he is also taking the opportunity to adopt new forms of expression to showcase queer art and highlight how queer people have been creating and collaborating. From sticker packs and rainbow hashtags to highlighting LGBTQI expressions across timeline feeds and stories, Tara Bedi, public policy and community outreach manager, Instagram India, pointed out how the community uses online space for connection, support and community action. Amplifying the voices of immensely talented creators and activists, she assured, was part of Instagram’s journey to make the medium more inclusive. Rahman’s own personal project is called ‘Countering queerphobia and Muslim hate, one story at a time’. He said it started with personal posts but they soon assumed an identity of their own. Most of the posts are about Muslim LGBTQI members telling their stories. He said it is a fight to counter Islamophobia and homophobia simultaneously. While it hasn’t been easy going for them, Rahman disclosed that many among his 27,000 followers have congratulated him and said his efforts have ensured they don’t feel they are alone. As the Pride Month celebrations shift online, dating app OKCupid actively encourages community members to express themselves across 13 sexual orientations and 22 gender identities. Coworking space company WeWork India also hosted an online pride parade and an online art exhibition showcasing the work of members of the community. There are a series of sensitisation workshops, online fundraisers ad virtual shows planned throughout June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pride-month-is-here-but-this-years-parade-has-to-go-virtual/articleshow/83186748.cms||Amin Ali
---||Nagpur||Act tough against companies unwilling to share CSR funds for Covid: Bombay HC||NAGPUR: Upset over the failure of industries from Vidarbha to share their CSR funds for Covid-19 management, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday orally directed the Maharashtra government to wield the stick of law to act against them by cancelling their registrations. The rebuke came after amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, while quoting affidavits filed by the divisional commissioner, pointed out that many companies in the region have refused to part with their CSR funds and are not cooperating. Flaying the commissioner, the judges orally asked him why he needs HC’s directives every time when there is a provision in the Companies Act, 2013, to punish such erring manufacturers if they violate the rules. “We must point out that there are specific provisions in the Act to deal with unwilling, defaulting and non-responsive companies under sections 136, 450, 454 and others. Both divisional commissioners and collectors of all Vidarbha districts should do a thorough study of these provisions and apply them against such erring companies. If any directives are required, a correct and detailed factual position should be placed before the HC so that we could take a decision in the next hearing,” they said. While hearing the suo motu PIL where Bhandarkar was pleading as amicus curiae along with Nidhi Dayani, the justices noted that the commissioner’s affidavit were filed about two weeks ago and they weren’t aware of the present position till date. “It’s not known as to how many among willing companies have actually sent their contributions.” Earlier, government pleader Ketki Joshi informed that the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had consented to donate CSR funds of Rs3 crore through its Mouda plant for Covid-19 management. The bench directed it to deposit the cheque with the collector before June 9, fixed as the next hearing date. The judges further asked MSETCL’s CSR committee to take a decision on releasing its funds within a week. The move came after MSETCL counsel DM Kale informed that their CSR panel would soon take a decision after its meeting. He added that a policy decision was already taken in this regard and, therefore, not much time would be required. “This submission, however, does not give any date within which the CSR Committee would be taking its decision. Considering its submissions which are quite vague at present and also considering the situation of emergency, we direct the MSETCL to inform about its decision within a week,” the judges said. ‘Expand scope of task force to all fungal infections immediately’ The HC further directed the divisional commissioner to expand the scope of a task force to all fungal infections with immediate effect. Currently, it is confined to only deal with mucormycosis cases. “We also direct him, collector and NMC commissioner to extend all the help to make available the requisite manpower and paraphernalia for increasing check-ups and survey of all city hospitals. It would help find out any deficiency, lacunae, and other incidental factors which contribute to spread of fungal infections. The task force, upon completing such surveys and check-ups, shall report within two weeks.” IMA, VHA & govt to create awareness on hygiene The HC has appealed to Indian Medical Association (IMA), Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) and the Maharashtra government to devise a procedure for improving the state of cleanliness and hygiene in hospitals and create awareness among the patients, doctors, nursing staff and other persons concerned. “There’s a need to establish effective and regular machinery for keeping check on all the hospitals — government or private — regarding the conditions of cleanliness and hygiene.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/act-tough-against-companies-unwilling-to-share-csr-funds-for-covid-hc/articleshow/83184846.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Prizes will be given to three villages who are found doing novel work in Covid-19 management from each of the six revenue divisions. In all there will be 18 villages and a total of Rs 5.4 crore has been budgeted for the initiative. The first prize will be Rs 50 lakh, second Rs 25 lakh and third Rs 15 lakh, said rural development minister Hasan Mushrif. Villages will be graded on 22 criteria and a total of 50 marks will be given to the village based on its performance. Winner will also get an additional amount equivalent to the prize money as encouragement, and it will be utilised for development works in those villages, said Mushrif.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-5-4-crore-budget-for-corona-free-village-contest/articleshow/83186758.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Most CBSE, ISC schools in Kolkata vote to count XI, XII marks||KOLKATA: Principals and teachers of city schools affiliated to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) expressed relief at the cancellation of the ISC and CBSE Class XII examinations but were unsure of the formula that would be adopted by the two boards for finalising the marksheets. They are, however, sure that the marks that the students have scored in school would play a decisive role in Class XII results. Schools had managed to finish all laboratory-based practical exams and projects and these marks have already been submitted to the respective boards, making up for the very critical 20%-30% externally assessed marks. However, there were concerns over whether the pre-board marks scored in offline exams would be evaluated differently from those that had been conducted online. Those who appeared in the latter have scored higher. “There are two probable methods of evaluating ISC candidates. First, the Council may consider the score card of students from the ICSE in 2019 and give considerable weightage and weave it together with the internal assessment score cards of both Classes XI and XII. The second could be, taking into account only the online or offline assessment marks of Class XI and XII along with the practical examination scores,” said a school principal. CISCE has already asked schools to send scores of each child through class XI and XII. The CBSE is yet to seek such marks but from what has been done with the class X board year assessment, schools say, it is clear that the scores of both class XI and XII will be sought. Some CBSE schools have decided to hold one last exam and these marks will also be sent to the board. In Birla High School, this exam is already on. “It started on May 24 because we wanted the kids to be in touch with their books. Let this be the last exam of their school lives” said principal Loveleen Saigal. Asian International School will start the exam when the school reopens after June 7, said principal Vijaylakshmi Kumar. South Point principal Rupa Sanyal Bhattacharjee said, “All Class XII candidates have been externally evaluated either on 30 marks or 20 marks. The evaluation was conducted by holding practical tests, assessing project work or viva-voce.” “The Council is looking at marks that not only reflect online but also the offline scores of Class XI,” said Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of La Martiniere for Girls. Seema Sapru, principal of Heritage School said this is the best that the Council could have done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-cbse-isc-schools-vote-to-count-xi-xii-marks/articleshow/83184884.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Dehradun||Now, Ramdev targets ‘pharma mafia’, ‘corrupt politicians’, religious leaders who ‘provoke followers to fight’ & docs who ‘force patients into expensive procedures’||HARIDWAR: Over a week after his comments on allopathic doctors, yoga guru Ramdev continued his tirade against what he termed ‘objectionable practices’ by different sections of society. During a yoga session at his Yog Gram centre in Haridwar on Wednesday, Ramdev targeted political leaders over their ‘corruption’and religious leaders over their ‘bad practices.’ He also took a swipe at “allopathic doctors who create panic and fear among patients in order to get them to undertake expensive procedures like surgeries which are not needed.” “Political leaders say that they are doing development but they do not disclose about the corruption they have done. Similarly, many seers say that they are preaching good things but don’t disclose how they have also provoked their followers to fight,” Ramdev said. He added that “politicians claim they are constructing roads, airport, colleges and universities for people but what is happening on the inside?” “A PM of our country had once said that of the Rs 100 the government gives, only Rs 20 reaches the beneficiary. Similarly, seers say they are taking people on the path of God but behind the curtain, what is happening? A lot of corruption and immorality is happening and people are being pitted against each other and provoked to fight in the name of religion,” he said, adding that it is a similar situation in the corporate world. “The corporate mafia says that it is doing service by supplying goods that are needed by people. But what kind of service is this if a thing worth Rs 2 is being sold for Rs 2,000 or even Rs 10 lakh?” Earlier, on Monday, Ramdev had said that Patanjali Yogpeeth will start an allopathic college and train MBBS doctors. Later, he alleged that he has no ill-will towards allopathy or allopathic practitioners and that his actual battle is against “the pharmaceutical mafia who are selling medicines at exaggerated costs in order to earn maximum profit.” During interactions with persons who were attending his yoga camp on Wednesday, Ramdev again reiterated, “I am not against allopathy but there should be an ‘integrated pathy’ for treatment. Allopathy is good during life-saving emergencies and surgery but allopathic doctors often create unnecessary panic and fear among the patients. This should be avoided.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-ramdev-targets-pharma-mafia-corrupt-politicians-religious-leaders-who-provoke-followers-to-fight-docs-who-force-patients-into-expensive-procedures/articleshow/83184907.cms||MS Nawaz

The move comes a few days after six Van Rawat members were found to be Covid-19 positive during a vaccination session held for the members of the tribe. Dr Girish Singh from Dharchula told TOI, "At Kimkhola, six Van Rawat members had tested positive for Covid-19. They have been put under home isolation.” Earlier, the district administration had sent medical teams to inoculate members of the Van Rawat tribe, based in three development blocks of Pithoragarh, against Covid-19. The teams have so far administered the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine to 83 Van Rawat members. The drive faced some resistance at Madanpuri and Kutichaurani localities. Meanwhile, a social organisation has initiated a Covid awareness drive in the localities of Van Rawat community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-affects-van-rawat-tribe-now/articleshow/83184891.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Nagpur||Citing MP example, stakeholders push to restart tourism in Tadoba||NAGPUR: Taking a cue from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which has restarted wildlife tourism from June 1, a demand has been raised to do the same in Maharashtra by tourists, guides, gypsy drivers associations, and resort owners. Due to lockdown, parks in Maharashtra are closed since April 15. Certain relaxations have been granted from June 1 but not for wildlife tourism. Maharashtra officials have taken a stand that the opening of parks will also need a nod from MoEFCC, which had asked to close the parks on April 30, after eight lions in Hyderabad zoo tested positive for coronavirus. However, Maharashtra State Guides Union president Anil Tiwade said, “How can two different sets of rules be applicable for opening parks in Maharashtra and MP? MoEFCC has not issued any fresh direction to open the parks, still MP started tourism. The state order doesn’t make specific mention about closing tourism. Ranthambore is also opening from June 8.” “Guides have been unemployed for two months. During the first Covid wave, we were supplied at least food kits but in the second, no help has reached. We want Tadoba to be partially kept open during the monsoon to compensate for the loss. Buffer already remains open. Resorts are cutting staff and this will again increase the dependence of people on forest,” said Tiwade. Sanjay Mankar, president of Tadoba Gypsy Ecotourism Welfare Society, said, “We have submitted a memorandum to the TATR field director to restart tourism. Chandrapur is already in the green zone and on Tuesday there were only 119 Covid-19 positive cases. Officials should take a call.” Deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale said, “We have no problem in opening the park provided district collector, who is disaster management authority (DMA) chief, comes out with a circular in this regard. TATR earns at least Rs 15 crore from tourism receipts, of which 70% is spent on community development in villages.” Resort owner Nikhil Abhyankar said, “There is no scientific evidence to believe Covid-19 will be spread from humans to animals because of tourism. If this is true then tendu collection should be stopped immediately as there are more chances of the people-wildlife interface. Over 21 people have died in carnivore attacks in the Tadoba landscape. If the victim is positive then chances of animals contracting the virus are more.” Chandrapur district collector Ajay Gulhane said, “I’ve not yet decided about opening tourism.” In a memorandum to PCCF (wildlife) NH Kakodkar, 23 resort and lodge owners have demanded to restarting tourism and also not to close tourism during monsoon. “We would not be able to support the local community if tourism remains closed for a long period,” they said. MP wants RTPCR report from tourists A day after opening the parks on June 1, tourism in Pench, Madhya Pradesh, has been hit as tourists visiting the park are being asked to produce Covid-19 negative RTPCR report issued 48 hours before. “On day one, we allowed tourist as there was no clarity but on Wednesday several tourists were asked to return from Khawasa border,” said Kurai TI Manoj Gupta. Pench LAC member Sandeep Singh said, “Over 90% of the tourists visiting Pench are from Nagpur. Now most of them who were keen on visiting the park have canceled bookings. The number of vehicles entering the park has also come down below 50%,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citing-mp-example-stakeholders-push-to-restart-tourism-in-tadoba/articleshow/83184894.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Vijayawada||Civic body to spend Rs 8 crore on solving water woes in hilly terrain||VIJAYAWADA: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) is set to resolve drinking water problems at hilly terrains in the city. The civic body has sanctioned funds for repair works of old and damaged pipelines to streamline water supply. Around 25 per cent of the city’s population lives in hilly terrains. Thousands of families reside on Gunadala Hill from Chuttugunta to Moghalrajapuram. VMC supplies purified drinking water to households on hilly terrains. But water supply has become irregular in recent times due to lack of maintenance and poor pumping mechanisms. As promised before municipal elections, the YSRC- led municipal council has its focus on water supply at hilly terrains. Deputy mayor Bellam Durga and YSRC Vijayawada East constituency in-charge Devineni Avinash held a review meeting with the engineering wing and prepared estimates for restoration of water supply. Deputy mayor Bellam Durga informed officials that locals are complaining about irregular water supply and pipeline leaks. She also raised questions about the poor water supply to the tail end of hilly terrains. Officials said new reservoirs and pumping stations are required to boost the supply of water. The officials have proposed to take up construction and restoration of water line works with Rs 8 crore. “People in hilly terrains are requesting us to solve water problems. The government is ready to release necessary funds,” said Bellam Durga.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/civic-body-to-spend-rs-8cr-on-solving-water-woes-in-hilly-terrain/articleshow/83153896.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Kolkata||Panel to look into feasibility of conducting Madhyamik, Higher Secondary examinations in West Bengal||KOLKATA: The state government on Wednesday formed a six-member expert committee to look into the feasibility of holding Madhyamik and Higher Secondary examinations in the state, considering safety issues in the current Covid situation and the fallout of not holding exams when students have not been appraised in the past year. The committee comprising three educationists, two doctors and a child rights advocate will have to submit the recommendations by Friday for the state education department to then take a call on the issue. Students associated with various state boards have moved the apex court against holding of offline exams and all eyes are now trained on the hearing. CBSE and CISCE have already cancelled both Class X and Class XII board exams citing safety issues. For Class XII students, both the boards have kept a window of written tests open at a later date for those not satisfied with the marks given after evaluating class, mid-term and pre-board exams. While the two boards headquartered in Delhi have affiliated schools in towns and cities where access to technology and resources have enabled them to hold online classes as well as online tests in 2020 as well as 2021, several schools affiliated to the Madhyamik Board and HS Council have been unable to do so due to the digital divide. A substantial section of the 12 lakh plus students appearing for Madhyamik and 8.5 lakh plus appearing for HS are from rural areas where access to Internet connectivity and digital devices are an issue. According to sources, the committee will consider if the exams can be held under the current circumstances; and if so, the mechanism of conducting them without exposing students to the infection. It will also deliberate upon the problems of not holding the exams and the issue of evaluating the students in the absence of class tests, particularly those in Class XII. On Wednesday morning, press conferences scheduled to announce the dates of Madhyamik and HS exams were cancelled. The CM had recently announced that the HS would be held in the last week of July and Madhyamik in the second week of August. She had also said that the tenure of both the exams would be one-and-a-half hours instead of three hours. Also, exams would only be held for the 15 compulsory subjects in the three streams and not the 37 additional subjects. West Bengal Government Teachers’ Association general secretary Saugata Basu said the absence of internal assessment except for 10 marks in each subject for Madhyamik candidates and practicals for HS candidates will be a challenge in drawing up marksheets. “This is probably why the Board and the Council was keen to arrange for the written examination in a different pattern,” he reasoned, adding that the result of the HS examination needed to be brought out in time so that HS students could keep pace with the all-India boards since many opt for studying in prestigious institutions outside the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panel-to-look-into-feasibility-of-conducting-madhyamik-hs/articleshow/83184905.cms||Somdatta Basu

The government has also started steps for constructing a commercial complex in the 4.77 acres where bus station and garage is located now. TOI had carried a series of articles depicting the plight of the bus station and calling the attention of various authorities to the issue. Replying to the submission raised by T J Vinod, MLA, in the assembly on Wednesday, transport minister Antony Raju said that the government is planning to implement these projects as a joint venture with other agencies and with the financial support from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The land where the bus terminal and garage are located now is a low-lying area which faces waterlogging. The Operation Breakthrough project being carried out by the district administration is expected to contain the waterlogging in the area. The minister also stressed importance of the proposed South-North corridor which is to run parallel to the railway line to South. “The corridor, which would lie beside the KSRTC bus station, will help increase the passenger flow. For making the South-North corridor, the coordinated effort on the part of railway, Kochi corporation and district administration is needed,” the minister said. The passengers and employees of the bus station are facing untold difficulties during rainy season. “Waterlogging is a regular feature in the bus station. It was in 1968 that the then chief minister E M S Namboodiripad and transport minister E K Imbichi Bava jointly inaugurated the bus station. The old dilapidated building still houses the bus station. The building may collapse anytime,” Vinod said. “Waterlogging was there in the bus station during the rains on May 15 as well. So, there should be urgent intervention by the government for finding a lasting solution to the issue. However, the minister has promised to construct a new bus station,” Vinod said. Around 25,000 to 30,000 passengers still depend on the bus station. “While 89 buses operate from the station, a total of 471 buses together conduct 940 trips every day. These facts underline the urgency of constructing a new bus terminal,” Vinod said. Though there were attempts to reconstruct the bus terminal more than twice, the efforts had to be abandoned due to various reasons. Hibi Eden, MP, had allotted Rs 2 crore from his funds when he was the MLA from Ernakulam constituency. But the project had to be scrapped due to the anomalies in the construction. Though there were demands for booking the officials responsible for the irregularities, government did nothing. In 2017 also, there was a plan to construct a new building to house the bus station. But that too didn’t work due to difficulties in carrying out the construction in the marshy land which was allotted for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ekm-ksrtc-bus-station-gets-a-ticket-to-recovery/articleshow/83184914.cms||---

The fatality rate of mucormycosis is five times that of Covid-19 in the state. While the Covid mortality rate is below 1%, the death rate for mucormycosis is 4.8%. The state is facing a shortage of liposomal amphotericin B, a drug of choice for treating mucormycosis, and many doctors are forced to use other antifungal drugs for treatment. The highest number of black fungus deaths have been reported from Jaipur. Thirty people lost their lives to mucormycosis in the city, while 12 died in Udaipur and 10 succumbed to the fungus in Jodhpur. Kota reported eight deaths, Bikaner six, while Ajmer, Chittorgarh and Sriganganagar reported two deaths each, and Jhalawar and Bhilwara one each. So far, 1,524 persons have been found to be infected by mucormycosis. Out of these, 988 have been diagnosed in Jaipur. “Diabetic people are vulnerable to mucormycosis. Majority of the patients were found infected with mucormycosis while being treated for Covid and as well as post-Covid complications. Among diabetic patients who take steroids the infection is high,” said a senior health department official. In the state, 32 hospitals have been allowed to provide treatment for mucormycosis patients. Such patients are coming to the hospitals with complaints like swelling on one-side of the face, headache, nasal or sinus congestion, fever and black lesions on nasal bridge or upper inside mouth that quickly become more severe. Doctors treating mucormycosis patients perform a surgery known as endoscopic surgical debridement to reduce the load of fungus on affected parts of the patients and follow it up by admninistering antifungal drugs. Earlier, SMS Medical College had warned against the abnormal use of steroids which would elevate sugar levels in patients and reduce immunity, resulting in mucormycosis infection. Steroids should not be given in the first week of Covid infection as it is the time when the virus replicates. Steroids can be given in the second week of infection, which is a period of inflammation, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/mucor-claims-74-in-raj-death-rate-5-times-as-high-as-covid/articleshow/83193487.cms||---

Those who have got into institutions abroad were especially elated. Siddhant Gupta and his classmates from St Xavier’s School, all residents of Fort Oasis, organized a bash in the evening. “It was convenient since we live in the same complex. We are out of school at last,” said the 18-year-old. Till Tuesday afternoon, Ahaan Kanaujia of DPS Ruby Park had thought his admission to the University of Illinois would be rescinded. “I was afraid of having to go to the exam centres unvaccinated. Now I am glad that I can be a part of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Class of 2025. The college needs the official Class XII transcripts by July 31. If the boards had been conducted, we would have had to reapply for admission after one or two semesters,” he said. Among those staying back in India is Asish Singh, who has earned a 100% scholarship in Ashoka University. The student of St Augustine’s Day School, Barrackpore, said, “I will need the mark sheet to secure the admission. Now I can get it on time.” Janet Gasper Chowdhury, president of St Augustine Education Society, which runs the school, said, “We have many such achievers from the suburbs. It would have been a shame if they were to suffer. The formula results should be out by July.” “My batch can now brag about getting into university without standardized testing or board exams,” said Anoushka Agarwalla of La Martiniere for Girls. Normally, a candidate needs a1,600 SAT score to make it into an Ivy League school. “I didn’t have to take the SAT because of the pandemic, but I am ready to attend Columbia University this Fall. My offer was unconditional, but I required my school-leaving certificate. The way things were developing, I thought I wouldn’t get it in time and had stopped studying since my pre-boards,” she said, adding, “I am happy that the council has decided to consider marks from both classes XI and XII to average the scores as it gives a more holistic and fair range.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-breathe-easy-celebrate-end-of-16-month-final-school-year/articleshow/83184916.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Foresters attend prank call, no clue of leopard yet||NAGPUR: With no clue of the leopard even on the sixth day, the forest teams are leaving no stone unturned. On Wednesday they even attended a prank call about the animal sighting but it probably turned out to be a civet cat. After killing a pig near Maharajbagh zoo on Monday-Tuesday night, it was expected that the leopard would return again to the kill but it didn’t. It is changing places and hence it is becoming difficult to track it. “The leopard did not enter any of the three cages placed to lure it with goats as baits. The animal was also not captured in any of the camera traps near the zoo area. We are puzzled with its behaviour,” said Dr Bharat Singh Hada, deputy conservator of forests (DyCF), Nagpur division. Hada said they also attended a prank call when a security guard at the edge of the VNIT campus said he saw an animal jumping from one tree to another and there were dogs near the spot. “But as per the description given by the guard, it seems to be a civet cat. Had it been a leopard, dogs would not have been near the tree. There was also no indirect evidence found about the animal,” said Hada. “Now, we have an increased number of cages and camera traps. For a change, these cameras will be deployed near the openings of the nullahs. As a strategy, we have also asked officials to break up into small teams so that the animal is not disturbed. It is possible that due to the crowd it is changing locations frequently during the night,” Hada said. The leopard was first sighted by Narendra Chakole and Kishor Jagtap on their residential premises in Gayatri Nagar neat National Power Training Institute (NPTI) on May 28. Since then the leopard has traveled 5km (as crow flies) to reach Maharajbagh zoo. The CCTV footage of the animal is the only evidence with the forest department as of now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/foresters-attend-prank-call-no-clue-of-leopard-yet/articleshow/83184924.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

With this, Malerkotla district will now have three subdivisions - Malerkotla, Ahmedgarh and Amargarh. As many as 192 villages, 62 patwar circles and 6 Kanungo circles will be included in Malerkotla district. The cabinet authorised chief minister Amarinder Singh to approve new posts for offices of 12 departments, including police, rural development and panchayats, social justice and minorities, agriculture and farmer welfare, social security and women and child development, health, education (primary and secondary), social security, employment generation, industry and commerce, food, civil supplies and consumer affairs and finance. Amarinder had on Eidul-Fitr, May 14, announced the decision to make Malerkotla a full-fledged district, fulfilling a long-standing demand of the local people. The cabinet also allowed the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for operating and maintaining large, multi-village schemes to sustain the supply of potable water to rural areas. This will be a Punjab Rural Water (Utility) Company under the water supply and sanitation department. The cabinet approved opening an account in the name of this SPV, with a seed money of Rs 25 crore, 64% from the World Bank funds and 36% from the state budget, for the first five years. This will meet the revenue shortfall, if any. The cabinet also authorised the CM as chairperson of the state water supply and sanitation mission to approve on behalf of the council of ministers any amendment in the structure, role, responsibilities, and funding pattern of the SPV. The water supply and sanitation department is executing five multi-village surface water supply projects for 612 villages of Amritsar, Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur districts, besides another project to cover 408 villages in fluoride-affected blocks of Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib districts. Another project to cover 39 villages of Rupnagar district’s Nurpurbedi block afftecte by iron and arsenic poisoning started in 2019. In January, construction giant L&T completed a Moga project based on design, build operate and transfer (DBOT) model and worth Rs 218.56 crore to benefit 85 villages and 3.64 lakh people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-approves-malerkotla-as-23rd-district/articleshow/83188573.cms||---

The fatality rate of mucormycosis is five times that of Covid-19 in the state. While the Covid mortality rate is below 1%, the death rate for mucormycosis is 4.8%. The state is facing a shortage of liposomal amphotericin B, a drug of choice for treating mucormycosis, and many doctors are forced to use other antifungal drugs for treatment. The highest number of black fungus deaths have been reported from Jaipur. Thirty people lost their lives to mucormycosis in the city, while 12 died in Udaipur and 10 succumbed to the fungus in Jodhpur. Kota reported eight deaths, Bikaner six, while Ajmer, Chittorgarh and Sriganganagar reported two deaths each, and Jhalawar and Bhilwara one each. So far, 1,524 persons have been found to be infected by mucormycosis. Out of these, 988 have been diagnosed in Jaipur. “Diabetic people are vulnerable to mucormycosis. Majority of the patients were found infected with mucormycosis while being treated for Covid and as well as post-Covid complications. Among diabetic patients who take steroids the infection is high,” said a senior health department official. In the state, 32 hospitals have been allowed to provide treatment for mucormycosis patients. Such patients are coming to the hospitals with complaints like swelling on one-side of the face, headache, nasal or sinus congestion, fever and black lesions on nasal bridge or upper inside mouth that quickly become more severe. Doctors treating mucormycosis patients perform a surgery known as endoscopic surgical debridement to reduce the load of fungus on affected parts of the patients and follow it up by admninistering antifungal drugs. Earlier, SMS Medical College had warned against the abnormal use of steroids which would elevate sugar levels in patients and reduce immunity, resulting in mucormycosis infection. Steroids should not be given in the first week of Covid infection as it is the time when the virus replicates. Steroids can be given in the second week of infection, which is a period of inflammation, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mucor-claims-74-in-raj-death-rate-5-times-as-high-as-covid/articleshow/83186795.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Eyes now on Higher Secondary exam to decide on criteria for college admission||KOLKATA: Universities have started contemplating if tests should be reintroduced for admission to undergraduate courses after the CBSE and ISC cancelled Class XII examinations, a benchmark used by many universities and colleges to admit students. State government had last week said it would hold the HS examinations in the end of July but a final decision is awaited. It will actually determine how universities and colleges modify their admission process. Holding admission tests will not be in the time of the pandemic as Jadavpur University and some other colleges could not hold them last year. “Class XII results are the only criterion for us to determine the merit of students. Now with the two boards cancelling the examinations, we do not know what will be criteria of evaluation. Once that becomes clear, we will modify our admission process,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. Last year, admissions to UG courses began in the first week of August and stretched till January this year as colleges and universities struggled to fill up the seats. The higher education department had to extend the admission multiple times so that maximum seats are taken in colleges and universities. There are some colleges, like JD Birla Institute, which might start receiving applications by the end of this month or early next month. It will start the admissions by the end of June or first week of July. St Xavier’s College, too, started receiving applications in July last year. “Last year, in Jadavpur University, entrance tests could not be held due to the pandemic. Also, the possibility of holding online admission tests were ruled since many applicants would not have had access to high-speed internet. But in 2019, arts faculty had opted for admission tests in all subjects and also awarded some weightage to the plus-two scores. This formula is likely to be reintroduced as the admission begins in July. But the science faculty needs to decide their criteria for admission as they have not yet held entrance tests in the UG level,” said a teacher of the arts faculty. A final decision will be taken by the executive council of JU. Presidency University is already scheduled to hold admission tests to the UG courses that will be conducted by the West Bengal Joint Entrance Examination Board in. “PUBDET is to be held in August. Till now, the plan holds,” informed a source in the WBJEE. He pointed out that there maybe alterations in the weightage set to assess the applications from their Board examination marks. “A call will have to be taken by the university,” the Board source said. Calcutta University, has, however adopted a wait-andwatch policy. “The decision regarding admissions will be taken in the Syndicate meeting,” said a CU official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/eyes-now-on-hs-exam-to-decide-on-criteria-for-college-admission/articleshow/83184931.cms||Zeeshan Javed

ZyCov-D, the Zydus vaccine, a is three-dose indigenous DNA vaccine being developed with support from the Centre’s National Biopharma Mission as part of Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, department of biotechnology. ?“Internationally, regulators know about the safety of the DNA platform. We have already finished 70-80% of recruitment, which means we have already covered 800-1,000 children, who are already a part of the trial. So, I believe we will have a good amount of data for this cohort as well. Potentially if there is good amount of data in terms of safety then this vaccine can be approved for use in the age group of 12-18 years,” Dr Sharvil Patel, managing director, Zydus Group told TOI. The vaccine is used with a new needle free applicator which can also lead to a significant reduction in any kind of major side effects. “Our vaccine is intradermal and will not be administered with a syringe. So, the children would be quite happy to receive the vaccine,” Patel added. Another benefit of a DNA vaccine is that, compared to others, it can be easily updated to counter the new variants of the virus, said officials. “The vaccine has already been updated against the UK, South Africa and the Brazil variants and in the next 7-10 days it will be updated against the B.1.617.2 variant prevalent in India,” said an official in the department of biotechnology. More than 28,000 people and 60 sites are covered in their trial, the manufacturer said. TOI had reported on May 30 that the pharma group even has plans to soon start trials on children aged between 5 and 12 years.? Microbiologists and medicos say that a three-dose regimen can be optimum for creating a long and sustainable immunity not only in children but also in immunocompromised people.  “It will give a larger immune response and longer antibody response. But how to space these doses is a call that should be taken by the ICMR and health authorities,” said a senior doctor with health ministry. ?Zydus added that they are looking to augment their in-house capacity from 1 crore to 2 crore doses, and over the next six months their monthly production may touch 2.5- 3 crore doses with contract manufacturing organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/zydus-80-of-enrolment-over-for-vaccine-trial-in-12-18-age-group/articleshow/83192356.cms||Rohan Dua
---||Mumbai||Hospital bills not audited and 80:20 scheme under-utilized: Activists||MUMBAI: The state’s 80:20 scheme that was first in India to regulate private beds and cap charges for Covid treatment has remained underutilised in most parts of the state, according to activists. They have demanded auditing of hospital bills on a bigger scale mainly in tier-II and III cities, and efforts to popularise the scheme. On Tuesday, the scheme was given an extension for the fifth time and will now be in force till August 31. But public health activists said without awareness, the scheme could largely remain on paper. Dr Abhijit More of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan cited the example of Pune, where less than 2% of bills have been audited. “It shows people don’t know treatment rates are capped and that they can seek an audit. 80:20 deserves wider publicity,” he said, adding the government has failed to propagate it. TOI found out the state doesn’t possess a consolidated number of how many bills have been audited and how much money has been refunded to patients, barring from bigger districts like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur. A state official said most local bodies have “failed” to implement the scheme. “Many haven’t designated auditors to review bills,” he said. Several districts decided to audit only bills over Rs 1.5 lakh though no such limit was suggested, the official said. The revised version mandates pre-auditing of every bill before it goes to patients. So far, Mumbai has refunded over Rs 15.5 crore, Pune over Rs 3 crore and Nagpur nearly Rs 2 crore to patients who were charged more than what has been fixed. The rate for isolation beds under 80:20 is now Rs 2,400 to Rs 4,000, ICU without ventilator is Rs 4,500 to 7,500 and ICU with ventilator is Rs 5,400 and Rs 9,000. Charges like doctors’ consultation, routine examinations and oxygen rates are included in room rates, but patients get charged additionally. Noted medical activist Dr Arun Gadre said the idea of such a scheme was commendable, but implementation and monitoring has faltered. He blamed private hospitals mainly for deliberately depriving people by not spelling out if the patient was being hospitalised under the 80% quota or 20%. “Under 20%, where hospitals can command their own rates, people have been charged arbitrarily, but in the absence of auditors, it went unchecked,” he said. Given that Maharashtra has not regulated the private sector for 30 years, it was expected they would find it difficult to create monitoring systems overnight, he added. In smaller districts, awareness is abysmal, said Nanded-based Ujjwala Padalwar of ASHA Gatpravartka Federation. “When the 2nd wave hit, people were at the mercy of private hospitals and had to pay anything from Rs 20,000 to half a lakh for admission,” she said. “When people don’t know about the scheme, how will they contest the charges,” she said. Dr Sudhakar Shinde, who was instrumental in framing the policy, said the state will work towards popularising it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hosp-bills-not-audited-and-8020-scheme-under-utilized-says-activists/articleshow/83186886.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Chandigarh||Haryana teams picking up Covid, mucor drugs from airport||Chandigarh: Health authorities from Haryana are reaching up to Delhi’s IGI Airport to pick up consignments of drugs for treating mucormycosis and Covid-19. Officials, according to sources, are going the extra mile to expedite the arrival of stocks at the main store of Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited (HMSCL), the state’s agency for procuring and distributing drugs. Ahead of arrival of parcels, guarded vehicles of Haryana health department reach IGI Airport to pick up drug stocks. Officials in the vehicles are authorised to pick up the drugs and rush them to the main store of HMSCL. While the teams were giving priority to oxygen vehicles, they are now resopnsible for transporting drugs like Amphotericin B, Tocilizumab and others. Earlier, oxygen vehicles were being given a police escort to ensure they reach their destinations in time. HMSCL officials said this was being done to expedite the entry of drug stocks and their further dispatch for distribution in medical colleges and hospitals where the injections have to be given to patients. “In mucormycosis, timely treatment is the need of the hour. Since we are getting a rationed supply, we have decided not to depend on companies for the purpose of supply. That is why we send our own vehicles. Sometimes, we have to leave vials at NCR hospitals and medical colleges, so this beocmes easy for us,’’ an HMSCL official said. The official added Amphotericin B injections were the main concern as they had sufficient stocks of other drugs in the HMSCL store. After alleged forced filling of oxygen cylinders in Faridabad from an oxygen tanker of Haryana, state government had deployed police escort to oxygen tankers to ensure smooth passage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-teams-picking-up-covid-mucor-drugs-from-airport/articleshow/83190784.cms||Manvir Saini

He was the former chairman of Kerala Cartoon Academy. Badusha was known for drawing caricatures of people in one minute. He was associated with various government departments to spread awareness against the use of drugs and violation of motor vehicle rules. He raised money for the chief minister’s disaster relief fund following the floods in 2018 drawing one-minute caricatures of passengers at Aluva Railway Station. Lately, he has been active in promoting caricatures related to Covid-preventive measures on social media.  Noted cartoonist Sudheer Nath said Badusha played a major role in attracting children to the world of caricature and cartoon. “His contribution to the cartoon world is that he did his best to bring children to cartoons, especially through words. He taught them simple techniques to draw cartoons. Badusha followed the footsteps of cartoonist Sajjive Balakrishnan in winning the hearts of people by making free live caricatures. It is very sad we lost one more cartoonist to Covid. We have lost a total of five cartoonists to the disease so far in the country,” said Sudheer Nath. Badhusha, son of Hamsa of Kallungal House in Thottumukham near Aluva, leaves behind wife Safeena and three children.

---||Jaipur||Now, RBSE cancels board exams for classes X & XII||JAIPUR: The state government on Wednesday decided to cancel Class X and XII board exams conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) this year in the backdrop of a looming third wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The decision was taken at a virtual meeting of the council of ministers, chaired by chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Around 12,14,512 Class X students and 8,82,112 Class XII students will be affected by the decision. The move follows a similar decision taken by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other state boards due to the present Covid situation in the country. The meeting also discussed a package for children orphaned by the deaths of parents due to the virus. “Though the Centre has announced a package of Rs 10 lakh for such children, they will get this only after they attain 18 years of age,” said education minister Govid Singh Dotasra. “So, the meeting directed the finance department to prepare a package to take care of their present requirement for education, boarding, lodging, etc.,” Dotasra added. It was also decided to release the second instalment of Rs 1,000 each for families of destitutes, daily labourers in June. The first instalment of Rs 1,000 was given to these families in April itself. During the first wave, 33 lakh helpless, destitute and labour families were provided assistance of Rs 3,500 each last year. The council of ministers also passed a resolution demanding the central government provide free vaccines to youth in the age group of 18-44 years like others. Despite issuing a global tender, vaccine manufacturing companies are not ready to provide the same to states. In such a situation, it is the responsibility of the central Government to provide free vaccines to all states, including Rajasthan, in sufficient quantity to inoculate the youth. Similarly, vaccines for children too should be made available to states free of cost. The meeting held that the wastage percentage of vaccine doses in the state is only 2.08%, which is much less than the national average of 6% and the 10% permissible limit set by the Centre. Along with vaccination, Rajasthan is among the leading states in the country doing well in all parameters in the war against coronavirus. A detailed discussion was held on the current status of infection, vaccination, measures to prevent black fungus and the strategy to combat the third wave. The meeting was informed that due to the efficient management of state government and effective enforcement of public discipline lockdown, Rajasthan was able to bring down the number of active patients sharply in the last about 20 days. At the peak of the second wave, the number of active patients in the state had exceeded two lakh, which has now come down to 37,000. The recovery rate has also exceeded 95%. Oxygen consumption has come down from 400MT per day to close to 222MT. At present, 37 private and government hospitals have been authorised to treat mucormycosis o black fungus. Health services up to the level of community health centres (CHCs) have been improved in preparation for the third wave. As part of this, oxygen supply through pipelines and oxygen generation plants are being set up. Medical personnel are being trained and arrangements for essential medicines for children are being made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/now-rbse-cancels-board-exams-for-classes-x-xii/articleshow/83186894.cms||---

Sharma said that the Gandhinagar station is being developed with a hotel on the station. He announced that the bullet train project in Gujarat section is going according to plans and 95% of the land acquisition is on. “In Maharashtra, there are issues of land acquisition and land for the undersea tunnel is yet to be obtained. Hence, one cannot comment on the time frame for the completion of the project,” Sharma said. About the dedicated freight corridor, Sharma said that a breakthrough in freight carrying for the railways is expected by next year by connecting the Mundra and Adani port freight to Palanpur on the Dedicated Freight Corridor. “We hope to complete the western and eastern dedicated freight corridor by next year,” he said. He said freight trains currently move at an average speed of 46km per hour and the railways is in the process of increasing the speed further. About the railway passenger services, Sharma said that the railways has decided to start more special trains on a sector depending on the length of the waiting lists for any train. “We are going ahead on the advice of the state government for starting train services. We have started trains for Mumbai and Surat and Ranchi as the passengers want round trips,” he said. He said that the private train operation bids have been announced and there are 10 bidders in the race.

Giving this information city police chief Amitesh Kumar on Monday said he will rope in experts from institutions like National Law University (NLU), Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Tirpude Institute of Management and such institutions to analyse the reason behind high numbers of violence taking place in the city, and take action accordingly.  “Following a reference made by state home minister Dilip Walse Patil, we have a plan to find out the reason behind such rage in the minds of criminals. In the last 20 years, there had been around 20,000 murders in the city with an annual average of 100 and the peak reaching with 135 in one year. We need to see whether it’s anthropological, socio-economical or even cultural aspect behind such high numbers of murders,” Kumar said, adding the officers are now in the process of talking to various organizations to explore the possibilities to rope in their experts to study the crime pattern vis-à-vis the social background of criminals. Kumar, who have been trying to check crimes especially murders, expressed his deep concern over close family members killing their elderly kin for no concrete reasons and also the street rages, leading to mindless violence. Former CP BK Upadhyay and incumbent Addl DG state traffic said the body offences have reduced over the period of last two decades but the prevalence of even a small number of such crimes put a blot on the city’s image. “Employment, education and lack of industrialization are one of the major factors in these crimes. One may see the connection of less opportunity for employment pushing up the crime. The same can be said about education,” Upadhyay who has served the city on various capacities for at least 10 years, said. Renowned psychiatrist Dr Sudhir Bhave underlined the sociological factors behind the occurrences of violent crimes. “The living surrounding and the quality of its ambience contributes to a person’s behaviour too. When something undesirable (like crime) starts becoming common then it gets ‘normalized’ too for a person perceiving it,” he said. “The squalor of the slum and the aggression of the people staying in them often gets reflected in their outwardly behaviour which many times transpired to activities like crime. Authorities should improve the conditions of the slums which may improve the thoughts of the dwellers here too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/soon-multi-disciplinary-group-to-assess-violence-pattern-in-city/articleshow/83184962.cms||Soumitra Bose

We will provide vaccine to the beneficiary. We have list of around 68,000 beneficiaries who are disabled and bed-ridden in Ernakulam. The list of street-dwellers who are above 18 years old should be prepared by the respective local bodies and the details should be uploaded on the portals of the central and state governments, based on the criteria. Anganwadi teachers and ICDS workers should be doing it. Those who are bed-ridden will be given vaccination by a team from the nearby vaccination center, at their house. In order to avoid wastage, the team will carry the last portion of the vaccine in the vial, in the carrier to the house of the beneficiary and administer it. If the beneficiary reports any health problem after vaccination, the family members can contact the team,” said Dr M G Sivadas, vaccination nodal officer in Ernakulam. All local bodies agreed to arrange facilities for the vaccination of the three categories and collect the required data. The speed of the vaccination will be based on the availability of it. Currently the project, DISPAL VAXEKM is underway at Muvattupuzha block panchayat. It will be expanded to the rest of the local bodies in Ernakulam. Meanwhile vaccination for people above 45 years will be held on Friday. First dose of Covishield and second dose of Covaxin will be administered on the day.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Ahir said BJP will launch a state-wide agitation on June 3, the death anniversary of party’s OBC leader late Gopinath Munde, to press for the demand. Taking a dig at chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and other ministers, Ahir claimed Maharashtra government failed to put up convincing arguments before the Supreme Court, which resulted in the apex court scrapping the reservation granted to the OBCs. “OBC members in local self government administration would be denied of the opportunities to participate in the governance due to the most “fatal” judgment,” he said. “Maha Vikas Aghadi constituents treat OBCs as a vote bank, but never think of granting them proportionate representation in the power sharing process,” said the BJP leader. “We condemn MVA’s insensitive conduct towards vital issue like OBC reservation and will continue the agitation till the government takes prompt action to rectify its mistake,” said Ahir. Among others present at the press meet include Rajendra Dange, OBC district chief, Sunil Samdurkar, councillors Nitin Giri and Dr Pravin Prajapathi, Amol Dhone and district general secretary Raju Padgilwar and others. Later, Ahir met collector Amol Yedge and discussed with him the pros and cons of the OBC reservation issue and sought information about the Covid situation in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ahir-demands-special-panel-to-restore-obc-quota/articleshow/83188613.cms||---

This would be the fourth instance when the civic body has had to halt the vaccination drive for want of stocks. Of 49,833 jabs given on Wednesday, 44,323 were at private facilities; barely over 5,510 were at public centres. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the city has been receiving doses in small instalments of 20,000 and 30,000, which not only slows down the drive but hampers planning and distribution. “The shortage is solely responsible for the slowdown in public vaccination. We are hoping to get some doses on Thursday, in which case we may be able to resume by Friday,” he said. Vaccination on Friday will be through online appointments. Numbers show the government’s drive has been slowing in the last seven days while private initiatives are thriving. In the last week, 2,14,694 doses were administered at paid-for private vaccination centres while 1,29,256 doses were given at public centres. Many private hospitals are expecting more stocks next week. BMC received 2.6lakh doses in January, 5.7lakh in February, 8.1lakh in March, 9.4lakh in April and 5.2lakh in May. Overall, Mumbai has got 31.17lakh doses. A civic official said they failed to persuade Serum Institute of India, makers of Covishield, to participate in a global tender floated by BMC to build an inventory. Of 49,833 doses administered on Wednesday, 39,530 were given to 18-44 years group; 5,559 to the 45-59 category and 3,071 to senior citizens. Recipients included 101 lactating mothers. On the third day of walk-ins for students, 711 took the shot. In all, 2,586 foreign bound students have got it so far. The state on Tuesday vaccinated 2,5,1703 in all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-short-on-stocks-bmc-cancels-vaccine-drive-for-thursday/articleshow/83186949.cms||Sumitra Debroy

BJP state president Bandi Sanjay on Wednesday confirmed the development, saying that the former health minister will join the BJP in a week, after taking legal opinion. “Eatala is joining us unconditionally. BJP will not give any assurance to anyone,” Bandi Sanjay said. Eatala reportedly decided to resign before the speaker takes action against him. “Eatala anticipated that TRS will taken action against him, but instead TRS is trying to distance the cadre from Eatala camp,” a source told TOI. Meanwhile, several developments took place in BJP over Eatala’s possible joining. Senior leader DK Arun met E Pedireddy, who was protesting Eatala joining the party. Peddireddy expressed unhappiness over the party’s decision, as he was anticipating Huzurabad seat in case of a by-election. The former TDP leader was touted to be joining TRS, but sources in TRS denied any such moves, for now. Gosha Mahal MLA Raja Singh came down heavily on partymen who were against Eatala joining the BJP. Meanwhile, Congress MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy said that Eatala is not joining his party since it does not have the Union home ministry under its ambit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-to-join-bjp-next-week-bandi/articleshow/83186973.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Diamond exports likely to grow $20bn this fiscal||AHMEDABAD: India’s diamond exports are expected to grow 20% and cross $20 billion mark in fiscal 2021-22 with demand rebounding since the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, said a report by Crisil. The revenues from exports declined by 12% to $16.4 billion in 2020-21. The drop, however, was not as steep as it was expected when the world went into unprecedented lockdowns. As nations recovered well in the second half of the last fiscal, the tumble in exports was halted, the rating agency stated based on an analysis of 70 diamantaires, who account for a third of industry’s total revenue. According to the rating agency, towards the second half of last fiscal, pent-up demand and stimuli had buoyed consumption of diamonds and jewellery in the US and China, which account for 75% of India’s polished diamond exports. With the pandemic said to be contained in China, and the US inoculating 40% of its population, consumer confidence has improved in both countries. The demand will also be bolstered by improving economic growth and declining unemployment. “Exports have been rising and averaging $2 billion per month since October 2020. There will be some moderation in the second quarter of this fiscal, which is a lean period typically,” said Rahul Guha, Director, CRISIL Ratings Ltd. “The festival season that begins in the export destinations from the third quarter will boost revenue to pre-pandemic levels. That will tantamount to a 20% growth in diamond exports by revenue this fiscal,” Guha further added. The onset of the second wave saw smaller, labour-intensive polishing units facing 20-30%labour migration. The larger ones restricted this to 10% by following physical-distancing norms and providing safe transport to staff. “The industry’s current operating rate is over 80%, with sufficient inventory to tide over any production loss in the first quarter of this fiscal,” stated Crisil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diamond-exports-likely-to-grow-20bn-this-fiscal/articleshow/83186930.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: With schools remaining closed, augmented reality takes over||KOCHI: As part of efforts to make learning more interesting and effective during online education in the time of the pandemic, some schools have introduced augmented reality (AR) based teaching system. The system will help the teachers to bring virtual objects into the real classroom thereby aiding the students to get a clearer picture of the lessons taught. It is in the wake of the restrictions in opening schools which are expected to continue throughout the year that the managements decided to introduce AR in their schools. “We had been exploring the usage of technology for making classes more effective and interactive. We are introducing AR in St Antony’s Public School, St Joseph’s LP School, St Joseph’s High School and Higher Secondary School. We have already installed the app in the laptops of more than 100 of our teachers,” said Fr Francis Areekkal, manager of schools under St Antony’s Forane Church, Kizhakkambalam. “We have already imparted online training to the teachers. Once the lockdown is lifted, experts from the firm which developed the software will give hands-on training to the teachers. We plan to launch AR in all our classrooms within a few days,” he added. In the first phase, AR facilities will be available for science, mathematics and social science subjects. “We have developed the modules for science, mathematics and social sciences. We will be developing the modules for other branches and labs by September. Many students are lamenting that they have to attend exams, especially Plus One and Plus Two practical exams, without getting hands-on training in the labs. The AR module for the lab will address such issues,” said Suvith S, one of the directors of Infusory, a start-up firm which developed ‘Tutar’ app used for providing AR facilities. “The teachers can bring any augmented reality versions of anything to the classroom. For example, the teacher can hold a three-dimensional heart designed by AR in his or her hands and rotate it to teach the students the features of the heart. Teachers of KG sections, for example, can bring elephants, cows or anything, about which they teach, to the classroom. This will make teaching more effective and interesting,” he added. “We have launched the AR facilities in schools in many districts like Kozhikode, Thrissur and Alappuzha. But, the schools managed by St Antony’s forane church at Kizhakkambalam are only institutions with AR facility in all classes,” Suvith said. “On Wednesday, three government schools in the state have also placed orders for providing AR services,” he said. Training centres, like those for medical entrance coaching, are also use the facility. Infusory was started in 2018 in Thrissur. “We have developed virtual reality (VR) labs for some colleges as well. The AR facilities in the classrooms can be switched over to VR once schools reopen and start real-time classes,” Suvith said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/with-schools-remaining-closed-augmented-reality-takes-over/articleshow/83184976.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Chandigarh||Amritsar hospitals gear up for possible 3rd wave||Amritsar: Hospitals here are gearing up for a possible third wave of Covid-19, with many hospitals adding Covid level-2 and -3 beds, making arrangements for oxygen, and ensuring regular supply of medicines. Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research dean Dr A P Singh said they would be adding 75 level-3 Covid beds with ventilators at Sri Guru Ram Das Hospital, Vallaha, near Amritsar in addition to the existing 25 level-3 Covid beds at Sri Guru Ram Das Hospital, near Shaheedan Gurdwara. He said a liquid oxygen-generation plant with a capacity of 1,000 litres per minute would be made operational in each hospital by June 15 . He said there was hardly any likelihood of a third wave with the same strains of virus. He said if there would be a third wave, it would most likely be of a new strain of the virus. Jallianwala Bagh Martyrs Memorial Civil Hospital senior medical officer Dr Chandar Mohan said they had proposed to set up a 50-bed Covid ward on the third floor of the hospital, with a separate passage and lift. He said they had proposed to arrange oxygen concentrators to meet any exigency during the third wave. A senior doctor of Fortis Hospital, Dr Arun Kumar, said they had sufficient beds in their hospital for Covid patients. He said they had 60 level 2 and 3 Covid beds in the hospital. He suggested people to follow Covid-sensible behaviour and take precautions. He added the target now should be to vaccinate the whole country or as many people as possible. “But both are unlikely to happen in a period of few months,” he said, adding that government must help all vaccine manufacturers . Guru Nanak Dev Hospital medical superintendent Dr K D Singh said they had recently added 100 Covid beds and would soon add another 60 Covid beds with level-3 facilities for children. He said an oxygen plant would be installed and made operational by Friday. He said the hospital had little role in ensuring medicines since they were supplied to them by the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amritsar-hospitals-gear-up-for-possible-3rd-wave/articleshow/83190838.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||Strict vigil, testing for safe unlocking||New Delhi: With manufacturing units and construction sites being allowed to operate from Monday as part of the gradual unlocking process, district authorities are not only keeping a hawk eye to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour, but also testing workers and employees at these sites. Sources said the authorities may soon inoculate workers and employees of manufacturing units and construction sites at the nearby vaccination centres.After almost 40 days of a stringent lockdown, which even saw Delhi Metro’s services getting suspended, construction work and factories were allowed to restart from 5am on May 31. While construction work was only allowed where workers were residing on-site earlier, from Monday labourers travelling from other places were permitted to come with e-passes. Factories, however, were completely closed and opened on Monday. Manufacturing units at only 28 authorised industrial areas in Patparganj, Bawana, Narela, etc have been allowed to function.In an order issued on May 29, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had directed all district magistrates to ensure that random RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests were carried out in sufficient numbers at construction sites and manufacturing and production units on a regular basis.District officials said while testing was being carried out, a large number of enforcement teams had been deployed to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour was followed by all workers and employees at both construction sites and factories.New Delhi district administration is carrying out public announcements at multiple locations daily to increase awareness regarding Covid-appropriate behaviour and to spread the message of SMS (Sanitisation, Mask and Social Distancing) as key to fighting the pandemic.Inspection of construction sites is being carried out by the “flying squad” of the district to ensure observance of DDMA guidelines. As part of the “outreach Covid-19 testing”, officials are holding makeshift testing camps. One such camp was held at the construction site at Mehram Nagar on Wednesday.A South district official said consolidated lists had been finalised with details of each construction site for every subdivision, which would be monitored by enforcement officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/strict-vigil-testing-for-safe-unlocking/articleshow/83185003.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Nagpur||Now, FDCM to foray into sawn timber marketing||NAGPUR: Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM), a state government enterprise engaged in commercial extraction of teak, plans to mop up revenue of around Rs 100 crore by foraying into sawn timber marketing business. Sawn timber is the timber that is cut from logs into different shapes and sizes. Presently, the corporation is into selling round teak logs and bamboo only. Sawn timber will be produced from its existing production for which FDCM will avail sawmills on lease in Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia, Bramhapuri (Chandrapur), Kinwat (Nanded). On May 20, the FDCM has invited expression of interest (EoI) for the same. The last date to submit offers is June 7. “Sawn timber has a good market and hence the FDCM board decided to enter into this trade. In Allapalli, five sawmills owned by the forest department have been allotted to us, but the production here can only fulfill 5% of the requirement. Hence, we need more sawmills at strategic locations and therefore EoI has been invited,” said N Vasudevan, managing director, FDCM. The FDCM produces 50,000 cubic metres of teak annually. Of this, initially, it plans to convert 5,000 cubic metres into sawn timber. It will be later increased to 25,000 cubic metres. The corporation’s teak is of good quality and hence can fetch good price. “We will increase the output gradually. Apart from generating revenue, our aim is to offer service to society by supplying authentic material. Presently, the market has attained dubious distinction by not supplying genuine teak,” said Vasudevan. As per officials in the field, on an average, one sawmill produces 300 cubic metres of sawn timber per year. The FDCM will have to take at least 20 sawmills on lease to meet the target of 5,000 cubic metres. The expected gross revenue target will be between Rs75-Rs100 crore. Officials said at present, states like Gujarat and Karnataka are selling sawn timber and making good profits. Being a government enterprise, the FDCM will also be able to tap supplies with the government departments. Vasudevan says, “We will also go for online selling of the material. In future, we may consider making teak furniture and also plan to make home deliveries of the material.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-fdcm-to-foray-into-sawn-timber-marketing/articleshow/83186961.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Ahmedabad||Tracing GSPC’s stake crash in its LNG project||AHMEDABAD: Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC), which held a majority stake of 50% in the LNG re-gasification terminal at Mundra in Kutch district, has seen its equity share come down to as low as 1.29% in the past one year. The dip was recorded after Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) infused capital to the tune of Rs 500 crore in May last year in GSPC LNG — a company floated by GSPC to set up the terminal facility. The ports and maritime regulator currently owns about 56% equity stake in the company. The once debt-ridden GSPC was looking to make capital investment to regain its stake in GSPC LNG. However, it did not get the clearance from the state government, said a GSPC official in the know of the matter. The government has set up a high-powered committee chaired by chief secretary Anil Mukim to look into the key decision-making processes for the terminal. “GSPC was looking to increase its stake in a phased manner. Initially, it wanted to increase its stake to 25%,” according to a state government official. “But the committee turned down the proposal.” The official stated that there was a strong possibility of changing the company’s name to GMB LNG in the future. The Rs 4,545 crore LNG project has been built with a capacity to store and re-gasify 5 million tonnes of natural gas, the sourcing for which is done by GSPC. The terminal’s capacity can be expanded to 10MTPA (million tonnes per annum) and is designed to have a berth for receiving LNG (liquefied natural gas) tankers and storage tank facilities for re-gasification and gas evacuation. Apart from GMB and GSPC, the Government of Gujarat holds close to 32% equity stake, Gujarat State Petronet Ltd holds 2.83%, while Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation and Gujarat Industries Power Company Ltd each hold 1.13%. Adani Enterprises Ltd owns 5.46% equity stake in the LNG project. The company has the government clearance for picking up to 25% stake in GSPC LNG.To meet financial closure, the company needs to raise another Rs 475 crore from shareholders to meet the prescribed debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30, said sources. So far about Rs 890 crore has been invested in the company by equity partners. The remaining amount of about Rs 3,180 crore for the project is by way of debt. The terminal received its first cargo in January last year and in record time of six months, the terminal’s capacity has been ramped up, reaching the peak of 40%. Over the years, GSPC has moved away from its core business activities of hydrocarbon exploration and production after it was faced with huge financial losses over its KG Basin Block that was sold to ONGC a few years ago.“GSPC has seen some turnaround in its financial performance over the past couple of years but was not in a position to make any fresh investments towards the terminal project,” said a source in the state government. In January 2019, after Indian Oil Corporation dropped its plan to pick equity in the project, for which it had the in-principle approval of the board, the government asked GMB to step in, sources added. GSPC had conceived the LNG terminal project in 2008. It was originally planned at Hazira with GSPC holding 50% equity stake, and Adani Group and Essar Power holding 25% each. Essar later backed out and the site of the terminal was shifted to Mundra. In 2013, the government invited expressions of interest and India Gas Solutions, a JV between Reliance Industries and the UK’s BP Plc, Torrent Power and Petronet LNG participated. The plan did not work out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tracing-gspcs-stake-crash-in-its-lng-project/articleshow/83186989.cms||Maulik Pathak

The entire machinery can be pressed into service to augment the production, if required,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote said. “We hope that centre and state will initiate urgent measures on this front and bring badly required relief to the patients, struggling for survival because of these infections,” the bench said before adjourning the hearing of a suo motu PIL till next Wednesday. Censuring both governments on their affidavits where they mentioned that steps were being taken to improve the situation, the judges observed that “HC and patients were always put on the waiting list”. “Patients are losing eyes, tongues, cheeks and other body parts. With affidavits you put a bait before us that some help is going to come. We waited endlessly, but no steps were taken. We will say, let the patients fend for themselves. Show by action that you are serious about what you are saying by increasing amphotericin allocation to Maharashtra.” Explaining concern over the growing number of black fungus patients in the city, the judges said there were 1,584 registered patients till May 29, of which 830 were operated upon so far. “Of them, eyeballs of 74 were removed to stop the infection from spreading, while 69 have succumbed to the deadly disease. These are extremely alarming figures, which shows that the infection is no longer a rare one, but assuming a form of an epidemic.” Stressing on that there have been reports coming from different parts of the country which are equally alarming so far as reports of Aspergillosis and Candida Auris fungus are concerned, the bench said if immediate measures aren’t taken, it would take severe form of epidemic in entire India as well. “This is the reason why we have been repeatedly saying that the Centre and state, community of experts and society in general make immediate efforts to contain the spread of fungal infection. Those could be in the form of maintaining individual cleanliness and hygiene through improvement of immunity levels by remaining on good diet and also keeping contributing ailments like hyperglycaemia, diabetes and the like under control to make available in sufficient quantities drugs required for treating these infections,” the judges observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/centre-state-not-taking-measures-to-contain-mucor-hc/articleshow/83183399.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The company, headed by city businessman Nitin Khara, already has a plant at Dahej in Gujarat. The Umred facility is expected to be operational by November after which Confidence would emerge as a company having second largest production capacity of cylinders in the country, says the management. The plant at Dahej has a capacity of making 16,000 cylinders in a month. The Umred facility will be able to make 30,000 in a month. The company which has the highest capacity has its unit at Gandhidham in Gujarat and has a capacity to make 54,000 cylinders, said a source. With both the plants clubbed Confidence will be making 46,000 cylinders. “We have the technology to make high pressure cylinders. With this, we can make cylinders to fill oxygen, nitrogen or even CNG,” said Khara. The company already has its presence in LPG bottling and auto LPG sectors. The Umred facility will require an investment of over Rs170 crore. “We already have plant in Dahej but we thought of having a facility in Vidarbha as the company is based in Nagpur,” said Khara. “The idea to set up the company’s second plant at Umred was conceived in February and the work began a month ago. By that time, Covid was already at its peak. This has created a major demand of cylinders from the healthcare sector,” said Khara “Since Covid had reached a peak when the project started, even work on the site has been speeded up. When the plant is ready in November and if the pandemic continues, the company will be able add to supply of cylinders in the market,” said Khara. “If not, there is always a demand from the industrial consumers. During Covid days, majority of demand has been from medical sector, normally it is the industries which are major users,” he said. Khara said Confidence Petroleum has also tied up with Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to set up 100 CNG filling stations in the city. The company also plans to increase the number of its auto LPG stations to 100 throughout the country. At present, Confidence has 209 filling stations in different cities. There are plans to add another 91 during the financial year, he said.

However, at the same time, some petrol pumps in the city witnessed a rush of bikers and motorists for buying fuel. Petrol was retailing at a record high of Rs 100.72 per litre, while diesel was at Rs 92.69 per litre. In Dadar, activists from AAP, including party’s national joint secretary Ruben Mascarenhas innovatively protested against the rising fuel prices by playing a cricket match. Petrol prices have been hiked by over Rs 24 in a year. AAP activists said they wanted to celebrate “petrol hitting a century” with sarcasm, and were protesting against the Centre’s decision. Mumbai Congress organised a protest rally against fuel price hikes opposite Metro Mall, on Western Express Highway, Magathane, Borivli (E), on Wednesday. Mumbai Congress president Bhai Jagtap led a bullock cart and cycle rally. Despite the huge hike in fuel prices and petrol retailing at over Rs 100 a litre, people were moving around on bikes for running errands.

---||Mumbai||PMLA court: Banks can take over Vijay Mallya properties worth Rs 5,600 crore||MUMBAI: In two separate orders, the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court has allowed the plea of the SBI-led consortium of banks to restore to it properties collectively worth Rs 5,600 crore of absconding businessman Vijay Mallya. Through an order on May 24, the court restored assets worth around Rs 4,233 crore. Tuesday’s order related to assets worth Rs 1,411 crore. In both orders, the court held prima facie Mallya and his companies were involved in falsification of accounts and funds misappropriation. The assets include under-construction properties in Kingfisher Tower, Vittal Mallya Road, Bengaluru, spread over 2.45 lakh sqft and worth over Rs 564 crore, multiple floors of a tower at UB City, Bengaluru valued at Rs 713 crore (as per the ready reckoner rate in 2016) and a land parcel along with a farm house at Mandwa, Alibaug, worth around Rs 25 crore. In addition, bank deposits and pledged shares are also to be restored. While some of the assets are in Mallya’s name, others are held through his companies. In 2019, the SBI-led consortium of 12 banks had submitted the application seeking “restoration” of the properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the provisions of the PMLA. It was alleged that the banks that had disbursed loans to Mallya and his companies had suffered losses of over Rs 6,200 crore due to their criminal actions. Mallya’s defence had opposed the plea stating he had given only a personal guarantee and that could not connect him to the alleged money laundering. Refuting the arguments, the court said that Mallya had full control and command over Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. It said that despite having no offshore operations, its accounts indicated expenditure of fuel for ‘aircraft operating offshore’. The court further said between 2009 and 2011, though the company’s financial condition was poor, it transferred money received through loans to Mallya’s Force India. “The transferred amount was shown as payments for operating expenses in relation to flight operations,” the court said. The court said the losses were not imaginary. “The accused Dr Vijay Mallya himself placed a proposal for replacement of dues. Had there been no loss to the banks, why is Dr Vijay Mallya ready to repay the loss,” the court said. It also pointed out that the properties were insufficient to meet the losses suffered by banks. In the orders, the court also remarked that it was surprising to note that Mallya’s legal team was demanding information from the ED about when he would come to India. “Ironically, the absconding accused himself is asking the court to get confirmation from the investigating agencies as to when they would secure the custody of accused. Dr Vijay Mallya should come with clean hands,” special judge Jayendra C Jagdale said. The court also said that restoration can take place on the banks executing a bond, undertaking to produce the properties before it as and when required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pmla-court-banks-can-take-over-mallya-properties-worth-rs-5600cr/articleshow/83188719.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The arrests were carried out within 12 hours of a video showing Dr Seuj Kumar Senapati being attacked at the Udali Covid care centre in Hojai, about 170km from Guwahati, on Tuesday. The doctor had just started his 1.30pm shift on Tuesday when he found that a patient identified as Giyasuddin had died, the centre’s nodal officer Dr Imran Hussain said. As relatives of the deceased went after Senapati and vandalised the centre, the mob grew to 25-30 people, witnesses said. The lone constable on duty was a spectator to the assault. Before Senapati, who is being treated for multiple injuries, the mob targeted nurse Lalita Bharali. “They tried to strangle me and asked for the doctor’s phone number,” said the nurse, who hid in a toilet as the rampage continued. Amid outrage and protest by the medical fraternity, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was visiting Delhi, tweeted that the “culprits involved in this barbaric attack” had been identified and arrested. A Hojai court remanded seven of the 24 accused in police custody for three days and 14 in judicial custody. The remaining three were sent to a juvenile home. DGP Bhaskar Mahanta said the police were looking for four other suspects and would file "a strong chargesheet" in the case soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opd-boycott-after-assault-on-assam-doctor-by-mob-24-held/articleshow/83192385.cms||Kangkan Kalita

---||Ranchi||12 of 41 with black fungus have died in Jharkhand||RANCHI: As many as 41 persons have been infected with the black fungus disease in Jharkhand till now, of which 12 have died from the fungal infection while 13 have recovered after undergoing surgery. As many as nine districts have reported black fungus cases, with Ranchi accounting for the lion’s share with 16 cases, followed by East Singbhum with 12 cases. Other districts include Ramgarh (four), Palamu (two) while Chatra, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Dumka, Godda, Hazaribag and Jamtara have each reported one case. As many as 50 patients have currently been classified as suspected cases of black fungus, of which maximum are in Ranchi (11), followed by Giridih (six), while Hazaribag and Garhwa each have five suspected cases, East Singhbhum and Koderma have three cases each, while Bokaro, Chatra, Dhanbad, Godda, Gumla, Palamu have two cases each and Sahebganj and Latehar each have one case. Also known as mucormycosis, it is a rare but severe fungal infection, which is mostly being detected in Covid-19 patients post their recovery. The first case of black fungus surfaced in Jharkhand around a month ago and now the fatality rate is around 29%. Asked about the death rate spiralling in such a short span of time, Dr Anindya Anuradha, who is an ophthalmologist at Medica hospital here, said, “One of the reasons responsible for this is that patients are turning up at the hospitals when they are already critical. Many from different districts are being referred to Ranchi or other big centres when their condition has worsened.” She added that the key to tackling the infection is early but accurate detection. “Not all cases are of black fungus, even if a patient exhibits identical symptoms. This is where the role of ophthalmologists comes into play. They need to be careful and avoid unwanted surgeries, which may lead to other complications or can even cause death,” she said. Ranchi and East Singhbhum have so far witnessed three deaths each, followed by two in Ramgarh and one each in Chatra, Dhanbad, Dumka and Hazaribag. “The maximum number of deaths have taken place at Medica, Raj hospitals and Rims in Ranchi and Tata Main Hospital in Jamshedpur as these are the only places that are attending to black fungus patients across the state,” said an official of the state health department. Dr Anuradha, who was reportedly the first one to perform the surgery of a black fungus patient in Jharkhand, said that it is a relatively new disease in Jharkhand. “I personally haven’t come across any black fungus cases during the pre-Covid period in Jharkhand. However, my colleagues in the southern states have come across such cases.” She added, “Jharkhand’s climate is not congenial for fungal growth but due to the high use of steroids and other medications, among others, for treating the critical patients of Covid-19 in this second wave, black fungus is spreading here as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/12-of-41-with-black-fungus-have-died-in-jharkhand/articleshow/83186252.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Ranchi: Church distributes nutritious food to Covid patients at Rims||RANCHI: The Archdiocese of Ranchi, under the Roman Catholic Church, on Wednesday began distribution of nutrition packets to over 300 patients admitted to the Covid ward at the state-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims). The food packets include fruit, biscuits, fresh juice, beaten rice, jaggery and mineral water. The church’s new effort is in addition to the 800 cooked food packets that the Archdiocese of Ranchi, in association with Ranchi Catholic Youth, has been distributing amongst the relatives of patients hospitalised at Rims since May 4. Ranchi archbishop Felix Toppo and auxiliary bishop Theodore Mascarenhas blessed the first 300 packets distributed among the patients. Toppo, praying over the packets, thanked God for keeping them healthy so that they could serve the sick and the needy. "Every day, Church officials, seminarians and volunteers of Ranchi Catholic Youth will take 300 food packets to Rims and hand over them to the warden, who will in turn distribute these among the patients. We will not undertake any direct distribution to patients to comply with Covid norms," Mascarenhas said. He added that the Ranchi archdiocese is drawing up plans to distribute similar food and nutrition packets at other hospitals in the state. He emphasised that the Church has been able to serve the poor as many religious congregations and benefactors belonging both to the Catholic Church as well as followers of other religions have been generously donating to the cause. "We will soon launch another programme to distribute dry ration -- rice, pulses, potatoes, cooking oil, salt, spices and onions -- among the needy and impoverished in sufficient quantities that would last at least two weeks for a family," Mascarenhas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/church-distributes-nutritious-food-to-cov-patients-at-rims/articleshow/83186347.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Take steps to prevent cheating in e-exams: Jharkhand governor||RANCHI: Governor Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday urged all the vice-chancellors (VCs) to improve their online teaching methods and take steps to prevent students from cheating during online exams. Speaking to the VCs during a review meet via video conferencing, Murmu said, “Under the current circumstances, there’s no alternative to online classes. It is crucial to take steps to make sure that students do not develop a habit of cheating.” Murmu brought up the matter of students being absent from online classes for a long period of time and asked the VCs to look into it. She said that such students need to be counselled if they are facing problems. She added, “The teachers should upload their lectures on YouTube for the benefit of students.” Several Ranchi University (RU) affiliated colleges have witnessed a fall in the number of students attending the online lectures with the attendance percentage hovering arpund 50%. Many students have cited the poor internet connectivity and the unavailability of smartphones as the main reasons for their absenteeism. Sanjay Kumar, a contractual teacher at KO College, said that he needs to send notes on WhatsApp groups as many students do not join the online class owing to poor connectivity. Rajan Kumar of Marwari College said that RU should provide a paid version of Google Meet and other gadgets for ensuring a better turnout in online classes. Meanwhile, the governor said that universities could play a vital role in encouraging people to follow the Covid-appropriate behaviour. The VCs apprised the governor of the steps taken by their respective institutes, like distributing masks, oxygen cylinders and encouraging people to take the vaccine, in this regard. She also discussed other matters, including regularisation of academic sessions and the Chancellor’s portal. Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee University’s VC S N Munda said, “Online classes, and social responsibility were some of the issues discussed in the meeting. Our university has adopted three villages in Ranchi where mass awareness regarding the vaccination drive will be carried out.” Besides the VCs, the meeting was attended by additional chief secretary (higher and technical education) K K Khandelwal and VCs (in-charge), among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/take-steps-to-prevent-cheating-in-e-exams-guv/articleshow/83184456.cms||---

A letter in this regard was issued by National Health Mission’s (NHM) MD Ravishankar Shukla, directing all the 24 civil surgeons to make sure that a physiotherapist is available in post Covid clinics in their respective districts. Shukla said, “We have seen a large chunk of Covid patients facing complications following their recovery and in most cases, they require physiotherapy sessions. We have decided to deploy physiotherapists across all our post Covid clinics, which are currently operating in the district hospitals.” Welcoming the government’s decision, the assistant professor of cardiology at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr Prashant Kumar, said, “Addressing post-Covid complications is a very important follow-up step for the recovered patients as it helps in identifying and eliminating the complications that one may experience in future and the physiotherapy of lungs is an essential step in this regard. It is done with the help of a respirometer as well as exercises involving one’s back. It helps in increasing the efficiency of lungs. It is a welcome step if the government is making such arrangements.” According to Shukla’s letter, a total of 42 physiotherapists will be deployed across all 24 districts. They will report to their respective centres between 10am and 12:30pm daily, as per the roster, and will continue with their regular work after they are done with their duty at the post Covid clinics. “We had already deployed a physiotherapist when we started operating the clinic a week ago. Now, with the addition of two more experts, we can cater to more number of patients,” Ranchi civil surgeon Dr Vinod Kumar said. The civil surgeons have been asked to make all the necessary arrangements at their respective post Covid clinics so that patients do not face any inconvenience. The NHM’s post-Covid care is part of its National Leprosy Eradication Program and Non Communicable Diseases projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-to-deploy-physiotherapists-at-all-post-covid-care-centres-in-jharkhand/articleshow/83184541.cms||Gaurav Pandey

One rebel was shot dead in the operation on Monday. Block development officer (BDO) Shishir Kumar Singh visited the Maoist-hit Marwa, Keragani and Kochagani villages under Kurumgarh police station to encourage terrified step out of home villagers to take the jabs. Singh said, “Initially, the villagers were reluctant to come over to the Marwa hilltop for vaccination, but I managed to persuade them. The Marwa village, where the encounter took place, has 40 families, mostly Mahatos and tribals.” The residents complained to the officials about the lack of approach road and drinking water facilities before the visiting team headed to Kergani and Kochagani, where another 15 agreed to take the shot. "Tribals of remote forest regions have now begun to admit that the vaccines do not harm anyone," Singh said. All panchayats sewaks have been asked to make weekly visit to these areas. Singh said he visited Sokrahau, Kolda and Budhokona villages in the same forested regions on Sunday to facilitate vaccination of 30 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/after-encounter-vax-drive-in-remote-forests/articleshow/83184439.cms||K A Gupta

The principals assured students dissatisfied with the decision that they will get plenty of opportunities to prove their mettle in future. CBSE’s tele-counsellor in the state and Vikas Vidyalaya’s principal P S Kalra said, “The Union government was left with no choice except cancelling the exams. Safeguarding a student’s life is of utmost importance. The pandemic has already brought excessive stress in our lives and one must try to curb its impact as far as possible.” He added, “Although most of the students are happy with the decision, those who did not perform well in the internal exams will naturally be disappointed. But one should realize that Class 12 marks will not matter in the long run, as long as one does well in life.” Now that uncertainty looms large over the minds of students, Kalra advised them to concentrate on entrance tests of professional courses and of colleges/universities. Delhi Public School principal Ram Singh feels that the decision should largely satisfy all students. He said, “Those who were aiming to score high marks in the exams may be complaining. That is why it is important that the assessment pattern addresses the concerns of all categories of students.” The CBSE is likely to assess the students on the tests they have taken throughout the year, the modalities of which will be announced soon. DAV Hehal’s principal M K Sinha said that the decision to cancel was correct and it was taken after consulting several experts on the issue. The Indian Certificate of Secondary Education Board on Tuesday also announced its decision to cancel the Class 12 board exams and the coordinator of Don Bosco Public School, Uma Shankar Sahu, said the board had no other option. “Those who were looking forward to the exams will be disappointed but holding exams in such a situation is risky, to say the least.” Jharkhand Parents Association’s president Ajay Rai said, “The decision comes a relief as we were worried about our kids’ safety. We had been pressing for the cancellation of the exams for quite some time now. The Jharkhand government should also cancel the intermediate examination, which is to be conducted by the Jharkhand Academic Council.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/principals-parents-welcome-cancellation-of-cbse-exams/articleshow/83186402.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Winter hope for panchayat election||RANCHI: The state government has begun deliberations to keep panchayat bodies operational in the event of any further delay in holding rural polls that are due since December last year. In January, the Jharkhand government granted six months extension to over 4,000 panchayat bodies by forming three-tier samities for their day-to-day operation. The extension period will end on July 31, before which either polls have to be held or all panchayat bodies would get dissolved. In case of the latter scenario, the department would face difficulty in utilization of funds meant for panchayat bodies and local area development at a time when the pandemic has hit the economy and resulted in rural distress. On Wednesday, state rural development minister Alamgir Alam held a meeting with his officials to explore possibilities in this regard and prepare an alternative road map to keep panchayat bodies operational. The department is considering two options — to provide extension of another six months or put the rural bodies under the administrative control of the state government, a move which Bihar government has adopted recently. Talking to TOI, Alam said, “We have decided to write separate letters to the Union government and the advocate general (AG) of the state and seek their opinion. As per the Panchayati Raj Act, extension can only be given once for six months. Therefore, we will seek the Centre’s opinion on the matter. Meanwhile, we will also seek the AG’s opinion before taking a final call.” Even though Covid-19 cases have seen a drastic dip in the state, the government is treading cautiously to prevent any uptick in infection. As part of its first unlock measure, the state government on Tuesday eased restrictions in 15 districts by allowing all kinds of shops to resume operations while curbs continued to remain in the remaining nine districts that have a higher rate of infection. Alam conceded that conducting polls within the next two months will not be feasible. “If all goes well, we will be in a position to hold the election in November-December and not before that as it requires a lot of ground work such as delimitation and preparing the voter list, among others. We are requesting the State Election Commission to be ready for the polls, but I don’t see the election happening anytime before the end of this year. Therefore, the only option is to explore whether to give extension to the panchayat bodies or put them under administrative control,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/winter-hope-for-panchayat-election/articleshow/83184532.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The 1999 batch IAS officer will also take additional charge of as many as six departments, including all the roles he played earlier. A notification in this regard- issued by the personnel, administrative reforms and Rajbhasha department here on Wednesday – was however silent about the role given to Ekka after his transfer. Choubey will remain secretary (urban development and housing), secretary (excise and prohibition), managing director of Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company (JUIDCO), excise commissioner, managing director of Jharkhand Beverage Corporation Ltd and managing director Greater Ranchi Development Agency. Considered a go-getter bureaucrat, his name was making rounds for the post of secretary to CM as soon as Hemant Soren government was voted to power in December 2019. Choubey was then the chief electoral officer (CEO) of the state. Though Choubey served at various bureaucratic positions in the state, his stint as the deputy commissioner-cum-district magistrate of Ranchi in 2012-13 is remembered for achieving the highest Aadhaar enrolment, making Ranchi top the list of all districts in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vinay-choubey-named-new-secy-to-cm/articleshow/83186203.cms||---

The move also paves the way for uniform ex-showroom pricing of its cars across India and is aimed to abolish the practice of dealers undercutting prices to record higher sales in a bid to clear stocks. The new retail strategy will be implemented in the fourth quarter (October-December 2021). Announcing the fundamental transition in its retail business by shifting to the direct-to-customer ‘Retail of the Future’ model, MBIL MD and CEO Martin Schwenk said that while dealers would still sell the cars, MBIL would own the entire stock of cars, invoice the new cars to the customers directly, process the order and fulfill them, offering one transparent price and purchasing experience for customers. While the company will still use dealer showrooms to display cars and their yards to stock inventory, dealers will no longer be required to make the purchase upfront, thereby reducing their financial and operational risks, resulting in a sustainable business model. This has become all the more significant during the pandemic when lockdowns and associated uncertainties in business have put dealers under huge financial strain. Prior to the pandemic, an average dealership in a tier-I city had to maintain an inventory of nearly 70-100 cars worth around Rs 35-50 crore. Conversely, that would also mean BMIL blocking several thousand crores in inventory. In 2019, MBIL had sold 13,786 units worth Rs 7,000 crore and in 2020 that was hit by the pandemic, the company managed to sell 7,893 units worth around 4,000 crore. In future, BMIL intends to bear this entire inventory cost. “Introducing Retail of the Future underscores our clear vision for a future which is sustainable, empowering and digital,” explained Schwenk. The MBIL MD further said the new strategy was the first step towards establishing an ecosystem that is customer-obsessed and empowers them to have a hassle-free journey. “Customers will henceforth avail the best price directly from Mercedes-Benz and transparent price comparison across the product range,” he said. MBIL currently has around 94 dealers in 47 cities across 22 states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/merc-unveils-direct-retail-to-hold-all-inventory/articleshow/83185320.cms||Subhro Niyogi

Schools are collaborating with private hospitals to hold immunisation camps for these students and their staff. Many of these students are expected to fly out in the coming months but the mandated 84-day gap between doses of Covishield vaccine may still delay them, unless the rule is relaxed. About 98% of students from the graduating class at Dhirubhai Ambani International School are planning to study abroad. The students and parents had got in touch with the administration to facilitate a vaccination drive for them, said a school spokesperson. The Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital was roped in to organise a drive on May 24 to get over 100 students immunised. Surabhi Goel, CEO Of Aditya Birla World Academy, said they had multiple requests from students. “Fortunately, the (Birla) group was holding a drive for our staff and we managed to include students too. Around 60 students had shown interest when we floated the plan, so we set up a separate counter for them,” said Goel. She said a few alumni, who had deferred their joining plans last year, also participated. The Cathedral and John Connon School has about 97 students in the graduating class who are scheduled to fly out in August-September. The school helped the students to get vaccinated at a drive organised last week. Around 60 students from the class participated. The delay in getting slots was only adding to their anxiety, said principal Meera Isaacs. Bombay Scottish School in Mahim will also be organising a drive. Another principal pointed out that the 12-week gap between doses of Covishield needed to be relaxed to help students get fully vaccinated before they travel. Though first doses are made available now at private hospitals, many will not be able to get their second dose if the rule applies, she added. The BMC, too, has allowed foreign-bound students to walk in at centres for their vaccine shots since Monday. In three days, the municipal corporation has vaccinated a total of 2,586 students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/international-schools-make-sure-foreign-bound-students-get-shots/articleshow/83192338.cms||Yogita Rao

Zoraiz Riyaz, a management graduate from Lahore, has replicated a Pakistani model of catering to SOS calls of Covid victims through a Facebook page, for India as well. The 28-year-old had created a Facebook page — ‘Corona-recovered warriors in Pakistan’. This has a member base of 3.41 lakh. Anyone who wanted help in terms of oxygen, plasma or medicines could write a message on the wall. The members would swing into action, using their resources. Based on the calls, group members tapped their own links or acquaintances to make the arrangements. Help could happen through sheer word of mouth, though spread through the Internet. For example, there is a call from Karachi to get oxygen cylinder and a member from the same city, who knows where it could be available, helps out. As Covid took major toll in India, Pakistani citizens too expressed solidarity towards the neighbour. There were Internet campaigns like ‘Indian Lives Matter’, and ‘Pakistan Stands For India’. Taking cue from it, Riyaz created a similar page — ‘Corona warriors India’. “Though the page was designed here in Pakistan, I made Indians as the administrators and moderators. This was because they had better understanding of the ground situation and the local area, as against a Pakistani,” Riyaz told TOI over phone. The Pakistani Facebook group has 3.41 lakh members and over 30,000 queries have been responded to, says Riyaz. The Indian page on the Facebook was created on April 22, and has nearly 6,000 members. Riyaz says half of them are Pakistanis. It’s handled by Richa Sanwal, a radio professional from Mumbai. Sanwal had come to know about Riyaz through common friends and had interviewed him as a personal endeavour. “I had done a podcast on Zoraiz after which we started the page for India,” said Sanwal. “The number of calls have come down considerably, but we may have responded to at least 100 queries, during the peak,” she says. Sanwal says even as Pakistanis could not provide direct assistance, they did send messages seeking help for their contacts in India. “When my mother needed Remdesivir, I was referred to contacts in Mumbai and Pune by Pakistani members of the page,” she said. Ashwani Saini, who lives in New Zealand, lost his grandfather, and both in-laws in Delhi. “It was a separate situation for us, but found help through this page,” said Saini. Saini was not aware that the page was created by a Pakistani youth, but was overjoyed on knowing this. “It was great of them indeed,” he said over phone. “The page can be found through random search on the Internet. A number of persons have made appeals on the net for help during Covid. They came across the page during such an attempt and soon the word spread,” said Riyaz. During these days, Riyaz also came to know more about India. “One of the new places I came to know about was Telangana. Is there any city by this name,” he asks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-covid-pak-and-india-do-gooders-come-on-same-page/articleshow/83187333.cms||Shishir Arya

This took the total number of such persons held in the district so far to six. On Wednesday, sleuths raided two clinics in the Manki Complex and Meem Masjid area of Godhra. Three persons treating people by claiming that they were doctors were held from the two locations. In the Manki Complex, Sufiyan Vadhel and Owaish Sadamas were held by the police. The duo was treating patients there for several years now. In the second raid, Sadiq Mala was found treating patients near Meem Mosque in Godhra town. Injections and IV sets were seen hanging in the premises where he used to work. In all, six such quacks have been nabbed by the Panchmahal police since the crackdown began on Monday. On Monday, two persons hailing from West Bengal were held from different villages in Kalol taluka. On Tuesday, a man was held from the Shivrajpur village in Halol taluka of the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/three-more-fake-docs-held-in-godhra/articleshow/83183773.cms||---
---||Nagpur||2 years on, no funds to rectify 66 accident-prone spots in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Despite identifying 66 accident-prone spots in Nagpur city and rural parts in 2019, no efforts to rectify the same could be initiated in the last 2 years as the District Road Safety Committee (DRSC) has no funds. Rajya Sabha member Dr Vikas Mahatme, who is also vice-president of Member of Parliament Road Safety Committee (MPRSC, Nagpur), said: “We are working on plan to overcome funds crunch.” “MPRSC has already rectified a few spots by taking some corrective measures through different government agencies. Now, it is time to resolve the issue through a systematic plan to minimize accidents,” Dr Mahatme stated in a letter to Visvesvaraya National Institute Of Technology (VNIT) director, urging the premier institute it to carry out study and help the panel by preparing a DPR of every accident-prone spot. “The move will enable the committee to fulfil its commitment towards larger public interest,” Dr Mahatme stated in the letter. Officials from transport department confirmed that the committee has no funds to appoint VNIT’s traffic engineering department to conduct scientific study of the black spots and intersections and prepare a detailed project report (DPR). “Unless DPR of the accident-prone spots is prepared, rectification work could not be carried out,” said a senior officer. Citing enormity of the task, VNIT has expressed inability to carry out the study without funds, said the officer. To prepare DPR of accident-prone spots in the district, the committee will require at least Rs1 crore. More funds would be required subsequently to carry out rectification, said sources. Now, the committee will try to raise funds from other agencies to meet the cost, sources said. Another hiccup is that roads in both city and rural Nagpur are owned by different agencies including National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), state’s public works department, Nagpur Municipal Corporation and Nagpur Improvement Trust. These agencies are responsible for the rectification of the black spots. Dr Mahatme said the NHAI has funds, but other agencies don’t. “Hence, it is very difficult task, but we are positive to get the work done at the earliest,” he said. In 2020, Union minister Nitin Gadkari had formed a pan-India Member of Parliament Road Safety Committee in every district to curb road accidents by identifying and rectifying accident-prone spots. Road corridors of about 500 meter length where either five road accidents, involving fatalities and grievous injuries, are reported during the past three calendar years or 10 fatalities during the past three calendar years are categorised as accident-prone or black spots spots. The committee considered the data of 2019, when the city had witnessed 1,007 road accidents that left 250 dead and 1,042 injured. Roads under Nagpur rural had witnessed 843 accidents, killing 382 people and injuring 940. An analysis of these accidents showed that the district had 66 accident-prone spots and they were mapped as per police station and road agency wise. The DRSC had inspected the accident-prone spots and suggested both short-term and long-term measures. It also identified 19 faulty road designs and 47 spots where accidents occurred regularly due to human negligence. For short-term measures, even works like painting zebra lines, warning signboards, advanced signages, speed breakers etc have been done in rural Nagpur, but no measures have been taken on city roads. The study also revealed that not only human negligence, but slow progress of development works like construction of flyovers and road works too have formed several accident-prone spots.

---||India||Covid-19: For the past seven days, new cases have remained below 2 lakh||NEW DELHI: Fresh infections continued to fall as it has been seven days since cases have not breached 2 lakh mark. With few exceptions, the overall declining trend is largely consistent since the first week of May when cases peaked in the country. Deaths, however have not seen a proportionate decline. Today was the 44th consecutive day of over 2,000 daily Covid deaths reported from the country. Overall the day reported 1,33,765 cases and 2,619 Deaths (doesn’t include Jharkhand’s tally). The trend in India is consistent with the global patterns as other hotspots -USA, Brazil, Argentina and so on are also cooling off. However, despite the fall in cases, India’s case count is about four times of 30,000 cases reported by Brazil the world’s second worst-hit country in terms of fresh cases. With 25,317 new infections confirmed in the past 24 hours, Tamil Nadu reported the country’s highest cases and was the only state where the daily total crossed 20,000 mark. The count was between 10,000 and 20,000 for Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, which among major states, were the hotspots till recent weeks are reporting steady fall in cases. All these states reported less than 10,000 fresh cases on Wednesday. Similarly, the count was less than 2,000 for Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. The national capital which along with these states was one of the major epicenters of the second wave reported less than a thousand cases on Wednesday. Like cases, India also leads the global death tally by a huge margin. Against 2,619 deaths reported by the country, Brazil the world’s second-worst country in daily deaths reported 860 fatalities. State-wise analysis shows that seven states reported more than a hundred deaths on Wednesday. The count was highest for Tamil Nadu where 483 people succumbed to covid related complications. Karnataka is the only second state that reported over 400 deaths. The number was 285 for Maharashtra and 213 for Kerala. Today’s toll for Kerala was the state’s highest so far. Apart from Kerala both Odisha and Nagaland also reported their highest death toll today. Odisha reported 40 deaths in the past 24 hours while the numbers were 27 for Nagaland. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi were the other three states that reported over a hundred deaths today. At 99, the daily toll remained below 100 in Punjab for the second consecutive day. The state had reported more than 100 fatalities for 35 days in the row, touching a peak of 231 on May 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-the-past-seven-days-new-cases-have-remained-below-2-lakh/articleshow/83192448.cms||---

As per state health department data, 3.33 lakh Covid-19 tests were conducted in past 24 hours taking the total tests conducted in the state to 5.07 crore. This is over 14% of total tests done in the country since the onset of pandemic. In terms of technique, 45% were conducted through RT-PCR method. State government officers stated over 65% tests conducted during the second wave were done in rural areas with help of rapid response teams. More than 61 lakh tests were done in April of which 63% were in rural areas. Likewise, in May, 70% of 85 lakh tests were done in villages. An official spokesperson said, UP has come a long way in terms of testing. “Earlier, samples would be sent to NIV, Pune, but infrastructure was quickly ramped up to set up testing centres here.” Officials said, despite being the most populous state in the country, UP has outpaced other states, including Delhi, Maharashtra and Rajasthan by conducting an average of 1.50 lakh RT-PCR tests daily. Officials pointed out that the strategy of test and treat has helped UP to limit the virus spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-up-conducts-3-3-lakh-tests-in-24-hrs-is-1st-state-to-top-5cr-screenings/articleshow/83192362.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Nagpur||Greens not buying into Nitin Gadkari’s plans for plantation and translocation of trees||NAGPUR: Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s announcement regarding felling of 4,522 trees and another 408 trees for inter modal station (IMS) and railway over bridge (ROB) and its approaches, respectively, at Ajni, has left environmentalists seething. They feel that the minister’s assurances of five times compensatory plantation and translocation of trees will not succeed. Meanwhile, sources told TOI that the deadline to submit objections against felling of trees has been extended till June 30 by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Till Wednesday, NMC had received more than 200 objection letters. Activist Kunal Mourya informed that more than 11,000 people have signed for an online petition against felling of trees. “People from across the country are coming forward to protest against such large-scale felling,” he said. On Wednesday, Gadkari tweeted that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is the implementing authority of the projects, has initiated transplantation of trees at an identified forest land in Shankarpur on Wardha Road. “It will also carry out additional five times compensatory plantation at suitable locations,” the minister added. According to government officials, 4,522 trees will be cut for IMS and another 408 to build an ROB connecting the station. While a total of nearly 5,000 age-old trees will be fully cut, sources informed that 2,000 trees, for which no permission has been taken by the NMC garden department, will be transplanted. According to this, a total of over 7,000 trees are at stake for phase-1 of the project. According to experts, transplantation of trees will be a big failure and a waste of public money. “Cost of transplanting one tree is around Rs 20,000. This means the total cost of transplanting 2023 trees will be around Rs 4 crores. This will be another scam,” said environment activist Jaydeep Das. TOI has been repeatedly reporting about failure of transplantation in the city. Rs 10 lakh were spent for Maha Metro’s transplantation of 31 trees and none of them survived. “Once the taproots of a tree are cut off, the tree will never survive. Scientifically also, it is not possible to transplant in our city's soil and climatic conditions. Trees can only be transplanted in coastal areas where there is moisture in the soil and humidity in atmosphere,” said environmental activist Anasuya Kale Chhabrani. She added that compensatory plantations too have been a major failure. Recently, Gadkari had admitted that compensatory plantations done by NHAI have failed at many places. Stating that not all trees are suitable for transplantation, founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said, “Transplantation of trees have been unsuccessful in Nagpur mainly due to the city’s climate. Even for trees being transplanted, compensatory plantation in the ratio 1: 5 should be done as a back-up plan.” Chatterjee added that species chosen for compensatory plantation should be either of same species being cut or with high oxygen transfer and high carbon absorption. “Most importantly, compensatory plantation needs to be carried out preferably at Ajni or nearby places in order to maintain green lungs of our city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/greens-not-buying-into-gadkaris-plans-for-plantation-and-translocation-of-trees/articleshow/83187486.cms||Manka Behl
---||Delhi||Number of Delhi death certificates up 250% to 35,000 in April-May||NEW DELHI: More than 34,750 death certificates were issued by the three municipal corporations in the city during April and May, when the second Covid-19 wave was raging. This is a 250% increase over the figure of 9,916 certificates issued in the corresponding period last year. With the severity of the pandemic peaking around April-end this year, bulk of these death certificates have been issued in May. The death registration data for May this year shows that 24,000 certificates were issued, while during the same month in 2020, 5,475 death certificates were issued by the municipal bodies, an additional 18,525 certificates in May alone. The registration data from South Delhi Municipal Corporation shows the number of death certificates rose from 2,512 in May 2020 to 10,209 in May 2021; the north corporation saw an increase from 2,116 to 9,663; and the east corporation an increase from 847 to 4,128 in the same period. TOI had earlier reported the comparative death registration data for the month of April. The three corporations had issued 4,441 death certificates in April 2020 and the count increased to 10,750 certificates during April this year. Final count may go up as applications still pendingA senior municipal official said that many applications are still pending in the registration system while some families in case of recent deaths may not have applied for the certificates yet due to which the final number is likely to be higher. The official Covid toll in Delhi, according to the government health bulletins, was 11,036 on April 1, 2021, which increased to 24,237 on May 31, 2021 — an addition of 13,201 deaths in two months. TimesViewThere’s a wide gap between the official Covid count and the increase in death certificates issued this April-May. The difference must be examined and explained by officials. Having accurate data on Covid is crucial in formulating the right response.Jai Prakash, mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation – the civic body which oversees the biggest crematorium of the city at Nigambodh Ghat – said that a large chunk of these additional deaths are due to Covid. "If we compare the registration data for May, the number in the north corporation area alone has increased from 2,116 last year to 9,663. A proper audit or door-to-door survey should be carried out to find out the real Covid death count of the city. Checking the cremation slips issued at the crematorium can also give us a fair idea about the Covid deaths,” he added. “Never in recent decades have we registered more than 10,000 deaths in one month. That record was broken in April, while now more than double of that figure has also been recorded,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/number-of-delhi-death-certificates-up-250-to-35000-in-april-may/articleshow/83192476.cms||Paras Singh
