The first lady wore a black jacket with the word "love" outlined on the back in silver beading as she and the president met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Thursday. She wore the same jacket more than two years ago to kick off Biden's presidential campaign. "We're bringing love from America," she told reporters, explaining her fashion choice. "This is a global conference and we are trying to bring unity across the globe and I think it's needed right now, that people feel a sense of unity from all the countries and feel a sense hope after this year of the pandemic." Biden is known for her sartorial choices, often donning bright pastels or eye-catching patterns for her outings on behalf of the Biden administration. She is rarely seen without a kitten heel or stiletto boot, adding height to her petite frame. And this isn't the first time she's sent a direct message with her clothes: During a campaign trip to Iowa late last year, Biden wore black skinny jeans bearing the word "VOTE" down each calf. Biden's jacket and pants come in contrast to the last first lady to offer a message with her clothes: Melania Trump wore a jacket that read "I Really Don't Care, Do U?" during a trip to a detention center for migrant children in 2018. She wore a different jacket at the shelter. The first lady is accompanying her husband during the UK leg of his foreign trip, where she'll participate in spouses' activities at the Group of Seven summit, and a couple of events focused on military veterans and their families. She joined Johnson's wife, Carrie Johnson, for tea Thursday. It marks Biden's first overseas visit as president. Along with his participation in the G-7 summit and a NATO summit in Brussels, he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden said her husband had been "studying for weeks" for the trip and joked that he is "over-prepared." "Joe loves foreign policy. This is his forte," she said. The Bidens are set to meet with Queen Elizabeth II on Sunday at Windsor Castle. The first lady told reporters "that's an exciting part of the visit for us."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/message-in-a-jacket-jill-biden-offers-love-during-uk-trip/articleshow/83412793.cms||---

"This is a very ongoing investigation and there's a lot more to come," Wray said during an oversight hearing held by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. "I would expect to see more charges - some of them maybe more serious charges."  Wray testified that the FBI considered the attack an act of "domestic terrorism." He said he understands why Democratic lawmakers have called the attack an "insurrection," but said it would not be appropriate for him to use that word because of the effect it could have on pending criminal cases.  "In my role as FBI director, because that's a term that has legal meaning, I really have to be careful about using words like that," Wray said.  Democratic lawmakers repeatedly grilled Wray, appointed by Trump in 2017, over what they said were intelligence failures that left law enforcement ill-prepared for the deadly attack.  "The FBI's inaction in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6 is simply baffling," Nadler said. "It is hard to tell whether FBI headquarters merely missed the evidence - which had been flagged by your field offices and was available online for all the world to see - or whether the Bureau saw the intelligence, underestimated the threat, and simply failed to act."  Wray responded that on Jan. 5 an FBI field office in Virginia issued an explicit warning, sent to U.S. Capitol Police, that extremists were preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence.  Wray added that "almost none" of the 500 people charged so far with participating in the attack had been under FBI investigation previously, suggesting it would have been difficult for the FBI to have monitored them in advance.  "You can be darn sure that we are going to be looking hard at how we can do better, how we can do more, how we can do things differently in terms of collecting and disseminating" intelligence, Wray said.  Asked whether the FBI was investigating Trump or his associate Roger Stone, Wray said he could neither confirm nor deny any FBI investigation.  "I'm talking about Mr. Big, Number One," said Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen, referring to Trump. "Have you gone after the people who incited the riot?"  Wray responded: "I don't think it would be appropriate for me to be discussing whether or not we are or aren't investigating specific individuals."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fbi-director-suggests-serious-charges-coming-in-probe-of-capitol-attack/articleshow/83412856.cms||---
---||World||Heart inflammation in young men higher than expected after Pfizer, Moderna vaccines: US CDC||A higher-than-expected number of young men have experienced heart inflammation after their second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, according to data from two vaccine safety monitoring systems, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday. The CDC and other health regulators have been investigating heart inflammation cases after Israel’s Health Ministry reported that it had found a likely link to the condition in young men who received Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. The agency said it is still assessing the risk from the condition and has not yet concluded that there was a causal relationship between the vaccines and cases of myocarditis or pericarditis. While some patients required hospitalization, most have fully recovered from their symptoms, the CDC said. More than half of the cases reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) after people had received their second dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines were in people between the ages of 12 and 24, the CDC said. Those age groups accounted for less than 9% of doses administered. "We clearly have an imbalance there," Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office, said in a presentation to an advisory committee to the US Food and Drug Administration meeting on Thursday. The overwhelming majority of the cases have occurred within a week of vaccination, Shimabukuro said. There were 283 observed cases of heart inflammation after the second vaccine dose in those aged 16 to 24 in the VAERS data. That compares with expectations of 10-to-102 cases for that age range based on US population background incidence rates, the CDC said. Shimabukuro said there was a predominance of males in younger age groups among the reported heart inflammation cases. The median age of patients who experienced the inflammation after a second vaccine dose was 24, according to the VAERS data. Just under 80% of the cases were in men. Shimabukuro also said the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) - another safety monitoring system - showed an increased incidence of heart inflammation in 16 to 39 year olds after their second shot when compared to the rate observed after the first dose. Pfizer said it supports the CDC's assessment of the heart inflammation cases, noting that "the number of reports is small given the number of doses administered." About 130 million people in the United States have received both doses of one of the mRNA vaccines. "It is important to understand that a careful assessment of the reports is ongoing and it has not been concluded that the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines cause myocarditis or pericarditis," the company said in a statement. Moderna said it also has not established a causal association with the condition and its vaccine. It said it is actively working with public health and regulatory authorities to further assess the issue. The CDC said it will hold a meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices next week to further evaluate the evidence and assess the risk of myocarditis following mRNA vaccination for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/heart-inflammation-in-young-men-higher-than-expected-after-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-us-cdc/articleshow/83413037.cms||---

The 42-year-old who won gold at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, breathed his last on Thursday after fighting a long battle with liver cancer.  For Dingko, it all started in Goa when he won gold at the 1996 Junior National Boxing Championship at Don Bosco, Panaji. The Manipuri not only topped in the flyweight category (U-18), but also emerged as the Best Boxer of the championship.  “Dingko was a very young boxer. They called him Army boy in Army Sports Institute, Pune. He was scouted and brought in by Dronacharya BB Mohanty from Manipur. It is sad that he expired now. He visited Goa twice and loved this place very much,” Lenny Da Gama, vice-president of the Goa Boxing Association, told TOI on Thursday. Dingko was a fast learner and his rise was imminent. A year after his exploits in Goa, he made it to the Indian team for the King’s Cup in Bangkok. He made his presence felt in his first international tournament.  “I was the team manager that time. We had never won a gold medal but he (Dingko) won gold (54kg bantamweight category) in that championship and the Best Boxer award as well. He climbed up the ladder very fast,” said Lenny.  There was no looking back for Dingko after that triumph as his most glorious moment arrived at the Bangkok Asian Games in 1998. He faced well-known boxer from Uzbekistan, Timur Tulyakov in the final. Timur was ranked world No. 5 in his category.  Dingko had just moved up to the 54kg category from the 51kg a few months earlier but was fearless, before winning gold and creating history. He proved to be far better than his opponent as Timur had to retire after the fourth round.  “After the Olympics (in Sydney, 2000), he had a tragic accident and his right fist had multiple fractures. Unfortunately, he couldn’t recover and be at his best. He was really frustrated at that time. It was a very short career but one to remember,” said Lenny.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-first-saw-dingkos-greatness-as-junior-champion/articleshow/83413101.cms||FLAVIO LOPES
---||World||Colorado reports first litter of wolf pups in 80 years||WASHINGTON: Colorado has reported its first litter of gray wolf pups in 80 years, a major milestone in the western state's efforts to reintroduce the iconic species even as it stands imperiled in other parts of the country.  Between June 4 and June 8, a state biologist and a wildlife manager independently reported visual confirmation that "John" and "Jane," known collared wolves, were seen with three young.  The observations were made at a distance from the den site so as not to interfere with the pack.  It is not known if the three pups spotted are the only offspring. Litters typically consist of four to six pups.  "Colorado is now home to our first wolf litter since the 1940s," said Governor Jared Polis in a statement released Wednesday. "We welcome this historic den and the new wolf family to Colorado."  Coloradans narrowly voted last year in favor of a law to reintroduce the predator by 2023.  A quarter of a million wolves once roamed from coast to coast before European settlers embarked on campaigns of eradication by shooting, trapping and poisoning that endured into the 20th century.  There are now an estimated 6,000 gray wolves in the lower 48 states, up from the roughly thousand or so that remained before the US granted them protection under the Endangered Species Act in the late 1970s.  A few individual wolves crossed over to Colorado from Yellowstone National Park, where they were reintroduced in the 1990s, but it was not clear there was a self-sustaining, viable population in the state.  "We are continuing to actively monitor this den site while exercising extreme caution so as not to inadvertently jeopardize the potential survival of these pups," said Libbie Miller, a state wildlife biologist.  "Our hope is that we will eventually have photos to document this momentous occasion in Colorado's incredible and diverse wildlife history, but not bothering them remains a paramount concern." Ongoing perilDespite the welcome news from Colorado, wildlife groups remain deeply concerned about the species' future after the administration of former president Donald Trump lifted federal protections last year, exposing wolves in several states to trophy hunting and extermination by ranchers.  In March, licensed hunters in the Midwestern state of Wisconsin blew through their quota and killed 216 wolves over the course of three days.  The number was almost twice as high as the allocation, and amounted to roughly 20 percent of the state's entire population.  In May, Idaho's governor signed a bill allowing contractors to kill up to 90 percent of the state's 1,500 wolves, including by shooting them from helicopters or chasing them down with snowmobiles or all-terrain vehicles.  Research has confirmed the keystone predator's ecological importance in thinning over-browsing herds of elk to prevent destruction of habitat. Wolves also help with wetland creation by keeping beavers in check.  A paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last month found wolves reduced the frequency of car-deer collisions by a quarter in Wisconsin.  Most of the reduction was due not to a decline in the deer population but to increasing skittishness by deer around roads often used by wolves as travel corridors, the paper said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/colorado-reports-first-litter-of-wolf-pups-in-80-years/articleshow/83413234.cms||---

However, it questioned the integrity of the previous Sarbananda Sonowal government to curb anti-social activities in its five-year tenure. “In this one month of the BJP government, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma is seen trying very hard to build his image as being strict on issues of drug peddling and cow smuggling which is no doubt praiseworthy,” said Bobbeeta Sharma, chairperson of the media department of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee. She, however, questioned, “What was the BJP government doing in its first term? Why did the government did not crack the whip on drug peddlers and cow smugglers like they are doing now?" She said the BJP government in Assam is technically five years and one month old and that only the captain of the government has changed. On the development agenda, Congress came down heavily on the BJP rule as Assam has been ranked among the worst-performing states in Niti Ayog’s Sustainable Development Goals Index. Congress said this very fact, as determined by the Niti Ayog, is proof of BJP government’s poor performance in Assam. “In Good Health and Gender Equality, Assam’s score is 28th and we are all aware that the present CM was also the health minister of Assam. He was also the longest serving education minister and today, Assam is at the bottom in education as per a central government report published by the Union education minister. But the CM has not uttered a single word on the Niti Ayog report nor on the education report,” Sharma said. Congress also sniffed a backdoor attempt to implement the CAA through the direction of the Government of India to the state government to “disseminate information regarding grant of citizenship to migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who hold Long Term Visas.” “It’s a conspiracy to nullify the NRC. Without a proper NRC, how can Assam grant citizenship to any migrant? This is total betrayal of the people of Assam and disregard of the Assam Accord,” added Sharma. Congress has urged the government to make vaccine registration policy easier so that it can include all those who do not have mobile phones for Co-WIN registration. “People have faced great difficulty in getting registered for vaccination over mobile phones. Moreover, Covid deaths in Assam have increased manifold in the second wave,” the opposition party said. Congress has further demanded expansion of the frontline workers category to include taxi-drivers, rickshaw pullers, domestic helps, delivery boys, medicine shops and grocery shop workers, vegetable vendors, petrol pump workers and electricians for priority vaccination. “There has been great loss to working class people and small and medium businesses. The government must have an economic package for them,” Sharma said, further urging the government to have a more humanistic approach during Covid times. Congress also opposed the recent eviction drives in Sipajhar and Hojai and appealed to the government to make alternate rehabilitation arrangements for the landless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/congress-praises-assam-cm-for-crackdown-on-drug-peddlers-cow-smugglers/articleshow/83410104.cms||Kangkan Kalita

"This is really great, a tremendous sign of the rebirth of New York City," de Blasio said at a virtual briefing.  The fireworks will be launched from five barges in the East River starting at 9:25 pm on July 4, said Will Coss, executive producer of the show.  The show will be broadcast live on NBC as part of a two-hour special featuring the Black Pumas, Coldplay, OneRepublic and Reba McEntire, officials from Macy's and NBC said.  The big show was replaced by several small, unannounced fireworks displays last year in order to prevent crowds from gathering during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.  De Blasio said there will be dedicated areas for fully vaccinated people to enjoy this year's show, along with other areas for people who are not vaccinated or who want to join together with people who are not vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/macys-july-fourth-fireworks-show-will-be-back-this-year/articleshow/83413647.cms||---

All that’s just changed from June 7. Under the new unlock plan, shops selling essential and non-essential items are permitted to stay open till 4pm, however the latter will be open only on weekdays. So you can head out, browse around and pick up what you like, while making sure your face mask is on. With the lockdown rule being relaxed on the basis of COVID-19 positivity rate, it’s a welcome respite for city folks as they missed the buzz and vibrancy of the streets, stalls and shops that Mumbai is so known for. Buying themselves a comeback treatThe monsoon is here and that is topmost on people’s minds. Affirms Keerti Jha, Dadar-based marketing professional, “I love shopping and I missed that part of my life. Since shops are now open, I am making it a point to go buy a bright neon raincoat or umbrella for the rainy season. I am so glad I can do that as the weather is also perfect for a walk now.” With work-from-home (WFH) still the norm, stationery and electronic items are also topmost on most shoppers’ minds. Navin Verma, a corporate employee, says, “I have been wanting to buy a new portable coffee-maker and some headphones. I didn’t order them online as I believe these are things that one must personally check and buy. I plan to pay a visit to my store when it’s relatively empty. I also like to check out the new products on the shelves or the offers they have for shoppers.” Shops and stores opt for contactless paymentsSanitising, social distancing and digital payments will add to providing a safe environment to customers While click-and-order has become the norm in the past few months, people will have to let go of their digital shopping habit and head out to do some fun browsing and buying. Shopping establishments, on their part, are paying attention to COVID protocols and are hopeful of better times ahead. Hamza Kachwala, of a gift and household items store in Bandra, says, “We are now open from Monday to Friday till 4pm, but footfalls are low. It may take a little time for people to step out for shopping. On our part, the staff is vaccinated with some awaiting their slots as per their age group.” Darshit Shah, who works at a fabric store in Andheri, shares, “We don’t have that many walk-ins yet. The store is all ready, with sanitisation and other COVID preventive measures in place. Also, many of our staff members have got vaccinated.” Karunesh Bhatia, a vendor from South Mumbai, adds, “It will take time for people to switch back to their physical shopping habit, but we are hopeful that the situation will change. Contactless payments, social distancing will go a long way to build that.” FEW TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND BEFORE YOU GO SHOPPINGPicking up WFH stationery could be on the list  Shake out the make-up kit. If there’s anything that needs to be restocked, you could do so now  Perk up the home with a room aroma. Go find the fragrance you like and pick that  Add utility items to the culinary cupboard to help you speed up the ‘cooking from home’ process. Explore more plants for your home gardening hobby Pick up WFH stationery Buy local as markets are struggling everywhere, so help them get to their feet Be a safe shopper by opting for a double mask, carry a sanitiser and maintain social distance||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaikars-get-set-to-do-some-unlock-shopping/articleshow/83413053.cms||Ismat Tahseen
---||India||Covid-19: Deaths in 2nd wave cross 2 lakh at daily average of over 2,000||NEW DELHI: The official death toll in India's devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has crossed 2 lakh. Fatalities recorded since March 1 this year account for nearly three of every five deaths from the virus reported since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. India has reported more than 2.05 lakh deaths since March 1 (taken as the beginning of the second wave), which translates to an average of more than 2,000 deaths every day. Fatalities in the second wave are now nearly 57% of all Covid deaths in the country. India's cumulative death toll from Covid currently stands at 3,63,029. Globally, only Brazil, with nearly 2.25 lakh deaths, recorded a higher toll during this 102-day period. The toll in the US -- which cumulatively has the highest deaths at more than 6.1 lakh -- was 82,738 since March 1 (counting that day). While daily fatalities in India have been decreasing over the last three weeks or so, more than 16,300 earlier deaths have been added to the toll since the first week of May in data reconciliation exercises, with Maharashtra accounting for 11,583, Bihar 3,951 and Uttarakhand 779.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); In the last two days alone, as many as 5,873 old deaths were added, 3,951 by Bihar and the rest by Maharashtra. In comparison, the daily toll in these two days was 3,671. Reconciliation of old deaths in the overall tally is a welcome step towards more accuracy in reporting of numbers, say experts. The high number of previous deaths being reported from Maharashtra, and now Bihar, also points to the way the healthcare and reporting systems were overwhelmed by the second wave. In terms of cases, the second wave accounts for around 62% of all Covid infections recorded in India since the pandemic hit that country. The country has recorded more than 1.8 crore new cases since March 1, as against a total caseload of a little over 2.9 crore so far. Since March 1, India has recorded more cases of the coronavirus than the US (48.7 lakh) and Brazil (65.7 lakh) put together. On Thursday, the country reported around 91,870 fresh cases and 1,891 fatalities, not counting 1,522 previous fatalities added by Maharashtra. While there was a marginal dip in cases, the day's toll was the highest in four days. On Wednesday, India had recorded 93,993 fresh cases and 1,780 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-deaths-in-2nd-wave-cross-2-lakh-at-daily-average-of-over-2000/articleshow/83414459.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||World||Joe Biden, Boris Johnson strike warm tone in first meeting||CARBIS BAY: Striking a warm tone, President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson used their first meeting Thursday to highlight a commitment to strengthening their nations' historic ties while setting aside, at least publicly, their political and personal differences.  Beginning a week of diplomacy across the Atlantic, Biden hopes to use his first overseas trip as president to reassure European allies that the United States had shed the transactional tendencies of Donald Trump's term and is a reliable partner again. Long a believer in alliances, Biden stressed the deep bonds with the United Kingdom as a lynchpin of his call for Western democracies to compete against rising authoritarian states.  "We affirmed the special relationship -- it's not said lightly -- the special relationship between our people," Bide said after the meeting. "We renewed our pledge to defend the enduring democratic values that both of our nations share that are the strong foundation of our partnership."  Though thorny issues like Brexit and the future of Northern Ireland shadowed the meeting, Biden and Johnson began their sit-down by immediately striking a tone of conviviality as the news media watched.  "I told the prime minister we have something in common. We both married way above our station," Biden joked after a highly choreographed walk with their spouses.  Johnson laughed and said he was "not going to dissent from that one." But then he seemed to hint that he would be looking to only improve relations with his American counterpart.  "I'm not going to disagree with you on that," said Johnson, "or indeed on anything else."  But there are areas of friction. The president staunchly opposed Brexit, Britain's exit from the European Union that Johnson championed, and has expressed great concern over the future of Northern Ireland. Biden once called Johnson a "physical and emotional clone" of Trump.  The British government has worked hard to overcome that impression, stressing Johnson's common ground with Biden on climate change, support for international institutions and other issues. But Johnson, host for the Group of Seven summit opening Friday, has been frustrated by the lack of a new trade deal with the United States.  Johnson on Thursday, however, described the new U.S. administration as "a breath of fresh air."  Speaking after his first face-to-face meeting with Biden, Johnson said "it was a long, long huge session. We covered a good range of topics." He added that protecting the Northern Ireland peace agreement was "absolutely common ground" among Britain, the U.S. and the EU.  Before their formal discussions, the two men looked back on illustrious wartime predecessors, inspecting documents related to the Atlantic Charter. The declaration signed by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt in August 1941 set out common goals for the post-World War II world, including freer trade, disarmament and the right to self-determination of all people.  Reaffirming their nations' longstanding ties, the two men authorized an updated version of the charter, one that looks to the challenge posed by countries like China and Russia with its promises to promote free trade, human rights and a rules-based international order, and to counter "those who seek to undermine our alliances and institutions."  The new charter also took aim at "interference through disinformation" in elections and murky economic practices, charges that the West has levelled at Beijing and Moscow. The leaders also promised to build stronger global defenses against health threats on the eve of a summit where discussion of the coronavirus pandemic is expected to take center stage.  The leaders had planned to visit the spectacular island of St. Michael's Mount but the trip was scrapped because of bad weather. Instead, they met above the beach at the G-7 site in Carbis Bay, staring out at the ocean while trading pleasantries.  Both couples - Johnson is newly married - held hands as they walked. First lady Jill Biden's black jacket had "LOVE" embroidered on the upper back - a fashion move that recalled her predecessor Melania Trump's decision to wear a jacket with "I Really Don't Care, Do U?" written on the back during a 2018 trip to a Texas border town.  The leaders also announced a new US-UK task force to work on resuming travel between their countries. Most such travel has been banned since March 2020.  Both sides have stressed publicly that the meeting would be about strengthening ties between longtime allies in a week in which Biden will look to rally the West to rebuff Russian meddling and publicly demonstrate it can compete economically with China.  Biden, who is fiercely proud of his Irish roots, has warned that nothing should undermine Northern Ireland's 1998 Good Friday peace accord. Some on the British side have viewed Biden warily because of his heritage. White House officials have said the United States does not plan to be involved in the negotiations.  After Brexit, a new arrangement was needed for the border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, because the European Union requires certain goods to be inspected and others not to be admitted at all. Ahead of a June 30 deadline, ongoing negotiations over goods - including sausages - have been contentious and have attracted the attention of the White House.  One-on-one talks between Biden and Johnson lasted about 10 minutes before advisers joined for a larger meeting that lasted about an hour, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. The leaders also discussed climate change, the pandemic, creating an infrastructure financing program for developing countries and Afghanistan, and launch a bilateral commission to research and defeat cancer.  But Trump's presence was still felt on Thursday. Johnson and Trump, for a time, appeared to be kindred spirits, both riding a wave of populism that in 2016 delivered Brexit and upended the American political landscape.  Biden, for his part, has expressed a mistrust of Johnson, who once unspooled a Trump-like insult of President Barack Obama, saying that Biden's former boss was "half-Kenyan" and had an ancestral dislike of Britain.  Since World War II, the trans-Atlantic "special relationship" has been sustained by a common language, shared interests, military cooperation and cultural affection.  Brexit has tested those bonds. But Biden has made clear that he intends to rebuild bridges with the EU, a frequent target of Trump's ire. That suggests Berlin, Brussels and Paris, rather than London, will be uppermost in his thoughts.  Britain hoped to secure a quick trade agreement with the U.S. after its official departure from the EU in January. The change in administration in Washington leaves prospects of a deal uncertain.  And there may be one more, though admittedly small, obstacle to nurturing the "special relationship" - the very phrase itself.  Johnson has said he did not appreciate "special relationship," used by the U.S. president, because to the prime minister it seemed needy and weak. Johnson's spokesperson said this week: "The prime minister is on the record previously saying he prefers not to use the phrase, but that in no way detracts from the importance with which we regard our relationship with the US, our closest ally."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-biden-boris-johnson-strike-warm-tone-in-first-meeting/articleshow/83414789.cms||---

Ayaansh Gupta got a shot of the US-manufactured drug Zolgensma, thanks to 62,450 people contributing Rs 14.84 crore through a crowdfunding site. The remaining Rs 1.2 crore came from an international crowdfunding initiative and his family The Union government waived import duty of Rs 6 crore, without which the drug would have cost Rs 22 crore. Children suffering from SMA type 1 rarely make it beyond two years of age without medical intervention. “SMA is a progressive neuromuscular disease caused due to a defect in the SMN1 gene. Affected children show muscle weakness, involving upper and lower limbs initially, but overtime develop breathing and swallowing difficulty,” said Dr Ramesh Konanki, paediatric neurologist at Rainbow Children’s Hospital. “Zolgensma is the single-dose intravenous injection of gene therapy, in which the defective SMN1 gene is replaced through adenoviral vector. Ayaansh is doing fine and will be under observation for a day.” Ayaansh’s case had caught the attention of Bollywood celebrities and cricketers, with many of them donating to the fund and spreading the word. “It is heartening to witness the power of crowdfunding.

Yogi, who met Amit Shah on Thursday, is scheduled to meet PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief J P Nadda on Saturday as part of an exercise which might involve expansion of the UP government and increased representation for the state in the Union council of ministers when it is expanded. Anupriya Patel, leader of BJP ally Apna Dal, joined Shah and Yogi for the deliberations at the home minister's residence, intensifying the buzz about a likely reconfiguration of ministries in Lucknow and at the Centre. Patel, a junior minister in the first Modi government, failed to find a place in the PM's second team. Apna Dal, a party which has OBC Kurmis as its mainstay, has been keen on her return as well as enhanced representation in the state government. BJP, sources in the party said, has decided to stick with with Adityanath. Yet, his arrival in the national Capital once again reignited speculation about an imminent leadership change in UP, perplexing the party brass.

Thought is also being given to how far the Ram temple in Ayodhya can go in papering over the caste fault lines, particularly the discontent amongSenior saffron figures are intrigued by the persistence of the buzz about the possibility of Adityanath being asked to make way for a colleague even when the leadership has sent out signals ruling out any change. BJP general secretary in charge of organisation B L Santhosh had earlier praised the Adityanath government for tacking the second wave of Covid infections, in what was seen as a clear signal to opponents outside and dissidents within about the leadership’s intent. The statement came against the backdrop of intense talk in certain quarters about an “imminent” change. While that should have, in ordinary circumstances, quelled the chatter, suggestion that a change was in the offing persisted.

BJP seeks to invoke national pride andSignificantly, Modi, while addressing health workers in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi, had highlighted Adityanath’s success in taming encephalitis, endemic to eastern UP and the bordering regions of Bihar and Nepal, as an example of what could be achieved by a leadership which is cleareyed and focused on objectives. Sources also said irrespective of how Adityanath was rated, the proximity of polls negated the chance of somebody being put at the helm now. “Only six months are left for the poll drill to begin. The party has to focus on planning the roadmap. Rumours about leadership change are baseless,” a senior BJP functionary told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/buzz-of-rejig-in-lucknow-delhi-as-yogi-meets-amit-shah/articleshow/83415490.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||World||Senators eye $579 billion in new infrastructure spending, $1 trillion plan||WASHINGTON: A bipartisan group of senators is eyeing an infrastructure deal with $579 billion in new spending as part of a $1 trillion package. It could be rolled out as soon as Thursday as negotiators try to strike a deal on President Joe Biden's top priority, according to those briefed on the plan.  The 10 senators have been huddling behind closed doors, encouraged by Biden to keep working on the effort after he walked away from a Republican-only proposal this week unable to resolve differences. The senators are briefing their colleagues privately and cautioned changes could still be made.  "We got a piece of paper with every line and a total," Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, told reporters at the Capitol. He declined to provide further details. "Can be adjusted and changed? Sure."  The president and Congress have been straining to reach an agreement on his ideas for an infrastructure investment, stuck over the scope of the package of road, highway and other projects and how to pay for it.  At that size, the new package spread over five years would be more than the previous Republican-only effort of $330 billion in new spending in a $928 billion package, but still short of the $1.7 trillion over eight years Biden is seeking. It appears the group is running into the same problems that Biden and lead Republican negotiator Sen. Shelley Moore Capito confronted in agreeing on how to pay for it.  Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a lead negotiator, would not disclose the final tab. Asked if the new spending was at $600 billion, he said "the president said that was his goal. So I don't think anybody felt like they had to exceed his goal."  Another member of the group, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said they are "fairly close" on a topline amount, but are still debating how to pay for it. One option is to include potential revenue from uncollected income taxes, he said.  "We still have to talk," Tester said.  One Republican not in the group, Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, said he was told the package would provide nearly $1 trillion - including $579 billion in new spending over the baseline for transportation projects.  Braun also said parts of it would be paid for with untapped Covid-19 relief funds, which has been a nonstarter for the White House.  "They have come up with similar to what I think Capito was working on, but my understanding is it would be a little more money," he said.  Biden tasked the senators to keep working as he set out for his first overseas trip after talks collapsed this week with Capito and the GOP senators.  The president is seeking a sweeping investment in not just roads, highways and bridges but also broadband, electric vehicle charging stations and other aspects of what he views as the new economy, all paid for with a hike in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.  Republicans prefer a more narrow focus on fixing existing transportation systems, with more modest investments elsewhere. They oppose any tax hikes to pay for the new spending.  With the Senate narrowly split, 50-50, and most legislation requiring 60 votes to advance past a filibuster, Biden is seeking a bipartisan agreement to ensure passage. At the same time, he is also instructing Democrats who control the House and Senate to prepare to pass portions of the package on their own, under special budget rules that enable approval with 51 votes in the Senate.  In the evenly-divided Senate, Vice President Kamala Harris serves as a tie-breaking vote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/senators-eye-579-billion-in-new-infrastructure-spending-1-trillion-plan/articleshow/83415768.cms||---

Sarma expressed his willingness to work with Muslim organizations to educate Muslim women on the necessity for population control to eradicate poverty and encroachment of land and ease the pressure on land. “We want to work with the minority Muslim community to control the population explosion. Social menaces like poverty and land encroachment have their roots in the population explosion. We can solve several social problems if the immigrant Muslims can adopt decent family norms…this is my appeal to them,” he added. He further said, “With increase in population, there will be problem of living space, which in turn will give rise to clashes. It will be too much of expectation from a democratically elected government to allow people to settle on temple and forest land.” Sarma’s resolve to address the population boom among immigrant Muslims has come after several Muslim organizations and people’s representative have criticised the government for series of drives across the state in last few days to evict encroachers on temple and forest land. The government has cleared 180 bighas of land belonging to a Naraksur (Mahabharata) period Shiv temple at Sipajhar from illegal settlers, 2005 bigha of forest land at Kaki Taralangso in Hojai district, Sootea and Karimganj in the last one week. Barring a miniscule 2% of Assam’s Muslim population, the rest are immigrant Muslims from Bangladesh, who are Bengali-speaking. The state’s Muslim population constitutes nearly 35% of the 3.13 corer population of the state and they are in majority in as many 35 of 126 assembly seats. BJP fought the last assembly election on promises to protect land, culture and identity of the indigenous communities of Assam from them. “No one is our enemy. The government is the guardian of every poor man and we want their development. But we need community support. They (immigrant Mulsims) have to come forward. Protests will not end their poverty. To end their poverty, we have to educate Muslim women, work on population control… poverty will never be reduced unless they control their population,” Sarma said. He referred to an unnamed assembly constituency where the number of voters have increased by over 25,000 in just five years. “I understand the problem on other side. The way population explosion is taking place, they also need living space. Instead of criticizing the government, they should try to practice small family size. Tribals practice it and have never encroached upon forest lands, rather they have conserved forests and built new ones,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/amid-evictions-himanta-asks-muslims-to-control-population/articleshow/83415779.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||World||Florida bans 'critical race theory' from its classrooms||TALLAHASSEE: Florida's state Board of Education banned "critical race theory" from public school classrooms Thursday, adopting new rules it said would shield schoolchildren from curricula that could "distort historical events."  Florida's move was widely expected as a national debate intensifies about how race should be used as a lens in classrooms to examine the country's tumultuous history.  Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appeared by video at the top of the board's meeting, urging its members, many of whom he appointed, to adopt the new measures he asserted would serve students with the facts rather than "trying to indoctrinate them with ideology."  The Black Lives Matter movement has helped bring contentious discussions about race to the forefront of American discourse, and classrooms have become a battleground. Supporters contend that federal law has preserved the unequal treatment of people on the basis of race and that the country was founded on the theft of land and labor.  Opponents of critical race theory say schoolchildren should not be taught that America is fundamentally racist. Governors and legislatures in Republican-led states around the country are considering or have signed into law bills that would limit how teachers can frame American history.  Both sides accuse the other of politicizing classroom instruction and violating the free speech rights of countless people by limiting the allowable points of view.  Florida law already requires schools to provide instruction on a host of fundamentals, including the Declaration of Independence, the Holocaust and African American history, but the topics have often been muddled. Current events, including the killings of Black people by police, have intensified debates.  Some have called for a "faithful" interpretation of U.S. history that honors the founding of the country - as a rebellion against oppressive British rule. But some Americans - particularly Blacks, Native Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans - argue that dissenting perspectives are often missing from text books and classroom discussions.  The new rules say classroom instruction "must be factual and objective, and may not suppress or distort significant historical events." It goes on to mention the Holocaust, slavery and the Civil War, as well as the civil rights movement and the contributions of Blacks, Hispanics and women to the country.  But it also makes specific mention of "theories that distort historical events" that are inconsistent with board policy, including any teaching that denies the Holocaust or espouses critical race theory, which the new rules say asserts "that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons."  During his brief appearance Thursday, DeSantis called it "outrageous" how some instructors are deviating from what he and others consider the fundamentals of history.  "Some of this stuff is, I think, really toxic," DeSantis told the school board. "I think it's going to cause a lot of divisions. I think it'll cause people to think of themselves more as a member of particular race based on skin color, rather than based on the content of their character and based on their hard work and what they're trying to accomplish in life."  The Florida Education Association had called on the board to reject the proposal.  The association, which represents teachers across Florida, called on the board to strip away inflammatory language from the proposed rules. A particular sore point was the use of "indoctrinate" in the rule, which the union says presents an overly negative view of classroom instruction. That word, however, remained in the rules adopted by the board.  "The job of educators is to challenge students with facts and allow them to question and think critically about information, and that's the antithesis of indoctrination," Cathy Boehme, a public policy advocate for the association, told the board. "No matter our color, background or ZIP Code, we want our kids to have an education that imparts honesty about who we are, integrity and how we treat others, and courage to do what's right."  More than two dozen members of the public spoke on the matter, their opinions divided and impassioned. The board meeting, held at a state college in Jacksonville, was briefly recessed when one speaker went over his time limit and began chanting in support of teachers.  One woman implored the board to reject the new rules, saying it was important for children to learn about how the legacies of slavery, segregation and Jim Crow still "created an uneven playing field for Black people."  Others spoke about how an individual's interpretation of history could reflect personal agendas and biases that could lead to the proselytization of children.  The new rules also forbids use of the 1619 Project, a classroom program spawned by a New York Times project that focuses on teaching about slavery and African American history. The project's name refers to the year popularly believed to be when slaves were first brought to colonial America.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/florida-bans-critical-race-theory-from-its-classrooms/articleshow/83416417.cms||---
---||India||1,000:854: Women get left behind in Covid-19 vaccination drive||NEW DELHI: For every 1,000 men vaccinated in India so far, only 854 women have received the shot. This gender skew could have been attributed to there being fewer women than men in the adult population. However, the skew in vaccination in most states is much worse than in the adult population. Kerala and Chhattisgarh are the only states where more women than men have been vaccinated. In Chhattisgarh, the sex ratio of the adult population is 1,013 women for every 1,000 men, but in the vaccinated population, the proportion of women is even higher — 1,045 women for every 1,000 men. Though Kerala has the highest proportion of women in the vaccinated population (52.2% or 1,087 for every 1,000 men), this is less than the sex ratio of adult population, which is 1,126. Women’s lack of agency, inability in many cases to book a slot on CoWin on their own and lack of independent mobility are important reasons that could explain this skew. But there seem to be other factors too. In states with high vaccination coverage, for instance, the gender skew among the vaccinated is much lower. In Himachal Pradesh, women are almost 50% of those vaccinated. It also has the highest vaccination coverage in the country of over 38% of adult population. In Rajasthan, where the coverage is almost 30%, women constitute almost 48% of those vaccinated despite the state having an adult sex ratio of 906. That low vaccination coverage could mean a higher gender skew is borne out by states such as UP, Punjab, Bihar and West Bengal. In UP, where only 12% of the adult population has been vaccinated, though the adult sex ratio is 936, among the vaccinated it’s just 746. Similarly, in Bihar where only 13% of the adult population has been covered, the sex ratio among those vaccinated is 810 in a state with an adult sex ratio of 923. As coverage approaches 100%, the skew will more accurately reflect the gender imbalance in the adult population. One of the exceptions to the pattern is Jammu & Kashmir, where 32% of the adult population has been given a shot and yet there are just 711 women vaccinated for every 1,000 men. The UT’s adult sex ratio of 913 is much better. The explanation is perhaps a substantial chunk of the vaccinated would be security forces, almost all men. The next lowest sex ratio in the vaccinated is in Delhi, where women were just 42% of those vaccinated or just 722 for every 1,000 men. This illustrates a different pattern — a pronounced gender skew in almost all big cities, probably for the presence of a large population of male migrant labour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1000854-women-get-left-behind-in-covid-19-vaccination-drive/articleshow/83416191.cms||---

US President Joe Biden, who is in the UK for the Group of Seven Summit, met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday.  This comes as calls to investigate further the origins of Covid-19 have intensified.  The origin of coronavirus that causes Covid-19 has remained a mystery even after over 1.5 years the first case of infection was reported in the Wuhan city of China.  Now, scientists and countries calling for further investigations to figure out whether the virus originated naturally or leaked from a lab in Wuhan.  "We will also support a timely, transparent and evidence-based independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened Covid-19 origins study, including in China, and for investigating outbreaks of unknown origin in the future," a joint statement issued after two leaders talked, read.  According to the joint statement, Biden and Johnson set out a global vision in a new Atlantic Charter to deepen cooperation in democracy and human rights, defence and security, science and innovation, and economic prosperity, with renewed joint efforts to tackle the challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity loss, and emerging health threats.  In a joint statement, Boris Johnson and Biden said they are determined to work together to overcome the current pandemic, which has reversed progress on improving the human condition, and to be better prepared in the future.  Reflecting US and UK shared strength in science and technology, the two leaders are committed to enhancing the cooperation on tackling variants of concern and emerging infectious disease threats with pandemic or epidemic potential.  "We will work together to help increase global vaccine supply through investments in manufacturing of safe and effective vaccines and the materials needed to produce them. We will promote the timely availability of vaccines, key components and equipment by encouraging bilateral trade and investment and avoiding export restrictions or other supply chain disruption," the statement read.  The joint statement noted that the UK and the US will work together and with like-minded member states to implement the WHO strengthening resolution adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2021.  Besides health, the two leaders held a discussion on a range of issues including, trade, climate, science, defence.  On defence, Boris and Biden agreed to work together to further strengthen and modernise NATO, and increase its common funding.  "We will work together to further strengthen and modernise NATO, and increase its common funding, so the Alliance can harness the full range of military and non-military capabilities to contest existing and new threats, including malicious cyber activity and attacks that test the resiliency of our societies," the statement read.  On climate change, the two leaders said they are committed to achieving an ambitious outcome at COP26 and to the collective developed country goal of mobilising USD 100 billion annually through to 2025 from a wide variety of public and private sources in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-us-back-timely-transparent-who-convened-covid-19-origins-study/articleshow/83417121.cms||---

---||India||Half of health & frontline staff still to get fully vaccinated||NEW DELHI: Only 56% of healthcare workers and less than 50% of frontline workers have been fully vaccinated so far and the coverage is worse in many states, the Centre said on Thursday while expressing concern over the poor coverage almost five months after the vaccination drive began on January 16. The Centre also highlighted the “less than adequate” participation of the private sector in the vaccination drive. Even as the Centre has earmarked 25% of vaccine stocks for private sector, it accounted for 4% of the total 42,279 vaccination sessions on Thursday. Times ViewOne of the basic norms of mass vaccination across the world is that health and frontline workers should be the first to be inoculated. The gap, though partly caused by their own initial hesitancy, is alarming. Nonetheless, the state should vaccinate them on a priority basis since they work tirelessly every day in a high-risk environment.Vaccination issues were highlighted by health secretary Rajesh Bhushan in a review meeting with states on Thursday. In 18 states, including Punjab, Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi and Assam, the full vaccination coverage among healthworkers was lower than the national average. Similarly, 19 states, including Bihar, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Punjab, have covered less than 47% (national average) of frontline workers with the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/half-of-health-frontline-staff-still-to-get-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/83416835.cms||Sushmi Dey

While Moily asserted that the party needs to undergo a “major surgery” and not depend just on legacy, Sibal said, “Congress must become the grand old party that it was. For that we need reforms.”  Moily asserted that the top leadership must give primacy to ideological commitment while assigning responsibility to leaders. Alleging that Prasada had placed “personal ambition” over everything else, he said the Uttar Pradesh leader’s ideological commitment was suspect from the beginning and the party winning zero seats in West Bengal under his charge showed that he was incompetent.

The panel submitted its report on Thursday. The committee, chaired by Mallikarjun Kharge and comprising party general secretary in charge of Punjab Harish Rawat and J P Aggarwal, after hearing elected representatives and organisational functionaries, is learnt to have concluded that the party has issues of management, personal aspirations and individual grievances, but with no challenge to the leadership of CM Amarinder Singh. Navjot Sidhu, who has emerged as the principal dissident in the Punjab unit, has to be adjusted in the state, the panel is reported to have recommended. Sidhu had resigned as minister earlier but has since been keen for a comeback. Congress firefighters want Sidhu to be made deputy CM and a resolution had appeared imminent earlier this year, before the cricketer-turned-politician again started making public comments against the CM. While sources claimed that the panel has not made any specific suggestion on the issue, the expectation is that the party may go for multiple deputy chief ministers with the idea of adjusting Sidhu, besides a Dalit and a Hindu leader for social balancing. While it is learnt that Sidhu is keen to become the state unit president, replacing Sunil Jakhar, CM Singh is reported to be against that.  While individual members had attacked the CM over issues of accessibility, work done in constituencies and the sensitive issue of sacrilege, the panel appears to have taken a considered note of the three-hour presentation given by the CM in which he clarified the issues while also rebutting some of the charges. He also told the panel that the Bagrari sacrilege issue had been entrusted to an SIT with a deadline of six months while assuring that the probe would be taken to its logical conclusion. He also strongly rebutted charges of being soft on the Badal family of Akali Dal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-panel-on-punjab-suggests-rejig-to-accommodate-key-netas/articleshow/83418524.cms||---

The breakthrough came when a TTE Sunil Paswan was checking passengers’ tickets at Kanpur Central railway station on Wednesday night and nabbed a person from platform no: 2 where he was found moving around suspiciously with a railway identity card worn around his neck. “On being questioned, the man identified himself as a trainee railway staff Dinesh Kumar Gautam, who has been asked by authorities to note down the number of coaches of the trains,” said Circle Officer GRP Qamrul Hasan on Thursday. “During further rounds of questioning, Gautam apprised GRP that besides him there are many others who are undergoing training for various posts at the Kanpur Central railway station. He told investigators, some had been assigned a job of TC (ticket collector), while some others were given a task of noting down the number of coaches of trains, besides few others were working as porters,” he said. “Following inputs provided by the suspect, police nabbed 15 others from various locations in the city along with fake railway IDs and joining letters. On verification, it was found that IDs and joining letters were fake and they were not authorised for any kind of job at Kanpur Central railway station,” said the official further. “During interrogation, it was found that one Rudra Pratap Thakur of Panki had given them fake appointment letters of TC and porters at the Kanpur Central railway station. Thakur during the raid was found to be absconding. Search of the houses of the arrested persons has led to recovery of some documents, ID cards, etc,” a GRP official said. A case under various sections of IPC for impersonating as a railway employee, criminal conspiracy and forgery, etc., has been lodged and further investigation is underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/16-arrested-for-possessing-fake-railway-id-cards/articleshow/83413104.cms||---

According to a May, 2021 report of consulting firm RedSeer, Indian female innerwear market stands at $6-$7 billion as of CY20 which is 9% of the overall apparel market. About 30% of the market is driven by the metro cities. It estimates the online female innerwear market to reach around $11-$12 billion by 2025. Enamor’s online share of the business has grown to the tune of 4-5x as of May, 2021 on a year-on-year basis. “Ours is a premium brand, hence, we get most of the business from tier 1 cities. However, demand is now driven by most people adopting work from home (which includes those who returned back to their homes in tier-2 and 3 cities) which has contributed to the rise in home wear and lingerie sales. However, the fashion wear and occasion wear categories are dull, since people no longer take vacations and have celebrations,” Enamor CEO Shekhar Tewari said. Enamor’s core lingerie business has increased to 25% of total business, as against 5% a year ago on the back of online sales. This despite the fact that the price of cotton has gone up by 30%-40% in the last 7-8 months. Online lingerie store Clovia says despite muted growth seen in its 250 offline stores, sales of innerwear and ancillaries have grown by 90%-95% between October 2020 to May 2021.  “The demand from non-metro cities have grown substantially in the last few months and we have gone from selling one piece of brassier per second in May 2020 to selling four pieces of brassieres per second in May 2021,” said Clovia CEO Pankaj Verman. Its monthly sales stand between 6.5 lakh and 7 lakh pieces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/demand-from-smaller-cities-pushes-lingerie-sales/articleshow/83214858.cms||Mamtha Asokan

Similarly, Madhubani will have its ethanol plant at Lohat with the same production capacity,” the minister said. Shahnawaz said this in his assurance to the two BJP MLAs from the region Murari Mohan Jha from Kewati and Hari Bhushan Thakur from Bisfi, as well as MLC Ghanshyam Thakur and state BJP Mahila Morcha president Lajwanti Jha. They had called on the minister and met him at Udyog Bhavan to apprise him of their demands regarding industrial development of the Mithila region. Their demands included ethanol plants, Mithila Haat and improvement of the conditions of weavers. Shahnawaz said that PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar were concerned about development of the region. It had already got its airport at Darbhanga, as a result of which investors had started showing interest in the area.

Police have denied that the victims were stripped and on Thursday arrested both the accused after a first information (FIR) was lodged under stringent sections.

Of the 89 accredited colleges in the state, only six have been awarded ‘A’ grade by the council. There are altogether 262 constituent colleges under 13 conventional universities, but even the popular ones like Patna College, Patna Science College, Patna Law College and Gaya College have failed to make a mark so far as NAAC grades are concerned. While Patna College, the oldest institution of higher education in the state, has received ‘C’ grade, Patna Science College and Gaya College have been awarded ‘B’ grade. However, they continue to draw maximum crowds at the time of admissions. According to the new regulations of the University Grants Commission, all the institutions with less than the mandatory 2.5 score may soon face closure. Talking to this reporter, Patna University teacher Ranbir Nandan claimed that the criteria adopted by the NAAC in assessing an institution of higher education were not foolproof and purposeful. “Although most institutions are performing well in academics, they fail to achieve the desired result due to the lack of infrastructure. Our students are making great strides in different fields at national and international levels. They qualify for competitive examinations every year and their overall performance is far better than the students from other states,” Nandan said. He also suggested that the NAAC accreditation system needed drastic changes so that the institutions were not demoralized. “Despite several constraints, these colleges train their students in the best possible manner,” he said, adding that the aim of the grading system should be reformative and not punitive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/academic-pleads-for-overhaul-of-naac-accreditation-system/articleshow/83408204.cms||B K Mishra

During an inspection of the ISBT on Thursday, Kishor said, “After the Mithapur stand is shut, all the buses, which used to operate from there, will run from the ISBT.” Recently, it was decided that all buses would operate from the ISBT, instead of the Mithapur stand, from July 15. Expressing displeasure over the slow pace of work at the ISBT, Kishor claimed that no slackness would be tolerated. He asked the executive officer of the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited to issue a show-cause notice to the contractor and take legal action against him if he failed to complete the work on time. The principal secretary also instructed the officials concerned to make necessary arrangements for the operation of buses to Nalanda, Nawada, Sheikhpura and Jamui from June 15. “The basic infrastructure should be ready so that the passengers do not face any inconvenience,” he said. Later, Kishor also visited the Mithapur bus stand. The ISBT, which was inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar on September 18 last year, has four separate multi-storey blocks — A for arrival, B for departure, C that connects the first two, and D for commercial uses. These have been built at a cost of Rs 339 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/make-isbt-ready-by-june-30-udhd-principal-secretary/articleshow/83408078.cms||---

Delivering the 19th S N Sinha Memorial Lecture on ‘Curb the Cause to Cure Covid’ organized by A N College on a digital platform, Satyam pointed out that the virus, if not detected at an early stage, could affect different organs of the body and ultimately lead to a patient’s death. “You should, therefore, get yourself inoculated because vaccination alone can protect you from the virus. You should also follow the safety protocols strictly,” he said, adding that some Covid variants should be watched closely and studied in greater detail.

Pandey said, “Bihar received the mobile vans from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that has been lending its support to the state ever since the beginning of the Covid crisis.” He added, “With a capacity to collect 1,000 samples a day, these vans will help the government keep tabs on the number of Covid cases in rural areas and send the reports to the beneficiaries on their cellphones within 24 hours.” Earlier, chief minister Nitish Kumar had flagged off five similar vans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-minister-flags-off-mobile-rt-pcr-vans/articleshow/83408880.cms||---

FADA, is requesting “all those OEMs which have still not announced any financial assistance to do it urgently,” he added..Vehicle retails for the month of May hit a skid row falling by nearly 55% month on month and over 70% when compared to May 2019. Two wheelers, three wheelers, passenger vehicles, tractors and commercial vehicles each fell by 53%, 76%, 59%, 57% and 66% respectively. “The first 9 days of June saw a better start than expected due to pent up demand and at this pace June’21 may result in almost equivalent sales when compared to June’20,” said Gulati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/auto-dealers-seek-financial-support-as-sales-skid/articleshow/83413004.cms||---
---||Business||Tatas to buy 51% in 1MG for $230mn||Mumbai: India’s largest conglomerate Tata Group will acquire a majority stake in e-pharmacy retailer 1MG, broadening its presence in the medical economy. Not too long ago, the conglomerate used to be in the pharma manufacturing business. But then it sold Merind and Tata Pharma to Wockhardt, restricting its play in the health industry. After the outbreak of Covid, the $106-billion conglomerate reignited its interest in the industry with a vision to build a digital, patient-centric ecosystem. The proposed 1MG acquisition is in that direction and follows its purchase of teleconferencing software (used in offering virtual health consultations) from AccessBell, a startup based in Silicon Valley. The conglomerate through Tata Digital will acquire over 51% in 1MG for an enterprise value of over $230 million. The deal will peg the total value of 1MG at $450 million. Tata Digital had already infused about $14 million in 1MG in the form of convertible debenture instruments. These instruments, when converted into equity shares, will give Tata Digital about 6% in 1MG. 1MG co-founder and CEO Prashant Tandon will continue to lead the company. The e-pharmacy retailer’s existing investors — Sequoia Capital and Omidyar Network — will exit the company in the fresh equity restructuring round. Other investors like International Finance Corporation and Redwood Global-Korea Omega will continue to retain interest in 1MG along with majority shareholder Tata Digital. Incorporated in 2015, 1MG made a loss of over Rs 300 crore on a revenue of Rs 369 crore in fiscal 2020. Apart from running an online medical store, 1MG offers teleconsultation and operates three diagnostics labs. Another Tata Group company Tata Medical and Diagnostics, which was launched during the 2020 pandemic and which markets Covid testing kits, already has a partnership with 1MG’s diagnostic labs. “The investment in 1MG is in line with Tata Group’s vision of creating a digital ecosystem...e-pharmacy, e-diagnostics and teleconsultation are critical segments in this ecosystem as the sector enabled access to healthcare through the pandemic,” said Tata Digital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-to-buy-51-in-1mg-for-230mn/articleshow/83414924.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||Higher debit bounces in May point to retail stress||Mumbai: Bounce rates of payments made under their standing instructions to banks last month have been the highest ever for the month of May in the last five years in value terms. According to data released by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), debit bounce rates for the National Automated Clearing House (NACH) in May 2021 stood at 30.7%. In terms of the number of transactions, 35% of the debit transactions bounced. Accountholders use a NACH mandate to give standing instruction for recurring payments like utility bills or repaying a loan’s equated monthly instalments (EMIs). If there is not enough money in the account, the standing instruction results in a ‘bounce’ similar to a cheque being returned without payment. The bounce rate for May 2021 (30.7%) by value is higher than even May 2020 (30.3%) when there was a similar lockdown following the pandemic. Sequentially too, the bounce rates have been going up since March 2021. NACH bounce rates are seen as early signs of stress among retail borrowers. The nationwide lockdown in the second wave of the pandemic is leaving people with less money in their bank accounts. While the bounce rates at nearly a third of total transactions appear very high, these are all not defaults as in most cases the borrower completes a transfer upon receiving an intimation from the bank.“While April ’21 debit bounce rates were lower than April ’20, we are surprised that May ’21 bounce rates (by value) have been higher than May ’20, albeit marginally as the lockdowns and restrictions imposed in May’20 were far more severe than last month. Sequentially, bounce rates were expected to go up in May ’21 due to increased lockdowns imposed in several states,” Macquarie Capital research analyst Suresh Ganapathy said in a research note. According to Ganapathy, NBFCs have seen a 10-15% dip in collection efficiencies and that could have impacted the May ’21 numbers. “Our conversations with managements of top banks indicate that collection efficiencies have been holding up well even for May ’21. HDFC Bank, in our recently hosted conference call, also indicated that May ’21 bounce rates have normalised compared to what was seen in April ’21,” said Ganapathy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/higher-debit-bounces-in-may-point-to-retail-stress/articleshow/83414701.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata complexes plan upgrade to plug security loopholes||KOLKATA: The shootout at Shukhobrishti Complex on Wednesday has exposed several chinks in the security arrangements of housing complexes across the city, some of which have bolstered and modernized their plans over the last few years. Prominent condominiums, like Urbana and South City, have upgraded security measures and keep in touch with local police stations to screen residents and visitors for the last few years. At South City, the steps followed a spate of suicides while at Urbana, Gujarat Police had tracked a financial offender in 2018. However, several complexes in New Town are yet to implement stringent screening apart from just informing the local cops whenever a new tenant comes in. Some of these complexes are now contemplating a security upgrade. Director of Urbana Facility Management Debjani Mookherjee told TOI, “If somebody wants to rent out a flat, the authority asks for two local references who can be traced, apart from the KYC and other details. We get the KYC stamped by the cops and keep in touch with the references.” The president of South City Apartment Owners’ Association, Manak Daga, said the property consultant firm JLL looks after facilities there. But if a flat is to be rented out, a board formed by the owners screens the tenants after informing the local cops. Daga said the association will meet on Friday to consider stepping up the security. The managing director of JLL (east) Surekha Bihani, which manages facilities of complexes, like Uniworld and DLF (Action Area III), apart from South City, said they take declarations from owners and tenants and submit the KYC to the police station. “We issue security passes for tenants which have to be shown during entry,” she said. The president of New Town Heights Apartment Owners’ Association, N Mandal, said they are planning to follow the South City model of setting up an interview panel to screen tenants. Secretary of Kolkata Uniworld City Apartment Owners’ Association Anjan Sen said they have a standard form for tenants that has to be submitted to the police station. “But in most cases, the owner does not know who the tenant is.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-complexes-plan-upgrade-to-plug-security-loopholes/articleshow/83412389.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

Born on August 8, 1896, in Sylhet district (now in Bangladesh), Swami Shivanand has been living in Varanasi’s Bhelupur area since 1979. On Wednesday, the centenarian seer sprung a surprise when he arrived at Durgakund urban primary health centre vaccination centre to take the jab. Health officials believe he could be the oldest citizen to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Centre in charge, Dr Sarika Rai, confirmed the seer’s age from his Aadhaar card. His enthusiasm was contagious for his age, she said. “We have multiple documents, including passport to prove he’s 125 years old. Some years ago, he was examined by a team of Kolkata doctors and they couldn’t believe he was so fit for his age. He believes in simple living and leads by example,” his disciple (since 1993) Dr Subhash Chandra Garai, medical officer of a multi-national company told TOI. Hospital staff interacted with Swami Shivanand, while he was under observation post-vaccination. Many were surprised to know he consumes only boiled food, practices yoga and leads a disciplined life. “When he was leaving, we asked him how was he feeling and he said he felt energised. He also said, people fear the vaccine for no reason. Everyone must take the jab,” recalled a health worker. Earlier, a 109-year-old Ram Dulaiya of Veerpur village in Jalaun was considered the seniormost citizen to be immunised. The elderly woman has taken both doses – first on March 18 and the second on April 20. Her grandson, Ravindra, said his granny has become a role model for villagers. “Villagers cite her as an example to those who shy away from the jab,” said Ravindra, who is scheduled to take his shot next week. He informed that in his family of 13, nine except his grandmother were eligible for the vaccine. By next week, our entire family will be vaccinated,” he said. Experts said, there was a need for such role models to boost the vaccination programme. “Perception, fear of the unknown, misconceptions and misinformation affect everyone, but some take it too seriously. To convince them, role models come handy,” said an official. Health officials pointed out that UP has a vaccination target of 13.6 crore. Of these, 20,77,143 are 80 years of age or more. In Varanasi, the number of 80 plus persons is 3,86,36 lakh. Data from the Cowin portal updated till 7 pm indicated that over 2.19 vaccine doses have been administered in UP since the launch of the programme on January 16. At least 1.82 crore have received at least one dose of the vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/125-year-old-kashi-seer-takes-shot-oldest-to-get-vaccinated/articleshow/83415875.cms||Shailvee Sharda

In the hurry, PWD floated a tender for the works without undertaking a detailed study and estimate of the sewerage project in six sewage wards of Panaji. The tenders for the laying and commissioning of a sewerage network speak about laying new pipelines, but overlook the need for diversion of sewage while the work is underway. While the tender requires the contractor to lay new, parallel sewerage lines, the lack of space along the road would entail rehabilitation of the existing sewer network and manholes, including house connections, said sources. According to documents, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Lts and the State Level High Powered Committee (SLHPC) decided to hand over unspent funds to PWD in February. The SLHPC noted that the unspent amount “needs to be utilised, i.e. tendered/awarded before March 31, 2021, in order to ensure full utilization of AMRUT Mission funds.” IPSCDL, the nodal agency to implement AMRUT, estimates the cost for upgrading Panaji’s sewerage network and sewage pumping at Rs 120 crore of which Rs 108 crore will come from the AMRUT Mission and Rs 10.5 crore from the Smart City Mission. Based on the go ahead given by the government, PWD floated two tenders in April to lay a new sewage network in six sewage wards of Panaji, but without providing detailed estimates, digital designs, and drawings of other utility services. “We have opened technical bids on Wednesday and financial bids will be opened later. We have to see whether they are fitting the criteria. PWD has received six bids in total for the two tenders,” said executive engineer Nivruti Parsekar. “Many critical aspects are not considered in the broad estimates, like width of the roads in Panaji, underground utilities, existing sewage network, adjoining sewage scheme of Taleigao and EDC area. Traffic diversion and existing house connections will play a crucial role in the planning and execution of the project,” said an engineer. Take for example, Mala or the 18th June Road where the road width is 3 to 6 metres with existing sewer network in the centre, a storm water drain and several other utilities concealed under the road leaving no scope to lay any additional sewer line parallel to the existing one. The contractor will have to replace the existing sewer network. The tender also estimates that the project will be completed in 12 months, but this does not seem likely, said a PWD source. Panaji’s sewerage network is divided in 10 wards and has approximately 45km of pipelines and eight pumping stations. The network is close to 40 years old. The Taleigao sewerage project has been under construction since 2010. The 15 MLD STP at St Inez, which was completed in 2017, is running at mere 10% capacity as most parts have not been linked to the Taleigao STP at St Inez.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-hurry-to-use-funds-smart-city-pwd-take-up-work-without-study/articleshow/83414977.cms||Newton Sequeira

In the last five days, over 10,000 persons have been vaccinated in the joint drive started by the cops in collaboration with the civic body. The cops will extend vaccination drive to industrial labourers within the next few days. “The drive was aimed to help those who come in contact with many people daily. Over 10,000 have got their first dose in last five days,” said Shamsher Singh, city police commissioner. The police said that its focus is on vegetable vendors and auto drivers who come in contact with many people daily. From Wednesday, the police department also started drive to vaccinate industrial labourers. “We have started vaccinating labourers and other employees working in Makarpura GIDC with the help of Vadodara Chambers of Commerce and Industry,” Singh told TOI. The police said most of the citizens from this segment don’t have access to smartphones or they don’t know how to register online. The police help them in on-the-spot registration and vaccination. A committee of roadside vendors has been formed to keep an eye on those who flout the Covid protocols. If any vendor is found not wearing a face mask, his stall is closed for a day. “Apart from helping in vaccination, we are also spreading awareness in shopping complexes and urging the shop owners to follow all the Covid protocols,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-to-help-vaccinate-industrial-workers/articleshow/83410928.cms||---
---||Business||EasiLoan partners top housing financiers, digitises sanctions||Mumbai: EasiLoan, a fintech platform for home loan providers, developers and borrowers, has partnered lenders representing 70% of the home loan market. The company’s integration with lenders and developers enables borrowers to get a view of their eligibility. They will also know the interest rate across lenders based on their profile. This cuts weeks from the processing time. The company, which recently launched operations, is already sourcing 200-250 home loan applications a month and aims to scale this up to 700 by the end of the fiscal. EasiLoan is promoted by Pramod Kathuria, former regional head at ICICI Bank and who has worked with real estate and construction companies like Lodha, L&T Realty and GMR Group. Co-founder Vishal Dawda has over 15 years of experience in corporate finance and fundraising with Lodha Developers and Trustcap. According to Kathuria, the platform aims to address the pain points of all the constituents in the housing finance ecosystem, including borrowers, developers, direct selling agents, brokers and banks. However, it will charge a fee only to the banks and housing finance companies participating. Unlike some digital loan providers, EasiLoan is not into lending and only provides services through EasiLoan Techno Solutions. “Our present focus is largely on the primary market where the seller is the developer. One of the biggest pain points for a developer is the cash flow as they have a high cost of funds,” said Kathuria. Despite tying up with lenders, developers sometimes have to wait for as long as two months for the funds as borrowers do not always match up with the right lender. For the customer, this will be a unique marketplace where they can get a choice of offers for which they are already approved and get an in-principle approval digitally, said Kathuria. “‘EasiLoan Instant Match’ works as a selection and recommendation engine for providing the best offers to the customers. The customer profiles are pre-qualified, matched and processed, resulting in a high success rate and shorter turn-around times,” said Kathuria. What cuts the loan processing time is the fact that EasiLoan’s matchmaking engine uses the lender’s credit logic, bureau score and customer information so that the credit appraisal is done instantly using digitally available information. As the platform has an application programme interface integration with the banks, there is no additional form filling required from the borrower side. Besides providing home loans, the company uses its artificial intelligence-based loan-matching software to provide a takeover of home loans and top-up loans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/easiloan-partners-top-housing-financiers-digitises-sanctions/articleshow/83414587.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||RBI hikes fee banks pay for use of other lenders’ ATMs||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has hiked the interchange fee for ATMs to Rs 17 from Rs 15 effective January 2022. The interchange, which is the charge banks pay each other when their customers use ATMs of another lender, was last revised in 2012. While the Rs 17 fee will apply to withdrawals, for non-financial transactions the interchange will go up from Rs 5 to Rs 6. For customers, the ATM withdrawal charge will go to Rs 21 from Rs 20 if they exhaust their free transactions. Customers are eligible for five free transactions (inclusive of non-financial transactions) every month from their own bank ATMs. They are also eligible for three free transactions from other bank ATMs in metros (five in non-metro centres). “This will help us not only serve the customers better but also deploy additional ATMs, which are particularly needed in semi-urban and rural locations, to provide financial access and enable financial inclusion. It will also give much-needed relief to the ATM industry,” said Rustom Irani, MD & CEO, Hitachi Payment Services. The RBI said that the decision was taken given the increasing cost of ATM deployment and expenses towards ATM maintenance incurred by banks/ white label ATM operators, as also considering the need to balance expectations of stakeholder entities and customer convenience. The Confederation of ATM Industry said that the move will incentivise banks, management service providers and white label ATM operators to significantly increase ATM penetration in semi-urban and rural areas thereby boosting financial inclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-hikes-fee-banks-pay-for-use-of-other-lenders-atms/articleshow/83414639.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Why New Town: Floating population, quick deals offer anonymity||KOLKATA: A large floating population seeking short- to medium-term residency options, smart housing complexes with several hundred apartments that provide multiple amenities without being intrusive, owners residing elsewhere and keen to rent out flats, and a sprawling network of property agents and brokers — both offline and online — to facilitate hassle-free deals. These are the factors that could have prompted fugitive gangsters Jaipal Singh Bhullar and Jaspreet Singh Jassi to take shelter in a complex in New Town. At the Shukhobrishti Complex, which has several thousand apartments, property agents and brokers control the tenant-landlord transactions with the two key stakeholders not meeting each other in person. In the instance of the twin gangsters, someone else had entered into an agreement with the owner. Once the deal was done, the two gangsters moved in with the owner apparently oblivious about who had taken up residence. Their arrival did not cause any inquisitiveness among neighbours since residents are used to people from all over the country, particularly students and techies, shifting in and out all year round. “I have been staying in a rented flat for more than six months but I don’t know the owner. A broker had handed me the keys, arranged the agreement documents and took care of all formalities. I just pay my rent to a bank account provided by him. If I ever have any electrical, plumbing or any other problem, I ring up the broker and he helps me out,” said a second-year postgraduate student who lives in a B block flat. While the rent agreement contains only the student’s name, he shares the flat with two others. Among 12,000 flats in Shukhobrishti, more than 75% are rented out to tenants. The original owners either stay in another part of the city or live elsewhere. The keys to the units are usually entrusted with brokers, some of whom stay in the complex while others live in the nearby Patharghata village. Their contacts are listed with multiple shops and tea stalls just outside the complex or with maintenance staff within the complex to provide leads to potential tenants. “It becomes difficult for owners living elsewhere to come down to show the flats and carry out the transactions. Hence, we help them out. We also have a formatted rent agreement with us which the tenant has to fill up. We get it approved by the owner, either electronically or physically. Thereafter, copies of the agreement are deposited at the police station and the maintenance office,” said Sahabuddin Molla, a prominent broker in the area. Although the brokers claim they hand over the keys to tenants only after police verification, the fact remains that the copies of identity documents provided in case of the fugitives were fake. While the tenant’s name in the agreement and on the ID documents was Sumit Kumar, his real name is Bharat Kumar. It was also Bhullar and Jassi who had moved in, not Kumar. While most of the housing complexes in New Town have a high tenancy ratio with nearly 60% of the apartments rented out, there are broadly two reasons for renting out the apartments. While Kolkatans who had purchased flats in affordable complexes like Shukhobrishti rent out units for a steady income, non-resident Indians who have bought units in fancy condominiums rent them out to ensure the apartments are maintained. Both have their own set of challenges. While the relatively low rent at Shukhobrishti appeals to many, some flat owners make it a point to check out the tenant in person. That is possible because they usually live in Kolkata. On the other hand, in the luxury condos, owners rarely get to see the tenants first hand and the leasing or rental agreements are usually handled by high-end brokers or facility managers. However, a degree of due diligence is carried out at the premium apartments due to the involvement of professionals while in the budget apartments, local brokers are happy ensuring that the tenant simply submits the necessary documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/why-new-town-floating-population-quick-deals-offer-anonymity/articleshow/83412536.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

A study by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (Credai) found that construction activity — particularly in the affordable and mid-range segment — has been affected due to the exodus of migrant labourers and delays in approvals. The study, which was conducted between May 24 and June 3, found that 90% of builders surveyed in Goa have faced a labour shortage ever since the second Covid-19 wave swept the state. For customers, this would mean further delay in moving into their homesthat they booked before the pandemic. Easing BlocksThe study shows that 97% of the builders registered with Credai expect their projects to be “further delayed due to the onset of the second wave” in Goa. “In case of real estate, even after the lockdown is lifted, it will take months to mobilise labour and material. Though states have exempted construction activity from the lockdown, labourers are moving back to their villages as there is a big surge in infections across major cities,” the report said. Credai says that the real estate sector was already bearing a cascading effect of the first wave as the disrupted supply chain had barely started to recover, and now, with states imposing fresh lockdowns and curfews, the supply chain will continue to stay affected. Normalcy, said Credai’s report, could take six to nine months to return. The association’s analysis also spells bad news for those who wanted to buy a new home as the market has seen construction cost increase anywhere between 10% to more than 20%. Prices of cement, steel, labour and other supplies have become expensive. Among the builders surveyed, 48% said construction cost has increased by 10-20% on account of rising material and labour cost, while 45% said that real estate costs had increased by more than 20%. All these factors are expected to take a toll on real estate transactions and project timelines going forward. Goa’s real estate market is expected to remain stagnant for several quarters as homebuyers take a more cautious approach and turn risk averse. The fear of job losses and loss of an earning member will deter high-value purchases such as a new home. Goa’s real estate firms have already noticed that customer inquiries and walk-ins have reduced by more than 75% since the onset of the second wave. Along with this, 97% of the builders also said that customers have either stopped paying or are delaying payments, a strong indication that the pandemic has affected people’s finances. However, those customers who have taken credit from housing finance companies provide some relief as 41% of the builders said that they have no problem in sanction or disbursement of customer home loans. With cash flows affected, workers returning home and projects deliveries delayed, property developers face financial challenges. Credai said that 62% of their members are struggling to service their existing loans. While most of the real estate projects were operating at less than 75% of the capacity, 38% of the real estate firms said they are operating at less than 25% of their capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-2nd-wave-delaying-projects-making-housing-expensive-credai/articleshow/83414846.cms||Newton Sequeira

Of these achievers, 19 are girls. An announcement in this regard was made by the state minority welfare minister, Mohd Zama Khan, during a press meet at the Haj Bhavan on Thursday. He congratulated all the achievers. “Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar has always cared for the minorities. All the students, who are facing difficulty in preparing for administrative examinations due to financial constraints, can reach us,” the minister said. The free coaching service at the Haj Bhavan began in 2010. Md Rashid Hussain, the chief executive officer of the Bihar State Haj Committee, said, “Each year more than 1,000 candidates take our entrance test. We, however, select only 150. Our residential programme is very comprehensive and each student receives individual attention. We are thankful to the CM and the minority welfare department for their support.” Kumar Dipankar, who had studied engineering, cleared the CCE in his third attempt. He claimed, “The hospitality here is amazing and the library is very rich. Since I had studied engineering, I was directionless and knew nothing about the BPSC. But this institute helped me a lot. Now, I have been selected for the post of block SC/ST welfare officer.” Another successful candidate, Asma Khatoon, who is from Patna, wants to work for the welfare of women. She exclaimed, “Rashid Sir has worked really hard to motivate and guide all of us. We were groomed by reputed officers who often shared their experiences with us.” Sima Khatoon from Gaya, who has been selected as a block panchayat officer, warned “fake maulvis, who misguide the community and claim that Islam does not encourage female education”. She said, “Stop spreading misinformation. Islam encourages women to be educated. My family has also supported me.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/51-from-haj-bhavan-coaching-unit-clear-bpsc-exams-minister/articleshow/83408276.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa provides aid to only 50% of persons with disabilities: Report||PANAJI: Nearly 50% of persons with disabilities in Goa have not received any aid or help from the state government, a report titled, Persons with Disabilities (Divyangjan) in India - A Statistical Profile: 2021 has revealed. Among disabled persons Goa has the second highest literacy rate at 70% the report said. As per the Census of India 2011, Goa’s divyangjan population stands at 33,012 persons making it 2% of the total state population. As per the report, 49% of persons with disabilities received aid or help from the state government while 0.9 per cent received aid or help from organisations other than the government. From the above 49%, 54% is rural and 46% urban. In response to a mere 50% of persons with disabilities receiving any aid from the state, a senior official said that a contrributing factor could be that welfare schemes have not been amended in Goa to cover all 21 disabilities identified by the Centre. The officer also said that currently the government’s benefits cover providing aids and appliances to people for over seven disabilities, and that 19 schemes for persons with disabilities are active. He also added that a program has been launched to provide such aids and appliances to cover all persons with disabilities. The report further stated that the highest percentage of disabled children (5-19 years) currently in educational institutions has been reported from Goa and Kerala, at 73%, followed by Maharashtra and Lakshadweep at 70%. Among the state and Union territories, the highest literacy rate among disabled persons is in Kerala 71%, followed by Goa at 70%. The lowest is Arunachal Pradesh at 39%, followed by Rajasthan at 40%, the report stated. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had said that the state government will establish early intervention centres across all talukas for early diagnosis of children suffering from different disabilities that will help in early treatment. In December, Sawant had said that the state government will establish a permanent home for disabled persons within one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-provides-aid-to-only-50-of-persons-with-disabilities-report/articleshow/83415124.cms||Murari Shetye

The state forests department has also asked the staff at VTR to remain inside the tiger reserve to prevent spread of coronavirus. The NTCA had asked all states on Tuesday to close down tiger reserves, national parks and sanctuaries till further orders, citing Covid-19 infection as reason behind death of a lioness inside a zoo in Chennai. “As per the news reports, a lioness in Vandalur zoo, Chennai is suspected to have died due to Covid-19 infection and several other lions of the same zoo have tested positive for SARS COV-2. For preventing the possible transmission of Covid-19 from human beings to wild tigers and other wildlife, all tiger reserves should remain closed for tourism activities until further orders,” the NTCA order read. Principal secretary (forests department) Dipak Kumar Singh said, “Following receipt of the order from NTCA, a correspondence has been made for formal closure of VTR, the only tiger reserve in Bihar. Besides, monitoring of the staff, their vaccination against the virus as well as health of the animals in the tiger reserve are being done regularly.” Singh added identification of symptoms in tigers is initially done through change in their food habits. “Incidentally, no animal has been identified with any such symptom so far,” he added. The letter issued by Rajendra G Garawad, deputy inspector general of forests (NTCA) to all states on June 7, stated that the latest instance of zoo animals getting infected by Covid-19 once again indicates the high likelihood of disease transmission from affected human beings to captive wild animals. “A similar transmission may also happen in tiger reserves,” the letter read. Additional chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Prabhat Kumar Gupta told TOI on Thursday, “We have issued letters to officials at VTR as well as Patna zoo on the same day. They have been asked to close down all tourism-related activities. We have also written to Patna zoo on the same issue even though it does not come under the purview of the NTCA order and a similar order from Central Zoo Authority is also in effect.” Gupta said VTR authorities have also been asked to vaccinate their staff on priority basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-orders-closure-of-tiger-reserve-patna-zoo/articleshow/83408014.cms||Piyush Tripathi

ECR GM LC Trivedi directed all five divisions of the zone to ensure foolproof safety at both manned and unmanned railway crossing gates and create mass awareness among the common people about the importance of observing international level crossing gate awareness each year on June 10. Trivedi also urged vehicle owners, drivers, motorists and pedestrians to cross manned or unmanned railway crossing gates looking both ends of the tracks. This practice could avert major mishaps on tracks at manned or unmanned gates, he said adding safety rules should be strictly followed by responsible citizens to avert mishaps on tracks. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, “Railways has launched a drive to create mass awareness among the common people to follow safety rules at unmanned and manned gates through SMs and ‘nukkad nataks’ (street plays). Besides, handbills have been distributed by railways in all five divisions about the need to follow safety rules, he said adding people have been warned not to use ear phones or cell phones while crossing railway gates . Railway artists including females have been taking part in ‘nukkad nataks’ at major railway station premises as well as at vulnerable places to create awareness among illiterate or semi-literate people about the need to cross manned or unmanned gates cautiously. ECR had earlier staged a mass awareness campaign about the safety measures to be followed at railway level crossing gates in its all five divisions through making announcements on public addressing system, the CPRO said adding, “Railways also carried out an awareness drive through the medium of a select group of safety men inside running coaches of passenger trains to follow safety rules while crossing railway gates, especially at roadside stations.” Under the guidance of Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar railway safety officials and RPF men held counselling sessions with common people at 35 places covering 185 level crossing gates in the division on Thursday. About 18,000 handbills and safety pamphlets were distributed among people located on various sections of the division including Jhajha–Patna–Pt Deen Dayal Upadhaya Junction mainline route and Patna–Gaya section of the division. According to the DRM , all railway crossing gates in the Danapur division are manned gates now and thus each railway gateman on duty has been asked to follow safety rules at any cost at a time when passenger trains are passing through level crossing gates . Meanwhile, railways has decided to start services of special passenger trains ( 05161/05162 ) between Muzaffarpur and Manuadih from June 14 to facilitate local people undertake journey conveniently. These special passenger trains will run every Monday and Wednesday from both ends, the CPRO said adding services of Saharsa– Anand Vihar special passenger train (05279/05280) which were to start from June13, have been suspended temporarily due to technical reasons .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/follow-safety-rules-at-manned-unmanned-railway-crossings/articleshow/83408367.cms||---

Besides creating awareness about the rules and regulations through leaflets and brochures for level crossings among the commuters, the railway officials also counselled the commuters about the urgent need for Covid-19 immunization and observing Covid appropriate behaviour. The railway crossings under major railway stations, where the awareness campaign was undertaken on Thursday included Malda, Sahibganj, Kahalgaon, Bhagalpur, Banka, Jamalpur, Jasidih, Durgapur, Asansol, Andal, Howrah, Liluah, Bally, Belur, Sealdah, 24 Paraganas, Nadia, Naihati, DumDum, Diamond Harbour and several others of the four railway division of ER. Ekalabya Chakraborty, chief public relations officer (CPRO) at ER said the objective behind observance of International Level Crossing Day was to create awareness about the basic rules for crossing the railway line and avoid accidents. “Momentary carelessness can be fatal. The road-rail line crossings are under a set of safety rules and the level- crossing in closed condition is not only illegal but also can lead to legal actions against the offenders,” the CPRO said. The divisional railway manager (DRM) at Malda Yatendra Kumar said counselling of commuters was done in a persuasive and pleasant manner about the need to inculcate a habit of observing safety rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eastern-railway-launches-awareness-drive/articleshow/83408321.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Railways to adopt new system to avert train accidents||Prayagraj: To ensure safer and speedy journey to passengers, Indian Railways would soon introduce two major concepts in the system of train operations. Railways has approved Train Collision Avoidance System (ACAS), an indigenously developed system, which will help in avoiding accidents. Besides, the Prime Minister has approved the proposal for allotment of 5 MHz Spectrum in 700 MHz frequency band to IR for public safety and security services at stations and in trains. With this spectrum, IR has envisaged to provide LTE (Long Term Evolution) based mobile train radio communication on its route. The estimated investment in the project is more than Rs 25,000 crore. The project will be completed in the next five years, informs, CPRO, North Central Railways, Dr Shivam Sharma. Sharma said, “Presently, the movement of trains is dependent on signalling system between a given block, wherein the signal turns from red to yellow and green, depending on the movement of train which has crossed the signal. However, in ACAS, these signal posts will be installed with Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tag and the loco engine of each train would have the RFID reader. The loco pilot would easily view the status of signal on the reader despite the fact that the signal would not be visible practically.” This would be helpful in maintaining the speed of the trains in the foggy conditions as the engine would automatically adjust the speed and there cannot be overshooting of signal as even if the pilot misses the signal, the system would initiate the brakes, automatically if the signal is red, he added. “This indigenously developed ATP (Automatic Train Protection) system would help in avoiding train collisions thereby reducing accidents and ensuring passenger safety”, said Sharma. Likewise, the purpose of the LTE for Indian Railways is to provide secure and reliable voice, video and data communication services for operational, safety and security applications. It will be used for modern signalling and train protection systems and ensure seamless communication between loco pilots and guards. It will also enable Internet of Things (IoT) based remote asset monitoring especially of coaches, wagons & locos, and live video feed of CCTV cameras in the train coaches to ensure efficient, safer and faster train operations. “Since this will be dedicated bandwidth (5 MHz Spectrum in 700 MHz frequency), only to be used by the railways, the present communication system, which is based on cable and wire, would be replaced by telecommunication network using the bandwidth given to IR which would be faster and more secure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/railways-to-adopt-new-system-to-avert-train-accidents/articleshow/83413768.cms||---

Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit said apart from 1,700 vials of Amphotericin B injection, the department has provided 2,780 tablets of Posaconazole (100mg) to hospitals. “In case of non-availability of anti-fungal injection, the hospitals can give medicines to treat mucormycosis patients. The state has sent a requisition to the Centre about the requirement of anti-fungal drug for uninterrupted treatment of black fungus patients in Bihar,” he said. Number of mucormycosis cases has increased to more than 520 in the state. The number of black fungus at AIIMS-Patna has jumped to 90 with seven more admissions in the last 24 hours. So far, 16 such patients have died at the hospital. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, said the hospital has received 500 vials of Amphotericin B injection and 1,000 tablets of Posaconazole. “Almost 80% patients need this injection. On an average, each patient needs 6-7 vials depending on their weight,” he said. “Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment of black fungus. It takes minimum 17 days and maximum a month to treat the mucormycosis patients by administering the injection regularly. However, in absence of injection, the doctors give three tablets of Posaconazole (second best anti-fungal drug) per day to a patient. The efficacy of this drug, however, is less,” Dr Sanjeev said. In view of rising cases of mucormycosis, AIIMS-Patna has started four more operation theatres (OTs) to increase the number of surgeries from 4-5 a day to 10. Earlier, only two OTs were there for mucormycosis patients. Only emergency OTs will be operational at AIIMS-Patna. Dr Manish Mandal, medical superintendent of IGIMS-Patna, said all 500 vials of Amphotericin B injection were administered on patients, the day they received the drug. “Posaconazole can be used on mucormycosis patients only after they receive Amphotericin B injection for at least ten days,” he said. The IGIMS had 110 mucormycosis patients on Thursday. Seven suspected patients were admitted to the hospital and one black fungus patient was discharged on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/black-fungus-govt-provides-alternative-drug-to-hospitals/articleshow/83408834.cms||Faryal Rumi

We took the feedback from everyone with complete sincerity and worked proactively. Talks were held with all district magistrates and they were asked to furnish information regarding institutionalised deaths due to Covid as per the guidelines of the Centre. Our motive was to reach out to people affected by the pandemic and provide them the necessary relief,” Pandey said. Amid the hearings in Patna high court on Covid scenario in the state, the health department had formed committees at medical college and district levels in the third week of May to assess deaths due to Covid. The committees had been asked to furnish consolidated reports of Covid deaths under their jurisdiction in 10 days. Meanwhile, the revision of Covid death toll triggered a political slugfest on Thursday, with the RJD accusing the Nitish Kumar government of “botching up” the fight against the pandemic and ruling members defending it as an administrative matter that has been corrected. Though figures were drastically revised to 9,429, it was not specified as to when these additional deaths had taken place though a district-wise breakup was provided. Lapping up the issue, leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Yadav accused the state government of “mismanaging” the fight against coronavirus by presenting “farzi” (fake) data. “Nitishji had tried to bury the truth about many Covid victims. When caught, he suddenly added up 4,000 figures in a day,” Yadav tweeted. He was referring to the recent order given by the Patna high court to reverify the Covid fatalities tally. “When the government itself is ‘farzi’, the data will also be ‘farzi’,” Yadav said in another Twitter post. He claimed that “20 times more deaths have happened due to Covid in Bihar than the data presented by the Nitish government”. JD(U) spokesperson and MLC Niraj Kumar said, “After rall, it’s the Bihar government which has come out with a revised figure after fresh verification exercise...had there been any intention to hide something, such an exercise would not have been taken up.” The JD(U) leader took a swipe at Yadav for “remaining absent” from the ground when people are battling the coronavirus surge and instead making political statements against the state government on social media platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-takes-a-swipe-as-govt-defends-cov-toll-revision/articleshow/83411709.cms||---

The shift is set to accelerate as reflected by online trends which show that searches outside cities are growing 2.5 times faster as compared to cities. According to a study by TransUnion Cibil and Google, searches for loans grew the most in tier-3 cities at 47%, followed by tier-2 (32%) and tier-4 (28%). Indian retail credit industry stood at $613 billion (Rs 44 lakh crore), which reflects an 18% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) since 2017. While home loans at $290 billion (Rs 21 lakh crore) form the largest chunk, loan against property and business loans are growing the fastest. Digital lending is enabling small loans which are driving up volumes. According to the report loans of below Rs 25,000 have grown 23 times since 2017. The data shows that those who avail small loans are not less creditworthy. According to TU Cibil in 2020, 38% of loans disbursed to the ‘prime’ credit tier was through fintech NBFCs (non-banking financial companies). Additionally, these fintech NBFCs no longer have only ‘urban youth’ as their primary audience — 70% of disbursals are outside tier-1, with 78% of customers being millennials (between 25-45 years of age). “Consumer credit demand and access have undergone a paradigm shift over the last few years, with the post-pandemic circumstances having further accelerated this change,” said TU Cibil MD & CEO Rajesh Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/retail-loan-demand-sees-faster-growth-in-b-towns/articleshow/83414762.cms||---

Addressing a joint conference with SP Arvind Kumar Gupta, the DM said it was not an improvised explosive device (IED) blast. “Preliminary investigations suggest that the crude bombs somehow exploded and it resulted in collapse of the madrassa walls. Eventually, the building collapsed,” the DM said. The SP said a sum of Rs 1.65 lakh was recovered from the almirah of Maulana Abdul Momin Ansari, imam of the adjacent mosque, who died in the blast. “No other incriminating document was recovered,” he said, adding investigations were being made from different angles. “We are also looking into various hearsays related to use of IED in the explosion. Past incidents of bomb blasts in the district are also being revisited,” the SP said. The madrassa where the explosion occurred was not registered. “It was constructed on private land,” the DM said, adding the state government does not control this particular madrassa. Meanwhile, the four-member team of anti-terrorism squad (ATS) of the state police continued its investigation on Thursday in cooperation with Banka police. Along with joint investigations, the ATS team is also making separate inquiries. It will submit its report to the state police headquarters after in-depth investigations, sources said. Bhagalpur zone DIG Sujeet Kumar said, “We are waiting for the forensic science laboratory (FSL) report.” The SP said chemical analysis of the evidences gathered so far is being conducted by the FSL to come to a conclusion about the nature of explosive and the quantity of the explosives that blew the madrassa. “We are making investigations scientifically and gathering information from eyewitnesses. An elderly person who resides in the vicinity of the madrassa has provided some important information,” the SP added. He said some village women have also provided insights into the incident. “Several police and intelligence teams are doing their level best to crack the case. We are working with the ATS as a team to conclude the multi-directional investigations,” Gupta said. A massive explosion had occurred at the madrassa at the Noori Islampur mosque building at Navtolia village around 8am on Tuesday. Major part of the building had collapsed in the explosion. Meanwhile, last rites of the imam of the madrassa, whose body was recovered from the outskirts of the village on Tuesday evening, was conducted at his native village in Sarath block of Deoghar in neighbouring Jharkhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ied-not-used-in-madrassa-blast-banka-dm/articleshow/83412370.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Many of them are returning to hospitals with a myriad of symptoms like fever, cough, fatigue, body ache, headache and anxiety for consulting their doctors again. According to a new study conducted by the Stanford University School of Medicine, 70% of the patients with moderate or severe infection experience a variety of symptoms months after recovering from Covid. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, told this newspaper that 10 patients were undergoing treatment at the post-corona centre of the hospital. “Many Covid-recovered patients are facing problems like happy hypoxia, gangrene, myocarditis, lung infection, thrombosis, fatigue, weakness and body ache. In fact, six people have died at the hospital due to complications like pulmonary fibrosis after testing negative for corona,” Dr Sanjeev said. He added, “Although breathing exercises help, it is not advisable to exert oneself for at least three to six months.” A large number of patients are also visiting the post-Covid ward at the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital. Its nodal officer for corona, Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, pointed out, “People suffering from cough, fever, shortness of breath and mental stress are consulting us these days.” The post-corona ward at the Patna Medical College and Hospital, which has four beds and an intensive care unit, has a medical team for treating the recovered patients with symptoms like breathlessness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-recovered-patients-with-myriad-of-symptoms-seek-medical-help/articleshow/83409003.cms||Faryal Rumi

The CM visited various localities of the city to have personal experience of the responses of the people to the process of unlocking that began from June 9. To break the transmission chain, the government had imposed the lockdown on May 5, which continued till June 8. The process of unlocking began from June 9 with some restrictions, like night curfew, still in place. On June 9 and 10, it was observed that the people, who came out on the roads in large numbers, were also violating the Covid-appropriate behaviour. Many were seen not wearing masks and throwing social distancing norms to winds. It forced the CM to make a round of the urban stretch of Patna. After the visit, he tweeted, “Today, I visited some of the localities of Patna urban areas. Saw that several people were not wearing masks. Due to this lapse on their part, the coronavirus transmission might increase again. I appeal to the people of Bihar to wear masks and also maintain a two-yard distance among them.” Among the localities that Nitish visited included Raja Bazar, Saguna Mor, Danapur Cantt, Danapur, Digha, Mainpura, Rajapur Pul, Gandhi Maidan, Ashok Rajpah, Fraser Road, Dakbungalow crossing and I-T roundabout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-to-people-use-mask-keep-distance/articleshow/83408757.cms||Abhay Singh

He, however, said that if operations were to restart in the near future, they would be permitted only if protocols introduced by the government are properly followed. “It is my suggestion that tourists who have taken both vaccine doses be allowed entry. The people of the state also need to be fully vaccinated for the industry to open. We don’t know how long this will take, but if the government opens the sector shortly with SOPs in place, I will support the move,” Ajgaonkar told TOI on Thursday, even as he confirmed that no discussions have taken place so far to decide when Goa should throw open its tourism sector. The minister also said there is a fear that delays in resuming tourism may deprive Goa of its share of visitors as rival destination Kerala has slowly begun reopening for business. “Tourists looking to come to Goa may visit Kerala instead if we continue to keep our tourism sector closed,” he said. Goa receives domestic tourists mainly from the metros, with the majority arriving from neighbouring Maharashtra. While the state usually sees increased footfalls during weekends and extended weekends, the trend weakened after March as the lethal second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic engulfed the country. Fresh infections began reducing only after mid-May, the month in which the Goa government belatedly imposed entry restrictions following the intervention of the high court of Bombay at Goa. The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG), said trades will have to find a way to function while adhering to the restrictions imposed. Its president Nilesh Shah, suggested the setting up of kiosks at entry points to allow travellers to get themselves tested speedily in case they do not carry Covid-19 negative certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/open-tourism-after-people-are-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/83415195.cms||---

The estimated cost is Rs 7 lakh and the work is expected to complete within 60 days. Speaking to TOI, assistant engineer Eknath Paste said the locals were complaining of low pressure and limited water supply. “The supply was regular to these areas, but complaints were also increasing,” he said. Meanwhile, the Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida has also written a letter to the PWD about the water crisis in these areas. The residents of Mangor Hill, Non mon & Fakirgalli were receiving water with very low pressure. Though the work order was issued a couple of months back, it had to wait due to the code of conduct, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-water-pipeline-at-three-areas-in-vasco/articleshow/83414632.cms||---
---||Business||Rush for wills to secure family wealth in Covid||MUMBAI: A businessman in his late 40s, who had severe Covid and was desperate for oxygen and a hospital bed, had given up hope of surviving the brutal second wave that has ravaged several families. “When I survived, I felt that miracles do happen. But this has shaken me up,” he later told friends and associates. While recuperating, he realised the catastrophic financial impact the pandemic would have had on his family had he not made it in the absence of a will and the separation of personal assets from his well-spread business. While his son is still studying, his wife and daughter know next to nothing about his finances. He is now working on his will and plans to ensure his business and personal assets are segregated and securely kept in a trust for the benefit of his family. There has been a spike in registration of wills, succession planning at family businesses, and estate planning over the last year. Moreover, the pandemic has made such legal processes age-agnostic. While in the past mostly parents or grandparents may have made a will, many such families now want their children (often in their late 20s and 30s) to make one too. Legal and estate management firms said they are working with young individuals and families with small children to make succession plans, even if temporary. Some are even appointing a temporary guardian. HDFC Securities head (products & business development) Rajeev Srivastava said the firm witnessed a growth of 76% for e-will registrations in 2020-21 as compared to the previous fiscal. “Many customers in the age group of 40+ are creating their e-wills. A lot of corporate employees, too, have shown interest in creating their wills,” said Srivastava. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas (CAM) partner and co-head (private client practice) Rishabh Shroff said, “We have seen many individuals/promoters wanting to make urgent wills, almost overnight — they want to make a ‘stopgap’ or ‘temporary’ will to ensure their assets pass smoothly to the next generation and the family in case something happens to them suddenly. They will revise the wills later to make it more detailed and robust once things settle down, but they need a temporary will like this for emergency situations.” In one such case, from the time a client called CAM to when he had a signed will in place was less than 1 hour. “And this client is one of India’s wealthiest family businesses.” Law firm Majmudar & Partners has seen a rise in inquiries for estate planning. The firm’s partner Neerav Merchant said due to Covid and general uncertainty about one’s life, people are keen to expedite estate planning. The Supreme Court recently ruled that if a businessman gives a personal guarantee for loans taken for business, despite a limited liability partnership or company, the invocation of that guarantee extends to his/her assets. “Some are aware enough to create a will, appoint nominees to their bank accounts and investments, and have investments in joint names. But what is extremely important for businessmen is to segregate personal assets from the business,” said Daksha Baxi, a tax expert at SRI Solutions. “A businessman can lose his personal assets when the business faces a crisis of the nature seen in this pandemic. It is therefore imperative for businessmen to consider an asset protection trust for their personal wealth. Trusts can serve several purposes, including smooth passing of wealth to the next generation, ability to get professional advice on wealth management, cater to special needs of family members, and save on estate duty if it is brought in,” said Baxi. Shroff of CAM said, “Given the recent judgment allowing personal guarantees to be enforced, we are seeing a spike in queries from clients who want to know if trusts can be used to insulate their personal wealth from their company’s risk. It is still early days, but this will be a driver in planning for promoters in future.” Gautami Gavankar, CEO - estate planning & trusteeship, and head - family office at Kotak Mahindra Group, said succession planning was not taken up earlier as a priority in most cases. “The typical response used to be, ‘Why do I need a will at 30?’ The pandemic has made people realise the importance of succession planning, creating a will/trust, and having a safety pot to meet the post-pandemic needs of a business, which is dramatically different. Across age groups, people now want to ensure that they are prepared. Families, in the midst of this pandemic situation are taking some quick and effective decisions, including emergency plans for businesses and families and laying down a clear leadership transition. We are also seeing increasing instances of the next generation being trained and coached in the financial affairs of family businesses,” said Gavankar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rush-for-wills-to-secure-family-wealth-in-covid/articleshow/83414965.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Patna||Manjhi: Those who study in madrassas are not terrorists||PATNA: The Tuesday’s blast at a madrassa at Navtolia village in Banka has sparked war of words between BJP and Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), the two NDA constituents in the state.Reacting to BJP MLA Shashi Bhushan Thakur Bachol’s statement that madrassas have become “nursery to grow terrorists” and all madrassas in the state should be closed, Manjhi tweeted on Thursday, “If the poor dalits forge ahead, they are seen as Maoists. Similarly, if the poor Muslims study in madrassas, they are considered terrorists. People should change their mindset. It is not good for the unity and integrity of the country. There should be a high-level inquiry into the Banka madrassa blast.” The blast at the madrassa had left Maulana Abdul Momin Ansari, imam of the adjacent mosque, dead and several others injured. While most male residents of Navtolia had fled the village, Ansari’s body was first whisked away from the site and then brought back and abandoned there in suspicious circumstances. Asked about the controversy, state BJP chief Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said, “I have nothing to say on what our MLA and Manjhi have commented. The incident should be seen purely from the criminal angle and investigations should be done accordingly. The anti-terrorism squad of the state police has already begun investigation into the case.”“The fact that male members of the village escaped after the blast makes the incident look fishy. Yet, I would say what happened at the mosque was purely a criminal incident,” Jaiswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-those-who-study-in-madrassas-are-not-terrorists/articleshow/83407211.cms||Abhay Singh

Police said that six armed criminals visited a tea stall at Krishna Nagar under the Bariarpur police station area in Munger district at around 9.30 am and pumped three bullets into the body of its owner Dhanraj Kumar. Dhanraj (30), was rushed to a primary health centre (PHC) at Bariarpur where the doctor declared him dead. Bariarpur DSP Nandji Prasad said the deceased shopkeeper's marriage was scheduled to be solemnised on June 30.

The doctors have noticed partial nerve injury on his upper limb. He is under observation,” said an AMRI Salt Lake statement on Thursday. Ghosh was part of a team whose members had been hand-picked two years ago after the Bengal Special Task Force (STF) was formed. This unit led the initial assault at the high-rise on Wednesday. Kolkata Police formed an STF first and the model was replicated for the state police as commissionerates under it grew. In September 2019, the Bengal STF was formed to combat modern urban organized crimes — terrorism, gangs, illegal arms, ammunition, drugs and FICN. Its is a combination of two units — one handling operations, the other, intelligence collection and processing. “Down the line, we realized we needed a unit that could go beyond Kolkata and its suburbs and deal with urban terrorism and crime. When the proposal went to CM Mamata Banerjee, she readily agreed,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/injured-cop-stable-under-observation/articleshow/83412331.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Patna||Degree courses: Patna University to start online admission soon||PATNA: Patna University (PU) is likely to begin the process of online admission of students to the three-year degree courses in its different colleges soon. The admission work would be expedited through the university management information system (UMIS). PU vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary said the university has requested the chancellor to allow it to admit the students without entrance test and interview. “For the last several years, PU colleges had been admitting students to all the undergraduate courses on the basis of centralised faculty-wise entrance tests as per the admission ordinance. But, owing to the Covid pandemic, it would not be feasible to conduct the entrance tests this time. Hence, a necessary amendment would have to be made in the ordinance for doing away with the entrance tests for a year through some transitory regulation,” the VC said. Chaudhary said as soon as permission is received from the chancellor’s office, PU would invite online applications from eligible candidates for admission to both the conventional as well as self-financing courses. “Candidates will have to indicate their preferences of subjects and colleges in their applications and the admission would be made on merit-cum-choice basis. There would also be a provision of automatic upgradation in the selection list in case of some vacancies and a student allotted a seat in B N College may be asked to get himself admitted in Patna Science College if his position on the merit list is upgraded,” he said. The VC added as the online classes of students enrolled in both undergraduate and postgraduate courses have already started with the reopening of the institutions after summer vacation, shortage of teachers in different subjects has been hampering the smooth conduct of classes. “The services of more than 90 guest faculty were terminated before the commencement of summer vacation from May 1 and their reinstatement could be done only after appraisal by the university selection committee,” he added. “PU has already sought an appraisal report of individual teachers working as guest faculty in different subjects and the subject-wise selection committees will assess the performance of teachers from June 11. Services of teachers whose performance is found satisfactory will be renewed for another 11 months,” the VC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/degree-courses-pu-to-start-online-admission-soon/articleshow/83408161.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Patna: Covid turns students’ plans upside down||PATNA: The Covid-19 pandemic has not only robbed kids of offline studies and examinations, but also made their future uncertain. Those on the threshold of entering college life are the worst hit. Some students are suffering from psychological distress and finding it difficult to concentrate on studies for competitive examinations. Alina S Joe, a Class XII student of St Michael’s High School, was quite worried about her future. “Students having science background have alternative options like JEE and NEET, but the commerce students are left out. It feels like our future is decided by someone else. Class XII result is the only way to get admission in premium colleges of Delhi University. Now, we have to totally depend on entrance exams and we do not even know how the pattern will be,” the girl said. She added, “The CBSE has not declared the marking scheme for Class XII yet. It is the worst year than even 2020 and it is not going to be any better as the experts are predicting third wave of Covid.” Vishal Singh, a student of DAV Public School, said if he fails to clear the competitive exam, there will be limited options for him. “Even after admission, we will have to attend online classes because there is no certainty when the situation would improve,” he said, adding his parents are also worried about his future. “I am unable to concentrate on my studies as lot of things are happening. Every time, we started preparing for the exams, the dates were extended. I am fatigued now. Being cooped up at home, I have become more stressed,” said Roshini Gupta, a student of Patna Central School. Snehansu Kumar, a student of Loyola High School, said amid all the uncertainties, he was focusing on JEE. “My aim is to secure admission in a reputed engineering college. I am already preparing for the entrance examinations,” he said. Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) students, whose Class XII results have already been announced, are also a worried lot. Sugandha Kumari, the second-rank holder in BSEB Class XII, said she had planned to pursue higher education in Delhi or Jaipur. “However, it seems I have to take admission in a Bihar college now. The Covid pandemic has crushed all my plans. My parents are not willing to send me to any other state due to the pandemic,” she said. Dr Binda Singh, a city-based psychologist, said kids are feeling insecure and have developed fear psychosis. “On an average, I attend to 6-7 such cases. Children are frustrated and uncertain about their future. I had recently attended a programme for students in which most children were distressed. They are also worried about the likely third wave of the pandemic,” she said. Dr Santosh Kumar, a psychiatrist and deputy superintendent of NMCH-Patna, said kids should maintain their routine so that their biological clock is not disturbed. “They should spend some amount of time in regular exercises besides maintaining immunity level and indulging in productive things. Children should not cut off themselves from the family. Parents should avoid conflicts, spend time with children and keep them away from negativity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-turns-students-plans-upside-down/articleshow/83409170.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Hyderabad||HCA notice to president; Mohd Azharuddin says it’s illegal||HYDERABAD: The power struggle between president Mohd Azharuddin and the other Apex council members of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) has taken yet another turn with the president being issued a show cause notice. At the Apex council meeting on Thursday, the members decided to issue a show cause notice to Azharuddin. “During the 10th Apex Council meeting held on 25.05.21, secretary R Vijayanand was asked to issue a show cause notice to the president Mohd Azharuddin on behalf of the Apex Council as per the Memorandum of Association Rules and Regulations 2019 chapter IV, point no.41 (b) – detriment caused by the member or administrator. The minutes of the 10th Apex Council meeting were accepted today during the 11th Apex Council meeting and a show cause notice will be issued accordingly,” a HCA release said. “The notice will be issued to the president tomorrow,” Vijayanand told ToI on Thursday and added that Azharuddin had issued a show cause notice to the Apex council members “which is against the rules as any show cause notice has to be issued by the Apex council and not by an individual office-bearer.” Reacting to the development, Azharuddin said: “This post-facto action by a coterie of five members, who themselves are facing an inquiry initiated much earlier in time, is inherently illegal, malafide & vindictive. It is public knowledge that a majority of the members of the coterie are attending the courts as accused in various corruption cases that involve kickbacks and misappropriation of public money. “These people are already facing enquiry before the Ombudsman and a notice to this effect has already been issued. So there is no point in these tainted people conducting the so-called Apex meeting and issuing show cause to the president. These people are not eligible to conduct any meeting pending enquiry against them,” Azhar said. Ombudsman Verma issues notice to secretary In a related development, Ombudsman Justice (retd) Deepak Verma had issued a show cause notice to Vijayanand on June 1 and has given him 15 days to submit his reply to the complaints/allegations made against him. “Once the date of filing reply to this show cause notice is over, a date of virtual hearing shall be informed to you and the complaint shall finally be decided accordingly in the said virtual meeting after hearing both the sides,” Justice Verma said. The complaint pertains to the charge that Vijayanand had convened the 8th Apex council meeting and signed the minutes “by falsely inserting/including an item in the minutes which was not discussed”. This was related to the appointment of advocate B Chandrasen Reddy as standing counsel of HCA. The objection was allegedly raised by Santosh Daware (CAG nominee) and agreed upon by Azharuddin. Other allegations include Vijayanand getting a resolution passed in the Apex council that he will represent HCA in all legal proceedings including the O.P.No.17 of 2020; dragging the Apex council in the case before the XXX additional chief judge, city civil court and concealing the address of the HCA in PSROP 17/2020 and showing his residential address instead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-notice-to-president-azharuddin-says-its-illegal/articleshow/83412820.cms||Solomon S Kumar

Of Goa's female population in the 18-24 age group, 34.6% girls are enrolled for various higher education programmes in colleges and universities, as per the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report of the Union education ministry released on Thursday. “Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Punjab, Telangana and Uttarakhand have GER of more than 30% for females in all categories. The GER for female population at the all India level is 27.3%,” the AISHE report noted. The state has the third best pupil-teacher ratio in the country and also has better enrolment ratio in higher education across social groups like SC, ST than the national average. However, one area of concern that has emerged in the AISHE report is the reduced number of male enrolment for degree programmes. The number of boys enrolled for undergraduate programmes in 2019-20 came down by almost a thousand students to around 15,600. The number of boys registered for diploma programmes was also down to 4,412, lower by another thousand students over the previous years. This is surprising given that the overall population of males in the 18-23 age group in Goa went from 10.22 lakh in 2018-19 to 10.54 lakh to 2019-20, as per the report. This lower male enrolment ratio was only specific to undergraduate and diploma programmes in Goa for 2019-20. In comparison, the enrolment in postgraduate and PhD programmes in 2019-20 only increased over the previous academic year with the numbers of both males and females showing an equal rise. According to the AISHE report 2019-20, at one teacher for every 13 students, Goa also has among the best pupil-teacher ratio for higher education in the country, after Puducherry (10) and Lakshadweep (12). As per the report, Goa also continues to be among the rare states with higher number of female teachers in higher education than male teachers. “Out of total no. of 15,03,156 teachers (in the country) for 2019-20 about 57.5% are male teachers and 42.5% are female teachers. A few states like Kerala, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Delhi and Goa on the other hand have more female teachers than male teachers,” the report states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-female-ratio-in-higher-edu-among-best-in-country/articleshow/83414770.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Meerut||Held under NSA for ‘spitting’ on rotis in Meerut, cook out of jail after Centre revokes charge||MEERUT: The Central government has revoked the stringent National Security Act (NSA) invoked against a cook, 25, who was accused of spitting on dough while making rotis for guests at a wedding function in Meerut. Naushad was arrested four months ago on the basis of a mobile video clip. He was released on May 14 after the Union home ministry quashed the NSA and directed the UP police to release him. Kept under wraps, news of his release came out only now. NSA empowers the district administration to detain a person if it is convinced that he or she is a threat to national security or will disrupt public order. District magistrate (DM) of Meerut K Balaji said, “When someone is booked under NSA, he can send a representation pleading innocence to three places -- the advisory board, the state government and Centre. In Naushad’s case, the advisory board and the state had rejected his plea. But the Centre accepted it and ordered his release.” Superintendent of Meerut district prison BD Pandey said, “Naushad was brought here on March 1. He was released after NSA was revoked and we received an order of his release from the district magistrate.” Naushad used to work with a city-based catering firm. In the video which was said to be shot by a guest, he was seen purportedly spitting on dough. Naushad had trashed the charges saying that he was working as a cook for the last 10 years and could never do such a despicable thing. The video was shot on February 16 this year and later uploaded on social media platforms. Right-wing outfit Hindu Jagran Manch then traced Naushad, roughed him up and filed a police complaint against him. Based on the complaint, an FIR against Naushad was registered at Medical police station. The administration later invoked NSA against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/held-under-nsa-for-spitting-on-rotis-cook-out-of-jail-after-centre-revokes-charge/articleshow/83410191.cms||---

At 91, the cases increased by 10 after remaining at 81 for two days. Over 100 more tests were done on Thursday as compared to Wednesday, as per the civil surgeon’s data. The Covid fatalities rose to 10 from 5 a day before. Of these, just one was from rural, 5 from city and four deceased patients were residents of other districts. Among the new cases, 49 were from the city and 38 from rural while 4 from outside the district. The continued fall in daily cases has ensured the district continues to enjoy level-1 status of the unlock guidelines issued by the state government. As per the guidelines, the district needs to maintain less than 25% bed occupancy and under 5% test positivity rate. As on date, the ratio is far less than this, keeping the district safe from any threat of movement restrictions. Such has been the drop in hospitalization that several hospitals have resumed their regular services and shut down Covid facilities. The district now has just 2,356 active cases. Of these, less than 500 patients are in admission. The load on government and civic-run hospitals has dramatically reduced. Just a month back, the district was falling short of beds, medical oxygen and even life saving medicines due to the whopping caseload. Now, only the three medical colleges and a couple of private hospitals have admission figures in double digits while many don’t have any patient. Probably for the first time, no one tested positive in 1,743 rapid antigen tests (RAT) while three public labs – AIIMS, Neeri and RTMNU – had positive cases in single digits against a large number of tests. In private labs, 56 tested positive against 4,888 samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cases-remain-under-100-deaths-under-10-for-3rd-day-in-a-row/articleshow/83414651.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Malad building owner performs last rites of 9 kin||Mumbai: Rafiq Siddique, the lone survivor of his family, performed last rites of nine kin at Malwani burial ground on Thursday evening. Rafiq, along with his wife Raisabano, had no children but his brother Shafiq on the first floor was with his wife and six children. Rafiq had gone to meet someone when the structure crashed. His family was trapped under the debris and extricated by fire brigade with the help of other residents. Most died on the spot. Police had booked Rafiq for culpable homicide not amounting to murder as he was aware of a crack in the structure but did not repair it. Rafiq had constructed the illegal structure around eight years back through a contractor, after spending his own money. He and his brother’s families occupied two middle floors while they gave the ground and top floors on rent. Rafiq also owned few other rooms in the vicinity. Neighbours said Rafiq runs a popcorn stall at an amusement park along with his brother but it was shut during lockdown. The brother had many friends in the area who helped Rafiq with the last rites. “He is devastated and is not talking much with friends. We helped whatever was possible. Meanwhile, Rizwana Sayyad (33) lost her nine-year-old son Sahil but she suffered serious injuries. Her other son and husband also survived. The son was playing near the structure, while her husband Sarfaraz had gone out to meet a friend. Rizwana was living on rent on the top floor and did household work to support the family. She was admitted to Shatabdi Hospital, Kandivli. Her mother Saira and brother Nasir Pathan tried to console her, but she continuously cried for her son. Hospital staff told relatives to wait outside as she needed her to rest. Sarfaraz and his other son made the rounds of the mortuary to get Sahil’s body after post-mortem. Saira and Nasir were waiting outside the second floor ward room passage when chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and others visited the injured. Thackeray briefly interacted with Saira and Nasir while leaving. Saira said, “He (Thackeray) told me he spoke to those injured. I pleaded with him for help. My daughter is poor, and was forced to live on rent.” Nasir said, “My other sister, who lives nearby, informed us about it. We rushed for help from Sakinaka. After over three hours she was rescued from under the debris. Firemen later found the son’s body.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-malad-building-owner-performs-last-rites-of-9-kin/articleshow/83414667.cms||Vijay V Singh

Senior counsel Darius Khambat, appearing for the state, said his earlier statement would stand continued as Singh’s quashing petition was adjourned for hearing to June 14 by a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar. On June 14, the bench will also hear Singh’s other petition to quash departmental enquiries against him, including the one to be led by DGP Sanjay Pandey. Pandey had later recused himself. A lawyer said that an intervention application was filed by builder Kartik Bhatt in the quashing petition against the FIR by Ghadge and it contained serious allegations against Singh and it should be heard. Bhatt has alleged that an officer subordinate to Singh had tried to extort Rs 200 crore in a complaint related to a SRA project in Chembur. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-will-not-arrest-param-bir-in-atrocities-case-till-june-15/articleshow/83416013.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Lakshadweep incident an attack on humanity’||KOCHI: Sathyadeepam, the weekly run by the Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese of the Syro Malabar Church, has come out with an editorial supporting Lakshadweep islanders. The editorial titled, Dweep Valayunna Fascism (Fascism encircling the island), termed the crisis in the atolls as ‘not just an attack against minority but against humanity’. The editorial stated that contemporary experiences suggest that the infiltration of modern day fascism was through parliamentary methods and that those who believe in democracy fear that a similar manifestation of fascism has taken place in the garb of development in the Lakshadweep islands.  The article said. “…it shouldn’t be forgotten that the islands, which are barely eight feet above sea level, are an extremely ecologically fragile region. When the people of Lakshadweep are crying due to the fear of getting evicted from their land and culture, we need to remember that there is only 486km between the islands and Kerala.” The editorial said that the politics of Lakshadweep had always represented Indian nationalism. “The democratic awareness of the islands has always been with national parties. It needs to be noted that till now there has been no place for extremist stances or for religious organizations that represent extremism in the islands,” said the editorial. “It is a place where the entire population are recognized as scheduled tribes. It is a tribal region which has special cultural and language traits that need protection. Dweep also claims Buddhist traditional symbols till the sixth century,” it added. Case against activist: Kavaratti police have registered a case against Aisha Sultana, an activist and a film artist based in Lakshadweep who has been in the forefront of the campaign against the policies of the present Lakshadweep administration. The case was registered reportedly for making a comment during a TV debate that ‘a bio-weapon’ was used against the Island, while talking about the change in standard operating procedure in the archipelago and the subsequent spurt in Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dweep-incident-an-attack-on-humanity/articleshow/83413071.cms||---

Following appeals from students across the nation, the authorities recently said those headed for foreign universities would not have to wait for the now-mandatory 84 days for their second dose of Covishield but could take it at the end of 28 days as they would have to reach their campuses abroad within a deadline. The exception was also extended to those going abroad for work as well as the Indian contingent to the Tokyo Olympics. Foreign universities demand that students from India be fully vaccinated and that they take Covishield only. “An officer at the rank of assistant director of health services at the state level, a KMC commissioner or his authorized officer for the city and chief medical officers of health in districts have been entrusted with the responsibility of overseeing second dose of this category of recipients,” said a source at Swasthya Bhawan. Ishita Mandal, studying computer science at Arizona State University, has completed her first semester online. She will travel to the US in the first week of August for physical classes. “ I am relieved I will be allowed to take my second dose in a 28 days’ gap, allowing me to reach the campus on time,” said Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nodal-officers-at-three-levels-to-oversee-vax-after-28-days/articleshow/83414751.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||India||35 aspirants for ‘9 berths’ in Rajasthan rejig||New Delhi: Besides nominating new ministers, Congress may also appoint ‘parliamentary secretaries’ in Rajasthan in a bid to accommodate aspirations as the upcoming ministerial expansion of Ashok Gehlot government has become a tightrope walk. Sources said the ministerial expansion is likely to happen soon with calculations swirling around nine vacancies in the Gehlot ministry with about 35 aspirants. While the Sachin Pilot camp has a demand of around 6-7 berths, 10 independents supporting the government are hopeful as are six MLAs of BSP who merged with Congress. Among others are at least 10 senior Congress members who expect to be rewarded in the normal course. Pilot has vented his grievance that the “resolution” of his grievances has not happened despite being promised by the Congress leadership. A special consideration is being given by the Gehlot camp to the independents who won on their own strength after being denied a ticket by Congress but still came back to support the party which eventually formed the government. There is also a desire to keep the former BSP contingent happy. As the demand overshoots the vacancies, Congress sources said the party is actively considering the post of “parliamentary secretaries” to satisfy a maximum of aspirants. Besides, it will seek to reward some MLAs through the nominations of chairmen to state boards and corporations, the established route of giving office to legislators denied ministries in states. The vacancies in Gehlot ministry shot up after Sachin Pilot’s rebellion last year which led to the sacking of three ministers who threw their lot with him. The expansion, sources claim, has been stuck because of Covid firefighting which has consumed an entire year. Pilot this week complained that promises made to him to persuade him to give up his rebellion have not been fulfilled yet. Congress appears keen to settle the issue in Rajasthan in the wake of growing dissidence in state units which is again battering the party in the political war of perception. The dissidence in Punjab unit as also the recent election defeats are viewed widely as the sign of a weakened leadership which is allowing factions to pull in different directions with concern for consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/35-aspirants-for-9-berths-in-rajasthan-rejig/articleshow/83419256.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The camp organized at Navyug school was done in coordination of social security department and Lakshya trust which works for the community. To dispel hesitancy about Covid vaccination among people at large, the transgender community took the jabs to do away with all misapprehensions. As their exposure among crowd is the maximum, transgenders were feared to act as super spreaders of the dreaded virus. Mirade Kachande, a member of the community said, “We are happy that a special camp was organized for our community. There is no side effect of the vaccine and everybody should participate in the drive.” District social security officer, Mehul Goswami said, “This is also an attempt to join the transgender community with mainstream society as well as they also need the vaccine shield for their own protection against this virus.” The authority also did not insist on ID proof of the beneficiaries while giving the shots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/hesitancy-dispelled-70-transgenders-get-vaccinated/articleshow/83410290.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: New amendments to Tree Act will hit Ajni Inter Modal Station work||MUMBAI/NAGPUR: In a major new policy to protect trees, the Maharashtra government has decided to accord ‘heritage’ status to more than 50-year-old trees and, in case they have to be felled, then the number of saplings to be planted would correspond to the age of the tree. Most importantly, the case of large-scale tree felling at Ajni for the Inter Modal Station (IMS) project will now be in the hands of Maharashtra State Tree Authority. The principal secretary of environment, Manisha Patankar Mhaiskar, told TOI after the cabinet meeting, “This is a very good decision to conserve and protect trees. If a 100 year old tree is hacked, then 100 new saplings will have to be planted at the same site or a public space.” The amendment is likely to make things difficult for the ambitious Inter Modal Station (IMS) project as more than 5,000 trees were scheduled to be cut in Ajni in the first phase. As reported by TOI, greens claimed that nearly 40,000 trees would be cut for the entire project to be constructed in various phases. According to environmentalists, most of the trees at Ajni are over 50-year-old, planted by the British. The new amendments require that an alternative project design should be considered to ensure minimum felling of trees. “Despite having better alternative sites in place, the policy-makers are not considering it. The site at Khapri will ensure negligible damage to green cover,” said environmentalist Jaydeep Das. The new norms state that if more than 200 trees of age 5 years or more need to be felled, the case will be referred to Maharashtra State Tree Authority. “This clearly means that Ajni Van case is no longer under the jurisdiction of Nagpur Municipal Corporation. The public notice thus gets null. Ajni Van should be declared as heritage Van now,” added Das. The policy will be enforced through amendments to The Maharashtra (Urban and Areas) Preservation and Protection of Trees Act, 1975, approved on Thursday. It also provides for a penalty up to Rs 1 lakh for violations. The saplings planted in compensation will have to be six to eight feet tall and they will be geo-tagged and maintained for seven years. The state level Tree Authority will be responsible for monitoring, protecting and conserving heritage status trees throughout the state. The methodology for tree plantation can be on Miyawaki, Amrut Van, Memorial Trees or even Urban Forests, as per the latest cabinet decision. Under the new policy, the local civic bodies will have to conduct a tree census once every five years and maintain record of the heritage trees. The local civic body level tree authorities will have tree specialists. Even the pruning of trees is to be done scientifically. “Strict implementation and accountability were important,” said B N Kumar, director of NGO NatConnect Foundation, hailing the decision. NatConnect also suggested a dedicated Green Police to handle environmental violations as the existing police force was overburdened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-amendments-to-tree-act-will-hit-ajni-ims-work/articleshow/83414523.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Mumbai||Blame game: BMC & collector’s office point fingers at each other||Mumbai: After yet another tragedy in the city, yet another blame game unfolded on Thursday.The land on which the Malwani structure stood belongs to the collector’s office, and there are thousands of similar illegal structures in the Malwani area. BMC officials stated the collector’s office should have taken action against illegal constructions, whereas officials from the collector’s office, Mumbai Suburban district, stated that irrespective of ownership of land, as the planning authority, it was BMC which had to take action against unauthorized constructions. The collector’s office said the plots in Malvani were allotted around 1970 for ground-floor constructions, so if any additional floors were added, the BMC should have acted. Milind Borikar, district magistrate and collector, said, “The BMC will conduct the structural audit of such constructions, after which teams of the BMC and collector’s office will take action to vacate unauthorized tenements in order to demolish them.”Local corporator Salma Amlekar said she had been complaining against unauthorized structures growing there since she was elected in 2017, but every time she wrote, the collector and BMC would keep passing her letters to one another. BMC officials said while they could provide manpower and machinery for demolitions, only the deputy collector (encroachments) could have initiated action. “Many structures have gone way above the permissible limit. The structure which crashed was also built in a way that it appears it had no stability,” said a senior official. Another official said a letter was given to Malwani police station in February 2020 seeking police protection for undertaking demolition, but it was not received.Meanwhile, netas visited the crash site on Thursday. State minister and local Congress MLA Aslam Shaikh said, “We are providing compensation to those who died and also trying to help the injured. Around 10,000 dilapidated structures exist in the city, and the Centre should come up with a plan for such structures.” BJP MP Gopal Shetty along with leader of opposition in the council Pravin Darekar too visited the site. Replying to Shaikh, Shetty said, “The state can provide houses to the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana which the state has to implement. These structures keep adding illegal floors, and the state is not taking action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/blame-game-bmc-collectors-office-point-fingers-at-each-other/articleshow/83414745.cms||Vijay V Singh

Many dug-up roads are yet to be restored, especially in Peth areas, even after the extension of the deadline for completion of work till June 10. The pre-monsoon road resurfacing work is yet to be carried out. Improper resurfacing at many spots is causing inconvenience to commuters venturing out for work after the unlock process. On Thursday afternoon, a truck carrying ready mix cement got stuck in a dug-up section of Kelkar Road near Tilak chowk (Alka Talkies chowk). A heavy-duty crane had to be pressed into service to move the truck. The movement of crane on the road in the old parts of the city caused traffic jams. Vishrambaug traffic division officials told TOI, “The truck got stuck in the dug-up area in the afternoon. Vehicular movement is not allowed on the stretch between Alka talkies chowk and ‘Z’ Bridge in Narayan Peth.” Though the civic administration claimed that road repair work will be completed by June 10, the work is far from over at many places. In some areas, like Pune Satara Road, the repair work commenced recently. Local corporator Sunil Kamble said, “The repair work has started since it falls under the emergency category and will to be completed as soon as possible.” “The side margins of the road were dug up for laying of electricity cables. Had the work not been done ,it would have caused power failure during the monsoon,” he said. Pune Municipal Corporation additional commissioner Kunal Khemnar said that he has sought work completion report from all ward offices. “Almost all road work has been completed. We will cross-verify the data. It is expected that we will get them from the respective offices on Friday. If any serious lapses are found in road repair work, criminal cases will be filed against contactors. We have already filed such cases for two locations.” Civic officials said that work related to road repairs, nullah cleaning and sewage line cleaning is almost complete. Only work for 24 x 7 water supply scheme is underway in some areas. The water supply lines are being laid after some decades. This work will continue for a few more days. Citizen activists stressed that the quality of work should be maintained. “The standard laid down by the Indian Roads Congress should be followed. The quality of work is poor in many places,” said Vivek Velankar of Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pre-monsoon-work-still-pending-even-after-extension-of-deadline/articleshow/83414736.cms||---
---||Nagpur||With mucor symptoms recurring, many patients having to undergo revision surgeries||NAGPUR: While the dangerous fungal complication mucormycosis has left many patients reeling, its recurrence or residual symptoms post recovery are aggravating their woes manifold. Though still small in number, experts say there is a steady stream of recovered patients revisiting them with fresh complications, forcing the latter to go under the knife once again for revision surgery. The experts claimed recurrences had taken place in the past too, but the trend is common now due to three reasons — acute scarcity of the antifungal drug Amphotericin-B, the delta variant of Covid-19 playing havoc on the betas cell of pancreas which release insulin, and mucormycosis’s unexplained devastating effects on immunity. Apart from many patients’ expenses shooting through the roof with Covid and mucormycosis treatment in advanced stage, it’s learnt that the surgeons also have to wage grim battles in many revision surgeries to save the victims from disfigurement due to removal of portions affected substantially. Ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon at Kingsway hospital Dr Sweta Lohiya said that since many patients do not even know they are diabetic, no medication is prescribed to them, which is another cause of the recurrence or residual symptoms of black fungus. “Surgeries are not enough; adequate medication is required too. The paucity of antifungal Amphotericin-B is one of the reasons behind the recurrence or residual symptoms of mucormycosis,” she said. “Also, the angioinvasion of fungus (its reaching other organs from the nose through the blood vessels) is being treated with medication and not surgery. If the medication is not available, the disease cannot be treated through surgery in angioinvasion,” Lohiya added. Before taking the patient for surgery, one should thoroughly check for the presence of the disease in the nose or sinuses, orbits, brain and maxillary bones, the ENT surgeon said. “We also need to rule out the presence of any underlying diseases like diabetes, before surgery,” she added. “Our most common experience is to treat the more painless rizhopus fungus, which causes more localized infection rather than the rare but severe apophycomyces fungus, which occurs in 5-10% cases,” said Dr Lohiya. “The delta variant of Covid-19 affects the beta cells of the pancreas and causes blood sugar dysregulation and immune dysregulation. These two factors often lead to mucormycosis in previously undiagnosed diabetic patients, which also needs to be kept in mind to prevent recurrences,” she further said. Infectious diseases specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade said mucormycosis is an aggressive fungal disease which in the past, too, had required repeated debridement (removal of infected tissue) despite therapies. Dr Tayade added that sufficient debridement surgeries in the early stage, adequate availability of Amphotericin-B and sound sugar control were keys to avoid repeated surgeries. “We have also noticed that mucormycosis presenting in the early Covid is more aggressive,” she said. ENT surgeon Dr Samir Thakare, also secretary of the association of otolaryngologists of India (Vidarbha region), said mucormycosis had the potency to spread through the blood vessels from one organ to another — like nose to teeth to eye to brain — within a short time. “Despite the clearances or debridement surgeries done in the early stage, the disease spreads through the blood vessels. If sugar is unchecked, the chances are higher,” he said. Dr Thakare said that of the 32 mucormycosis-related cases he had handled thus far, around 10% returned with residual symptoms and recurrences. “Lack of antifungal drugs played a major role in this trend,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/with-mucor-symptoms-recurring-many-patients-having-to-undergo-revision-surgeries/articleshow/83414682.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Update daily Remdesivir information on portal or face consequences: High Court to private hospitals in Nagpur||NAGPUR: Upset over private hospitals’s failure to upload their data of Remdesivir’s utilization and consumption, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court warned them to update daily information on the district administration’s portal or get ready to face consequences. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote agreed with amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar’s contention that if any information hasn’t updated regularly, it would be a reasonable indicator of the fact that the injections haven’t been administered and the hospital doesn’t require further allocation. Government pleader Ketki Joshi then informed that the information relating to daily utilization of Remdesivir isn’t being updated by some of the hospitals and that led to the portal failing in updating the information regularly. “All hospitals need to be made aware of the consequences that will follow on their failure to update the information on a daily basis, which shall be done by the authorities,” the HC warned. While hearing a bunch of PILs, including a suo motu based on TOI report, the bench reminded respondents about a June 4 communication by the State Directorate of Health Services in Mumbai, directing all the hospitals in city, rural and slum areas to improve efforts for increasing the standards of hygiene and cleanliness on their premises. While referring to ‘Kayakalp — Swach Rugnalaya’ scheme promulgated on May 15, the judges said some incentives have been provided encouraged hospitals to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. “Certain rewards have been prescribed, but it’s not known how many hospitals received them till date and action taken against those lagging behind in these aspects. We direct the state to submit detailed information in this regard before the next hearing on June 30.” Lauding collector Ravindra Thakare and other officials, the bench said their efforts to approach various companies for CSR funds have started showing fruits. “Of course, there is also a lot of cooperation from these companies. The collector’s affidavit shows that five of them have donated an amount of Rs82 lakh. Similarly, NTPC plant at Mouda, also deposited Rs3 crore for Covid-19 treatment and management with the collector. We appreciated their noble gesture.” HC censures MSTCL for putting riders for CSR funds The HC slammed Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL) for putting riders while donating CSR funds. “If MSETCL wants to control the Covid-19 management in this fashion, it’s better to set up its own hospital. We direct it to reconsider this issue and accord proper sanction for donation CSR funds on the NTPC’s lines.” The rebuke came after MSETCL counsel DM Kale informed that it had sanctioned Rs2 crore, but it’s to be spent only for the infrastructure related to Covid pandemic or Mucormycosis. “We don’t think that this sanction is of any use. Granting it amounts to micromanaging the efforts taken by nodal authorities here for treating Covid-19, Mucormycosis and other notified diseases. In fact, most of the hospitals have already set up necessary infrastructure. What is now required is making the costlier drugs and treatments available to the patients,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/update-daily-remdesivir-info-on-portal-or-face-consequences-hc-to-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/83414719.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The company executing the KV Dham project has started civil work, including constructing retaining walls of the expanded platforms at the cremation ground at war footing. Old structures, including the steps leading to Manikarnika Ghat and its old platforms, have been demolished. Due to the ongoing construction work, people bringing bodies for cremation are reaching the river bank from the other side of the ghat. Also, many bodies are being cremated on the mud deposited to protect the under-construction retaining wall. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “Manikarnika Ghat is being renovated with 18 new pyre frames as part of KV Dham project. The cost of the renovation is included in the total cost budget Rs 339 crore of the KV Dham project sanctioned for all construction work. The project is likely to be completed by November 15.” Providing details of the project after an inspection of the project site, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “Six new pyre frames will come on three platforms each downstairs for traditionally cremating the bodies along the Ganga bank. It will be handed over to the Dom Raja family after completion.” “This will end the practice of burning bodies in an unorganized way and on the silt deposited near ghats following the flood season. Existing pyres under tin-shade with chimneys are not being disturbed,” he added. The DM said that apart from 18 new pyre frames at three platforms, two greenatoriums are also being built at Manikarnika Ghat with financial assistance from a company under the corporate responsibility fund (CRF). Municipal commissioner Gauran Rathi said, “The greenatoriums comprise the facility of setting body on wood to burn in electric furnaces. It will enable people to perform traditional rituals on pyres. It reduces use of wood up to 80%, which also brings down the cost of cremation. The site for establishing the greenatoriums at Manikarnika Ghat will be finalised soon.” Meanwhile, some groups including one led by manager of Baba Shamshan Nath Mandir Seva Samiti Gulshan Kapoor have opposed electric crematorium at Manikarnika Ghat. They have claimed that Shastras do not allow for such things. He said it is unfortunate to remove the buildings where priests used to perform rituals in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/manikarnika-ghat-to-get-18-new-pyres-2-greenatoriums/articleshow/83413185.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Kanpur||Uttar Pradesh: Plan of dalit man wishing to ride a horse in his ‘baraat’ goes awry||KANPUR: A dalit man from Mahoba, who had recently expressed the desire to ride a horse during his marriage procession against local tradition and was assured police protection, will have to wait as the woman he was going to marry has come out to be a minor girl. Messages circulating on social media have claimed that the bride-to-be is 17 years one months old as per her Aadhaar card. To recall, Alakhram Ahirwar, a native of Madhavganj in Mahobkanth area of Mahoba district, whose marriage was to be solemnised on June 18, had last week approached the local police seeking protection for riding a horse while going for a pre-marriage ritual on his wedding day. Locals had stated it will be probably for the first time since Independence when a dalit man would be riding a horse in the village. As soon as the message regarding the age of the bride-to-be went viral on social media wherein users claimed that on the basis of Aadhaar card, the girl is a minor, police ordered a probe. “We have initiated a probe after coming across viral messages on social media, wherein users have alleged that the girl with whom Ahirwar’s marriage is to be solemnised is a minor,” additional superintendent of police Mahoba RK Gautam told TOI on Thursday. He added, “CO Kulpahar has been instructed to conduct the probe and submit a report in this regard soon. If the girl would be found underage, Ahirwar’s application would be rejected.” Ahirwar, meanwhile, told the reporters that he was not aware of the exact age of his bride-to-be. “I came to know about the matter through viral messages on social media. I am a law abiding citizen and will cooperate fully with the police for a probe regarding her age,” he added. Alakhram Ahirwar, son of Gayadeen Ahirwar, had given an application to Mahobkanth police urging them to give him security for a pre-marriage ritual wherein he would ride a horse and visit a local temple prior to his ‘baraat’. Station house officer Mahobkanth Sunil Tiwari had told reporters that Alakhram Ahirwar had given in writing that he wanted police protection as he desired to ride a horse for a pre-marriage ritual at his wedding. The local panchayat too had stated that Ahirwar was given permission to ride a horse on his wedding day. Ahirwar had also sought support from various social organisations on social media platforms to help him in fulfilling his dream of riding a horse on his wedding day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/plan-of-dalit-man-wishing-to-ridea-horse-in-his-baraat-goes-awry/articleshow/83413070.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Sources said the party is drawing up a detailed plan on whom to tap and whom to touch base with. But, the party’s attention will be more on second rung TRS leaders, MLA ticket hopefuls and contestants who lost in the 2018 assembly elections. The party will also eye aspirants who lost out on assembly tickets and woo them into its fold, sources said. BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar said more leaders will join the party in the coming days.  “BJP is the only alternative to the TRS in Telangana,” he asserted. On Thursday, a meeting of party state general secretaries was held. The meeting primarily focused on the TRS government’s failures to keep its promises made to the people. “Many leaders are ready to join the BJP but have postponed their plans. We want to accelerate this process and discussed it elaborately at the meeting,” a senior party leader told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-to-lure-second-rung-trs-leaders-mla-ticket-hopefuls/articleshow/83412855.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

In the city to review Haj 2021, he said the campaign would also persuade people who are hesitant in taking the Covid-19 vaccine. On Haj 2021, he said India would follow the Haj advisory Saudi Arabia issues. “State Haj committees, waqf boards in states, Central Waqf Council, Maulana Azad Educational Foundation and many other social and educational organisations will participate in the campaign,” Naqvi said. The campaign will focus more on villages and women self-help groups will be roped in to persuade people to get vaccinated, he said. “We are with the Saudi government in its fight against the dreaded infectious disease. We will cooperate with it in whatever we can to stop the spread of the pandemic. We are awaiting their decision regarding Haj 2021 and will move ahead as soon as their decision comes,” he said. Earlier, the Saudi ministry of health had said only 60,000 pilgrims (15000 Saudi nationals and 45000 international pilgrims) will perform Haj this year. If this is followed, India may send around 5000 pilgrims out of the 2 lakh quota it has.

There were some issues regarding the land which were sorted out in the Wednesday’s meeting held under the chairmanship of Satish Mahana, cabinet minister for industries. Under the settlement, Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA) will give land for the mega cluster to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) named ‘Mega Leather Cluster Development UP Ltd’ on a 90-year lease instead of free hold. The SPV was insisting that land should be given free hold. During the meeting, it was decided that land allotment would take place under a tripartite system. According to director SPV, Ashraf Rizwan, this project is being developed in two villages — Magrasa and Karona Bahadur Nagar — where SPV has 22 acre land. The SPV has 35 acre of alternate land at Sardh village. UPSIDC had procured around 42 acre land in both the villages. The SPV will get 35.23 acre gram sabha land in the two villages in lieu of 35 acre land at Sardh. In total, it would get around 97 acre land. “The leather cluster thereafter will be developed in around 240 acres and it would be the first Greenfield project of the country,” Rizwan claimed. According to a release, the industries minister had asked the officials of the concerned department that the exchange process and construction of road and other processes must be completed by June 15, 2021 so that the chief minister could lay the foundation stone within three months. UPSIDA officials disclosed that the layout of the cluster and building map has been prepared. The cluster will attract an investment to the tune of Rs 13,000 crore. The Central government will spend around Rs 125 crore as financial assistance, while around Rs 200 would be given by NMCG for the treatment plant. State government will give a sum of Rs 50 crore for developing a common facility centre under one district one product scheme. Rizwan said so far 237 entrepreneurs have given their consent for the leather cluster, which would give employment to around 1.5 lakh persons including 50,000 skilled workers. He hoped that once the leather cluster would convert into a reality, the load of Jajmau would be reduced and the blot of polluting the Ganga river by the tanneries would be removed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/land-deal-done-ramaipur-mega-leather-cluster-will-soon-be-reality/articleshow/83413090.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ICSE student’s plea in Bombay HC against state move to hold CET||Mumbai: Bombay HC on Thursday directed the state government to respond to a petition challenging the common entrance test (CET) for junior college admissions based on the SSC board syllabus.A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Chandrakant Bhadang heard a petition by Ananya Patki of IES Orion School, Dadar. She urged the court to quash the state’s May 28 notification “declaring that admissions to standard XI/junior college in Maharashtra will be based on CET which in turn will be based solely only on the syllabus of SSC board.” Her plea said the notification is discriminatory because both the ICSE and state boards have different subjects. The syllabus is different even for common subjects.“ICSE board permits dropping of math and science, which is not permitted by SSC board,” her father Yogesh Patki argued, adding ICSE students will be at a disadvantage in the CET. He said the notification states CET is optional, but all those who appear for CET will be given admissions first and the balance seats will be given to other students.The petition said there are nearly 16 lakh SSC students. “Since the CET is based on their syllabus, if all of them or even 50% appear for the CET, this would mean all college seats in Maharashtra will be filled up by SSC students and there will be no seats left for the petitioner and students similar to her,” it added. Advocates Poornima Kantharia and Jyoti Chavan for the state said the CET date will be announced only after declaration of results by the different boards. Posting the hearing after two weeks for the state’s response, the judges said if the CET date is going to be notified, the petitioner must be informed about it. They granted Patki liberty to move the court if the date is declared before two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/icse-students-plea-in-bombay-hc-against-state-move-to-hold-cet/articleshow/83414765.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Nagpur||Revised vaccine rates at private hospitals come into effect amid confusion, in Nagpur||NAGPUR: The missing date of implementation in the union health ministry’s letter regarding revised charges of per dose of Covid19 vaccination has left private hospitals and citizens baffled. As a consequence, Kingsway Hospital — the only private Covid vaccination centre (CVC) inoculating 18+ group as of now in the city — was forced to refund the difference amount for registrations done since Wednesday morning. The ministry’s letter followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that all 18+ beneficiaries would get free vaccination from June 21. Private hospitals and citizens were under the impression that the revised rates would come into effect from June 21. Sources told TOI that Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) didn’t issue any separate guidelines but forwarded the letter in its WhatsApp group asking the CVCs to implement it. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said they received queries regarding the interpretation. “The circular doesn’t say the revised rates have to be made applicable from June 21. Hence the benefit must be passed on immediately,” he said. The ministry also tasked the state government to monitor the price of doses at private CVCs. The central government has notified Rs780, Rs1,410 and Rs1,145 for each dose of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik, respectively, at private hospitals. Cowin system too was reset from June 9 morning as per the new rates. Waseem Khan, vice president of district Youth Congress, said though the system showed Rs780 on June 9, he was charged Rs1,100 for Covishielld. After Khan made a post viral, he claimed the hospital refunded him but his relatives were yet to get a call for it. He said Rs100 were in excess of the revised rates. Amit Somani, director of Kingsway Hospital, said the hospital has refunded all those who registered and paid Rs1100 from Wednesday morning onwards as the central government’s circular. “Now, we are charging Rs780 for vaccination and Rs100 for hospital registration. Generally we charge Rs200 as registration fee for OPD for new patients and it can be used throughout the year. But for vaccination a 50% discount is being given. We were assuming the revised charges would be applicable from June 21 but we were asked to implement it from June 9,” he said. Somani also said that fresh stock is yet to arrive from Serum Institute of India while their phase I doses have exhausted. Meanwhile, 13.36 lakh beneficiaries have taken either of the two or both doses in Nagpur district as on June 9. Of these, 10.52lakh have taken their first dose. In NMC limits, over 5lakh in 45+ age group have taken their first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/revised-vax-rates-at-pvt-hospitals-come-into-effect-amid-confusion/articleshow/83414758.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hyderabad||CM likely to make Huzurabad a new district, name it after PV||Hyderabad: Is chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao aiming to kill two birds with one stone by declaring a new district of Huzurabad and naming it after former prime minister PV Narasimha Rao or naming an existing district after PV? Buzz in the political circles in the past few days is that the CM may declare Huzurabad as a new district and name it after PV on his birth centenary. Huzurabad assembly constituency, it may be recalled, is set for a by-election following the resignation of incumbent MLA Etala Rajender, who quit from the TRS and the assembly. He, however, is yet to submit his resignation to the speaker. The state government is officially celebrating PV’s birth centenary celebrations since June 28, 2020, by conducting year-long programmes. Due to the pandemic, it could not hold many programmes. PV’s native village Vangara is just 12 km from Huzurabad, but technically falls under Warangal urban district. There has been a demand from locals to create a new Huzurabad district, which is now part of Karimnagar district. Sources in the government and TRS said if Huzurabad is announced as a new district and named after PV, it would certainly boost the party’s prospects in the upcoming by-election from Huzurabad and also enable honouring the former PM. Sources said the CM is expected to make an announcement on June 28 in this regard. Official sources said there was a proposal to create the new district by taking Bheemadevarapally, Elkaturthy, Kamalapur from Warangal urban district and Huzurabad, Shankarapatnam, Veenavanka, Illanthakunta, Saidapur and Chigurumamidi mandals in Karimnagar district. Apart from this, two new villages — Challuru and Vavilala — would be made into mandals. But, the government is in a dilemma as well. If the new (34th) district is formed, two districts — Warangal urban and Karimnagar — would be shrunk further as more mandals will be taken away from them and added to the new district. Along with this, the government may run into problems on recruitment, employees and zonal issues. Some experts suggested that Warangal urban or rural district should be named after PV instead of creating a new district. Meanwhile, the government is gearing up to hold the closing ceremony of PV’s birth centenary celebrations both in his native Vangara village and installation of PV’s statue on Necklace Road, which has been renamed PV Narasimha Rao Marg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-likely-to-make-huzurabad-a-new-district-name-it-after-pv/articleshow/83412859.cms||Koride Mahesh

Prashant Sharma, a local resident, told TOI, “Social distancing norms are being openly flouted at the ghats. People can be seen roaming around without masks. What is worse, people from outside have been found creating a ruckus after drinking alcohol in public places.” Even though a negative RT-PCR report is still mandatory to enter Uttarakhand, many are reportedly arriving without a valid registration and Covid test, the locals pointed out. Recently, Muni-ki-Reti police in Rishikesh had arrested two staff members of a private lab for facilitating fake negative RT-PCR reports to eight tourists from Delhi at a check-post. The role of staff members in facilitating negative RT-PCR reports came to light after a surprise check by cabinet minister Subodh Uniyal at the spot. When queried about the concerns raised by residents regarding inappropriate Covid-related behaviour by pilgrims and visitors to the holy town, circle officer (city), Abhay Singh said, “We are requesting pilgrims to follow proper Covid-19 protocols. Penalty is being imposed on those not found wearing masks at Har-ki-Pauri. We have also detained some tourists for drinking alcohol in public places.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/restrictions-easing-covid-protocols-go-for-a-toss-at-har-ki-pauri/articleshow/83407643.cms||MS Nawaz

When queried when he will be taking his dose of the vaccine, Ramdev said, “I will take it soon.” He reiterated that his fight was not against any organisation. “There is no doubt that good allopathic doctors are like angels sent by God. They are indeed a blessing for earth. However, there are also doctors who are unscrupulous but for that, allopathy cannot be held responsible.” He added that his fight was against unscrupulous elements including those in the pharma industry. “Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadi Kendras had to be started in order to dispense generic medicines since branded medicines were being sold at exorbitant rates. We want that people are saved from unnecessary medication and surgeries.” He further said that “there is no doubt that allopathy is the best treatment in emergency care and surgery cases but other diseases like lifestyle and genetic diseases can be and are being cured by us through yoga and Ayurveda following the protocols laid down by our ancestors.” “This is the main point that I wanted to make. There is no controversy as such,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ramdev-says-he-will-take-covid-vaccine-soon-reiterates-that-he-is-not-against-allopathy-but-against-unscrupulous-doctors-pharma-mafia/articleshow/83407608.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Nagpur||Sex-sorted semen to ensure 90% female calves, more milk in Maharashtra||NAGPUR: If there are laws preventing gender-based selective elimination of the girl child, here is a state government scheme that ensures doing away with an unwanted male progeny — but for cattle. The state government has come up with a scheme under which farmers can get sex-sorted semen for artificial insemination of cows and buffaloes at highly subsided rates. The technology separates male sperms from the spermatozoa, this leads to a 90% chance of the animal delivering a female calf. The government is not only viewing it as a means to increase milk production but also a solution to illegal cattle smuggling following the beef ban. The Maharashtra State Animal Husbandry Board has entered into an agreement with Genus Breeding India Private Limited (ABS India) to buy 6.80 lakh sex-sorted semen doses, at Rs 575 per dose. Based at Pune, this is a subsidiary of UK bovine genetics major Genus PLC. The semen will be made available at a subsidized rate of Rs81 to the farmer. The scheme is an initiative of animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar. The state press release said according to 2017 census there 89.04 lakh cows and buffaloes in the state. Out of these, artificial insemination is done on nearly 25 lakh cattle. This produces 13 lakh calves, out of which half are male. The idea is that male calves are no longer needed as much as earlier so the birth rate can be controlled. With mechanization of agriculture, bullocks are no longer needed for ploughing as it was earlier. These days a male calf born to a cattle rearer has become a burden. The animal is either sold illegally to the slaughter house, or left to stray. Illegal sales leads to clashes with cow vigilantes and cases of violence. “Instead, if there are more chances of having a female calf, it would help the rearers increase their income through higher milk production, and also prevent illegal sale for beef. The farmers would prefer to keep the cows with them,” said a senior official in the state’s animal husbandry department. The technology is already available and is also encouraged under centre’s National Gokul Mission. The sex-sorted semen is available from two companies. Genus Breeding emerged as the lowest bidder in the tender process following which the agreement has been entered into with it, a source said. Earlier, the plan was to get a transfer of technology, which could not materialize due to intellectual property rights (IPR) issue. Even as the technology was available, it could not find enough takers due to affordability. The companies charge Rs1,000 to 1,200 per dose. It takes around three doses of artificial insemination for ensuring pregnancy. Since it involved a substantial cost, farmers avoided it, said an official. Now, under the subsidy scheme, a single dose will be available for Rs81. Out of the Rs575 to be paid to Genus Breeding, Rs 261 will come from the centre, Rs174 from the state and another Rs100 either from milk unions operating in a given area or the state’s animal husbandry board. Replying to a question, regarding regions like Vidarbha where farmers still depend on bullocks for farming, state’s principal secretary (animal husbandry) Anoop Kumar said it is an optional scheme. Moreover, in the first phase only 2 lakh doses will be made available. Sajal Kulkarni, an independent activist taking up herders’ issue, said it would have been better if the technology was developed in the country itself. Instead of increasing the population of cows, the government should stress on fodder management and better pricing for milk, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sex-sorted-semen-to-ensure-90-female-calves-more-milk/articleshow/83414766.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Illegal structures come up when admin’s weak’||Mumbai: The crash at Malad that killed 12 was the second this week involving an illegal structure on government land. On Monday, one person died and five were injured after the portion of a house wall collapsed on another house in Bandra (E). Monday’s structure was on railway land, while Thursday’s crash was on the Collector’s land. Senior officials pointed out that government land owned by BMC, Mhada, public works department (state and central), Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) and Railways were most vulnerable to encroachments, and authorities turn a blind eye when shanties come up. Once the land is taken over by slums, illegal extensions continue and the buck passes from one agency to another to demolish them. “The Malad structure was part of slums on Collector’s land. The structures are illegal and were first ground floor structures. They later turned into five-storey structures. BMC had written to the Collector to take action but nothing was done as BMC failed to provide men and machinery. Police also did not get into action. This is the result of a nexus between the agencies and netas who are nurturing the slums as vote-banks,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra, who had written to the Collector’s office against the illegal slums in May. Officials said usually BMC writes to land owners to take action against illegal constructions after they receive complaints, and they carry out an inspection. But agencies like the Collector’s office don’t have machinery to demolish the structures, and write back to BMC for manpower and machinery. BMC writes to police seeking protection during demolitions. Police rarely agree to give protection and demolitions are carried out. Former bureaucrat Mahesh Zagde said illegal encroachments are a sign of weak administration. “Slums and illegal structures come up when the administration is weak or if it is in connivance with encroachers. Keeping a check on illegal constructions is BMC’s job, regardless of who owns the land. The structures must be checked throughout the year and not only during monsoon. The administration fails when slums come up in the first place,” Zagde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-illegal-structures-come-up-when-admins-weak/articleshow/83414788.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Goyal held a review meeting to ascertain the preparedness as well as draw up a contingency plan for monsoon. The minister examined current status of vulnerable areas a day after flooding was reported on CR and WR tracks. He advised Railways to partner with institutions like IIT-B to study the efficiency of technical and civil work initiatives of Railways in handling cisis situation. “Innovation and hard work must go together to ensure railway services continue to operate safely and in an uninterrupted manner,” he said. In July 2018 too, Railways had roped in IIT experts to study overhead structures and recommend action after the collapse of Andheri’s Gokhale bridge. So far, Railways has cleared 1.5 cubic metres of muck from CR and 2.1 cubic metres from WR’s suburban section. Flooding spots have been identified based on past records and customised solution are being devised for each spot. Drones are being used to survey and monitor cleaning of nallah in Borivali-Virar section and de-sludging machines have been installed to ensure deep cleaning of culverts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rly-min-goyal-calls-for-roping-in-iit-b-to-tackle-monsoon-woes/articleshow/83416044.cms||Manthank Mehta

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Elephant, leopard die due to old age||HYDERABAD: The Nehru Zoological Park lost an 83-year-old female Asiatic elephant named Rani and a 21-year-old male leopard named Ayyappa to old age on Wednesday. Born on October 7, 1938, Rani was one of the oldest elephants in captivity. It was transferred from Bagh-e-Aam (Public Gardens, Nampally) to the Nehru Zoological Park on October 1, 1963. She was regularly featured at the Bonalu and Moharram processions. According to zoo officials, Rani had been suffering from old age related complications and was undergoing treatment under the supervision of the zoo veterinary team. Supportive medicines and special supplements were being regularly administered to improve her quality of life. “Due to arthritis, she was not able to lie down and rest like the other elephants. Therefore, an earthern mound was prepared in her enclosure which enabled her to lean and take some rest. She consumed food till her last day and left for her heavenly abode without any major physical suffering,” read a press release issued by the zoo authorities. Normal life expectancy of an Asiatic elephant is 60 years and in captivity, it is 70 years. Following Rani’s demise, the zoo is left with four Asiatic elephants (one male and three females). The male leopard Ayyappa, born on June 16, 2000, was received from Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park, Tirupati and died due to multiple organ failure. “Ayyappa was under the observation of zoo veterinarians at its enclosure. The average lifespan of leopard is 15 years in wild and 18 years in captivity,” read the press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/elephant-leopard-die-due-to-old-age/articleshow/83412892.cms||---

Efforts made by scientists at Navsari Agricultural University (NAU) are now reaping commercial and environmental benefits. The university has signed 31 memorandums of understanding (MoU) with companies, foundations, and a cooperative society for commercial production of this fertilizer. The university signed its latest MoUs with Shree Khedut Sahakari Ginning & Processing Society Ltd, based in Bardoli, and a Mumbai-based company on Tuesday and Wednesday. “During the experiments of developing products from banana pseudo stem this liquid fertilizer was also developed from its sap as it is rich in potassium and iron. Through different processes and working on it for five years, the liquid fertilizer was developed and its international patent was also secured,” said Dr Chirag Desai, assistant research scientist at NAU. While Desai handles the project now, the product was initially developed by Dr RG Patil and Dr BN Kolambe. The scientists started working on developing products from banana pseudo stem as farmers were incurring loss while disposing it. “It saves the environment and farmers also getting bumper crops due to the presence of nutrients and plant growth hormones in the fertilizer,” Desai said. He added that after using this, farmers have reduced using chemicals. By transferring the technology for production, the university is also benefiting economically as the companies that manufacture the fertilizer under their brand names have to pay 2% royalty to NAU. In the last financial year alone, 45 lakh litre of fertilizer were sold. “Farmers in all states are using the fertilizer,” Desai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/naus-banana-stem-manure-a-big-hit/articleshow/83410520.cms||---

However, the department warned that the possibility of heavy rainfall on June 11 remains. The rain intensity will increase from June 12. “For a region like Goa, if we even get heavy rain for a day, it is only from the second or third day that we find some impact. The orange warning has now been issued for June 12 to 14,” IMD scientist Rahul M said. He said that this was going to be a continuous event and IMD warnings will be frequently updated in the coming days. “Numerical weather prediction models indicate that the intensity of rainfall will increase from June 12 onwards. The possibility of very heavy rainfall is still there for June 11,” he said. TOI had reported on Thursday that an orange alert was issued for Goa warning of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the state. The IMD attributed the reason for the phenomenon to the low pressure area formed over North Bay of Bengal and surrounding areas on June 7, which is likely to become “more marked”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/imd-revises-dates-orange-alert-now-from-june-12-14/articleshow/83414820.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Install armoured cables: Study||Sarus Crane is seen feeding the little one from her own beak during a hot summer day at Chattbir Zoological Park near Chandigarh. Photo-Deep KumarAhmedabad: Evaluating the threat to sarus cranes in Gujarat, researchers found that electrocution and death by kite strings played a major role in reducing the number of this already endangered bird. Shifting the power lines away from the breeding, nesting and roosting areas would go a long way in the conservation of the species, suggested the experts. Electrocution has been one of the major reasons across the world for mortality of many species of birds, particularly those with large wing span. Nearly 6-foot tall, with a wingspan of 8 feet, sarus crane is the world’s tallest flying bird. The study by SACON on ‘Assessment of status, distribution and threats to the population of threatened Sarus Crane Antigone in Gujarat’ suggested that a wide range of power line markings, such as bird flight diverter, bird flight flapper, fire-fly diverter, swinging plates, coloured aviation balls and spiral vibration dampers are practised elsewhere to warn birds into changing their flight path.” The permanent solution would be to shift the power lines away from the breeding and nesting or roosting areas. The study stated that in areas where possibilities of electrocution are more, insulating existing naked conductors or replacing them with armoured cables is another option. The study found that armoured cables need to be installed in a phased manner in Vastana, Khandhali and Indervarna areas in Kheda district, Daloli, Padra and Bhanderaj areas in Anand district, Dholka, as well as Sanand, Bavla and Sankol areas in Ahmedabad district. The study also suggested that network of transmission and distribution lines have to be mapped, particularly in agricultural and wetland landscapes to locate stretches where the birds are more prone to electrocution. “More viable solutions can be worked out with Gujarat State Electricity Board and power generation and distribution companies. New power lines passing through important bird areas must be bird-friendly or rerouted so that many species of larger birds can be saved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/install-armoured-cables-study/articleshow/83413002.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

Varni police said the bodies of Lakshmi, 20, and Mohan, 19, were found by local villagers. Their bodies were in a decomposed condition. About 25 days ago, Lakshmi, who was already married to one Raju, left the house without informing anyone. Her family members lodged a missing complaint at Nizam Sagar police station. Police, however, could not trace her. On Thursday, locals of Varni noticed the bodies and they alerted police. After verifying missing complaints in the district, police established that the body was that of Lakshmi. Later, they identified the body of Mohan. “Lakshmi got married to Raju six months ago. She was already in love with Mohan,’’ police said. The couple did not leave any suicide note. Police suspect the couple took the extreme step more than 10 days ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-teen-lover-die-by-suicide/articleshow/83413010.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Eight children among 12 killed as illegal building in Malad crashes||MUMBAI: Twelve people, eight of them children, were killed and seven others injured after an illegal three-storey building collapsed in Malad’s Malwani locality around 11pm on Wednesday. The youngest victim was a one-and-a-half-year-old. The forewarning of impending disaster had come last month during Cyclone Tauktae, when the building developed a fissure. Wednesday’s record downpour proved the final straw. The top portion of the unnamed building gave way and crashed onto two single-storey structures. The unlawful “builder” Rafiq Siddiqui lost nine members of his family, including his wife, his brother and his wife, and their six children. Siddiqui and a contractor, Ramzan Shaikh, have been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. CM Uddhav Thackeray announced an ex-gratia sum of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the deceased. PM Narendra Modi also announced Rs 2 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund for the kin of the dead, and Rs 50,000 each for grievously injured victims. The CM, along with his son, tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, mayor Kishori Pednekar and BMC commissioner I S Chahal visited Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli, where the injured have been admitted. Malwani police registered a case under IPC section 304 (2) of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against Siddiqui and a contractor, Ramzan Shaikh, who had constructed the building around eight years ago. Additional police commissioner Dilip Sawant said, “The structure was constructed illegally. It developed a visible crack during the recent cyclone and collapsed on Wednesday. We registered a case against the two and arrested Ramzan Shaikh on Thursday.” An adjoining three-storey building appeared shaky and was evacuated. The collector’s office and BMC blamed each other for not having demolished the illegal structure. It was built on the collector’s plot, whereas the BMC is the planning authority. Wednesday night’s collapse followed a day of torrential rain. Horrified neighbours heard a loud thud and saw the building go down. They rushed to rescue survivors from the debris before the fire brigade arrived, whose officials then took over the task. Through the night, rescuers pulled out 18 people who were rushed to Shatabdi Hospital. Only seven managed to survive. Of them Marikumari Hirangana, 30, was in critical condition. The body of one victim, a milk shop owner who had his ship in the illegal building, was found on Thursday. He, along his son, had tried to escape when the structure tilted a few seconds before it came down. While the son sustained serious injuries in the leg and is in hospital, he told police his father may have got trapped in the debris. Ten of the victims were from the illegal building, while the other two were from the structure it crashed on. Of the 12 killed, eight were minors, with the youngest being 1.5 years old. The video of a child being pulled out from the ruins went viral and showed rescuers trying to remove mud from her body. Soyat Shaikh and his mother Rubina were having dinner when the three-storey building collapsed onto their house. They were trapped inside. He said, “Nothing was visible. Somehow, we pushed the door open and managed to come out. We then pulled out others who were living on upper floors.” Sangram, who was hanging about with his friends, said, “The trapped people were screaming for help. We rushed forward and began to remove the rubble. Through the bricks, I saw the hair of a woman and managed to pull her out. I lifted her on my shoulders to the main road, where people shifted her to hospital in an autorickshaw. I feel happy to learn that she survived.” Officials said that save for the ground floor, the upper storeys were illegal and built without a care for structural stability. The BMC said the structure came under the collector’s land and therefore did not figure on its list of dilapidated buildings. A senior fire brigade officer said rescue operations were hampered as it was not possible to take heavy machinery through the narrow alley. “However, by Thursday morning, we managed to clear the rubble and have accounted for all survivors,” he said. As the opposition BJP criticised the BMC and state government, mayor Kishori Pednekar said, “These are illegal structures, and they have not come up after 2020 (the MVA government was formed in November 2019). The previous government could have acted against them. People have lost their family members, one should understand their suffering and we should come together to resolve this issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/8-children-among-12-killed-as-illegal-buildling-in-malad-crashes/articleshow/83416097.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Ahmedabad||B group students can opt for engg||Ahmedabad: Paving the way for B group students of science stream to take admission in engineering courses, the All India Council of Technical Education has granted permission for change in discipline. The students who clear Class 12 board exams with biology cannot usually take admission in engineering courses, and there was a demand to permit such students to opt for engineering. The state government had in principle agreed to the proposal for the same made by engineering college managements. Now, the AICTE has granted permission, but the students will have to take a bridge course for this changeover, sources said. The engineering college managements were pursuing their demand because nearly 35,000 engineering seats remain vacant every year, whereas most of the B group students could not make it to medical courses because there is a shortage of seats in this discipline.  Sources said that there are a little over 40,000 seats in medical courses, but due to recent mass promotion, the number of students clearing Class 12 in B group is double the number of seats available in medical courses. A passage to engineering courses might give students some relief as they get an opportunity to pursue their careers in another discipline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/b-group-students-can-opt-for-engg/articleshow/83413040.cms||---

Children aged 6-11 years may wear a mask depending on the ability of the child to use it safely and appropriately under the direct supervision of parents or guardians, the guidelines say. However, children above 12 should wear amask just as adults do. While the drug remdesivir has not been recommended for treatment of Covid-19 in kids, rational use of high-resolution CT (HRCT) imaging has been suggested to monitor the effect of the disease on lungs. The guidelines also advise against use of steroids in asymptomatic and mild cases as it can be harmful and could lead to other severe problems. The use of steroids has been recommended only in hospitalised moderately severe and critically ill cases under strict supervision. “Steroids should be used at the right time, in the right dose and for the right duration. Self-medication of steroids must be avoided,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-rules-discourage-mask-use-in-u-5-kids/articleshow/83419528.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Murder witness seeks CBI probe into son’s abduction||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Thursday issued notice to the state government, the Centre and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after one of the witnesses in Amit Jethava murder case sought transfer of investigation into kidnapping of his son to the CBI. Dharmendragiri Goswami was a witness who turned hostile after his minor son was allegedly kidnapped while he was in the witness box. He informed the court about the incident and left the witness box. Later, while convicting six persons including former BJP MP from Junagadh Dinu Bogha Solanki and his nephew Pratap alias Shiva Solanki in July 2019, the CBI court had ordered CBI and Gujarat police to conduct a joint inquiry and report on the kidnapping of the minor. After inquiry, an FIR was lodged at Una police station in 2020 and chargesheet was filed against one person. Goswami and Jethava’s father Bhikhabhai approached HC nearly a year after registration of FIR and said that the minor was kidnapped to prevent Goswami from giving evidence. Their advocate Anand Yagnik complained that Una inspector Vijay Chaudhari had not been conducting investigation in a proper manner and was not taking action against the Solankis. Besides, the petitioners claimed that the administration and police from the Union territory of Diu had been harassing Goswami by causing disruptions in his contract for marine sports. They also alleged that the Diu officials acted outside Diu jurisdiction to pressurise Goswami into settling the dispute with the accused in the Amit Jethava murder case. The petitioners sought transfer of the probe either to the CBI or to an IPS officer of IG cadre in Gujarat police. They urged for completion of investigation. They also asked for an FIR against concerned Diu officials for their alleged action outside their jurisdiction. An inquiry by the central authority has been also sought into how the officials of the union territory allegedly pressured Goswami to enter into a compromise. The petitioners have also sought suspension or transfer of the Una inspector and an immediate stay on current probe. Justice Vipul Pancholi issued a notice and sought reply from various authorities by July 19. The murder trial has a chequered history with the HC ordering a re-trial after 105 out of 196 witnesses turning hostile. The SC restricted re-trial to re-examination of 26 witnesses, but 25 turned hostile again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/murder-witness-seeks-cbi-probe-into-sons-abduction/articleshow/83413072.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Court lets woman go with her lover||PALAKKAD: The first-class judicial magistrate court, Alathur, has allowed Sajitha, a woman who had been living with her lover at his house in hiding for the past 10 years, to go with her lover, Rehman. They are now living in a rented house at Vithinasseri near Nemmara since March this year, after they left Rehman’s house where the girl had claimed to have lived without the knowledge of the family for a decade. Nemmara police produced her in the court after the weird incident came to light recently as her family had lodged a missing complaint in 2010 and also due to the fact that she was not legally married to Rehman. Rehman claimed that he was in love with Sajitha, who was his neighbour, and brought her to his house when she was hardly 18 years old and kept her for the past 10 years without the knowledge of his father, mother and a mentally unsound sister. Police brought Sajitha to the house of Rehman to verify their claim. But the police did not believe the story and felt that the family of Rehman must be in the know of the presence of the woman in the house. The woman told reporters when asked how she spent time when Rehman was out of the house, she said that she used to watch television. She also said that on some occasions the other members of the family used to knock at the door but she did not open it! So the police strongly believe that the family knew about her presence but they must have been afraid to reveal it since the girl belonged to another religion, said Nemmara circle inspector of police Deepakumar. “As Rehman was mentally ill, his family members kept him at a distance. He utilized this condition to bring his lover to his house. There was a missing case filed by her parents 10 years ago. But it was closed by police after two years when there was no clue about the girl. Rehman was never suspected because nobody thought that he was in love with Sajitha,” the CI said. Rehman’s brother had in March filed a complaint with Nemmara police that his brother was missing. On Monday, he saw Rehman near Nemmara police station and informed the police, who took him to the station. He told police that he left the house along with his lover and they were living in a rented house at Vithinasseri . “Since there was no formal marriage between the two, the woman was produced before the magistrate and her statement was recorded and on her appeal she was allowed to go with Rehman to their rented house,” the CI said. The lovers told the police that they were living in constant fear as they belonged to two different religions. But now the girl’s family is happy that at last they could find out that she is alive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/court-lets-woman-go-with-her-lover/articleshow/83413096.cms||---

More than 7,000 students are set to travel to countries such as Canada, US and UK to pursue higher education. Following a rise in Covid-19 cases, the Telangana government deferred all the undergraduate and postgraduate examinations in March this year. Subsequently, the government declared a statewide lockdown, which continues to be in place partially till June 19. The delay in conducting the examination has forced many students to defer their joining to foreign institutions. “The deadline to submit my certificates to the Canadian institution was May 15. Since the exams were not held, I was unable to do so. Due to this, I had to defer my admission from the September intake to the January intake,” said Alekhya Pagilla, a student who secured admission at Humber Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning in Toronto, Canada. Students said that their requests seeking exemptions from the foreign institutions are not being entertained. “I had written to the university seeking an exemption. However, they asked me to defer my joining by another six month and join during the winter intake. I am now waiting for an update on my semester exams,” said a student who secured admission at a university at Ontario, Canada. Meanwhile, the Telangana collegiate and technical education commissioner Navin Mittal told TOI that priority is being given to conduct final year exams at the earliest. “As per the UGC guidelines, universities will decide the examination schedule. Top priority is to conduct final year exams to enable students to get admissions in higher education institutions,” said Mittal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delay-in-final-year-exams-leaves-foreign-bound-students-reeling/articleshow/83414881.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Pune||Cheaper form of mucormycosis drug ‘as good as costlier version’||PUNE: The Centre's Joint Task Force has clarified that conventional amphotericin B is ‘equally efficacious’ as its more expensive version in the treatment of Covid-associated mucormycosis. The task force advisory brings massive relief to patients nationwide. Most doctors treating mucormycosis have been apprehensive about using conventional amphotericin (deoxycholate), citing its impact on the kidneys by triggering nephrotoxicity. Instead, they have been insisting on the extremely expensive (liposomal) formulation of the drug. But a minimum 21-day course of the liposomal form can cost anywhere between Rs 7.5 lakh to Rs 17 lakh, depending on a patient's body weight. Treatment with conventional amphotericin (deoxycholate) for the same period only costs about Rs 8,000 to Rs 16,000. The task force experts said conventional amphotericin B can be administered without worry, as long as doctors monitor patients’ kidney functions and electrolytes imbalance. The Joint National Task Force for Covid-19 is an expert body of the NITI Aayog and the ICMR. “The Joint National Task Force has recommended that amphotericin B — both in the amphotericin B lipid complex/liposomal form and the amphotericin B deoxycholate form — is equally efficacious for the treatment of Covid associated mucormycosis (CAM) cases,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to states and union territories on June 7, 2021. The health ministry has requested states and UTs to widely disseminate the advisory among doctors across public and private hospitals. In a June 7 report, TOI had said that administering conventional amphotericin, along with careful monitoring of kidney functions, can reduce mucormycosis treatment cost by 100 times and make it affordable for the masses. The liposomal form of amphotericin injections cost the patient Rs 35,000 per day. The conventional form of the drug (deoxycholate) costs just Rs 350 per day, but needs a blood test every alternate day to rule out the drug toxicity in the kidneys. Infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the national task force, said, “Use of conventional amphotericin does not cause long-term kidney complications. All minor kidney issues, post-conventional amphotericin therapy, are fully reversible.” Medical experts noted that an “unwarranted fear” of conventional amphotericin causing kidney damage has led to the hyped demand for the liposomal form. “It is the fear of ‘kidney damage’ in the minds of the public as well as treating physicians that has led to the overrating of the liposomal form. We should dispel this fear. Careful and regular monitoring with blood creatinine and few other tests can tide over this risk and make use of conventional amphotericin effective,” said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi. Joshi, who is the head of department of ENT at the state-run B J Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, has treated about 201 patients with post-Covid mucormycosis. “More than 85% of these patients recovered through monitored use of conventional amphotericin and carefully planned debridement surgeries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cheaper-form-of-mucor-drug-as-good-as-costlier-version/articleshow/83414917.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The notice was issued by the single judge bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari and the court has now given Vardhan six weeks to respond. The HC had, in June last year, while hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL), directed the officer to take action on the allegations of misuse of funds in the Mahadevi Kanya Pathshala Inter College Society within four months. However, the petitioner has now reached the HC alleging that no action has been taken to address the issue even after a year. As reported by TOI earlier, a PIL was filed in the HC by an alumna of the MKP College. The petition alleged that the funds allocated for the infrastructure work in the college were either siphoned off or used for procuring items that were of no use. The petition further alleged that the University Grants Commission stopped giving grants to the college due to this 'misappropriation of funds', directly affecting the quality of education at the college. According to the petition, the state government had prepared an audit report of the college in 2014 which highlighted that no fund utilisation certificate was ever submitted to the UGC. The CAG also submitted a report in June 2016 which recorded how equipment worth Rs 47.08 lakhs was purchased only based on quotations. The petition further alleged that even the equipment purchased were never entered into the college stock registers. Meanwhile, the former principal of the college and the secretary of the MKP Society have dismissed these allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/misappropriation-of-funds-at-doons-mkp-college-hc-issues-contempt-notice-against-principal-secretary-higher-education-for-not-taking-action/articleshow/83410690.cms||Prashant Jha

Not more than 50 persons will be allowed into the temple premises at a given point in time. Due measures have been taken to enforce social distancing in the temple premises. No devotees will be allowed to stand inside the temple, they can quickly offer prayers and leave. Each will be allowed in after thermal screening and wearing of masks is mandatory,” said a representative of Arasuri Ambaji Mata Devasthan Trust. Many temples have also introduced a pass system. Vijaysinh Chavda, general manager of the Somnath Temple Trust, said, “Devotees seeking to offer prayers at Somnath Temple will need to obtain a pass either online or in-person.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/major-temples-in-state-to-reopen-today/articleshow/83414944.cms||---

---||Dehradun||One-time settlement scheme: MDDA refuses to issue new maps without dismantling unauthorised construction||DEHRADUN: The Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) has refused to issue compounded maps of properties without dismantling unauthorised construction. This has left the property owners — who were willing to regularise their 'unauthorised' construction — in a fix. The civic body has said that it will only issue provisional maps to people who have applied to avail the benefit of the one-time settlement (OTS) scheme, which aims to help property owners regularise their unauthorised construction by paying a one-time fee. The architects' association working with MDDA has asked the officials to further relax a few regulations so that all the property owners — commercial and residential — could benefit under the OTS scheme. Ranvir Singh Chauhan, MDDA, VC, clarified that the government has given major relaxations to the people under the OTS scheme. Initially, a 10% compounding was permitted which was later increased to 20%, said the official. The officials from the MDDA also informed that once the Covid curfew restrictions are lifted, camps will be set up at various locations in the city to facilitate the submission of maps by the people. Talking to TOI, Vinay Singh, an architect, said “We had suggested that in cases where the maps have lapsed, property owners must be given six months to rectify. The scheme will help people regularise their properties for which a major overhaul has been done in the software which faced issues due to updates in the bylaws. MDDA will start accepting files under the OTS scheme soon after the Covid curfew restrictions are lifted.” “The changes in the software will result in minimal scope of manual intervention which will make the process of approval of maps seamless”, added the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/one-time-settlement-scheme-mdda-refuses-to-issue-new-maps-without-dismantling-unauthorised-construction/articleshow/83410660.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The operation was described by Rear Admiral Krishna Swaminathan, AVSM, VSM, Flag Officer Offshore Defence Advisory Group and Advisor Offshore Security and Defence to the Government of India.He was speaking at an event at Gujarat Maritime University on June 7. At the programme, he interacted with the students too. He spoke at length about the Indian Navy’s role in saving the lives of seafarers onboard the vessels which had drifted from Mumbai high seas to the Gujarat coast during cyclone Tauktae. Rear Admiral Swaminathan said warships were prepared in the shortest possible time to carry rescue operations. They were otherwise preparing for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief operations in affected coastal areas of Gujarat. The“The warships that reached the scene first for the herculean search operation were INS Kochi, INS Kolkata, and INS Talwar,” he said in his speech. “In the case of accommodation barge P-305 with 261 persons onboard, the crew abandoned ship as it was taking in water and tilting dangerously to one end,” he said. “All onboard holding the railing for hours jumped into the waters and were rescued in challenging weather conditions by using the ship’s ‘scramble’ net.” The crew was advised by the Navy to stay in clusters so it’s easier to find them in the rough sea, he added. “The fatigue caused by holding on to some portion of the vessel for hours and then holding on to each other after jumping into the waters is something difficult to express in words,” he said. The search and rescue operation included focus on barge GAL Constructor with 137 personnel onboard, barge SS-3 with 202 personnel, Sagar Bhushan drilling ship with 101 personnel, and tug Varaprada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/before-rescue-navy-quelled-fear-in-sailors/articleshow/83413127.cms||---
---||Pune||Maha tops in varsity enrolment of students||Pune: More women among the total number of students were enrolled for higher education, from certificate courses to doctoral programmes, in Maharashtra. Their numbers were up from 19.05 lakh in 2018-19 to 19.51 lakh in 2019-20, the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report released on Thursday said. The report also said the Gender Parity Index for the state rose from 0.86 in 2015-16 to 0.93 in 2019-20. The index is better when it is closer to 1. Maharashtra with 4,494 colleges is second after Uttar Pradesh, with 34 colleges available per lakh population. In terms of state-share in 2019-20, the state tops in the enrolment in universities, including constituent units like sub-centres, with 9.67 lakh students, followed by Tamil Nadu with 9.26 lakh and Delhi with 8.16 lakh pupils. But, the number of foreign students enrolled in the state was down to 4,599 in 2019-20 as against 5003 in 2018-19. Pune has retained its fourth place in the country as the city with the highest number of colleges at 467 compared to 450 in 2018-19. Dhanraj Mane, state director for higher education, said the increase in colleges in rural areas is one of the reasons for more girls enrolling in higher education. “Hostel facilities are made available to them. The free bus pass girl students get helps them to complete school education and enter college. The increase in nursing colleges in the state has helped more women take up the course as the possibility of getting a job is high. Women have also started taking the benefit of various scholarships available to them due to better awareness of the schemes, which boosts higher enrolment,” Mane added. V N Magare, pro-vice chancellor of SNDT Women’s University, said awareness about women empowerment is increasing resulting in more of them taking up higher education. “As an exclusive university for women, our founding fathers wanted to empower them. We provide skill-based education which helps them get a job easily and that helps them stand on their own feet. This inspires other women to take up higher education too. The numbers will increase more in the coming years,” Magare added.

They have an aggressive marketing strategy that attracts foreign students that we lack. This can be one reason for the decline.” Another senior official from SPPU said that one of the reasons for the decline may also be due to the tougher admission policy for international students in Maharashtra. “Technical education, especially engineering, is sought after by these students but when it comes to admission in the state, it is a lengthy and difficult process with hardly any counselling available to the students. This process needs to be streamlined,” he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-tops-in-varsity-enrolment-of-students/articleshow/83414957.cms||Ardhra Nair

In the district, 2,037 tests were done on Wednesday, 45 people, including the baby and her parents, tested positive. One person died of Covid while undergoing treatment at the Sangareddy government hospital. The parents of the baby, who had symptoms of Covid-19, went to the Narayankhed government hospital to get a test done on Wednesday. As the baby also had fever, a test was also conducted on her and she tested positive for the virus. “This is the first time that we have a case where a months-old baby has tested positive. The baby is being taken care of and being given medication,” Sangareddy in-charge district medical and health officer (DMHO) Gayathri Devi told TOI. The parents have also reportedly tested positive. The family has been asked to be in home isolation. According to officials, the baby was being given medication in the form of drops and medical personnel were in regular touch with the family.

---||Thane||Thane: Woman (27) falls from auto fending off cell robbers, dies||THANE: A 27-year-old woman was killed after she fell off an autorickshaw while trying to fend off two bike-borne thieves who eventually managed to snatch her mobile and flee near the bustling Teen Hath Naka area of Thane on Wednesday evening. Late on Thursday evening, police said two youths were arrested based on technical analysis. The duo, Alkesh Ansari, 20, and Sohail Ansari 18, are residents of Bhiwandi. TimesViewNot only is this incident tragic, but also shocking that it occurred near an important traffic junction in Thane. Growing street crime, especially those involving chain and mobile snatching is a menace. Women are mostly the target of such crimes. The cops have their job cut out for them and increase patrolling. Citizens are naturally worried. The police, who said they arrested two people, must file a watertight case against them and try to fast track it in the court.The victim, Kanmila Raising, a native of a village in Manipur, stayed at Kalina along with her sister and was working in a spa at a mall. Raising and her friend, who is the complainant in the case, were headed back home in an autorickshaw after work when the incident occurred near an open gym on the Eastern Express Highway, just before Teen Hath naka.  Police said the two accused had been following the autorickshaw on their bike. The pillion rider tried to snatch Raising’s mobile phone, but she held on to it. The other accused then pulled her onto the road. Since she was holding the mobile, the duo snatched it and fled, the complaint stated. “Raising lost consciousness and sustained major injuries on her head, while the accused fled with the mobile worth Rs 10,000,” said a police officer. Her friend took her to a private hospital initially and then to Kalwa hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival. A case has been registered with Naupada police station for robbery and culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The incident has triggered fear among citizens who questioned policing on the streets especially since a similar incident occurred less than a week ago. On June 4, a bike-borne thief snatched the mobile phone of a pillion rider on the highway. The victim tried to resist, but ended up with injuries after the accused kicked the bike. The case is registered at Rabodi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/woman-27-falls-from-auto-fending-off-cell-robbers-dies/articleshow/83416090.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

---||Pune||Centre for near-to-home jabs; in Pune BJP starts limited door-to-door drive||PUNE: The BJP on Thursday launched a limited door-to-door vaccination programme for those with disabilities in the city despite the party-led central government arguing in courts that such drives were not feasible. The Centre, citing safety concerns, had said that instead of home vaccinations, near-to-home drives were more preferable. But on Thursday, the city BJP — currently holding majority in the PMC — launched “Ghari Yeu Aani Las Deu” from the Kasba Peth constituency, a party stronghold. The programme, BJP leadership said, aims to cover bedridden citizens and those with mobility issues. “It is not door-to-door vaccination for all,” said Hemant Rasane, BJP corporator and chairman of the standing committee. “The initiative has been taken to vaccinate citizens who cannot move out of their homes because of physical ailments. This is a personal initiative. It is being supported by me and well-wishers. It’s not against any government policy and has been carried out with all required permissions,” he said. Organisers of the drive — also launched to celebrate BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil’s birthday — said it would go on till June 20. It’s free of cost for beneficiaries. Rasane said they would ensure “not a single dose is wasted”. In arguments against door-to-door jabs, the Centre had said vaccine wastage was a key concern, stating that vials, once opened, could be wasted while traveling to each beneficiary’s doorstep. Rasane said the PMC drive would ensure that all doses were administered within a couple of hours of opening a vial (according to policy, a vial once opened should be used up within four hours). Names of beneficiaries are being collected with help from local party workers and organisers said a location must have at least 10 eligible citizens — all in immediate vicinity of each other — before it can be selected for the door-to-door programme. Rasane said the civic body had tied up with a private hospital which will provide manpower and infrastructure. The initiative was not exerting any pressure on civic administration or infrastructure, organisers insisted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-for-near-to-home-jabs-in-pune-bjp-starts-limited-door-to-door-drive/articleshow/83414939.cms||---
---||Delhi||Sushil Kumar case: Delhi Police probe if ‘poaching’ of wrestlers sparked fatal row||NEW DELHI: Did slain wrestler Sagar Dhankad poach around 50-60 wrestlers from Chhatrasal Stadium and enrol them at another akhada, intensifying his feud with Olympian Sushil Kumar? Delhi Police is reportedly probing this angle after Kala Jathedi’s nephew, Sonu Mahaal, made a statement in this regard. Mahaal and some others have also claimed that there was no brawl on the night of the assault, and it was a premeditated act. Mahaal has claimed that five of them were abducted on May 4. “As per Mahaal, Dhankad and he were abducted from home along with three others that evening and brought to Chhatrasal Stadium as Kumar wanted to teach them a lesson,” a source said. Dhankad later died in hospital. On the poaching of wrestlers, sources said Dhankad had joined hands with a wrestling coach, Virender. Both were insulted and kicked out of Chhatrasal Stadium as they refused to tow Kumar’s line. Mahaal and a few other victims have said Dhankad and Vijender opened the akhada in Nangloi. “Kumar first asked Dhankad to vacate the flat that he had usurped with gangster Kala Jathedi’s help, but when Dhankad began to mock him in public, Kumar decided to seek revenge,” said a source. On May 4, Kumar allegedly began to hunt for Dhankad with the help of henchmen of Neeraj Bawana. As the wrestler didn’t know Dhankad’s new address, he began to look for his associates, said the source. “The first to be picked up were Ravinder and Amit from outer Delhi. Kumar thrashed them, got Dhankad’s address and then abducted him along with Bhagat and Mahaal,” an officer said. Bhagat was allegedly released late at night after his wife started calling up police and relatives. When the cops contacted Bhagat on his handset, Kumar allegedly made him say that he was fine. Kumar soon let him go, but the assault on the rest continued at a parking lot. Kumar was angry with Mahaal as he had been backing Dhankad on Jathedi’s instructions and informing the gangster about him. Kumar allegedly broke both his hands. Meanwhile, the Crime Branch has also questioned Kumar’s woman friend whose scooty the wrestler had used just before he was arrested last month. Over a dozen people have been questioned in the case till now. Kumar is currently in judicial custody and lodged in Mandoli Jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-probe-if-poaching-of-wrestlers-sparked-fatal-row/articleshow/83413230.cms||---

---||Pune||Vax scarcity shut over half of district’s sites in May||Pune: Most civic-run Covid vaccination sites in the district were unable to launch drives last month due to serious vaccine scarcity. Data showed that more than 300 of nearly 550 sites were shut or unable to hold sessions. The drop in operational sites also impacted coverage. A total of 5.05 lakh people were vaccinated in May, much less than the 14.15 lakh in April and six lakh in March. Officials said irregular vaccine supply also slowed first-dose coverage among the elderly, with focus diverted to cover those due for second doses.. Abhay Tidke, additional health officer of Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “There are nearly 417 vaccination sites in Pune rural,which includes some private hospital sites. But irregular vaccine supply meant only about 150 sites could operate. They include PHCs, rural hospitals and some sub-centres.”Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “The number of functional sites in most days of May must have gone down to just one third, meaning less than 200 civic sites were functional on an average during the month.”Deshmukh said supply is expected to improve in June; the district has already received nearly 1.26 lakh doses of Covishield and 44,460 doses of Covaxin in the first 10 days. The volume, Deshmukh said, can grow substantially as the month progresses. As for daily coverage, on Thursday, a total of 26,732 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-scarcity-shut-over-half-of-districts-sites-in-may/articleshow/83414953.cms||Piyush Bhusari

China’s effective ban on entry of Indian nationals since November last year, apparently because of Covid, has badly affected Indian students. In March this year, the Chinese embassy issued a notification about facilitating visas for those taking Chinese jabs. Many have complained though that they have not been issued visas despite being vaccinated by Chinese jabs. Responding to queries on the issue, the MEA reminded Beijing that currently, persons from China are able to travel to India despite the absence of direct connectivity. “However, for Indian nationals, travel to China has not been possible since last November as the Chinese side had suspended existing visas,” said spokesperson Arindam Bagchi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indians-stuck-allow-two-way-travel-delhi-tells-beijing-on-curbs/articleshow/83419640.cms||---
---||Nagpur||2,264 potholes filled in 2 months in Nagpur, still it’s a bumpy ride||NAGPUR: While the length and breadth of the city’s cement roads has increased, the condition of tar roads is just the opposite. It’s worsening. In 2020-21, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s public works department repaired 6,115 potholes across the city. In the first two months of the current financial year it carried out patchwork on 2,264 potholes. Potholes in NagpurAs per the NMC PWD data, this year the highest number of potholes were reported from the constituency of leader of opposition of the state assembly and ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis. The department claimed to have repaired 483 potholes in Laxmi Nagar zone. It was followed by 257 potholes repaired in Hanuman Nagar zone. NMC’s claims to repair potholes notwithstanding, the condition of tar roads across the city is dismal. TOI visited various parts of the city and found that lack of repair work has deteriorated the condition of tar roads further. The approach road alongside the Kalamna flyover near HB Nagar is full of craters. The residents’ numerous calls for help to corporators, civic body and the state’s public works department to repair the deadly craters on the busy road have fallen on deaf ears. On Monday, secretary of Youth Congress (North Nagpur) Sheikh Shahnawaz met guardian minister Nitin Raut who said that he would look into the matter. The patch work carried out by the NMC has turned many roads bumpy — Deo Nagar and Ajni Square (up to Khamla Road) are two of the many examples. “When you travel, you will experience a bumpy ride. Since years, the road has been in a pathetic condition, thanks to the NMC as well as the corporators, including a former mayor. We’ve been given false assurances that it would be converted into a cement road, but the road has not even been repaired. On Sunday, they did some haphazard patchwork,” said shopkeeper Raj Hirekhan. Gym owner Rajesh Ghodmare said most of the tar roads have become bumpy due to lack of maintenance by the civic body. “If you travel on any tar road regularly, you will surely develop back problems as most of the roads are full of big potholes. Even for repairs, the NMC used substandard material, which gets ripped off in just a few days,” he said. A group of residents said, “People tend to have a short memory and so the road repair work may happen 3-4 months before the civic elections. Corporators and civic officials act only when the media raises the issue. Every corporator is allotted Rs 20 lakh per annum for area development. Many corporators have got Rs 1 crore, yet the roads are in bad shape.” Road repairs aren’t serving the purpose due to substandard work. As soon as one pothole is repaired, another one crops up nearby, was the general observation of citizens. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar said the NMC will carry out road repair work soon. “After the monsoon is over, we will re-asphalt the tar roads,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2264-potholes-filled-in-2-months-still-its-a-bumpy-ride/articleshow/83413285.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Goa||Mapusa: After rejection, court grants bail to accused in honour killing case||PANAJI: A Mapusa court, that had earlier rejected the bail application of a father accused of killing his daughter in an honour killing case, has granted him conditional bail. The advocate appearing for the accused stated that although he is alleged to have committed the offence under Section 302 of the IPC, there was no intention to kill. The advocate appearing for the accused is Menino Teles. The accused alleged that his daughter was in an illicit relationship with a married person. When she confessed about it, he committed the act in a fit of rage. The allegation is that he assaulted his daughter with a wooden cricket stump, causing her injuries as a result of which she succumbed while undergoing medical treatment at a community health centre. “No doubt the incident has occurred between the father and daughter, and it is clear that the father assaulted the daughter with a cricket stump, and due to the assault there were multiple blunt object forceful impacts which were anti mortem, fresh and collectively fatal, as per the post mortem report,” the court stated. The court found that there is no possibility of the accused to go absconding or jump bail as he is a businessman who has been residing in Goa for the past 16 years and that the children are also schooling here. The court held that the approach in bail matters shouldn’t be based on punishment, but on whether the accused would be readily available for trial or whether he is likely to tamper with evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-rejection-court-grants-bail-to-accused-in-honour-killing-case/articleshow/83414970.cms||---

We have sought information from teachers and others to send the death certificate of the parent to confirm the authenticity of the claim. Students in ZP schools receive textbooks, but no notebooks or uniforms. We provide them with notebooks, uniforms, sweater, stationery, school bag, raincoat, lunch box and all such things during the start of an academic year so that they do not give up education for want of these,” Datta Walunj, one of the four teachers, said. The others are Nandakumar Yewale, Surendra Doke and Kisan Kondhawale. Walunj, in 2018, had noticed two of his bright students in Std I and III not paying attention in class. When he visited their home, he had found that they had lost their father, and their mother had remarried. He knew it would be hard on the poor grandparents. Since the ZP school gives free education and midday meals, he decided to buy them the rest. It made him want to do more, and he requested fellow teachers to send him the names of such students. He got 18 more names. “In 2019, we got more such cases and by the end of the year we were sponsoring 50 children. Most had lost one or both their parents while the remaining come from very poor tribal families,” Kondhawale said. Yewale said it is his responsibility to help them. “ No student must feel left out for lack of resources. Helping everyone is not possible, but I want to assist as many in my taluka,” Yewale added. “These students are weak both financially and emotionally. We want to reduce their everyday struggle at least for academics. Education is the most powerful skill to survive in this world,” Doke said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/11-students-who-lost-parents-to-covid-19-stay-in-school-with-zp-teachers-help/articleshow/83414968.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Delhi||17-fold increase in trade licence fee will hit traders hard: Bharadwaj||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Thursday said that municipal corporations had increased trade licence fee by 17 times even during the Covid-19 pandemic that would add to traders’ financial distress. Bharadwaj said, “We all are well aware of the distress that small businesses had to face in the past 1.5 years. Small traders and shopkeepers neither receive any pension nor any guarantee of provident fund. They have also not been safeguarded with any insurance. The only means of income for them is the small day-to-day business that they run.” “In these testing times, when Delhi government is trying its best to curtail the financial pressure on these families through a variety of measures, the BJP is indulging in corruption and playing abysmal politics. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has increased the trade licence fee from Rs 500 to Rs 8,625 for A and B categories, and from Rs 500 to Rs 5,750 per square metre for C and D categories,” Bharadwaj stated in a press conference. “East Delhi Municipal Corporation has increased the rate of trade licence for A and B categories from Rs 200 to Rs 3,000, and from Rs 200 to Rs 2,000 per square metre for C and D categories,” Bharadwaj said. All small and big shopkeepers have to pay the licence fee every year. The AAP functionary called the hike a matter of shame and claimed it was equal to playing with traders’ lives. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Bharadwaj had mastered the art of giving misleading statements. “AAP government’s director, local bodies forced the corporations to raise the trade licence fee by using the municipal reform committee but AAP leader is trying to score political points by protesting against the fee hike,” said Kapoor. Meanwhile, Bharadwaj and Model Town MLA Akhilesh Pati Tripathi in a separate press conference claimed that a private builder in Model Town was occupying PWD land in connivance with the north corporation. Kapoor rejected their allegations. “Some individuals occupying the plot have got a building plan passed online under Saral scheme. North corporation’s authorities have already started the procedure to cancel the builders’ online plan and a police complaint too has been sent,” the BJP functionary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/17-fold-increase-in-trade-licence-fee-will-hit-traders-hard-bharadwaj/articleshow/83413373.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||Bihar: Rs 1.19 crore looted from HDFC Bank in Vaishali||PATNA: A gang of armed criminals looted Rs 1.19 crore in cash from the Jadhua branch of HDFC Bank near Hajipur in Vaishali district around 10.30am on Thursday. Police said five criminals entered the bank around 10.30am and looted cash from shelf after holding employees and security guard hostage at gunpoint. According to the bank employees, the robbers had covered their faces with masks and were wearing gloves in hands. They were in the age group of 20 to 25 years. The CCTV footages obtained from the bank showed the robbers entering the bank as customers. The guard on duty sanitised their hands and recorded their temperature at the gate before allowing them to enter the bank. Soon, one of the robbers whipped out a pistol and held the security guard hostage. His other accomplices went inside and filled their bags with cash from the shelf after threatening the manager with fire consequences. “The entire operation lasted hardly for five minutes. The criminals had parked their motorcycles outside the bank. They fled with the looted cash without any resistance either from the bank staff or the locals,” IG (Tirhut range) Ganesh Kumar said. The IG visited the bank along with Vaishali SP Maneesh and Hajipur sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal and inquired about the incident. He said the borders of the district have been sealed and a combing operation launched to arrest the robbers. The IG said the exit route of the robbers had already been ascertained. The CCTV footage showed four criminals escorting one of their associates who was carrying the bag containing cash as they stepped out of the bank after committing the crime. Police sources said Thursday’s incident was the 13th bank robbery in the state in the last 18 months. Earlier this year, the criminals had looted Rs 43 lakh from an Axis Bank branch on Hajipur-Mahnar road under the Desri police station area in Vaishali district. The IG said a special investigation team had been set up under the leadership of Vaishali SP. “The role of some bank employees is under scanner,” he added. The site of occurrence is at a stone’s throw distance from the ancestral house of Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai and Vaishali district Women’s police station. A senior police officer posted at the police headquarters has not ruled out the possibility of involvement of a professional gang in the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-1-19-crore-looted-from-hdfc-bank-in-vaishali/articleshow/83410115.cms||Ramashankar
---||Pune||Maha tops in varsity enrolment of students||Pune: More women among the total number of students were enrolled for higher education, from certificate courses to doctoral programmes, in Maharashtra. Their numbers were up from 19.05 lakh in 2018-19 to 19.51 lakh in 2019-20, the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report released on Thursday said. The report also said the Gender Parity Index for the state rose from 0.86 in 2015-16 to 0.93 in 2019-20. The index is better when it is closer to 1. Maharashtra with 4,494 colleges is second after Uttar Pradesh, with 34 colleges available per lakh population. In terms of state-share in 2019-20, the state tops in the enrolment in universities, including constituent units like sub-centres, with 9.67 lakh students, followed by Tamil Nadu with 9.26 lakh and Delhi with 8.16 lakh pupils. But, the number of foreign students enrolled in the state was down to 4,599 in 2019-20 as against 5003 in 2018-19. Pune has retained its fourth place in the country as the city with the highest number of colleges at 467 compared to 450 in 2018-19. Dhanraj Mane, state director for higher education, said the increase in colleges in rural areas is one of the reasons for more girls enrolling in higher education. “Hostel facilities are made available to them. The free bus pass girl students get helps them to complete school education and enter college. The increase in nursing colleges in the state has helped more women take up the course as the possibility of getting a job is high. Women have also started taking the benefit of various scholarships available to them due to better awareness of the schemes, which boosts higher enrolment,” Mane added. V N Magare, pro-vice chancellor of SNDT Women’s University, said awareness about women empowerment is increasing resulting in more of them taking up higher education. “As an exclusive university for women, our founding fathers wanted to empower them. We provide skill-based education which helps them get a job easily and that helps them stand on their own feet. This inspires other women to take up higher education too. The numbers will increase more in the coming years,” Magare added. The Rising Curve Year---Men -----Women ----Total 2019-20----23,13,862---19,51,610---42,65,472 2018-19----23,24,424----19,05,902---42,30,326 2017-18----22,71,078----18,60,679------41,31,757 2016-17----22,39,764-----17,76,545-----40,16,309 2015-16----22,47,820-----17,39,492------39,87,312 Foreign Students’ Numbers Dip Vijay Khare, director of the International Centre at Savitribai Phule Pune University said, “There is stiff competition that Maharashtra faces from private and deemed universities from southern states as well as in and around Delhi. They have an aggressive marketing strategy that attracts foreign students that we lack. This can be one reason for the decline.” Another senior official from SPPU said that one of the reasons for the decline may also be due to the tougher admission policy for international students in Maharashtra. “Technical education, especially engineering, is sought after by these students but when it comes to admission in the state, it is a lengthy and difficult process with hardly any counselling available to the students. This process needs to be streamlined,” he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-tops-in-varsity-enrolment-of-students/articleshow/83415287.cms||Ardhra Nair

Locally known as the abode of the tiger, it is named after the big cat. Today, the hill and its ecology are under threat from increasing deforestation and anthropogenic pressures. In 2013, it was here that the camera traps set up by the forest department had found the first image of a tiger in Goa. While some of the forested areas in the vicinity of Vagheri have been included in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in 1999, there are still large areas of rich private forests that have been excluded. In April, owners of private forest in survey no. 102/1 in Keri had sought permission from the office of Range Forest Officer for bush cutting and demarcation of boundaries. Though no permission for forest clearance was given, it was noticed that trees were felled, causing irreparable loss to the area’s environment and ecology. RFO Vivek Gaonkar told TOI, “I have given directives to the Round Forester concerned to verify whether any tree felling was carried out in violation of the law and to book offences against the violators accordingly.” As per directives of the Supreme Court, the Goa government appointed the Sawant Committee in 1997 to identify private forests in Goa. Accordingly, the committee found forested areas dominated by more than 75% forest species and above 40% tree canopy in large tracts around Vagheri as well. Subsequently, the V T Thomas committee also confirmed these findings in 2017. However, some of the areas near Vagheri have long been cleared to cultivate cashew. And, in the degraded areas owned by the forest department, under social forestry, monoculture plantation was undertaken. The lush green cover of Vagheri hill offers refuge to tigers, leopards and other wildlife. From atop the Vagheri hill, trekkers can enjoy the panoramic view of Goa up to the capital Panaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/deforestation-threat-looms-over-goas-third-highest-hill/articleshow/83414999.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Ahmedabad||Impact fee chances missed||Ahmedabad: The ongoing civic body’s sealing drive against buildings that do not have a valid ‘Building Use’ permission has reached an impasse. Till now, 166 buildings and 2,557 units within them have been sealed and now there is no way that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) can reopen the seals unless the construction conditions are met. Most of the buildings that have been sealed are almost two and half decades old and had two chances to pay impact fee — once in year 2000 and the other between 2012 and 2016. Buildings like Norquest in Mithakali, Swastik Centre on CG Road, Arjun Avenue in Navrangpura, Siddharth Park in Paldi were among a few of the buildings where occupants were asked to vacate the buildings immediately. Many of these buildings had an extra floor constructed, galleries extended, parking space was missing, change of use of basement area, in many building margin spaces were missing. “If the owners or building association agrees to rectify these errors the BU permission procedures can begin,” says a senior AMC estate department official. But there are also cases where the land title in official revenue records are either disputed or are not clear. “In case a building comes up on such land the BU permission gets tougher,” adds the AMC estate officer. “But the owners of these buildings failed us on two occasions by not paying towards the impact fee. They have exhausted their chances and now we cant help them unless the court or the state government issues a government resolution,” says a senior AMC official in the estate department. The AMC will continue with the sealing drive for a week by which time close to 200 buildings will be sealed as per civic body list. “If the owners of these buildings approach us and ensure that they demolish parts of the building that have been illegally constructed , we can begin the process of BU permission,” adds the AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/impact-fee-chances-missed/articleshow/83413314.cms||---

The racketeers promised handsome returns over investment of small amounts and collected money through mobile apps. But the investor never received the promised amount. Police detained Jay Parekh, 30 and his associate Vijay Vanzara, 35, and were handed over to Bengaluru police for further investigation. “A Rs 120 crore online fraud complaint has been registered in Bengaluru. During investigation the name of Vanzara cropped up,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police, cyber crime. Police detained Vanzara and he revealed Parekh’s name. Vanzara is an auto rickshaw driver while Parekh is a travel agent and also sells products online. “Bengaluru police traced Vanzara since the fraud money was deposited in bank accounts of Vanzara. Actually Parekh opened the accounts of Vanzara collecting his identity proofs and paid Rs 35,000,” said police. The bank accounts were opened in March and over Rs 3 crore were deposited in the bank accounts. “Similar complaints of Rs 250 crore in Uttarakhand and Rs 150 crore in New Delhi’s cyber crime cell have been registered recently. The accused involved in all these complaints have almost similar modus operandi,” said police. In these offences, handsome returns were promised against investment of small amounts starting from Rs 500. The accused used Power Bank and EzPlan Android mobile applications as a platform to attract investors. Parekh had floated 360 Teq Software Pvt Ltd and received amounts as investment money. The payment was received through payment aggregator Razorpay. “The aggregator was informed that the payment is for online gaming but it was actually of fraud,” said police, adding that Bengaluru cops traced Vanzara from the bank account details.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-involved-in-rs-120cr-online-fraud-held/articleshow/83410934.cms||---

Both officers immediately posted that these accounts were fake. On Thursday, Choudhary realised that a fake Facebook account had been created in his name and messages were sent to his friends asking for money. This is not the first time that such accounts pretending to be senior police officers have been created. In April, Ahmedabad police had filed a case against an unidentified person for creating a fake Twitter account of DCP Zone 7 Premsukh Delu and posting objectionable posts from it.  Choudhary said, “I realised a fake account was created when my friends called me and said they were going to the bank to deposit the money in the bank.” Within 20 minutes of posting the message, Choudhary said he sent a message to the profile stating that the account was fake and the person behind it should not ask his friends for money. Choudhary said that he was informed that such accounts are being operated from Haryana and the account was created from Kanpur. “However, before we could trace the IP address, the account was locked. Cybercrime investigators are tracing the person behind the messages. Haresh Dudhat, SP and deputy director of the Police Training Academy at Karai, said he came to know about the fake account on Thursday morning when a friend called and informed him about it and the demands for money. “I immediately put up a post on Facebook about the fake account and later approached cybercrime police. They told me to report the issue to Facebook which I did. I also sent messages to my friends so that they do not get cheated,” he said. Dudhat said the person was asking his friends that if they have Google Pay accounts and then demanded money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-fb-accounts-of-senior-cops-created/articleshow/83413390.cms||---

The bench of Justice Pankaj Bhandari issued the order while hearing a petition filed by a young woman, seeking protection for her "life and liberty" in the face of threats for living with a married man. Dismissing the petition, the court said, “The prerequisites for a live-in relationship, as held by the apex court in the D Velussamy vs D Patchaiammal case of 2010, is that the couple must hold themselves out to society as being akin to spouses and must be of legal age to marry or qualified to enter into a legal marriage, including being unmarried.” The Punjab and Haryana high court had recently refused to grant protection to two sets of live-in couples allegedly facing threats from the girls' families on the ground that such a relationship was "morally or socially unacceptable" and, therefore, the state's intervention could "disturb society". One of the couples subsequently approached the Supreme Court, which last week ordered Punjab police to provide security to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/live-in-with-married-partner-untenable-hc/articleshow/83415036.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Video of suspended Jaipur Municipal Corporation mayor’s hubby making Rs 20 crore ‘deal’ viral||JAIPUR: A video of suspended Jaipur Municipal Corporation, Greater, mayor Somya Gurjar’s husband allegedly making a deal with an employee of a sanitation company for his share of Rs 20 crore, from a bill cleared by the corporation, went viral on Thursday. Following this, the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) decided to conduct a primary inquiry into the incident. In the video, Gurjar’s husband Raja Ram Gurjar is allegedly seen sitting in the middle of a room wearing a mask along with the employees of the sanitation company. “Whenever our amount is cleared, which is around Rs 276 crore, we need to pay penalty on that. After that we will pay you Rs 20 crore. Just get our payment passed within six months to one year and it will be done,” an employee can be heard allegedly saying in the video. Raja Ram is then seen agreeing with the company employee. ACB DG B L Soni said, “After seeing the video, we have decided to conduct a primary enquiry to ascertain the facts. If things shown in the video are found to be genuine and true, this would be a case fit to be registered under Section 7A of Prevention of Corruption Act.” ACB will find the source of the video and will speak to Somya’s husband and others shown in the video to verify facts. While the company employees switched off their mobile phones following the viral video, late night, the operations head of the company released a video saying that the firm never had any dealing with any person. “We have had no conversation regarding exchange of money with any person or organisation ever. All the news going on is false and we condemn it,” said Omkar Sapre, head of the company in Jaipur. Somya Gurjar didn’t respond to calls from TOI. Her husband Raja Ram, however, came to Sanganer police station late night on Thursday and gave a complaint to register an FIR against company official Sandeep Chaudhary. But the cops turned him away as the matter was already pending investigation by ACB. “The videos made viral on social media and news channels are false and made viral to malign the image of my family. Officials of the company are behind this matter to make the fabricated video viral,” said Raja Ram in his complaint. Meanwhile, TOI tried to contact state BJP president Satish Poonia regarding the controversy, but he didn’t respond. In a statement, Congress leader Archana Sharma said, “I urge the BJP state leadership to form an inquiry committee under Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria, who will investigate the facts and expose the truth. We also demand the government investigate the income, property of both the husband and wife by the ACB. Congress member Giriraj Khandelwal called for an urgent investigation into the viral video as it smelled of a very serious corruption in JMC-Greater. However, refuting all the charges, a BJP councillor said that it was not clear from the video if the masked person was Raja Ram. “We do not know the authenticity of the video. May be it is edited as no one is seen speaking because of the face masks,” said the councillor.

MahaMetro has barricaded the site and has started the preliminary work of shifting utility cables and digging ducts. “A plan is being chalked out to minimize disruption to vehicular movement in the area,” Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said. The station would be close to the city’s main market and is a crucial stop on the Pimpri-Swargate Metro corridor. Five stations on the corridor are part of the 5km underground stretch from the College of Agriculture and Swargate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/land-in-hand-mahametro-to-expedite-work-at-mandai-site/articleshow/83415107.cms||Sarang Dastane

At the last meeting of the council, heated discussions had taken place over the issue of the constitution of the statutory committees with rebel candidates from Margao MLA Digambar Kamat’s camp, Damodar Shirodkar and Ghanashyam Shirodkar, taking on chairperson Lyndon Pereira and insisting that the committees be constituted strictly as per the rules. After lengthy deliberations, it was decided that apart from constituting standing committee and subject committee, a solid waste management committee also be formed. While the standing committee will consist of eight members, the subject committee will comprise five members. The strength of the solid waste management committee is yet to be decided. Differences had arisen among the members of the ruling alliance of the council over the manner of constituting the committees with several members insisting that elections be held instead of direct appointment as was favoured by some. It was also insisted that the council form the solid waste management committee as mandated in the Solid Waste Management Rules. Fernandes said that all the three statutory committees will be formed at the meeting to be held on Wednesday. “If needed, elections will be held for constituting the committees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-clash-margao-civic-body-to-form-committees-next-wk/articleshow/83415075.cms||---

GFP functionary Jitendra Gaonkar alleged that under Ajgaonkar’s watch, water meant for agricultural purposes is being pumped into tankers and supplied for construction of the greenfield airport at Mopa. Stating that Ajgaonkar had promised jobs for the locals, Gaonkar asked him to spell out how many locals have been employed by him at the Mopa airport site or elsewhere. “The Pernem MLA should resign and go back to Margao. He should retire from politics and allow the youth and others to develop Pernem,” said Gaonkar, who is vying to contest the assembly elections from Pernem on a GFP ticket. Gaonkar said that Ajgaonkar has done little to develop Pernem or improve the taluka’s infrastructure. A primary health centre at Kasarvanem village is dilapidated and has not been upgraded, said Gaonkar. “Let the deputy chief minister explain what development has happened in Pernem. Building roads and putting up lights is not a new or unique thing. Pernem’s health system has collapsed,” he said. GFP has demanded that Ajgaonkar should come out with a “white paper” to explain what works have been taken up in Pernem and how the locals have benefitted. Gaonkar alleged that Ajgaonkar has refused to answer the concerns of the locals. Let deputy chief minister Manohar Ajgaonkar explain what development has happened in Pernem constituency.

Right now, developers are not in a position to absorb more costs arising from increased input cost of materials such as steel and cement. In the medium and long-term, price rises are inevitable,” said Harsh Vardhan Patodia, the president of Credai. Satish Magar, the Credai chairman, said, “Real estate is the only sector that is not being able to avail input tax credits, yet it is paying GST at given rates. The prices of steel and cement have gone up at a fast pace, and our sales have stopped now as there are no walk-ins. The government needs to step in and allow restructuring and moratoriums, so that the cash flows can be maintained. The RERA-mandated deadline extensions also need to come in, due to the current situation,” said Satish Magar, the Credai chairman. Credai released a report showing the “negative impact” of the second wave of the pandemic on the real estate industry after having bumper sales through the end of 2020, and the first three months of 2021 aided by stamp duty cuts in states like Maharashtra, and low interest rates for home loans. The report added that though less than last year, most developers reported loss of labour strength, issues related to financing at their end as well as those of customers, and most of all, cost of key materials ballooning over the recent months. Developers said that steel prices have increased by 70%, while cement is dearer by 20%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/housing-prices-may-rise-in-near-future-credai/articleshow/83415073.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

A staggering 98% developers are facing reduced customer enquiries,” reveals the survey, which covered 4,813 developers across 217 cities, including those from Gujarat. The delays, according to CREDAI, are attributed to a range of factors, with 92% developers experiencing labour shortage at sites, 83% developers are working with less than half the workforce, and over 82% of developers are facing project approval delays.Added factors such as recent spike in construction materials including steel and cement have contributed to more than 10% increase in construction cost for more than 88% developers, the survey stated.“We have made a representation to the government citing the current survey and requesting the government to infuse urgent financial stimulus and initiate quick progressive measures to assist recovery,” said Harsh Vardhan Patodia, president, CREDAI-National.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/95-developers-fear-project-delays-amid-second-wave-credai/articleshow/83413461.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Sachin Pilot loyalists attack AICC panel for delay in resolving crisis||JAIPUR: As political crisis deepens in Rajasthan, MLAs loyal to former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot have questioned the delay by the AICC committee – set up last year to resolve issues related to differences between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Pilot – in reaching an amicable solution. With voices of dissent getting stronger, especially after Jitin Prasada deserting the Congress to join BJP and former Union minister Bhanwar Jitendra Singh speaking in favour of Pilot, sources in Rajasthan Congress say that Gehlot would now find it difficult to postpone a cabinet rejig and state-level political appointments for long. Congress legislators Vishvendra Singh, Ved Prakash Solanki, Rakesh Pareek, Mukesh Bhakar, Suresh Modi and Ramniwas Gawriya met Pilot at his residence here on Thursday. All of them were among the 19 MLAs who rebelled against Gehlot’s leadership in July last year. BJP MLA Gurdeep Singh also met Pilot, though the former claimed it was a personal meeting with no political motive. Pilot loyalists said their leader should be heard the way Navjot Singh Sidhu was heard in Punjab. Solanki, who represents Chaksu seat in Jaipur district, said, “Party workers are disappointed after learning that the Congress high command is keen on a quick decision to resolve the issues plaguing the party in Punjab. It is learnt that the AICC committee set up for Punjab submitted its report in 10 days. In Rajasthan, the committee has not even heard our views in 10 months.” On the delay in cabinet expansion, Solanki said, “If the chief minister feels that those who support Pilot should not be included and only his people should be inducted, so be it. He should at least appoint someone, so that people’s works get done and development takes place.” “Pilot is not demanding any post for himself. He is talking about the honour and respect of Congress workers who fought for the party for 5 years when it was in opposition,” said Bhakar. Legislator from Parbatsar in Nagaur, Ramniwas Gawriya, said, “The kind of things happening in the party — first Jyotiraditya Scindia and now Jitin Prasada moving to BJP -- should not have happened. Congress high command should have intervened to hold them back.” On being asked if Pilot too might switch over, Gawriya said, “Pilot struggled for six years and pulled the party up from 21 seats to holding power in the state. He is fighting for the party workers who helped this happen. We will continue our fight while remaining within the party.” Vishvendra Singh, who was sacked as tourism minister for the rebellion last July, is believed to have got closer to Gehlot recently. His son Anirudh targeted him on Twitter for switching sides. “Vishvasghat (treachery)… a new word learned today (sic),” Anirudh wrote. In another tweet, he indicated his father’s changing political loyalties. “From Rajesh Pilot ji sahab to Bhairon Singh ji, to Vasundhara ji, to Gehlot sahib, to Pilot sahib to Gehlot sahib! #joke,” Anirudh tweeted, but later deleted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pilot-loyalists-attack-aicc-panel-for-delay-in-resolving-crisis/articleshow/83415118.cms||---

It was a double whammy for this poor man from Khambhat who had barely recovered from Covid when the necrosis had set in and he came under the threat of losing his limb. But fortunately, he came to Dr Manish Raval’s endovascular hospital in Shefali Shopping Center which started a free Covid care centre in May and was treated free of charge for a procedure that would have cost him nothing less than Rs 1.5-2 lakh.  Ironically, Hasmukh was the last patient to get the benefit of free Covid complication care as Dr Raval was directed by the AMC to discharge the patient and shut down the hospital by Friday. This was part of the recent drive undertaken by AMC following the high court's order to seal all buildings and hospitals which do not have Building Use permission. “AMC officials say there is no resolution which can be extended. My hospital has treated 18 patients free ever since it was turned into a Covid centre on May 8 at the peak of the second wave. We would have continued to treat patients free till Covid lasted. In fact, we wanted to start a free mucormycosis ward but guess that is not to be,” Dr Raval said. He said that his group of friends, all runners, including Delnaz Medora, Ketan Thakkar and others funded the initiative buying ventilators, BiPAP machines, medicines and even food. Dr Raval says that Shefali Shopping Center was one of the first highrises of the city built in 1983 and the building has ‘raja chitthi’ which was given to the building before it started operations. In between, AMC had offered to give BU charge impact fees but office owners could not come to a consensus to pay the hefty fee. “During Covid, we were told to get a fire NOC and we did all that was mandated not only for the building but the entire hospital. Now, members are ready to pay a fee but AMC says there is no option to end the impasse,” said Dr Raval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sans-bu-free-covid-hospital-to-shut-down/articleshow/83413519.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Market dynamics will now dictate land pooling policy||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had launched a web-enabled, single-window portal for inviting registration for participation in its ambitious land pooling policy, which was expected to be a game changer, on February 5, 2019. Seen as a win-win option for land owners, developers and those looking for affordable housing, the policy has not yet taken off the way it was expected. The policy, development control norms of which are now part of the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041, aims to provide affordable housing by overcoming the cumbersome process of land acquisition for development and promises to pave the way for 17-20 lakh new houses accommodating around 76 lakh people in the land-scarce capital. Doing away with the traditional model of land development, which often gets mired in litigation due to complaints for paltry compensation, the policy allows pooling of land by developers who can retain a large part of the developed land for residential and commercial use, while DDA will only play the role of a facilitator. Senior officials admit that while many land owners may be following a wait-and-watch policy, the participation rate has not been bad and land owners have come forward “aggresively” in land pooling areas. “Enough land has been pooled to create a sub-city, but it is scattered and needs readjustment,” an official said. Although around 6,900 hectares of land have been pooled since the portal’s launch, these land parcels are scattered across different peripheral parts of Delhi. The pandemic has also slowed down the process as verification of land records, field surveys etc. have suffered. Though DDA had prepared plans for three model sectors in three different zones, work couldn’t fully start. “Although things have been moving in a positive way, the verification of land records has been getting slower due to the pandemic,” he said. DDA, however, has also brought in major changes in the policy to make it more attractive for developers and land owners. “Flexibility has now been given to developers and they can use variable FAR. We have also permitted mixed use now,” the official said. He said this flexibility would now allow the developer to build more commercial or residential options, as per demand. “Not every commercial area becomes a hot cake and it might be possible that an area has more demand for residential properties,” he said. “Development should not be monotonous and developers can take up projects based on market demand.” MPD 41 now also allows higher FAR of up to 400 for land pooling projects near transit nodes, as long as the upper limit is not breached. “For instance, all residential units can be built up near the transit node and the remaining area can be kept open and green without breaching the cap. More buyers would be interested in flats near Metro stations, allowing optimum use of the land,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/market-dynamics-will-now-dictate-land-pooling-policy/articleshow/83413534.cms||Sidharatha Roy

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to give heritage tag to trees that are over 50 years old||MUMBAI: In a major new policy to protect trees, the state government has decided to accord ‘heritage’ status to trees that are over 50 years old. If these trees have to be cut, saplings corresponding to the age of the tree will have to be planted. The policy also provides for up to Rs 1 lakh penalty for violations. Earlier, only one sapling had to be planted for cutting a tree, irrespective of its age. The cabinet on Thursday approved amendments to The Maharashtra (Urban and Areas) Preservation and Protection of Trees Act, 1975. The compensatory plantation will have to be done at the same location of the original tree or in a public place. The saplings will have to be 6-8 feet tall and they will be geo-tagged and maintained for seven years. Local civic bodies will have to conduct a tree census every five years and maintain a record of heritage trees. “This is a very good decision to conserve and protect trees. If a 100-year-old tree is hacked, 100 new saplings will have to be planted at the same site or at a public space,” principal secretary, environment, Manisha Patankar Mhaiskar, told TOI after the meeting. The state-level Tree Authority will be responsible for monitoring, protecting and conserving heritage status trees. BN Kumar, founder of NGO NatConnect Foundation, said this would definitely help in conserving nature, but what is important is strict implementation and accountability.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-give-heritage-tag-to-trees-that-are-over-50-yrs-old/articleshow/83416166.cms||Vijay Singh
---||Goa||Goa: Will join BJP if given ticket for elections: Gaude||PANAJI: Independent Priol MLA and art and culture minister Govind Gaude on Thursday said that he was willing to join BJP provided the party nominates him as a candidate for the 2022 assembly election. Gaude on Thursday held a detailed discussion with BJP national general secretary (organisation) B L Santosh on the functioning of his portfolio. Gaude had won the 2017 assembly elections with the support of the party and has since been cabinet minister in the state BJP-led government, both under the chief ministership of Manohar Parrikar and later Pramod Sawant. In 2019, Sawant, soon after taking over at the helm of the state’s affairs, had dropped independent MLA Rohan Khaunte and GFP from the cabinet. On Thursday, the Priol MLA, while expressing his desire to continue his association with BJP, said, “In 2017, BJP supported me in my win in the Priol constituency and I believe in commitment.” Speaking to TOI, Gaude said that he had joined active politics in 1994 at which time he had supported BJP candidate Shripad Naik in Madkai constituency. In 1999, he had backed MGP candidate Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar in Madkai. Thereafter, he joined Congress and contested the 2007 assembly election from Madkai on the party’s ticket. During the following assembly polls, in 2012, Gaude contested from Priol constituency where he battled BJP-MGP alliance candidate Pandurang Dhavalikar and lost. In 2017, he won from Priol constituency as an independent supported by BJP. Gaude said that as MGP and Congress are not options for him, it leaves only BJP. “I have a good relationship with BJP leaders and MLAs and it would be better to join BJP. It is now up to BJP to decide,” he said. A senior BJP leader said that the local BJP leadership is against nominating Gaude as the party’s candidate in Priol constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-join-bjp-if-given-ticket-for-elections-gaude/articleshow/83415140.cms||---

This has now been revealed by the laboratory that sequenced genome samples from Rajasthan. Out of the 174 samples, as many as 166 samples tested positive for the Delta variant collected from the state in April and May. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has also expressed his concern on the report from the Centre. He said that there is fear that the Delta variant, which caused the damage, may infect people who have already been vaccinated. “These samples were collected from April-May Covid cases. The state government has received a report showing that the Delta variant is circulating in the state with 166 samples testing positive for it. Apart from this, five samples have tested positive for the Kappa variant, two for the Alpha variant,” a health department official said. The Covid Delta variant, scientifically termed B.1.617.2, refers to the merging of two mutations of a virus strain that form a third, super infectious strain. The B.1.617.2 variant contains mutations from two separate virus variants, namely E484Q and L452R.“In 80% of the cases, the Delta variant was responsible, which is not only aggressive but also spreads much faster. It is 50% more infective and, even after recovery, causes prolonged post-Covid symptoms such as more thromboembolism and blood clots. It has also targeted the younger generation,” said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal and controller, SMS Medical College. Since the state does not have any genome sequencing facility, the health department had sent the samples to the lab in Delhi. “It was actually a Delta wave which swept across the state with high infectivity. Not only Rajasthan, the entire north India was affected by the variant. Studies and genome sequencing reports have confirmed it. The higher number of deaths in the second wave happened due to this variant. Among other complications, it also affects pancreas, resulting in sugar levels going up and causing more complications such as mucormycosis,” said Dr Virendra Singh, member of the advisory committee on Covid formed by the state government. He said that in the UK also cases have gone up. It has also been found the Delta variant was in circulation in that country, infecting more people. At the start of the second wave, doctors had failed to understand the behaviour of Covid and also why it was affecting recovered patients. “In some patients, it was observed that despite all optimal and standard medications and treatment given, the disease had continued to progress. The patients required ventilators and did not survive. The lungs got infected quickly in Covid caused by the Delta variant. In the second week of infection, the lungs of patients were affected within a few days of the infection. The condition of such patients started to deteriorate in the second week. This was not the case in the first wave,” said Dr K K Sharma, senior consultant (pulmonology), at a private hospital. Despite recovering from the virus, many patients are still battling for life on ventilator support. “We have seen many cases which are quite unusual from Covid cases earlier who had pneumomediastinum (SPM) and pneumothorax (PNX). In all these cases, the lungs of patients got badly damaged. A lot of such patients are still on ventilator and oxygen support despite having recovered from the virus. They are oxygen dependent. Also, patients under home isolation, who took steroids for Covid treatment, contracted mucormycosis and other post-Covid complications. The Delta variant has taken a toll on the health of the people,” said Dr Sheetu Singh, director (Covid pulmonary rehab) at a private hospital. The SMS Medical College also observed that many Covid cases went undetected by RT-PCR tests and the infection of lungs was detected only when the patients got the HRCT done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/virulent-delta-variant-causeddeadly-second-wave-in-state/articleshow/83415146.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

On April 16, the man got a phone call from a person — supposedly from a private finance firm in Vimannagar — who wanted to know if he had applied for a personal loan from the firm. “I had told him about my home loan [with a bank], when he said I had taken a personal loan from his company. When he told me my PAN and asked for an OTP, I disconnected the call,” the man, who has since lodged a police complaint, told TOI. The following day, the man contacted the firm. “The woman who answered the call told me there was no loan linked to my mobile number. When I gave her my PAN, she said a loan of Rs 1.4 lakh was taken using my details,” the complainant The man spoke to his wife, a bank employee, who helped him check his credit score. They found that someone used his Aadhaar and PAN to take loans ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 2.89 lakh from nine private firms in Pune, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and New Delhi between February 3 and 10 this year. The complainant immediately approached the Hinjewadi police, who directed him to the cybercrime cell. “I was given an email address to file a complaint. The next day, I took a copy of the email to the police station and submitted a complaint application,” he said. “I managed to find the email addresses of six financial firms. I emailed them, but only two responded,” he said. One firm emailed him copies of the Aadhaar and PAN submitted for the loan. “In both cases, the fraudster had submitted my Aadhaar and PAN details with someone else’s photograph,” the complainant said. The complainant later made a video call to one firm in the presence of the police. “An official told me that they had sanctioned the loan though video KYC and that the person who had applied was someone else,” he said. The Hinjewadi police registered an FIR on Wednesday. “I have even filed a complaint with the consumer court,” the complainant said. Sub-inspector Govind Pawar said the police traced the fraudster to Kolkata. “We found that the suspect transferred Rs 3 lakh to a private bank account in Kolkata. We are trying to ascertain how the fraudster got hold of these documents,” Pawar said. A case has been registered under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 468, 469 and 470 (forgery).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crook-uses-sus-mans-pan-aadhaar-takes-rs-8-2l-in-loans/articleshow/83415133.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The woman thought the bank had sent her the text message and clicked it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/techie-loses-rs-2-5-lakh-to-fraudster/articleshow/83415128.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Transit-oriented development aligned with global standards||NEW DELHI: The transit-oriented development (TOD) policy, which Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has approved in 2019, is now part of the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041. While earlier planned as high-density, mixed-use developments along mass rapid transit corridors with higher FAR for optimum use of land, the policy, on which DDA has been working since 2015, was recently changed to focus on “transit nodes”. Drafted with primarily Delhi Metro and railway stations in mind, the policy in its latest avatar enables node-based TOD around upcoming modes of public transit, such as RRTS, Metro Lite, Metro-Neo, BRT, LRT, making it “future ready”. “Unlike earlier, the policy is now applicable only on identified nodes for TOD. Just because an area is along a continuous mass rapid transit corridor, you can’t enhance FAR,” a senior official said. “This is how world over similar TOD schemes are carried out.” In the first phase, 12 transit nodes have been identified, which, apart from the multimodal transit hubs at Kashmere Gate, Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan, include Metro stations at Haiderpur Badli Mor, Rohini Sector 18, Mukundpur, Dwarka Sector 21, Trilokpuri, Karkardooma and the corridor between Dwarka Sector 8 and Sector14 stations. The rest are New Delhi railway station and Jangpura station on the upcoming Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System. “The first TOD project, East Delhi Hub, is coming up at Karkardooma and is on track,” the official said. The project, which is being executed by NBCC, will have 6,518 dwelling units, including 1,992 for those falling under the economically weaker sections. It will also boast of schools, dispensaries, library, cultural centre, community halls, convenient shopping, community spaces, creche, etc. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is planning commercial development at Pink Line’s Karkardooma station, also close to Anand Vihar, to cater to the rise in demand thanks to the project. The draft MPD states, “A TOD approach in Delhi will help in bringing people and jobs closer to mass transit and lead to much needed integration of land use and transport in the city. It will result in compact, walkable, mixed-use developments within influence zones of transit stations. This is a critical paradigm shift that can potentially improve public transit ridership, reduce vehicular congestion, and reduce greenhouse emissions and pollution in the long term.” The compact development ensures ample provision of open and green spaces, up to 30% of the total area with at least 20% as public green space, promoting walkable precincts in these nodes. Additional development control norms regarding active frontage, parking and other building controls have been added to create more vibrant public spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/transit-oriented-development-aligned-with-global-standards/articleshow/83413676.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The consortium comprises CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB), Hyderabad; National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS ), Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (inStem) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru; CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in New Delhi and Pune Knowledge Cluster, National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL) and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) in Pune. The environmental surveillance would include sewage water analysis of various sub-wards to check the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Complementing the efforts of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), the scientists part of the four-city consortium aim to develop strategies to identify variants of concern (VOCs) before they spread widely and cause outbreaks. L S Shashidhara, professor, Ashoka University and IISER Pune, told TOI, “INSACOG undertakes genome surveillance at a macro-level, while the consortium of four city clusters will attempt to identify virus variants and correlate to the spread at a very granular level in the cities. The surveillance will be done at a more regional level.” The four cities located in the four corners of the country with a high Covid-19 caseload were picked for this reason. “The idea is to focus on genome surveillance in small pockets or localities to identify VOCs and their spread. For instance, a new variant emerging in a small locality will not spread immediately in the entire city. Its spread may first concentrate in a high-density sub-ward, before spreading to a bigger region,” he said. The consortium will also take up a city-wide environmental surveillance, including sewage water testing for presence of the virus and its new variants. “Sewage water surveillance of various localities will help identify the level of infection spread in a given region even before estimating the level of infection spread in a population through RT-PCR tests. Authorities could then take up early measures to curb the spread,” Shashidhara said, adding that CSIR-NCL would lead this surveillance in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/consortium-of-4-city-clusters-to-scale-up-sars-cov-2-genomic-environmental-surveillance/articleshow/83415153.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai gets 94% of average June rain, heavy showers likely in places||MUMBAI: The wet spell that began with the onset of monsoons on Wednesday has given Mumbai 94% of its June rain so far. The showers continued, albeit way more moderately, on Thursday in the city even as the southwest monsoon covered the entire state. The IMD has forecast heavy rain (orange alert) at isolated places in the city for the weekend. An alert for extremely heavy rain has been issued for Monday. With showers continuing, the average precipitation is likely to be covered in the first fortnight of June itself. Since June 1, 474mm rainfall has been recorded in the city against the average monthly total of 505mm. As much as 338mm of that is above normal for the period, said meteorologists. In the 24 hours ending on Thursday morning, the total rainfall recorded at the IMD Santacruz observatory touched 231.3mm, which falls in the extremely heavy rain category. About 222mm of that had fallen in the 12 hours between 8.30am and 8.30pm on Wednesday. The rainfall between June 9 and 10 has clearly surpassed last year’s highest June one-day rain of 65mm on June 6. Historical data shows the highest one-day June rainfall recorded was 399mm on June 10 in 1991. Intermittent showers and heavy rain at a few places continued throughout Thursday with the IMD Santacruz observatory gauge showing 48.8mm rainfall in 12 hours between 8.30am and 8.30pm. Areas like Mulund and Andheri in the city, and adjoining areas like Navi Mumbai and Thane recorded significant rain. However, IMD Colaba recorded a meagre 16.8mm rain the 12 hours. The IMD said they are closely observing the weather models for the coming days with extremely heavy rain expected on some days. “Satellite images as on Thursday evening indicated dense cloud formation over north Konkan and the interiors of Maharashtra too. As per IMD forecast, a low pressure system is expected to form in 24 hours in north Bay of Bengal and very likely to intensify in the subsequent 24 hours. This will bring a lot of rain over Konkan, including Mumbai, in next 4-5 days,” said an IMD official. A warning for fishermen is in place. “Strong winds with speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph are likely to prevail along and off the north Maharashtra coast on June 9-13. Fishermen are advised not to venture along and off the north Maharashtra coast during the above mentioned period,” said IMD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gets-94-of-avg-june-rain-heavy-showers-likely-in-places/articleshow/83415172.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Pune||Sale of masks, sanitizers drops 90% in Pune district||PUNE: The All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists Association as well as manufacturers have reported a significant drop in the sale of masks and sanitizers across the country after the second wave of Covid-19 seemed to be subsiding. Across the country, data shows a 30-40% drop in sales during the last 15 days. The Chemists’ Association of Pune district said the the drop has been a whopping 90% in the local market. Jagannath Shinde, president, All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists Associations, told TOI that several reasons have led to the drop in sales. “A section of the population may have reduced the use of masks and sanitizers after the drop in cases and reduced Covid-19 fear. At the start of the second wave, the sales were about 90-95% in April, which is now down to 50-60%,” he said. Shinde said multispecialty hospitals treating Covid cases still continue to use masks and sanitizers. “But the sales have dropped on account of non-use of these items by relatives of cured patients or people in certain localities that now have a lower number of cases,” he added. Anil Belkar, secretary, Chemists’ Association of Pune district, said, “We have seen a 90% drop in sales of both masks and sanitizers at retail stores in the last 15 days. After the drop in cases, citizens aren’t buying as many masks and sanitizers. More awareness is needed about how these products should continue to be used for the next one year.” Belkar said that he would earlier sell 100 sanitizer bottles (500 ml) daily, which has now reduced to 10-12 a day, while the earlier sale of 50 N-95 masks daily has now come down to not more than five per day. Anshumali Jain, president, All India Mask Manufacturers Association, quoted a 50% drop in sale of masks since the second wave started waning. He pointed out that the drop is primarily at the institutional level. “When the wave started, a lot of government and private tenders were floated for bulk purchase of masks for various government departments, including public hospitals. The number of such tenders has reduced recently,” said Jain. Jain, however, said citizens may not be using medical-grade masks. “Most citizens use cloth masks. Now, when places are unlocking, the public will have to be conscious about the diligent use of masks and sanitizers,” he added. Shaily Grover, founder, Paramount Surgimed, a healthcare company dealing in the manufacture of masks, said, “Retailers, who were earlier requesting 2-3 lakh pieces a month, have now reduced orders to 50,000-odd masks. There’s a 50% drop in such requests since the number of cases started reducing.” Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit at Ruby Hall Clinic, attributed the drop to a sharp reduction in patients. “Healthcare workers, isolation ward employees, cured patients’ relatives, jumbo clinic staff attached to such patients may have now naturally also lessened the use of N-95/surgical masks and sanitizers,” he said. Zirpe said citizens should continue to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, including use of masks and sanitizers, to avert a possible third wave. Sudhir Mehta, president, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), told TOI that he recently conducted an informal survey of mask compliance in several areas of the city. “I noticed people not wearing masks in many places. It is natural to feel happy about the number of cases falling but people have resumed normal activities without taking precaution,” he lamented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dip-in-covid-19-cases-brings-up-to-90-drop-in-mask-sanitizer-sales/articleshow/83415162.cms||Neha Madaan

The BMC could not confirm the authenticity of the video but admitted such an incident had happened at the site on Wednesday. The women were caught completely unaware as the manhole was on the footpath, but proved lucky as the chamber was not too deep and they did not get swept away by the current. The BMC chief has ordered that all manholes in the city should be inspected again. They are checked as part of the pre-monsoon routine. “The women were unhurt. However, we immediately informed the roads and storm water drain department, which is supposed to put the Fibre Reinforced Plastic (FRP) manhole covers. Earlier, the BMC used to put cast iron covers but these get stolen and so FRPs are being used instead. However, on days when there is very heavy rain, the FRP can get dislodged by water pressure and float away. Now, the Bhandup cover has been changed,” said Vibhas Acharekar, assistant municipal commissioner of S ward. The incident brought back memories of Deepak Amrapurkar, a renowned gastroenterologist, drowning after slipping into an open manhole on Elphinstone Road on a heavy rain day in August 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-women-fall-into-manhole-but-clamber-out-in-viral-video-covers-to-be-checked/articleshow/83415201.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad bank recovery officer held for seeking bribe||AURANGABAD: The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested the recovery officer of the Union Bank of India, Aurangabad, on the charges of seeking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh to get a loan amount sanctioned under the Prime Minister Employment Guarantee Scheme (PMEGS) and disburse it. CBI officials said two suspects have been booked, of them, one suspect identified as Suresh Ingale has been arrested. The accused was arrested while accepting bribe amount through two bearer cheques of Rs 30, 000 and Rs 50, 000. On being produced before the special court, he has been remanded in judicial custody.  When contacted, CBI superintendent of police MR Kadole confirmed that one of the accused in the case registered with the Pune unit of CBI has been arrested. A 26-year old city-based youth, in his complaint with the CBI, stated that he had applied for a loan under PMEGS in September 2018. He received communication in November 2020 informing that his loan file has reached the UBI branch of Paithan Gate in the city. He reached out to the bank authorities, who after avoiding him for several days, allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs 2.5 lakh, the amount he was eligible for getting as subsidy for the loan amount. The complainant said after he expressed his inability to pay the bribe, he was allegedly warned that his loan file would be rejected. Around the same time, he was contacted by the bank’s recovery officer, who assured help to get his loan file cleared. After series of meetings and negotiations, the deal was finalised at Rs1 lakh. Meanwhile, the youth received an online alert stating that his loan has been sanctioned. But the manager initially refused to disburse the loan amount. After much persuasion, the branch manager agreed to disburse the loan amount partially, while warning that if the agreed bribe amount is not paid, the remaining amount will not be disbursed. Unwilling to pay the bribe, the youth reached out to the CBI Pune unit on June 2 and lodged a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bank-recovery-officer-held-for-seeking-bribe/articleshow/83408303.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Jayakwadi and other Marathwada dams get over two TMC inflows||AURANGABAD: Jayakwadi and Vishnupuri dams are among five major irrigation projects in Marathwada, which have started receiving inflows at the onset of monsoon with the addition of over two TMC water taking place in these reservoirs since June 1. The good rainfall in catchment areas has resulted in Jayakwadi dam from Paithan taluka of Aurangabad district receiving 21 MCUM (million cubic meter) of water, whereas Vishnupuri dam from Nanded district received over 31 MCUM water. Among other major irrigation projects from the region, Yeldari dam and Lower Dudhan dam from Parbhani district have received over 5 MCUM and 3 MCUM inflows, respectively, whereas Sidhheshwar dam from Hingoli district has recorded 4 MCUM water. Jaisingh Hire, the assistant engineer with Command Area Development Authority (CADA), Aurangabad, said, “The catchment areas become dry due to the summer heat. Once catchment areas become wet due to initial spells of monsoon, it avoids transition loss of rainwater reaching to the dam,” he said. As per official data, both Lower Manar major irrigation project (Osmanabad district) and Majalgaon major irrigation project (Beed district) have received the highest rainfall (100 mm) in catchment areas since June 1, followed by Yeldari dam (95mm), Lower Terna dam from Osmanabad (72mm), Jayakwadi dam (71 mm), Lower Dudhna (65mm), Vishnupuri (51mm) and Sina Kolegaon from Osmanabad (12mm). The 11 major dams and two major barrages from Marathwada were showing improved collective storage of 69 TMC by Thursday morning, as compared to 57 TMC storage during the same period last year. Meanwhile, the good spell of the rainy season continues in the region with 11 circles from the region reporting heavy rainfall of more than 65 mm in the past 24 hours by Thursday morning. As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), more rain is in store for Aurangabad and parts of the region with chances of moderate rainfall till June 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jayakwadi-other-mwada-dams-get-over-2tmc-inflows/articleshow/83408369.cms||---

The information supplied by the Central Board of Direct taxes (CBDT) was based on surveys carried out in the last 10 years by its investigation-III branch. RTI reply on undisclosed income.It said undisclosed income of Rs90,390.33 crore was detected in financial year 2013-14 through 5,327 surveys carried out by the CBDT, which was highest in the last decade. In 2019-20, an amount of Rs22,243.56 crore wasn’t disclosed by taxpayers to the department. Even in Covid-19 pandemic last year, the CBDT carried out 367 surveys where evasion of Rs4,824.52 crore tax was detected. As per the information obtained by RTI activist Sangita Thul, the number of surveys also increased every year. In 2011-12, about Rs6,572.75 crore was detected through 3,706 surveys. The number of surveys increased to 15,401 in 2018-19, where Rs16,125 crore undisclosed income was found. The reply by CBDT central public relations officer ML Birdi added that only 43 persons were punished for evading tax in the last four years. According to Thul, the figure is very nominal, considering the fact that thousands of taxpayers adopt all unethical practices to evade the tax. As per CBDT, the data in this regard was being maintained centrally from 2017-18 onwards. In 2017-18, various courts have passed conviction orders against 21 accused for willful attempt to evade tax under Section 276C (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. In 2018-19, 17 persons were convicted and in 2019-20, just five were punished. Till December last year, not a single conviction was won due to the pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbdt-detected-over-rs2l-crore-in-undisclosed-income-in-last-10-years/articleshow/83413644.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Aurangabad||Suspects running fake call centre in Thane arrested||AURANGABAD: The Nanded police and the Thane crime branch, as part of a joint operation, arrested two men accused of running a fake call centre in Thane. The accused have been identified as Dinesh Chinchkar, a 31-year-old from Ramdaswadi in Kalyan, and 28-year-old Rohit Sherkar from the Kaka Dhaba locality in Kalyan East. Police have also seized 26 cellphones, a laptop and an illegally procured database of names. The police have obtained a transit remand for the suspects and the two men were on their way to Nanded at the time of filing this report. This call centre racket had been on police radar since before the Covid-related lockdowns were imposed. With the arrest of the two suspects, police said they have busted a major racket that had duped people — on the pretext of giving loans at attractive interest rates — from different parts of the country. Nanded superintendent of police Pramod Kumar Shewale told TOI, “Our team had been working on this case for over a year. Finally we have got success. We have arrested the kingpin. People from this call centre used to falsely claim that they were representatives of a leading finance company to cheat citizens.” The suspects were running the fake call centre from Block 116 of City Mall in Dombivali East, which falls within the limits of the Manpada police station. It was the crime branch unit-III of Kalyan, headed by senior inspector Sanjay John, that played an important role in busting of the racket, said Shewale. Police said there were about 20 employees working as call centre executives on meagre salaries of about Rs 10,000. These employees have been served notices and asked to report to Nanded police’s cyber police station and cooperate with the probe. Preliminary probe has indicated that the employees are gullible youths and were under the impression that they were working for a genuine call centre. Last year, while working on the case, the Nanded cyber police had tracked down the scammers’ location. But soon, the lockdown was imposed and the suspects shut down the call centre. The employees started working from home. However, soon after the unlock announcement, the suspect duo restarted the call centre, only to be arrested on Thursday. This year, on February 17, Nanded’s Itwara police station lodged a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust based on a complaint by fruit trader Abdul Mubin. Mubin had received a call telling him that a loan of Rs 25 lakh had been approved. However, he was cheated for Rs 50,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/suspects-running-fake-call-centre-in-thane-arrested/articleshow/83408323.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Many schools are said to be conducting classes with seven to eight periods in a day, even for primary school students. “Virtual classes for my son started on June 4. Daily, he has to attend seven periods, and classes are scheduled up to 3.30 pm,” said Sai Krishna, whose son is studying in class 5 in a private school in Habsiguda. Another parent, Raghu M, whose child is studying in class 8 in a private school in Miyapur, said, “Not just starting online classes, my child’s school even started removing fee defaulters. Today, he has been removed from online classes without any prior intimation.” Few parents said that they have been receiving messages from their child’s school informing them that classes will start on June 14. “My son’s school conducted an orientation on June 9 and informed us that classes will begin on June 14. I don’t understand why the school can’t wait for a couple of more days to start classes,” Vijay P, a parent. Some parents even took to Twitter to raise the issue. Parents said that schools are also asking them to buy uniforms, books, and other stationery items at the earliest. “I can understand buying books, but what’s the need to buy uniforms at this stage when there is no certainty when physical classes will begin? Asking parents to buy uniforms, will only put an additional financial burden on them,” said K Venkata Sainath of Hyderabad Schools Parents Association. The summer vacation for schools was supposed to end on May 31. However, the Telangana government extended the summer holidays for all schools and DIET (District Institute of Education and Training) colleges of the state till June 15 after taking the coronavirus situation into account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-begin-classes-despite-govt-extending-vacation/articleshow/83415227.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid widows see a ray of hope as Mumbai city bares its heart||Mumbai: Entrepreneur couple Ronnie and Zarina Screwvala have offered support for 12 women who lost their husbands to Covid-19, have no means of earning and many mouths to feed. The couple was moved by a TOI report on the plight of the widows, many of whom were facing economic hardship and discrimination. Besides the Screwvalas, readers from across the country offered aid. Dharavi residents Shabana Pathan and Naseema Khatoon were not acquainted with each other but were going through a similar struggle. Pathan was rendered homeless and penniless after her husband, Rafiq, who sold medicinal herbs, died of Covid. Partially lame and unable to travel for work, Pathan worried constantly about the safety of her 11-year-old daughter, Mahenoor, as the two spent the day at homes of acquaintances and nights at dargahs or railway stations. As for Khatoon, the frail 29-year-old is a school dropout and was pregnant with her seventh child when her husband, Sajid, a small entrepreneur, died of Covid. Had it not been for neighbours and NGO volunteers, she and her kids would have starved. The Screwvalas have picked up costs of accommodation, ration, children’s education and basic needs like electricity for 12 widows for six months. “Zarina and I are happy to commit to helping 12 such families, plus look to support 100 more in the ensuing days. Key is not charity, but to get them back on their feet in these six months and then hold the parent’s hand into employment and the children through school and college,” Ronnie Screwvala said. Six other donors contributed Rs 20,000. A children’s home in Matunga offered to house Mahenoor and offer a job in the kitchen to Pathan. Four citizens from Malad, Ambernath, Navi Mumbai and Ahmednagar offered jobs to the widows. “Covid widows is a pan-India issue... People could look into their local communities, identify families in distress and help in whatever way they can,” said Shievani Upadhyaya of NGO Enrich Lives Foundation that is trying to work out long-term intervention for the widows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/covid-widows-see-a-ray-of-hope-as-mumbai-city-bares-its-heart/articleshow/83416325.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Hyderabad||Despite pandemic, Telangana’s IT exports & jobs up in 2020-21||HYDERABAD: Telangana’s IT sector has turned the tables on the pandemic. At a time when Covid-19 is destroying jobs in almost every sector, tech companies in the state have created 46,489 jobs during 2020-21 as compared to 39,093 in 2019-20. These jobs were added despite slower IT exports growth of 13% in 2020-21 at Rs 1.45 lakh crore. The state’s IT exports had grown 18% during 2019-20 at Rs 1.29 lakh crore from Rs 1.09 lakh crore in 2018-19. “The employment in the IT/ITeS sector has increased by 8% in 2020-21... Every new direct job created in the IT sector leads to the creation of 2.5 new indirect jobs,” said Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao while launching the annual report of IT, Electronics and Communication (ITE&C) department on Thursday. ITE&C principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan attributed the growth in job creation to three key factors — large companies continuing to expand their workforce as per their pre-Covid plans, push in digitisation necessitated by Covid-19 and the availability of skilled workforce in Hyderabad with low attrition rates. KTR pointed out that when Telangana was formed, there were 3.23 lakh people working in the IT and ITeS sector and over 3 lakh new jobs have been added in the last seven years, taking the total employment created by the sector to 6.28 lakh. “When we started as a newborn state of Telangana in 2014, our IT exports were Rs 57,000 crore. Since the formation of the new state, we have been able to achieve a CAGR of 14.25%,” KTR said. Commenting on the numbers, HYSEA president Bharani Kumar Aroll pointed out that the IT exports growth numbers have been impressive as the industry was only targeting a higher single digit growth during the onset of pandemic last year, but with the gradual recovery the IT industry was hopeful of double digit growth by the end of FY21. “What is commendable is that a higher number of jobs have been created despite the IT industry working from home. In the coming days, with the state government’s thrust on boosting the IT sector in tier 2-3 centres and the WFH scenario, the sector is poised to grow in these places as well,” he said, adding that investments have flowed into the state despite Covid-19 and not even a single deal was reversed. Besides attracting new IT players to the state and enabling the existing ones to expand operations, KTR said the state government was working with industry stakeholders to boost the growth and usage of emerging technologies such as AI, Blockchain and Drones among others, in various sectors such as healthcare and agriculture. He said the state government would also be setting up IT towers in Ramagundam, Nalgonda, Mahabubnagar, Nizamabad and Siddipet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-pandemic-ts-it-exports-jobs-up-in-2020-21/articleshow/83416318.cms||Swati Rathor

The panel submitted its report to higher education minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati on Thursday. The five-member committee consisting of various vice-chancellors of the state and senior educational officials said that majority of them were of the opinion that examinations should be conducted even if it meant that the dates be delayed further. A panel member told TOI that most people were in support of conducting the examinations of all the years. “As per the university policy, a student’s marks for two years are necessary for evaluation and validation of degree. Barring final year students, we promoted the rest in 2020. This year exams have to be conducted for them. First year students can be promoted if the situation turns worse,” the committee member said. The final announcement will be made by chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Bhati. Academics said there is problem in evaluating students without examinations where there’s no semester system. In universities and colleges with semester system, internal marking throughout the year with various tests can be helpful to evaluate students without examinations. But in majority of institutions where more than 14 lakh students are studying, having just the final examinations and to universalise a formula for everyone is difficult. There have been several complaints in the past when every university charted out its own formula of evaluating students which many students claimed it to be unfair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-for-2nd-3rd-yr-varsity-exams-submits-report-to-govt/articleshow/83415244.cms||---

Ayaansh Gupta got a shot of the US-manufactured drug Zolgensma, thanks to over 62,400 people contributing Rs 14.84 crore towards his treatment through a crowdfunding site. The remaining Rs 1.2 crore came from an international crowdfunding initiative and the boy's family. The Union government waived import duty of Rs 6 crore, without which the drug would have cost Rs 22 crore. Children suffering from SMA type 1 rarely make it beyond two years of age without medical intervention. “SMA is a progressive neuromuscular disease caused due to a defect in the SMN1 gene,” said Dr Ramesh Konanki, paediatric neurologist at Rainbow Children’s Hospital. “Affected children show muscle weakness, involving upper and lower limbs initially, but over time develop breathing and swallowing difficulty,” added Dr Ramesh. “Zolgensma is the single-dose intravenous injection of gene therapy, in which the defective SMN1 gene is replaced through adenoviral vector. Ayaansh is doing fine and will be under observation for a day.” Ayaansh’s case had caught the attention of Bollywood celebrities and cricketers, with many of them donating to the fund and spreading the word. “It is heartening to witness the power of crowdfunding. A large number of donors came together to support Ayaansh Gupta’s family in their journey of saving their child. The single highest donation received on the crowdfunding campaign is Rs 56 lakh and USD $7,000. We are super ecstatic at the moment,” said Piyush Jain, co-founder and CEO, ImpactGuru.com.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kindness-of-strangers-helps-hyd-toddler-get-rs-16cr-shot/articleshow/83416350.cms||Amrita Didyala

The mazaars — two tiny cemented structures built side by side — were devoted to Jalesar Baba, a peer baba in Jalesar (Etah), worshipped by Jaipal Singh and his family of seven. “We had built the mazaars a year ago since we have deep faith in the peer. We didn’t do anything wrong…We haven’t encroached on anyone’s land. But police told us to remove them yesterday. They said it was required to prevent communal tension. I’m a small person, I can’t fight anyone,” Singh, a daily wager, told TOI. On Wednesday, Bajrang Dal convenor (city) Gaurav Sharma had taken to Twitter to urge the authorities to get the mazaars removed. He alleged that they were part of a “conspiracy to convert Hindu families”. Sharma’s tweets tagged chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Prime Minister’s office, Aligarh police and MP Sadhvi Pragya. Talking to TOI, Sharma said the family was using the mazaars to convert illiterate Hindus to Islam. “What is the purpose of a mazaar in a Hindu household?” he asked. Police admitted that they had received a complaint from Bajrang Dal on the issue and paid a visit to Singh’s house on Wednesday. “We only advised Singh, it was his decision to remove the mazaars,” Jalesar chowki-in-charge Anuj Kumar said.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Doctor sees bid to defame him using ‘toolkit’||KOCHI: Alleging a bias against Ayurveda, homeopathy and other forms of traditional medicine, trolls have been targeting Dr Cyriac Abby Philips, a doctor who works on drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and has published several peer-reviewed papers on the adverse link between traditional medicines and acute liver injury. “I think there is a toolkit on me. It’s happening,” Dr Philips of The Liver Institute, Center of Excellence in GI Sciences, Rajagiri Hospital, Aluva, said in a tweet. “Since the last one month I have been trolled and am getting threats from a few practitioners of alternate medicine. When I criticize quackery and pseudo-science, an attack was expected. But this has only made my job of creating awareness easier,” Dr Philips told TOI. The Asia Pacific Association of Study of Liver consensus guidelines that is based on current evidence-information on DILI in Asia Dr Philips had participated in the preparation of these guidelines clearly states that hepatotoxicity resulting from the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) and the ubiquitous use of traditional and complementary medicines in Asian countries can lead to DILI. After individual letters and emails, now alternate medicine “activists” through a ‘toolkit’ seem to be collaborating on social media to defame him. One recent tweet against Dr Philips, that has been retweeted by many, even accused him of linking the pandemic with traditional medicine. In a polite tone that tries to hide the underlying malice, the tweet asks him “to kindly provide details with link of Research that you are conducting with @Rajagiri_Hosptl that prove Ayush medicines are responsible for the New #Pandemic in India in form of Liver injury?” Recently, a pro-farmers protest toolkit made headlines after Swedish activist Greta Thunberg shared its link in a tweet on February 4. Delhi police registered FIR and few arrests were made. However, Dr Philips has not yet approached the police. “It will eventually die down because I don’t step out of science. The “toolkit” has given me more energy and encouraged me to further promote evidence based medicine. These “activists” make lots of fallacious statements that have made my job easier as it is a stepping stone for me to provide more information on quackery,” Dr Philips said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/doc-sees-bid-to-defame-him-using-toolkit/articleshow/83411333.cms||Preetu Nair

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Cheaper form of vital anti-mucor drug is good enough, says Task Force||Pune: Central government's Joint Task Force has clarified that conventional amphotericin B is 'equally efficacious' as its more expensive version in the treatment of Covid-associated mucormycosis (CAM).The task force's advisory brings relief to patients nationwide. Most doctors treating mucormycosis have been apprehensive about using conventional amphotericin (deoxycholate), citing its impact on the kidneys by triggering nephrotoxicity. Hence, they have been insisting on the extremely expensive (liposomal) formulation of the drug.But a minimum 21-day course of the liposomal form can cost Rs 7.5 lakh-Rs 17 lakh, depending on a patient's body weight. Treatment with conventional amphotericin (deoxycholate) for the same period costs Rs 8,000-Rs 16,000.The task force experts said conventional amphotericin B can be used without worry, as long as doctors monitor patients' kidney functions and electrolytes imbalance. The Joint National Task Force for Covid-19 is an expert body of the NITI Aayog and the ICMR."The Joint National Task Force has recommended that amphotericin B—both in the amphotericin B lipid complex/liposomal form and the amphotericin B deoxycholate form—is equally efficacious for treatment of Covid associated mucormycosis cases," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to states and UTs on June 7, 2021.The union health ministry has requested states and UTs to widely disseminate the advisory.In a June 7 report, TOI had said administering conventional amphotericin, along with careful monitoring of kidney functions, can reduce mucormycosis treatment cost by 100 times and make it affordable for the masses.The liposomal form of amphotericin injections costs the patient Rs 35,000 per day. The conventional form of the drug (deoxycholate) costs just Rs 350 per day, but requires a blood test every alternate day to rule out the drug's toxicity in the kidneys.Infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, member of the national task force, said, "Use of conventional amphotericin does not cause long-term kidney complications. All minor kidney issues, post-conventional amphotericin therapy, are fully reversible."Experts noted that an "unwarranted fear" of conventional amphotericin causing kidney damage has led to the hyped demand for the liposomal form.“It is the fear of 'kidney damage' in the minds of the public as well as physicians that has led to the overrating of the liposomal form. We should dispel this fear. Careful monitoring with blood creatinine and few other tests can tide over this risk and make use of conventional amphotericin effective,” said ENT surgeon Samir Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cheaper-form-of-vital-anti-mucor-drug-is-good-enough-says-task-force/articleshow/83415322.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The campaign also aims to dispel myths around the Covid vaccines. The collector, during his visit, took stock of the vaccination status there and met villagers and sarpanchs. He requested them to inspire people above 45 years to get vaccinated. On Wednesday alone, around 8,000 people were vaccinated in the drive. Following the directions to organise door-to-door camps, vaccination camps were organised in all gram panchayats for people aged 45 years and above, and people enthusiastically got vaccinated. Modi visited Moolsagar, Damodara, Kanoi, Sam, Meghwalon ki Basti, Sargro ki Basti, Balidad ki Basti etc. At many centres, the pace of vaccination was slow.

Their numbers were up from 19.05 lakh in 2018-19 to 19.51 lakh in 2019-20, the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report released on Thursday said. The report also said the Gender Parity Index for the state rose from 0.86 in 2015-16 to 0.93 in 2019-20. The index is better when it is closer to 1. Maharashtra with 4,494 colleges is second after Uttar Pradesh, with 34 colleges available per lakh population. In terms of state-share in 2019-20, the state tops in the enrolment in universities, including constituent units like sub-centres, with 9.67 lakh students, followed by Tamil Nadu with 9.26 lakh and Delhi with 8.16 lakh pupils. But, the number of foreign students enrolled in the state was down to 4,599 in 2019-20 as against 5003 in 2018-19. Pune has retained its fourth place in the country as the city with the highest number of colleges at 467 compared to 450 in 2018-19. Dhanraj Mane, state director for higher education, said the increase in colleges in rural areas is one of the reasons for more girls enrolling in higher education. “Hostel facilities are made available to them. The free bus pass girl students get helps them to complete school education and enter college. The increase in nursing colleges in the state has helped more women take up the course as the possibility of getting a job is high. Women have also started taking the benefit of various scholarships available to them due to better awareness of the schemes, which boosts higher enrolment,” Mane added. V N Magare, pro-vice chancellor of SNDT Women’s University, said awareness about women empowerment is increasing resulting in more of them taking up higher education. “As an exclusive university for women, our founding fathers wanted to empower them. We provide skill-based education which helps them get a job easily and that helps them stand on their own feet. This inspires other women to take up higher education too. The numbers will increase more in the coming years,” Magare added. All-India Trends The report also said that the number of universities and similar institutions listed on AISHE portal increased from 799 in 2015-16 to 1,043 in 2019-20 by almost 30.5% and the number of colleges from 39,071 to 42,343 in the same period by 8.4%. Not many universities came up in the larger states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal in 2019-20 when compared with the previous year. Enrolment grew considerably during the last five years from 3.45 crore in 2015-16 to 3. 85 crore in 2019-20, posting an overall growth of 11.4%. The enrolment at the doctoral level increased from 1.26 lakh to 20.25 lakh and in the integrated level it rose from 15.54 lakh to 30.03 lakh during this period and teachers’ numbers went up from 15.03 lakh to 15. 81 lakh. Similarly, enrolment in various undergraduate programmes increased over the years in the regular mode of education except in BA. and BTech, where it has started showing a decline. Women’s participation is very high and has increased sharply at MA, M.Com and M.Sc levels in the five-year period, but their participation is still low in undergraduate courses like BCA, BBA, B.Tech, BE and LLB.

They have an aggressive marketing strategy that attracts foreign students that we lack. This can be one reason for the decline.” Another senior official from SPPU said that one of the reasons for the decline may also be due to the tougher admission policy for international students in Maharashtra. “Technical education, especially engineering, is sought after by these students but when it comes to admission in the state, it is a lengthy and difficult process with hardly any counselling available to the students. This process needs to be streamlined,” he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-tops-in-varsity-enrolment-of-students/articleshow/83415325.cms||Ardhra Nair

Kolkata and some of its adjoining districts may receive heavy rain on Friday as a cyclonic circulation over northwest Bay of Bengal is likely to trigger a low-pressure area. It is likely to get more marked during the subsequent 24 hours and move towards Odisha. “Till the system remains a low pressure over northwest Bay of Bengal on Friday, it will be nearer to Kolkata. So, the city is likely to receive heavy showers. Once it turns into a depression and moves towards Odisha, the impact on Kolkata will lessen. We expect 70mm-110mm in the city over the next four days,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. He added that if the city receives enough rain and the other conditions are met, monsoon may arrive in Bengal on Friday. “If not, then we expect the currents to cover the entire state by Saturday,” added Das. Along with Kolkata, heavy rain has been predicted in Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas, East and West Midnapore on Friday. “Kolkata will receive heavier showers on Friday, after which the rain could be light to moderate. But since monsoon will set in and the rain will continue, the temperature will remain low,” added Das. He added that early monsoon rain in Kolkata is referred to as ‘summer monsoon’ since precipitation is inconsistent and often scanty during the early part of the season in Kolkata.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/expect-downpour-today-met-predicts-wet-weekend/articleshow/83413671.cms||---

Apart from BKU Charuni’s big convoy from Panipat, smaller groups also reached Tikri and Singhu. On Wednesday, central agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar refused once again to repeal the farm laws and asked farmers to pick another option to resume talks. They instead reinforced their numbers on the Delhi borders and fortified against heat and approaching monsoon. BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) is building a 10,000-square-feet pucca shed at the Bahadurgarh grain market near Pakora Chowk. Farmer union’s secretary Shingara Singh Mann said: "We have family back home for hassle-free transplantation of paddy. The wheat season went well along with the protests and the transplantation of paddy will also not suffer. At many places, our activists will take over where the entire families have joined protest." BKU (Dakaunda) vice-president Manjit Singh Dhaner, who led a batch to Delhi three days ago, said: "We have asked the farmers to send anyone from the family. Paddy is essential but the protest, too, is important." After Karnal and Ambala, Panipat sent a big batch to Delhi on Sunday. The farmers first gathered at the toll plaza on National Highway-44. Gurnam Singh Charuni, one of the biggest protest commanders, led this convoy of SUVs, cars, and motorcycles. He said: "The farmers of Panipat have pumped new energy into the movement. It shows how neither our count nor our enthusiasm has come down." Charuni said the farmers had saved the country’s economy during the Covid-19 pandemic but, in the 11 rounds of talks, failed to understand the benefits of the three farm laws. He saw gains only for the corporate houses. Reacting to the MSP hike, Charuni used a common idiom to say: "Oont ke muh me jeera (a cumin seed in the camel’s mouth)."

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Snarls return to haunt Tallah after Chitpore Bridge closure||KOLKATA: The shutting down of the Chitpore Bridge for a load test led to traffic snarls around Shyambazar on Thursday morning. The worst hit stretches included the Shyambazar five-point crossing and encompassed the entire Rajballabpara-RG Kar Road-Belgachhia Road stretch. Though the closure of the bridge was planned for early morning on Thursday, the Shyambazar traffic guard allowed a few more hours of traffic movement before allowing the KMDA to start the work. The closure of the bridge will continue till June 13. “The blockade was implemented around 11am. However, the slow movement of vehicles could not be avoided. As this was the first day, some motorists faced trouble in navigating their way, thus leading to the slow movement. We have brought in some minor changes and we are hoping for a better traffic movement on Friday. With the work being slated to finish by this weekend, there should not be any issue from Monday,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. Besides Shyambazar traffic guard that managed the diversions, the Jorabagan traffic guard also stopped the movement of trucks on the Sovabazar-BK Pal Avenue stretch after a couple of hours to lessen traffic pressure.

President of the All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists Associations Jagannath Shinde said, “A section of the population may have reduced the use of masks and sanitizers after the drop in cases and with reduced Covid-19 fears.” He added that multispeciality Covid-19 hospitals still continue to use masks and sanitizers. “However, the drop in sales has come in case of relatives of cured patients or people in certain localities that now have a lower number of cases,” Shinde said. All India Mask Manufacturers Association president Anshumali Jain said the drop is primarily at the institutional level. “When the wave started, a lot of government and private tenders were floated for bulk buys of masks for various government departments, including public hospitals. The number of such tenders has reduced recently,” said Jain. Shaily Grover, founder, Paramount Surgimed, a manufacturer of masks, said, “Retailers, who were earlier requesting 2-3 lakh pieces a month, have now reduced orders to 50,000-odd masks. There’s a 50% drop in such requests since the number of cases started reducing.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-dip-in-cases-leads-to-30-40-drop-in-mask-sanitiser-sales/articleshow/83415345.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Hyderabad||Three mosques open mucor detection centres in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Three mosques in the city are now equipped with dental and ophthalmic infrastructure to screen 5,000 Covid-19 recovered patients for mucormycosis, the fungal infection that is creating havoc in parts of India. Experts in ophthalmology, dental sciences and ENT, besides general physicians will take up screening of post-Covid-19 patients to rule out mucormycosis as the second wave in Telangana is now on a steady decline. Most mucormycosis cases are reported between second and four weeks post recovery from the virus. On Thursday, mucormycosis screening drive began at Masjid Ishaq at NS Kunta, Masjid Muhammed Mustafa at Rajendranagar and Masjid Omar-e-Shifa at Shaheenagar in the city. Incidentally, this is the first contact community-level screening for mucormycosis. The mosque centres would not only screen Covid-19 recovered patients but also spread awareness about prevention and control of the major fungal threat to health. There is also online counselling and diagnosis facility for those who cannot visit the centres. “With dental chairs and full-fledged ophthalmology units at the mosque centres, arrangement have been made for screening by a team of general practitioners, dental surgeons and ophthalmologists. Any patient found to be having early signs of the infection will be referred to a specialist or higher centre for further management and the patient will be tracked and monitored till he or she is discharged from hospital,” Helping Hand Foundation managing trustee Mujtaba Hasan Askari. According to Dr Arshia Akbar, senior ophthalmologist and oculoplastic surgeon, who is associated with the mosque centres, early detection of mucormycosis was significant as it results in better outcome. “The typical pathology may involve rhino (nose) sinuses, maxillary sinus (oral cavity), orbit (eye) and then brain finally. However, this is not necessarily the order,” she added. About 5,000 post-Covid-19 patients have registered with Helping Hand Foundation, the NGO running these centres. All the post-Covid-19 cases between second and fourth week of the disease were being contacted and screened for mucormycosis. Triaging for mucormycosis through a structured template or risk assessment form would be done at the centres. In the last three years, many mosques in Hyderabad have opened their doors to services other than religious. Beginning with ‘Visit my mosque’ programme in 2018, mosques have turned into impromptu clinics, diagnostic centres, Covid-19 isolation centres, mid-day meal centres and shelters for flood-hit people of the city. Some of them have been hosting libraries and coaching centres for better career prospects of the youth. People cutting across religious divide have benefited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-mosques-open-mucor-detection-centres/articleshow/83413877.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Pool funds to improve attendant facilities at hospitals, says K Chandrasekhar Rao||HYDERABAD: To provide relief to attendants of patients from economically weaker sections, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, during the recent cabinet meet, suggested that MLAs and MPs pool funds to improve facilities at government hospitals. This, as many such attendants find it difficult to pay for accommodation outside the hospital premises even on regular days. State-run hospitals take in the most number of inpatients even on regular days, at an occupancy rate of around 120 per cent which also leads to a rush of attendants. One of the topics which reportedly came up for discussion during the meet was how hospitals in the government sector, despite serving large numbers of patients, were still seen as centres of negligence. “Even in the non-Covid scenario, the occupancy ratio of government hospitals is anywhere between 120 and 130 per cent,” informed a highly-placed source in the government. On regular days, floor beds are arranged to treat patients while in paediatric wards, children undergoing treatment share beds with other children and sometimes even with their mothers. Such scenarios increase the load of visitors to hospitals, and this happens often in cases of patients who are under long-term treatment. In most cases, family members coming from villages or remote areas cannot afford the rent and other costs of staying in accommodations outside the hospital. “They sit on footpaths or under trees and bring with them stoves to cook and have to face other difficulties. In such a situation, if facilities for such people can be improved, the image of government hospitals will be enhanced as reliable support for and poor and even middle-income groups,” the government source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-pool-funds-to-improve-attendant-facilities-at-hosps/articleshow/83414053.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Delhi||Keeping guard up: 19 oxygen plants to open in Delhi by end of week||NEW DELHI: By the end of this week, Delhi government will get at least 19 more oxygen plants to keep the capital prepared to fight the next Covid-19 wave, if any. The government has already installed three storage centres, each 57 metric tonne in capacity, and work is undergoing on a war footing to set up more. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday visited a 57 metric tonne oxygen storage and generation centre in northwest Delhi’s Siraspur and said oxygen infrastructure was being created at various places in the city so that people didn’t have to struggle in case of a third wave. “Delhi government is rapidly making arrangements in case a third wave comes. In the second wave, shortage of oxygen came out as the biggest challenge due to which people of Delhi had to struggle a lot for a few days. Therefore, the preparations for adequate oxygen supply are being made so that in case a third wave emerges, there should be no shortage of oxygen,” Kejriwal said. A cryogenic tank of 57 metric tonne is being installed at Siraspur along with an oxygen generation plant with a production capacity of 12.5 tonne per day. “Three oxygen storage tanks of 57 metric tonne capacity each, a total of 171MT, have been installed in Delhi,” the chief minister said. Besides Sirsapur, two other storage centres have been built in Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital and DDU Hospital. Delhi reported major oxygen shortage when the second Covid-19 wave had peaked towards April-end and some Covid patients undergoing treatment in hospitals died during this period. The supply of oxygen was much less than the demand and distribution issues aggravated the crisis. This has prompted Delhi government to plan adequate oxygen supply for any future requirement. “Two oxygen generation plants are to be set up whose combined capacity will be 13,500 metric tonne,” Kejriwal said. “Oxygen facilities are being created in various places in Delhi; 19 more plants are to be inaugurated within a day or two.” He added, “All over Delhi, facilities for oxygen storage, oxygen generation are being created. We faced a lot of problem regarding tankers when we had to get oxygen from Haryana and other states. We did not have tankers. So we are also getting tankers. All preparations are in full swing.” Delhi government officials have been engaging with experts for oxygen management so that the city can be prepared even if 37,000 fresh Covid cases are reported on a daily basis and the number of hospitalised patients increases again. The government is trying to ensure that there is no death due to oxygen shortage, said a source. The buffer liquor medical oxygen storage capacity will be enhanced by 421MT, and the liquid medical oxygen storage capacity will be increased to have at least one-day buffer even during the peak demand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/keeping-guard-up-19-o2-plants-to-open-in-city-by-end-of-week/articleshow/83411447.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Santragachhi Jheel’s water toxic, not fit to sustain life, reveals study||KOLKATA: Santragachhi Jheel, a biodiversity hotspot in Howrah that draws migratory birds from faraway lands each winter, is turning increasingly toxic. An analysis of the lake’s water quality, only the second one in two decades, has revealed that it is not fit for sustaining life. The water analysis at the 10.9 hectare waterbody carried out by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board shows major deviations from the national water quality criteria. Dissolved oxygen (DO) at 3mg/l is way lower than the desired 6mg/l or more, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) at 10.6mg/l against a desired level of 2-4mg/l or less and total coliform of 1,70,000 MPN/100ml against less than 5,000MPN/100 ml point to the extremely poor state of the lake’s water that makes it difficult to sustain any life form, be it fish or other aquatic animals. Scientists have cautioned that the water is unfit for sustaining wildlife and fisheries and should not be used by people for even bathing and suggested warning signs be put up around the lake. Environment activist Subhas Datta, who had moved the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015, pointing out that the important habitat for migratory birds was being encroached upon and that the upkeep of the waterbody was extremely poor, expressed extreme disappointment at the negligence by both South Eastern Railway (SER) and Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC). The NGT had in an order in 2017 asked SER and HMC to set up a sewage treatment plant to ensure that the untreated sewage is not dumped into the lake. The last study on physico-chemical characteristics of the jheel, which was carried out close to two decades ago (February 2000 to January 2002) by scientists from the zoological department at Kalyani University, had found the water quality to be poor due to the inflow of sewage effluents from houses in the vicinity that caused turbidity. The study had concluded that the physico-chemical characteristics of Santragachi Jheel indicated that its water was rich in nutrients as well as pollution. This also increased the biological oxygen demand. The presence of sewage also led to reduced transparency of the water. Sewage contamination was the main cause identified for high nitrate and phosphates content. The jheel is owned by South Eastern Railway but since August 1992, the wildlife wing of the forest department has taken up management and development work of the wetland. Individual efforts by green organisations like Nature Mates have led to removal of water hyacinths but nothing has been done to clean up the lake’s water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/santragachhi-jheels-water-toxic-not-fit-to-sustain-life-reveals-study/articleshow/83413707.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Kochi||Kerala HC reverses conviction of top health officials||KOCHI: The high court has acquitted two top health officials who were convicted in the 2003 ‘hepatitis vaccine scam’ in which it was alleged that the exchequer lost close to Rs 1.5 crore as vaccines were bought in excess quantity than required to aid three manufacturers, including Serum Institute. Justice R Narayana Pisharadi held that Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) failed to prove that excess quantity of vaccines were procured. The agency also failed to prove conspiracy and pecuniary benefit against the top health officials, the court held. Those acquitted are first accused Dr VK Rajan, former director of health services, and second accused Dr Shylaja, former district medical officer (DMO) of Thiruvananthapuram. The companies from which they were accused of procuring excess vaccines are Serum Institute of India Ltd, Shantha Biotechnics (Pvt) Ltd, and VH Bhagath and Company. In 2017, a vigilance court had sentenced both the doctors to five years of rigorous imprisonment and had imposed a fine of Rs 52 lakh each. The high court pointed out that VACB has not adduced any expert evidence to establish that there was no necessity to administer hepatitis vaccine when there was no outbreak of that disease or that it is necessary to administer the vaccine only when an outbreak of that disease is apprehended or anticipated. Even if it is accepted that the DMO issued orders for supplying more vaccine than needed and that it caused a loss to the government, it is not sufficient to attract the offence of criminal misconduct under Prevention of Corruption Act, the court said. There is no allegation or evidence to prove that the first or second accused obtained any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage, the court pointed out. “There is no allegation that any person had received any commission or ‘kickback’ in the transaction. No doubt, the words ‘pecuniary advantage’ are of wide amplitude. But, the companies which sold the vaccine as per the supply orders issued by the second accused obtained only the fixed price of the vaccine and nothing more. The money received by those companies towards the price of the vaccine cannot be treated as pecuniary ‘advantage’ in the context of Section 13(1)(d) of the Act,” the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-reverses-conviction-of-top-health-officials/articleshow/83411457.cms||---

Even though lockdowns and restrictions were lifted by November and the outlook for the hospitality industry was far from being sanguine, but he took the gamble. Today, with an ear to ear smile, Karwasra said that more than the gamble paying off, the confidence he has gained is worth many times more the money he made in the pandemic. “We wrote several mails to various corporates, tied up with hospitals to give accommodation to their healthcare professionals on Covid duty, and offered nominal packages to the families of patients being treated nearby. Surprisingly, the response was positive and helped me achieve 60% average occupancy during the time when the entire hospitality industry is hardly surviving,” said Rajat Karwasra, director Loft 24 Karwasra is one of the young entrepreneurs who are nimble footed to give a new spin to their business models and make the best out of a new challenging situation. Rudravrat Singh Patan (29), running the family heritage property Patan Mahal near Kotputli, said it was also a testing time for them but the ‘work from anywhere’ model offered them an opening and they seized the opportunity. “We closed the last financial year with nearly 70% occupancy. 50% of the business was driven by people who were working remotely. It was a new segment which we cultivated through social media and online marketing. Otherwise, weddings, anniversaries and birthdays are the main source of our business,” said 29-year Patan. For Shambhavi Singh (26), director of the Royal Heritage Haveli, an 18th Century hunting lodge turned into a boutique hotel, it was a different strategy to ride out the storm. “With all possibilities of international travel remaining closed, we turned focus on our core strength, offering good, freshly prepared food. Even though the usual clientele was not there, the new venture into the food industry helped us to enable our employees to tide over. But more than the business, we earned trust from an expanded network of new clients,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/young-entrepreneurs-in-hospitality-biz-ride-out-pandemic-with-innovative-approach/articleshow/83415341.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Hyderabad||Cross-border movement behind Khammam surge||Hyderabad: Day after Khammam’s daily Covid-19 count shot past Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) numbers — for the first time during this pandemic — experts attributed it to increased movement across its 150-km-long border with Andhra Pradesh. “There is a lot of movement along the border due to agricultural activity. Many people own farms on both sides,” said a source adding that part of this movement is also because people travel across borders (from AP to Telangana) to buy liquor. On June 9, the district reported 180 cases (it’s total caseload now stands at 45,000) as against GHMC’s 179, forcing authorities to continue with the 1 pm lockdown in some divisions of Khammam. They have also ramped up daily testing numbers to 8,000. “Khammam is witnessing a delayed peak. In fact, it’s graph is more reflective of how the Covid-19 wave is progressing in AP than in Telangana,” district collector, RV Kannan, told TOI over telephone. He added: “We are, however, prepared to tackle the situation and have all the infrastructure in place, including oxygen supply and medicines. But just to make sure that there is no further spike of cases, we have continuing with the earlier lockdown restrictions for another week.” While the positivity rate in Khammam, that had touched 28% in Sattupalli and Madhira around May 15-May 16, has dropped to 7% now, it is still much higher than the overall rate of 1.8%. This, experts say, indicates the peak of second wave, which concluded in rest of the state by the first week of May, is still continuing in Khammam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cross-border-movement-behind-khammam-surge/articleshow/83414378.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

A daily wage worker from Medak, for instance, had to run from pillar to post to clear an hefty bill and discharge his mother from a private hospital. “I had to take a gold loan and a hand loan from relatives to clear Rs 13.5 lakh levied by the hospital management. The total bill was around Rs15.9 lakh. After we approached them, they gave us a discount of Rs 2.5 lakh and asked us to pay the rest to be able to discharge my mother,” said Manaih, the daily wage worker. Similarly, kin of a black fungus patient recovering at a private ENT hospital in Jubilee Hills is raising Rs 25 lakh to clear the hospital bill.  “My father was diagnosed with black fungus on May 17. He underwent a surgery as well. His treatment will take at least two weeks. We have already spent all our life savings on the treatment. Now we need another Rs 25 lakh to get him treated,” said Shaikh Mustaqeem, who has started a fundraiser on an online platform to collect funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/steep-private-hospital-bills-continue-to-worry-patients/articleshow/83414289.cms||---
---||Pune||Alumni, peers lend a hand to Covid-impacted students||Pune: Giving back to their alma mater, alumni associations of various schools and colleges are doing their best to raise funds to help Covid-impacted students. Some students have lost the breadwinners of their families, whereas many parents have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and severe financial problems, in turn, have driven students to drop out from schools and colleges. Jayashree Venkatraman, principal of SNBP International School, said, “Out of 6,000 students, around 2,000 of them come from families that have either lost their source of income or are facing severe financial crunch. Job loss and salary cuts across sectors are major concerns, as parents find it difficult to pay the fees in such situations. Our senior students organised an online event to raise funds so that their peers can carry on with their education. I have also sanctioned waivers to many parents who cannot afford to pay the fees after losing their jobs,” she said. The Vincentians Old Boys Association has also stepped up to help out present students. “The batch of 1978 came forward to help raise funds to pay the fees for four primary students. Donations poured in from former students, now based in the US, the UK, Hong Kong and Australia. We raised around Rs1.56 lakh. It was important to reach out by visiting homes and taking stock of the situation,” said Richard Fernandez, alumnus of St Vincent’s High School and Junior College. The Alumni of St Mira’s College for girls participated in a fund raiser organised by Artsphere, run by Anubha Doshi (a former student), to help current Covid-impacted students carry on with their education. “We ran an online campaign for 15 days, where many alumni contributed,” said Doshi. Jaya Rajagopalan, principal-in-charge, St Mira’s College, said, “After conducting a survey to assess whether most can pay the exam fees, we have allowed all students to take the second semester exams irrespective of payment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/alumni-peers-lend-a-hand-to-covid-impacted-students/articleshow/83415354.cms||---

He opposed the move to name the airport after Shiv Sena supremo late Balasaheb Thackeray and backed the locals’ demand for it to be named after former parliamentarian D B Patil. Clarifying his stand, Prakash, grandson of Dr BR Ambedkar, said original residents of Ulve, Kopar and Panvel had surrendered their land for the airport project and the fight for the rights of project-affected persons was led by Patil. “He also contributed to the movement for the rights of OBCs and has represented Raigad district in the Lok Sabha four times. He also held the post of opposition leader in the state assembly. Considering his contribution to the poor in the society, the state government should appreciate the sentiments of the locals who surrendered their ancestral land for the airport project and accept their demand to name the airport after DB Patil. VBA also demanded that the airport be named after Patil,” said Ambedkar. On Thursday, All Party Action Committee protested in Thane and Panvel belt, demanding to name the airport after their leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/vba-jumps-into-navi-mumbai-airport-name-row-backs-locals/articleshow/83416452.cms||---

She is also helping Covid-19 widows set up sources of income, coordinating tele consultations and supplying medicines and food. The most fulfilling experience for Sowmya was when she helped a pregnant woman from a village far away to deliver her baby in Hyderabad pre-empting complications. “This pandemic has devastated many lives. The feeling of waking up every day to news of death in known circles, the cries of help by the needy, helplessness of scores of people due to lack of awareness, alternative measures, finances and health support system moved me. The digital presence of the ecosystem is helping us bridge the most critical and widest gap among patients, hospitals, pharma industry and government,” Sowmya said. She has been donating medical essentials to Covid-19 hospitals offering free treatment for the poor (Aakar Asha Hospital, Kukatpally) and orphanages (Amma Nanna Anadha Ashramam for mentally challenged senior citizens at Choutuppal) and extending monetary support to Covid-hit families. She also coordinates among government, pharma distributors and patients’ attendants for life-saving drugs. Sowmya told TOI that the most rewarding experience for her was to help a pregnant woman deliver baby in Hyderabad ensuring that there are no complications. “When the father of the baby called and gave the good news, there were no limits to my joy. Of course, this wouldn’t have been possible without the support of MLC K Kavitha and strategic intervention,” she said. Soumya juggles between household chores, taking care of her parents, meeting stringent deadlines at work to ensuring round-the-clock service to Covid-19 affected people daily. “It is a very challenging, yet fulfilling experience,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/young-techie-helps-covid-hit-with-logistics-and-essentials/articleshow/83414251.cms||Syed Akbar

The local unit of the association on Thursday staged a protest in Aurangabad city to press for the demand for reopening of private coaching classes which are said to be closed during the pandemic for past 16 months. “Owners and staff of around 50,000 coaching classes from Maharashtra have been affected very badly due to outbreak of Covid-19. The Covid-related restrictions lifted in between and now have been excluding private classes, posing survival issues,” Association president Pandharinath Wagh said. Wagh said that the private coaching classes were ready to follow Covid prevention norms in letter and spirit and should be allowed to function. “Population of around 40 lakh depending for their livelihood upon private coaching classes has been affected due to closure since 16 months. Besides, there is huge academic loss to students and parents are also keen to reopen the classes,” Wagh said. In a memorandum submitted to the district administration, Association of Private Coaching Classes has requested for taking an official call on their demand for before June 14. When contacted, district collector Sunil Chavan said that the latest order by the state government under ‘Break The Chain’ was mum on reopening of the education sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/body-of-pvt-coaching-classes-announces-jail-bharo-agitation/articleshow/83408753.cms||---

Apart from providing free access to all TRSMA member schools, including access to the platform for all video and experiential content, test-prep, and other teaching modules, Practically has also contributed Rs 5 lakh to the TRSMA Covid Relief Fund, which will be utilised to assist families of TRSMA staff members who lost their lives due to Covid-19 recently. “In the current Covid-19 situation, schools need all the help to continue teaching more effectively and bring the much-needed engagement to virtual teaching and learning experience,” said Charu Noheria, co-founder and COO, Practically. Speaking about the association, Yadagiri Shekar Rao, president, TRSMA, said that this tie-up comes at a time when the pandemic has disrupted the delivery of traditional education. “At least 10 lakh students had no access to online classes during the last academic year. This year, we want to ensure that all students in the state get access to virtual classrooms,” said Rao. He said that a peer-to-peer lending firm — Rang De, identified 500 budget schools and agreed to provide interest-free loans to buy mobile phones and school fees to students from these schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trsma-ties-up-with-hyd-firm-for-free-e-learning-initiative/articleshow/83415350.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Brazil’s regulator grants GMP cert for Covaxin plants||Hyderabad: Less than a week after Brazil’s health regulator gave its nod for “exceptional import” of four million doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, it has now granted certification of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to the company’s facilities in Hyderabad manufacturing Covaxin as well as its drug substance. The move paves the way for full-fledged exports of Covaxin to Brazil, which had placed an order for 20 million doses of the vaccine. Bharat Biotech had also tied up with Precisa Medicamentos for imports of the vaccine for the private market. Brazilian health watchdog Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (Anvisa) granted the GMP certifications on Wednesday vide resolutions RE2248 and RE2249, according to a loosely translated version of Anvisa’s announcement. The certifications are for the plant involved in the manufacture of the finished vaccine Covaxin at Hyderabad as well as it active pharmaceutical ingredient, the Anvisa website said. “The Certification of Good Manufacturing Practices, valid for two years, was issued after the company made the adjustments related to non-conformities detected in the inspection carried out by the Agency's technicians in the period from 1st to 5th March this year,” Anvisa said. The Brazilian regulator also emphasised that the issuance of these certifications should not be confused with the exceptional importation deliberated by the Collegiate Board of Anvisa at the extraordinary meeting on June 4 and that the latest actions were different. The latest approvals came after Bharat Biotech submitted two applications in May-end seeking approval for GMP certifications for Covaxin’s production line as well as its biological input after Anvisa refused to grant the GMP certification, citing non-compliance with GMP standards in March-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/brazils-regulator-grants-gmp-cert-for-covaxin-plants/articleshow/83414329.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra marks 25 million shots, highest in India, but lags in 18-44 coverage||MUMBAI: Maharashtra hit the milestone of 25 million vaccinations on Wednesday, the highest by any state, retaining its top position in total doses administered. Overall, 20million in the state have got at least one dose and 50 lakh are fully vaccinated. But when it comes to the 18-44 age group, Maharashtra is behind seven states. Data shows barely 20lakh in the 18-44 age-group have got a single shot in Maharashtra. After starting a token drive for this bracket on May 1, the state discontinued it. The private sector did carry on, but they focused on urban hubs. In remote districts like Hingoli and Wardha, less than 7,000 from the 18-44 category have got vaccinated compared to 7lakh and nearly 5lakh in Mumbai and Pune respectively. Dr Archana Patil, head of the directorate of health services, said the state suspended the drive for the 18-44 cohort as the numbers due for second doses were high. “We are completing those on priority. We want to vaccinate people above 45 years who are yet to take their first dose next,” she said. Immunisation officer Dr Dilip Patil said the policy of not vaccinating the 18-44 lot is likely to see a change from June 21 once adequate doses arrive from the Centre. “…we will catch up with other states in no time,” he said. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, a technical advisor to the state, said shortage of doses and a shift in central policy forced the state to prioritise those more at risk of severe Covid or death. Overall, in Maharashtra, over 50lakh are fully vaccinated, which translates into 6% of the adult population while 24% (2crore) have got at least one dose. On April 23, Union health ministry released a Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy, putting the onus on states to vaccinate the 18-44 group. Dr Santosh Shukla, head of immunisation in Madhya Pradesh, the state which has immunised the highest numbers in the 18-44 category, said they were the first to release an advance payment to Serum Institute of India and begin vaccinating from May 5. “We didn’t want the young working population to stay unvaccinated, so we tried to cover everyone,” he said. He said MP adopted the ‘outbreak response immunisation’ approach. “We would vaccinate 500-1,000 houses in the proximity of an index case. In peri-urban areas, we covered a radius of 5km around an index case. And since people would be apprehensive on hearing about a case in their vicinity, they would willingly get vaccinated,” he said. The state also urged vaccinated frontliners to communicate about the benefits of vaccination to younger members in their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-marks-25-mn-shots-highest-in-india-but-lags-in-18-44-coverage/articleshow/83415367.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Hyderabad||Telangana goes big on oxygen, 200 tonne plant in Pashamylaram||HYDERABAD: Apart from procuring 13 more oxygen tankers from Singapore, Thailand and Saudi Arabia, the Telangana government is going big on having its own oxygen storage plant at Pashamylaram industrial area in Sangareddy district. With the daily oxygen requirement set to touch 600 tonnes in the third wave of the pandemic, senior officials said the government does not want to take any chances after having seen the fallout of oxygen shortage leading to fatalities in some states which was badly hit by the second wave of pandemic. Officials said the new oxygen plant will come up in an area of five acres in Pashamylaram, 43 km from Hyderabad, and about 200 tonnes of oxygen will be stored in it. This storage plant will come in handy to meet any emergency health situation or oxygen supply shortage issues arising out of a surge in positive cases, an official said. Sources said a private agency will maintain the plant, while both government and private hospitals will be allowed to utilise the facility. Elaborating the government’s preparedness to tackle the pandemic, Covid-19 state task force committee member and principal secretary, industries, Jayesh Ranjan said all the efforts, including import of oxygen tankers from foreign countries, were aimed at taking care of long-term needs. “While it’s too early to predict about third wave, we are gearing up fully. Whether there is a third wave or not, we are augmenting oxygen supply infrastructure to take care of regular and emergency needs as well,” he told TOI. Currently, the state has 12 oxygen tankers which were procured from Singapore and Bangkok. Another 13 tankers will be procured from the three Asian countries as part of a bigger plan to meet future challenges. “We are importing the tankers from Saudi Arabia also. The government is keen on having 25 oxygen tankers at its disposal to meet any exigency,” a senior health official said. Once the tankers land here, they will be sent to Odisha and West Bengal on railway wagons to bring oxygen. Currently, Telangana gets its oxygen supplies from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Odisha. Pointing out that manufacturing of oxygen tankers has not taken off in the country, senior officials said only a few countries manufacture the tankers, each of which costs more than Rs 50 lakh, carrying 20,000 litres of oxygen. “The entire process to get oxygen supplies is cumbersome. Not only we have to place an order for oxygen from other states, we also have to get the tankers brought to the state via road or rail route. Plus, sending the tankers for a refill itself consumes a lot of days,” an official explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-goes-big-on-o2-200-tonne-plant-in-pashamylaram/articleshow/83413693.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The health department will make the medicines available up to the level of primary health centres, which will be useful in treatment of Covid patients under 14 years. “By August, we will ensure that medicines for Covid treatment for children is made available up to the primary health centres. We have started issuing tenders of the medicines and soon we will be able to procure it to make them available up to the rural areas,” said a senior health department official. The health department had directed the pediatricians to prepare a list of medicines, which would be useful for the treatment of children. “We have prepared the list of medicines and it has been sent to the health department. These medicines are useful in Covid treatment of children,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. Since a lot of difficulties were faced by patients in the second wave as a lot many had to struggle to arrange the drugs such as remdesivir, tocilizumab and also antifungals for mucormycosis, the health department is taking measures to ensure that they don’t face any such problem in the third wave. The health department has started issuing tenders for procuring the medicines as they are expecting that the third wave may emerge in September and before that they will complete all preparations. A lot of parents are worried about reports that the third wave would affect children. In the first two waves, kids have been the safest lot so far. In the past one year, 21 children (below 15 years) died due to Covid in Rajasthan. The second wave, though, reported an increased number of fatalities, but the deaths among children remained at just five (from Jan 1 to May 11) in the state. In the first wave 15,104 children were infected and in the second wave 22,009 children got Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-readies-meds-infra-for-children-in-case-3rd-wave-hits/articleshow/83415361.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The India Meteorological Department has issued ‘Orange Alert’ for both the districts from Saturday, meaning there could be heavy rainfall here. Most parts of the district has now been covered by the southwest monsoon. Many parts, especially coastal regions of the state, are witnessing heavy rainfall. The northern limits of the winds have now covered almost entire state. The area under the northern limits of the winds witnessed sudden dip in temperature. For instance, the average minimum temperature for Kolhapur and Satara dipped to 20 degree celsius on Thursday. As per IMD, the ghat areas of Kolhapur and Satara will receive heavy downpour from June 12. The local disaster management authorities have issued do’s and don’ts for citizens travelling along the ghat areas or residing in the vicinity. Prasad Sankpal, Kolhapur’s district disaster management officer, said, “People should avoid travelling to ghat areas. There are chances of landslides. Also, citizens should avoid taking shelter in the dilapidated structures which can easily fall. We have advised citizens not to step out in heavy rain.” The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation is going to start removing the weak branches of the trees and also remove trees old enough and weak.

---||Kolkata||Rain alert raises waterlogging concerns at Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: Even as the city braces up for monsoon, officials at the airport are spending sleepless nights, worried about waterlogging in the operational area. Three pockets in the operational area, including four parking bays, were inundated twice in the past fortnight — once on May 28-29 and again on June 7. Airport officials had raised their concern over the issue at a meeting with irrigation department officials on June 5, calling for immediate desilting of drains along the airport perimeter wall so that storm water can be drained out. The issue again figured prominently at the Airfield Environment Management Committee meeting on Wednesday attended by representatives of PWD, KMDA, irrigation department and the four civic bodies — North Dum Dum, Dum Dum, Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation — around the airport. Speaking to TOI, an airport official said the issue was most acute near Narayanpur at the southern end of the airport. "The drainage lines are choked. Hence, if water is pumped out of the airport, it flows back. The drainage lines need to be cleared immediately to prevent any disruption in operations during the monsoon," he said. While parking bays 58 to 61 get inundated whenever there is heavy rain, water also accumulates where hangars are situated to the east of the airport. While these hangers have aerobridges that allow passengers to board and disembark from the aircraft without having to step into the water, other operations like refuelling and loading/unloading baggage get affected. Way back in 2013, KMDA had proposed a Rs 61.4 crore drainage augmentation programme to rid the airport of the perennial problem by setting up a storm water network to flush out rainwater to the adjoining Bagjola and Noai canals. But eight years on, the project is yet to be completed. On May 28-29, the showers had also led to waterlogging on the city side. Stretches of the road leading to the airport were inundated, slowing traffic movement. Though cars were comparatively fewer due to the restrictions that are in force and the fewer flights that are operating, the waterlogging has raised concerns. Airport authorities later said the problem could be due to gully pits and blocked drainage lines getting choked as a result of ongoing Metro construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-alert-raises-waterlogging-concerns-at-kolkata-airport/articleshow/83413745.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The crucial medical devices will equip the KMC clinics in boroughs and wards before the next wave of Covid-19, augmenting the facilities to provide initial care to distressed patients prior to hospitalisation. In the second wave, hospital resources and medical equipment were severely stretched, leading to patient distress and even loss of life. According to a KMC health department official, these medical devices will be stored centrally and distributed to borough health offices when needed. A civic official, associated with the KMC’s Covid team, said these devices will be helpful if a third wave hits the city. “Currently, the demand for oxygen concentrators at our safe homes is on the wane,” said the official. In all, 14 real estate developers affiliated to Credai Bengal donated the devices — Belani Group, Merlin Group, Salarpuria Group, PS Group, Rungta Group, Arya Group, Ideal Group, Signum Group, Primarc Realty, Diamond Group, Ambuja Neotia, Smita Properties, 90 Degrees and NPR Developers. “The real estate industry has responded to the Covid crisis by donating these medical devices to KMC clinics because they are crucial for treating people in case of subsequent Covid wave,” said Credai Bengal president, Nandu Belani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/credai-donates-o2-devices-to-kmc/articleshow/83413763.cms||---

On an average, Trichy airport handles three international flights daily from the gulf countries, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Besides, it also handles three domestic flights – two from Chennai and one from Bengaluru. Aviation analyst H Ubaidullah said that the delay in the work has resulted in cancellation of flights from destinations such as Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Work was underway during the election time, resulting in diversion of flights to other airports.“The runway was closed for day time operations till December. IndiGo was operating services from Mumbai and Hyderabad to Trichy, which had to be cancelled as they could not operate the services at night,” he said.However, denying the allegations the airport authorities said that the work may be completed in the next few weeks depending on the weather condition. Speaking to TOI, Trichy airport director S Dharmaraj said that 75-80% of the work has been completed and the rest of the work depends on various factors such as Covid, lockdown and weather conditions. By and large, flight operations have remained unaffected, said the airport director adding that the work is done mostly during night time and the runway was open during the day for flight operations. Work is being carried for more than nine hours to ensure that it is finished at the earliest.External factors alone cannot be blamed for the delay, says sources from the airport. A Mumbai-based company had bagged the contract, but the work was undertaken by another company as a sub-contract. The lack of professional experience of the company is said to be a reason for the delay, the sources said. “Being a functional airport, work is carried out only during night. There was a request from the company for undertaking the re-carpeting work during day time, but that would affect flight operations,” said a source from the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/runway-re-carpeting-delay-affects-trichy-flight-services/articleshow/83413728.cms||Sampath Kumar

People, who were stranded in Jaipur and wished to visit their near and dear ones in various villages and towns within Rajasthan, came in large numbers, while, with opening of express buses to Delhi many passengers also availed the services. While TOI visited the bus stand there were not the passengers who were travelling for fun or leisure or to attend any wedding or any function as there were many Covid-19 patients who have recovered and there were passengers who intended to visit their villages for the first time after they lost their kin in Covid-19 in past three months. “I had lost my uncle on April 17 when I was also down with Covid-19. As the buses have been started I am visiting my aunt and cousins for the first time,” said Ramesh Saini who was travelling to Khairthal in Alwar and who works in a spices manufacturing unit at Vishwakarma Industrial area. Likewise, there were some people who recovered from Covid-19. “My mother was infected with Covid-19 on May 7. She is now fully recovered and thus intended to visit the village. I am taking here to Jahajpur in Bhilwara our native place,” said Sheeshram Kumawat who took a bus to Bhilwara from Sindhi camp. Sudhir Bhati, manager (public relations), said, “We have operated nearly 1,600 buses from all across the state depots. Our services are now available for almost every city in Rajasthan and we have also started express services to Delhi. Volvo buses are available for cities including Jodhpur and Udaipur.” However, it was also seen that people were not following social distancing and many were seen carelessly wearing the mask. Buses were disinfected before their departure but passengers were seen negligent towards social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rsrtc-resumes-services-operates-1-6k-buses-in-raj/articleshow/83415368.cms||---

Nampally criminal court which delivered its verdict in the case on Thursday, said that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the accused were behind Nabeel’s death. In May 2015, a fist fight was organised by a few locals. Nabeel died when he was fighting with another person. But during the trial the key witnesses who were produced by the prosecution, turned hostile before the court. This led to the acquittal of the accused. Initially, the parents of the Nabeel were made to believe that the he died in a road accident. Later, when the video of the fight came to light, police initially registered a suspicious death case and later it was altered to murder case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/9-acquitted-in-2015-street-fight-death/articleshow/83415372.cms||---

When Melvin George, a 24-year-old commerce student from Kannur, thought of ‘printing out’ parts of his guitar, he too found that a 3D printer was too pricey for him and out of his range. That was when the thought struck him---why not make a 3D printer by himself? So, he set upon the task building one. “I had begun learning to play guitar viewing tutorials on YouTube during the lockdown. I made a guitar on my own out of wood but I wanted to upgrade it using original guitar parts. That is when I explored the possibility of getting them 3D printed. As I realized I could not afford one, I decided to make one on my own and it turned out to be a success,” says Melvin. The printer’s frame was made from wood collected from his old house. He learned about the printer’s mechanism researching on the internet. It took a few months for him to complete the project, and he has been upgrading it constantly after each trial. 3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional objects from a digital file using additive processes. While a 3D printer, which involves a maximum print size of 120cm x 83cm x 83cm, costs more than Rs 1.5 lakh, the one made by Melvin costs just about Rs 20,000. Besides guitar parts and its amplifier, he has ‘printed out’ many things including figurines and showpieces. He has even upgraded the printer using parts he 3D-printed. “The printer can print out things with dimensions up to 60cm x 60cm x 50 cm. I use polylactic acid, one of the most popular materials used in 3D printing. But as it is costly, I am planning to make it at home using corn. As 3D printing is getting popular, there is a huge scope for starting a business,” says Melvin. Melvin’s family and friends are amazed at his feat as he does not have prior experience in engineering works. With the word spreading, many people have begun approaching him to get things ‘printed out’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/how-a-24-year-old-student-printed-out-things-he-needed/articleshow/83411512.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

A total of 75,133 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, including 53,266 RT-PCR/TrueNat tests, while the rest were via rapid antigen testing. Nearly 560 people recovered from the viral disease in the past 24 hours, as recoveries again outnumbered fresh infections. Of the 24,126 beds in city hospitals, 21,806 lie vacant. The number of active Covid cases stands at 4,212, down from 4,511 a day ago. Nearly 1,369 patients are in home isolation, a decline from Wednesday’s figure of 1,795, the state health bulletin stated. On Monday, Delhi had reported 231 cases, the lowest since March 2, with the positivity rate dipping to 0.36%. Since April 19, both daily Covid cases and single-day death count due to the virus were spiralling up, with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths recorded on April 20, rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, Delhi registered a record 448 deaths, as per the official data.

Drives at a few housing societies too were on hold with private hospitals awaiting clarity on capping of rates. In all, 69,713 vaccine doses were administered on Thursday, of which 54,633 shots were given in the private sector. On Wednesday, barely a little over 50,000 doses were given due to rain disruption. Vaccination was only through online appointments. Most recipients were in the 18-44 group. Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said a few centres were water-logged or had leakages, but the drive continued regardless. Vaccination will continue on Friday by online appointments. A housing society in Borivli east was informed on Thursday that the private hospital it had tied up with for vaccination had pulled out of the drive. A resident said the hospital was unclear about the charges they could levy for an offsite. However, in other societies, vaccination carried on as planned.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vax-drive-picks-up-as-rain-abates/articleshow/83415371.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Call centre racket busted in Thane, 2 operators arrested||Kalyan: The Kalyan crime unit of Thane police, in a joint operation with Nanded police, on Thursday busted a fake call centre being run out of Dombivli-based City Mall and arrested two suspected operators. Police said the accused ran the centre in the name of Bajaj Finance Company and duped several people across the country to the tune of crores on the pretext of giving loans at attractive interest rates. After taking processing fees, the accused would stop taking calls from customers. The accused have been identified as Kalyan residents Dinesh Chinchkar, 31, and Rohit Shekar, 28. Police have seized 26 cellphones, a laptop and an illegally procured database of names. Investigators have found the kingpin operated from UP and all the money got transferred to his account. It is suspected that the gang ran more such fake call centres across the country. Police said the call centre had been on their radar before the Covid-related lockdowns were imposed. Nanded superintendent of police Pramod Kumar Shewale told TOI, “Our team had been working on this case for over a year. We have finally arrested the kingpin. The accused would cheat citizens by falsely claiming they were representatives of a leading finance company.” Police said about 20 employees worked as executives on salaries of about Rs 10,000. Preliminary probe has indicated the employees were clueless about the dubious nature of the business. Last year, the Nanded cyber police had tracked down the location of the call centre, but the place was closed after the lockdown was announced. However, soon after the unlock announcement, the suspects restarted operations. On February 17, Nanded’s Itwara police station lodged a case of cheating and criminal breach of trust based on a complaint by fruit trader, Abdul Mubin. He said he had received a call informing him that a loan of Rs 25 lakh had been approved. However, on the pretext of disbursing the loan, he was cheated of Rs 50,000.

Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said there was a shortage of Tocilizumab as Remdesivir was not available. “Demand is less. Cases have come down. Remdesivir is available,’’ he said. Advocate Rajesh Inamdar said shortage of Tocilizumab persists and people were struggling to get Covid medicines. He submitted social media pleas by patients/relatives and a June 4 letter by state minister (Eknath Shinde) to Mumbai city collector to give Tocilizumab to a patient.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Mid-term marks to decide promotion of Class IX, XI students||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has announced the cancellation of class IX and XI examinations, which were postponed earlier in the wake of the second wave of Covid. Students of these classes will be promoted on the basis of the marks scored during the mid-term. Admissions in Delhi government schools for classes VI to IX will begin on June 11, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. “Covid-related interruptions highlight key challenges and provide an opportunity to further evaluate alternative measures in the interest of the students. During this lockdown period, the educational institutions were closed, which hampered the teaching-learning process in the academic session 2020-21. Annual examinations of classes IX & XI, which were scheduled in May/June 2021, are hereby cancelled,” Sisodia stated in a circular. The promotion policy is a one-time measure. Private schools, which have already conducted their annual assessments, can follow the guidelines of the directorate of education and declare their results. In many private schools, children have already been promoted. “For schools that did not conduct mid-term examination or students who were not able to take all mid-term papers will be assessed based on the average of the marks obtained in best two performing subjects out of five main subjects. The annual results of classes IX and XI in all government schools will be declared on June 22 and will be available on the DoE portal. Students will also receive their result digitally via phone call/WhatsApp/emails,” said the deputy chief minister. All such students who gave their mid-term in only one subject or were unable to give their mid-term exam in any subject and students who did not receive minimum qualifying marks will be eligible for the re-assessment likely to be held in July. These students will be assessed through assignments/projects/school-based tests. Guidelines for it will be issued soon, stated the government. Like last year, admissions will be held online. “Deadline to register is June 30. Admissions will begin from July 5 onwards. Students unable to register by the given date will be eligible to register in the second cycle, from July 23” added Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mid-term-marks-to-decide-promotion-of-class-ix-xi-students/articleshow/83411542.cms||---

With majority of the councillors giving a negative feedback to senior BJP leaders in Jaipur for Gurjar, no support from Jaipur MLAs and a video of giving bribe to the garbage collection company officials by Gurjar’s husband, it has become difficult for her to make a comeback without the court’s intervention. On Tuesday, BJP held protest and on Wednesday, on social media hashtag of #dictator_Gehlot was trending on Twitter. After that now party is on mute waiting for court’s order. According to BJP sources, in a recent meeting with the party high command more than 80% councillors had given negative feedback regarding Gurjar. Councillors are opposing her appointment again saying that all the promises made by Gurjar were never fulfilled. A councillor of BJP said, “In the first general body meeting and when budget was passed, councillors were asked for recommendations. We were promised to give laptops, sanitation workers, good furniture and office. But nothing of that sort was given to us even after seven months. She made all promises without any intention to fulfil them.” Whereas, Sheel Dhabai, in her first meeting cleared the files of all the proposals regarding the promises made to the councillors. This was also said to be a pre-planned step by Dhabai to keep the councillors in her favour. Councillors also complained that Somya never used to pick up their calls for listening to their problems and complaints in their areas. They further alleged that when she used to visit their ward, she never used to inform the councillors beforehand which was embarrassing for them. Another councillor said that with MLAs of Jaipur not coming in for support, it will be difficult for Gurjar to return to the seat without court’s interference. “Most of the MLAs have grudges that they were not considered while choosing the mayor then why should they be worried about when so much problem has arisen on the post. After the suspension from the post it seems to be difficult to get back for Gurjar,” said a BJP source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjps-support-for-suspended-mayor-somya-gurjar-wanes/articleshow/83415375.cms||---

The court cleared its stand on the application filed by the UT powermen union that had sought clarification whether the May 28 order was stay on the deputation of two officials of M/s Deloitte or on the complete tender process. The petitioners had submitted that despite the HC order, the administration had started opening bids. The HC clarified that the stay was on the tender process. The high court had, on May 28, stayed power privatisation process on the application filed by Gopal Dutt Joshi, general secretary, UT powermen union.The petitioner had sought directions to the Union government and the Chandigarh administration to immediately stop further proceedings of the UT electricity department privatisation, including opening and finalisation of the bids, till the final adjudication of the main petition, which was fixed for hearing on August 18.Recently, the UT administration had opened technical bids of all seven firms and submitted the case to technical bids’ evaluation committee. Thereafter, the UT was planning to open financial bids in the first week of June. The UT engineering department had issued a notice on November 9 last year and invited bids for distribution licence in Chandigarh. The bids closed on February 8.On March 8, the UT had issued an amendment to the bid document and extended the bidding date to March 18. The amendment provided an opportunity to the new bidders to submit their bids and allowed the existing ones to modify theirs. During an inter-ministerial meeting held in Delhi on February 26, it was decided that the UTs, where the privatisation process was in the last phase, would continue with the procedure. As many as 20 intended bidders purchased the tenders, but only six companies—Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NESCL (NTPC), Adani Transmission Ltd, Tata Power and Torrent Power—had submitted their bids. Later, a Kolkata firm—Eminent Electricity Power Company—too participated in it.On December 1, 2020, the high court had stayed the privatisation till the next hearing and issued a notice to the Union government, the UT administration and the UT chief engineer on a petition filed by the UT powermen union. The petitioner had contended that they were aggrieved by the decision to privatise the electricity wing by selling 100% stake of the government in the absence of any provision under Section 131 of the Electricity Act, 2003.However, on January 12, the Supreme Court stayed the order of the high court. On January 14, the UT administration resumed the sale of tender for the privatisation process.Thereafter on February 9, the Supreme Court, in its order, requested the Punjab and Haryana high court to dispose of the petition preferably within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/power-privatisation-hc-says-stay-order-on-bidding-process/articleshow/83411543.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Similar orders to private oxygen refilling vendors, too, have been done away with. The vendors were daily submitting details of number of cylinders issued to private hospitals and mini Covid care centres and rate charged from them. The UT had issued these orders in May to keep a check on oxygen supply amid its shortage as second wave peaked.Yashpal Garg, nodal officer of oxygen supplies in Chandigarh, said, “As the demand for oxygen has decreased, we had recently removed the quota system for private hospitals as well. Now, these orders have also been dispensed with.” In the recent oxygen audit of government and private hospitals, which UT had started in May, it was observed that consumption of oxygen decreased by 20% to 25% after a sensitization drive by a team of doctors.Garg said the Union government has fixed the daily quota of 20MT of medical oxygen for UT from M/s INOX, Barotiwala. This medical oxygen was being utilized for GMCH-32, GMSH-16 and the Covid Hospital in Sector 48. The private healthcare institutions were also catered to from this quota. Besides, three oxygen generation plants were commissioned recently at these hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-city-breathes-easy-ut-takes-back-o2-order/articleshow/83411551.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

According to aviation enthusiasts, the unusual delay in the completion of re-carpeting, which is an essential maintenance work being done after a gap of ten years in Trichy, has led to cancellation of flights to a few domestic destinations. On an average, Trichy airport handles three international flights daily from the gulf countries, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. Besides, it also handles three domestic flights – two from Chennai and one from Bengaluru. Aviation analyst H Ubaidullah said that the delay in the work has resulted in cancellation of flights from destinations such as Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Work was underway during the election time, resulting in diversion of flights to other airports. “The runway was closed for day time operations till December. IndiGo was operating services from Mumbai and Hyderabad to Trichy, which had to be cancelled as they could not operate the services at night,” he said. However, denying the allegations the airport authorities said that the work may be completed in the next few weeks depending on the weather condition. Speaking to TOI, Trichy airport director S Dharmaraj said that 75-80% of the work has been completed and the rest of the work depends on various factors such as Covid, lockdown and weather conditions.

---||Kochi||Only 6% target population fully vaccinated in Kerala||KOCHI: More than four months after Kerala started its Covid vaccination drive on January 16, only 6% of its population has been fully vaccinated or received both doses of the vaccine. But in the race between the virus and vaccination programme, the state is still doing better compared with the larger states. Nationally, only 3% of the population has been covered. There is now increasing scientific evidence that the two doses of vaccination is the only effective and economical solution in the fight against more transmissible mutant virus variants that could emerge in the third wave. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had asked the health department to ensure that all those above 40 years are vaccinated by July 15. But at the present pace, the state is likely to miss the deadline. "With the new Delta strain emerging, there is a scientific imperative that two doses of the vaccine are needed to ensure maximum protection. Unfortunately, during an active surge, crowded vaccination centres can potentially become mass spreading events. Therefore, the government should consider decentralisation of the vaccination drive, preferably door-to-door vaccination and in small clinics to reduce chances of mass infections among vulnerable people,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, lead researcher of IMA-Kochi’s national survey on post-vaccination symptoms and experiences of healthcare workers. About 24% of the people in the state have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Among them, 44% are above 60 years, another 40% between 45-60 years and 16% in the age group of 18- 44. “The good thing about Kerala is that it is prioritizing its elderly and a large number of people above 60 years have at least received one dose,” said health economist Rijo M John. To speed up the vaccination drive, the government on Thursday held a meeting with private hospitals in which they discussed how the government can coordinate with vaccine manufacturers and ensure steady supply. When a few hospitals expressed willingness to join hands with the government to vaccinate citizens for free, the state health authority officials were, however, non-committal. “People are willing to be vaccinated but the government is not vaccinating more than 1.5 lakh persons per day. This is despite the fact that at any given point of time, we have 4.5-5 lakh vaccines in stock. The government needs to rework on its vaccination logistics-- it is easy to get the first dose but people are unable to get an appointment for the second dose with the wait longer than the stipulated deadline for many,” said Dr Jayakrishnan AV, chairman, Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) committee for vaccination promotion and coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/only-6-target-population-fully-vaccinated-in-state/articleshow/83413859.cms||Preetu Nair

There will be no rallies. Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati on Thursday unveiled the plan for the protest at Raigad fort. He said since his meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last month — over the five demands of the Maratha community — no one has approached him and no assurance has been given to him that the issues will be resolved. Sambhajiraje said the protest at the Shahu Samadhi Sthal will not be an agitation or a rally. He said the representatives of the Maratha community forums will arrive at the spot and sit in silent protest. “We expect the ministers, MPs and MLAs from Kolhapur and nearby districts to take part. None of us will speak at the protest. Now is the time for the public representatives to show what they will do for the community,”Sambhajiraje said. “Many resist taking a stand to avoid the wrath of other communities and fear of electoral backlash. However, they are our representatives as well. We want them to speak. They should speak whenever the special session of the state legislature is called. They will have to tell people what they are going to do for Maratha community,” he added. Sakal Maratha Samaj has put forth the demands including benefits to Maratha students similar to the benefits given to OBC students, issue of joining letters to those who have cleared the public service exams and making funds available to SARTHI institute for offering scholarships to Maratha students. “We are holding similar silent dharnas at four places in the state. If the government fails to address the concerns then we will organise a long march from Pune to Mumbai. Marathas from across the state will arrive at Pune and we will march to Mantralaya in Mumbai,” said Sambhajiraje.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapurs-maratha-protest-will-be-silent-says-sambhajiraje/articleshow/83408904.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why family can’t decide who gets donated organ||New Delhi: Can a deceased donor’s family decide whom the donated organ should go to? While some developed countries allow this, India doesn’t. Because of this, the family of a 24-year-old man who was declared brain dead at a private hospital recently couldn’t donate his organs.The family wanted that the deceased’s liver should be used for carrying out a transplant on a relative suffering from liver failure while the rest of the organs — remaining liver, two kidneys and the heart among others — could be given to those registered with the government for deceased donation.“I plan to write a letter to the Prime Minister’s office on this,” the deceased’s uncle, who did not want to be identified, lated told TOI.He added: “My nephew was a bright young child who had just finished his MBA. His death shocked us all. Still, keeping our grief aside, we wanted to donate his organs so that the lives of other needy patients, including one of our relatives, could be saved. What is wrong with that? We weren’t doing it for money.”Dr Subhash Gupta, the chairman of Max Centre for Liver and Biliary Sciences, said directed organ donation was allowed all over the world provided there was no coercion. “Even if one half of the liver was directed to the relative of the deceased, the other half could have been used for a non-directed recipient and so would have been the kidneys, heart and lungs,” the liver transplant surgeon said.A directed donation occurs when a donor family directs the organ to a specific recipient. A non-directed donation occurs when the donor family has no say as to when an organ is allocated. “The existing laws do not allow ‘directed donation’ in case of a deceased donor. Also, in this case, the recipient was not a blood relative of the 24-year-old. Therefore, a decision was made after due deliberation to deny the family’s request. We, however, urged them to donate the organs so the lives of other needy patients could be saved. We also told them that the relative would be given priority for receiving the liver if there is another deceased donation but they didn’t agree and the donation couldn’t take place,” said an official of National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization.According to Dr S K Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), ‘directed donations’ weren’t approved under the existing Act. “In the United States of America, United Kingdom and many developed countries, organ donations are allowed on compassionate and even philosophical grounds. But, I feel, India is not in a position to allow the same currently. It may give an opening to dubious ways to donate,” he said.Dr Sunil Shroff, a trustee of Mohan Foundation, said exceptions have been made in the past in India to allow a ‘directed donation’ under exceptional circumstances. “We need to have rules in place to objectively consider the requests on a case to case basis,” he said. Thousands of patients needing an organ transplant die every day in India due to the lack of donors. While a living donor can donate a kidney, a portion of the liver to his or her immediate blood relative, an individual who has been declared brain dead can save many people. His or her heart, kidneys, liver, corneas, even bones and skin can be used to save lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-family-cant-decide-who-gets-donated-organ/articleshow/83411594.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

However, the share of Telangana in the national GDP increased by 26 basis points to 5% in 2020-21 as against 4.74% in 2019-20. “The growth rate fell 1.26% at constant prices (2011-12) due to Covid pandemic but is significantly better than India’s projected GDP contraction at 8%,” said Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao while launching the industries and commerce department’s annual report on Thursday. He pointed out that in 2020-21, Telangana’s economy benefited from agriculture and allied sectors, which grew by 21% as compared to 3% growth at the national level. The industrial sector growth, including the mining sector, contracted by 5.6% in the state as against 8.2% contraction at national level and the services sector too contracted nearly 5% in 2020-21 as compared to a national contraction of 8.1%, the report said. “Due to its high growth rate, the agriculture and allied sectors contributed a higher share of 20.6% to overall GSDP than in any year since the state's formation. However, at an aggregate level, the services sector continues to contribute the highest share at 60.3%. The contribution of the industrial sector stood at 19.1%,” the report added. KTR said that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been adversely impacted due to Covid-19 and urged the Centre to step up its efforts to help SMEs tide over the crisis. “They had announced last year that there would be a Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package. We request the Centre to work with the states because SMEs are the most important piece when it comes to rapid industrialisation and providing employment,” he said. Meanwhile, KTR said the state government has provided financial support to SMEs through rental and talent acquisition subsidies. He said over 20 government projects were offered exclusively to SMEs to give them more business opportunities during Covid times. He pointed out that the state’s life sciences sector is playing a major role in fighting the pandemic by way of innovation. In 2020-21, the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) developed 10 new industrial parks and allotted 810 acres to 453 industries with an expected investment of Rs 6,023 crore and potential employment of 7,623. He said that TS-iPASS has facilitated cumulative investments of over Rs 2.15 lakh crore, creating 15.6 lakh jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ups-share-in-indias-gdp-to-5/articleshow/83413863.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Manish Sisodia slams Centre over gag on vaccine stock info||NEW DELHI: Delivery agents working for various e-commerce platforms will be vaccinated on a priority basis in Delhi. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday directed the health department to tie up with organisations such as Amazon, Flipkart, Zomato, Swiggy, Dunzo and others to ensure vaccination for their delivery personnel. Meanwhile, referring to the Centre’s letter to all state governments disallowing them to share information regarding the number of vaccines administered and the stock position, Sisodia tweeted, “Am amazed at the order of central govt that prevents states from sharing information regarding vaccine stocks! The central govt needs to focus on ensuring adequate supply of vaccine to all, rather than hiding the true position of vaccine availability from the public.” Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed concern about vaccine shortage. “We welcome the Centre’s move to buy vaccines and distribute them among states from June 21, but where will the Centre buy the vaccines from? The Covid vaccine production capacity of the country is still very low. The whole country can be vaccinated in three months if we have sufficient vaccines and all states follow Delhi’s vaccination model,” he said. Presenting the daily vaccination bulletin on Thursday, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said that instead of getting maximum people vaccinated, the Centre wanted to hide the stock position. “Vaccination for Delhi’s youths (18-44 years) restarted on Thursday after a halt of 16 days. Amid such a situation, it is surprising that the Centre wants us to conceal facts,” she said. “Delhi government believes that people have a right to know about the situation of vaccines and it has been our constant effort to put everything transparently in front of our people,” Atishi added. Justifying vaccination of delivery agents at the earliest, a government statement said that by delivering articles at the doorstep of buyers, they made sure that many people could stay at home and avoid crowded markets. Delhi government believes that delivery agents are at additional risk as their job involves travelling door to door and meeting multiple people throughout the day, it added. For above 45 years, two days of Covaxin and 26 days of Covishield stocks are available, while for the 18-44 years age group, four days of Covaxin and eight days of Covishield doses are in stock, the Kalkaji MLA said. On Wednesday, 47,978 doses were administered, out of which 25,527 were first doses and 22,451 second. Over 58 lakh people have been vaccinated in the capital. Atishi appealed to the Centre to make more vaccines available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-slams-centre-over-gag-on-vax-stock-info/articleshow/83411615.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||20 Jawaharlal Nehru University students forcibly enter central library, clash with security staff; police register FIR||NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered against 20 students of Jawaharlal Nehru University for forcibly entering the central library on Tuesday after manhandling the security personnel. While the FIR was registered based on the security superintendent’s complaint, the university’s chief proctor is also initiating disciplinary action against the erring students. A statement issued by registrar Ravikesh on Thursday said, “This is to inform the JNU community that a group of students scuffled with the security staff, broke open the side glass door of the BR Ambedkar Library, entered the main reading room of the building on June 8, 2021 and have occupied the space since then. They do not vacate the library building even during the night. This has caused health risk for the library staff and other students residing in the hostels since these unruly students return to the hostel for lunch/dinner or other purposes. When no amount of persuasion by the librarian and the security personnel convinced these students against violating the law and Covid-19 guidelines, the JNU Security Office lodged a police complaint in view of the seriousness of the issue.” Pointing out how the students weren’t using masks or Covid-appropriate behaviour, the statement added, “It is underlined that the curfew imposed by Delhi government is still in place and no new guidelines have yet been announced regarding resuming normal academic activities. The students occupying the library space are not permitting the library staff to sanitise the library for making it safer for students who will use the library after the restoration of normalcy.” A police officer said, “The students broke a windowpane and around five students also slept in the library. They violated the Covid guidelines and even fought with the guards. A case under appropriate sections of the Indian Penal Code has been registered.” The incident has been captured on the CCTV cameras and show around 20 students fighting with the guards. The JNU Students’ Union said the break-in was not the result of any call given by the students’ body, but perhaps because a few students wanted reading room space. Saket Moon, JNUSU vice-president, said, “In fact, we met with the chief librarian on June 9 and discussed issues related to the functioning of the library. We have demanded the authorities issue a circular with clarity on reopening BR Ambedkar Central Library, issuing of books to students at the earliest and opening of all reading rooms, including the PhD reading rooms, especially the Helen Keller unit with Covid-19 protocols in place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/20-jnu-students-forcibly-enter-central-library-clash-with-security-staff-police-register-fir/articleshow/83411640.cms||---

Considering a batch of petitions challenging the vaccine policy of the central government, a division bench of Justice Anil K Narendran and Justice Ziyad Rahman AA pointed out that getting slots for vaccination is a very difficult task now and sought to know the reason for such a phenomenon. The court raised the query after counsels representing central and state governments informed the court that statements have been filed addressing the contentions of the petitioners. A counsel representing Kerala Medical Services Corporation submitted that the difficulty in getting vaccination slots could be addressed to an extent when the option for spot registration was available. It is learned that a facility for spot registration would be available in the new vaccination policy. The most difficulty in obtaining vaccination booking in the state is in Ernakulam and steps to address this would be considered, counsels representing the state government submitted. Government counsels also informed the court that a detailed plan would be drawn up for vaccine distribution on the basis of the new vaccine policy of the central government within a few days. They also pointed out that the state is at the forefront in the rate of utilization of vaccines supplied to it. According to the submission of the state government, 2.63 crore persons above the age of 18 years are remaining to be vaccinated in the state and 5.26 crore vaccine doses are required. Until June 9, 86,21,848 persons have been given the first dose of vaccines whereas 21,97,024 persons received both the doses. While scheduling a hearing on Friday, the court has asked the state government to include workers who collect waste from homes in the priority list for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/only-otps-no-booking-slots-available-hc/articleshow/83413878.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Plea on suspension to be heard today||JAIPUR: The hearing on the petition challenging the suspension of JMC-Greater mayor Somya Gurjar has been postponed by a day to Friday as the government sought more time to reply. The petition said the government had not given sufficient opportunity to the mayor to explain her position on the complaint filed by the commissioner against her and other BJP councillors. Somya was suspended along with three BJP councillors on charges of physical assault on commissioner Yagya Mitra Singh Deo last Sunday at a meeting held to resolve the issue of payment to garbage collection company in Jaipur. The suspended mayor said the director of local bodies issued a notice seeking her explanation by 3pm on June 5 but she received it only after 3pm. The request for more time to file the reply had been treated as her reply and no opportunity was given to her to explain what had happened. It was also pointed out that the name of the mayor was not the FIR or in the complaint to the government. The only thing was that the incident took place at her office in her presence. Government action followed an inquiry by an RAS officer on a compliant by an IAS officer, which is inappropriate as the junior officer could not conduct a fair probe on a complaint by a senior officer, said Asish Sharma, counsel for the petitioner. The government had suspended her pending a judicial probe on the alleged complaint of manhandling the commissioner on June 6, but so far no probe had been ordered. The action of the government smacks of political vendetta, the former mayor said in her petition. The state government had filed a caveat on Monday in the high court seeking a hearing before the court issues any order on the petition challenging the suspension. The government meanwhile appointed senior BJP councillor Sheel Dhabai as the officiating mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/plea-on-suspension-to-be-heard-today/articleshow/83415407.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: RTO officer who filed Parab plaint faces probes||Mumbai: Nearly fortnight after Nashik Police initiated a probe into the allegations of corruption and bribery levelled by suspended motor vehicle inspector Gajendra Patil against transport minister Anil Parab, state transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne, and five senior department officials, it has been learnt that the transport department has already initiated two departmental inquiries against him. A senior transport official said that on January 19, Patil from Nashik RTO was suspended from service and two independent departmental probes were initiated against him. “We have served the chargesheet and appointed the inquiry officer and presenting officer as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Service Rules. We expect to complete the probe in a time-bound period,” the official said. The official added that Patil is facing charges for dereliction of duty and a criminal case registered against him at Mohadinagar police station in Dhule. As per the chargesheet, Patil did not take action against erring vehicle owners during the pandemic and was absent from work without the permission of the competent authority. Patil did not respond to messages from TOI. On August 20, 2020, deputy transport commissioner Jeetendra Patil had informed the additional chief secretary (transport) that an offence had been registered against Patil in connection with a sealed envelope found on most of the tables in the office. Following Patil’s complaint in May, Nashik city police commissioner Deepak Pandey set up a three-member panel of officers of the rank of deputy commissioner of police to conduct an in-depth probe into the charges of corruption against Parab, Dhakne and Mantralaya officials. The panel has recorded the statement of Dhakne and Mantralaya officials. Both Parab and Dhakne have already denied the charges and called the allegations “baseless, motivated and aimed at maligning the department’s image.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rto-officer-who-filed-parab-plaint-faces-probes/articleshow/83416664.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Posters of ex-CM Vasundhara Raje, son appear in Jhalawar district with ‘missing’ tag||KOTA: A day after a poster of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje was removed from the state BJP headquarters, another poster controversy has erupted in different parts of Jhalawar district on Thursday, which said that theleader was ‘missing’. The writing in these posters claim that Raje, the BJP MLA from Jhalrapatan, and her son Dushyant Singh, MP from Jhalawar-Baran, have been “missing” amid the Covid wave and those finding the two shall be rewarded. The posters have been put up behalf of ‘Tormented people of Jhalawar.’ The posters depict the pictures and designations of Raje and Singh and question on their whereabouts. “You should not be scared to come back, we the people shall forget everything in two to four days and you can then continue with your corrupt arrangements. No one shall say anything to you,” read the message. “Vasundhraji has been contesting election from here for last 30-35 years and her son Dushyantji since 2000 but none of them ever visited their people in Jhalawar in times of need and pandemic. The two have not even got a permanent residence in the constituency,” said Pramod Sharma, a local Congress leader, who contested against Singh in last parliamentary elections. “They fight the election from dak bungalows and hotels and move away after winning never to look back to hear public grievances,” he alleged. “The pasting of pamphlets and posters of the ‘missing’ MLA and MP with their photos is to kick off the Jan Jagran Abhyan against public representatives by social workers, who also included the Congress workers,” Sharma said. Sanjay Jain ‘Tau’, Jhalawar district BJP president, termed the pasting of posters as a new low of politcial discourse. “Ex-CM Raje since the very first day of Covid outbreak has been active in her home constituency while maintaining round-the-clock interaction through video conferencing with district collector, SP, party workers and mandal heads and provided instant help and relief to locals. No Covid deaths due to lack of medicine or oxygen in the district is proof of Raje’s and Singh’s active role in Jhalawar during the pandemic,”Jain claimed. On no visit by Raje to Jhalawar during the crisis, Jain said the MLA’s daughter-in-law herself was infected by Covid and it was also necessary for her to take care of her family. According to local sources, Raje has not visited her home constituency for over last two years. She reportedly visited Jhalawar only twice after her election in December 2018, first time to thank the voters and second at the time of nomination of her son to contest parliamentary election in May 2019. Singh last visited his constituency during local body election in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/posters-of-ex-cm-raje-son-appear-in-jhalawar-dist-with-missing-tag/articleshow/83415430.cms||Rajiv Saxena

The bystanders and people passing through the area told Shahpura police that the vehicle, suspected to be a truck, dragged Maju Devi for a while on the highway after a piece of her cloth got stuck in the truck. The driver did not stop the truck and fled the scene. Manju Devi was taken to the hospital where doctors declared her dead on arrival. “She is a wife of a retired police officer Durga Prasad Sharma.

Police have not ruled out natural death. Forensic experts prima facie believe the skeleton — studying the skull, ribs and bones of hands — might be at least three-year old. The skeleton was recovered from an abandoned shop that used to be operated at least 15 years ago. “A scrap dealer had gone inside the building looking for some iron scrap around 3 pm. He noticed the skeleton lying at a corner and informed us,” said an investigating officer. Police sources said the owner had left for London a year-and-a-half ago. “He is a businessman and owns several properties in the city and outside. Luckily, he is in India now due to the pandemic and he has consented to fish out the property papers and then visit us. This will help us ascertain the identity of the shop owner who last operated from here,” said an officer from the south division. The police are checking the records of persons who went missing around 2017-18.

The draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 has laid down strategies that would allow more than 50% of this energy requirement to be met through renewable sources of energy. Envisioning Delhi as a sustainable city, and aiming to enhance its global competitiveness, the draft MPD41 says that the capital needs to switch to clean energy. In 2016-17, Delhi per-capita power consumption was 1,561 units per annum against the national average of 1,122 and 78 % of the consumed power was purchased. The remaining comes from installed capacity within Delhi, with coal (59%) being the predominant generator, followed by gas (28%), hydro (10%) and solar power (3%). The national policy, and Delhi’s state solar policy of 2016 too, target meeting around 20% of power consumption from renewable sources by 2022, MPD41 states, adding that the city has to meet roughly 50.5% of its power consumption from renewable sources by 2041 to fulfil the national level targets set by the Union ministry of new and renewable energy. The draft MPD41 says that in light of global warming and climate change, Delhi needs to develop a renewable energy plan to enable the transition from conventional sources such as fossil fuels to clean energy. The plan notes that Delhi has a high potential for solar power generation and recommends strategies such as encouraging solar farms in the green development areas envisaged on the city’s periphery. Models based on power purchase agreements may be adopted to incentivise landowners to set up solar farms on their agricultural lands, the draft says, while recommending the use of canals for harnessing solar energy. Government buildings and institutional campuses with a roof top area above 500 sq metres are to install solar photovoltaic panels under Delhi Solar Policy 2016 and Net Metering Regulations, 2014, and large public facilities such as airports, metro stations, railway stations, inter-state and city bus stations and depots, stadiums etc. are to progressively meet most of their power requirements through solar energy. To enhance the usage of solar energy in buildings and public spaces, the draft MPD recommends solar-based LED lighting for use on roads, in parks and at public places. Installation of solar PVs will be encouraged on plots with roof area larger than 100 sq metres and solar water heating promoted. Also, installation of solar PVs will be made mandatory and incorporated in building permissions for all new constructions. MPD41 states that power discoms will undertake installation of smart meters in a phased manner in all existing buildings and mandatorily for all new constructions. It says that DERC may adopt the practice of differential pricing for power supply to encourage increased solar power usage during peak hours, thus reducing the load and improving system efficiency. To improve the power infrastructure, the draft MPD says that a major transmission network has to be planned within the road width of proposed roads where feasible and they should adhere to safety norms for overhead and underground transmission lines. The plan also recommends that all new sub-stations in Delhi be developed as gas insulated sub-stations where feasible, as roughly 50% smaller land area is required compared with the traditional air insulated sub-stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhis-power-demand-tipped-to-almost-double-in-20-years/articleshow/83414018.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Union MoS (external affairs), V Muraleedharan – who called on Union minister for environment, forest and climate change, Prakash Javadekar on Thursday seeking an investigation by MoEF in the issue– told the media that Javadekar has sought a report in this matter. He added that the minister informed that MoEF will take further action after getting the report. In his letter to Javadekar, Muraleedharan sought an independent enquiry under the direct supervision of MoEF, and if required summon forest officials including PCCF and head of forest force, Kerala and seek an explanation. Addressing the media persons in Delhi, Muraleedharan said the controversial order issued by the previous LDF government allowing felling of trees in assigned land would go down in history as the first instance of a government issuing an order to help the mafia. "Such an order could not have been issued without the knowledge and consent of the political leadership, including ministers," he claimed. Meanwhile, investigation by state forest department began on Thursday with five separate squads led by flying squad divisional forest officers tasked to conduct the probe in 14 districts. The investigation by the five teams will be supervised by Conservator of Forests (I&E) at Kottayam and Kozhikode. Already an investigation by the police is underway on the matter. As per the order issued by PCCF (V&FI) Ganga Singh, the probe would verify all documents related with the issue of declarations/ passes/NOC for the felling and transport of government trees from LA/LT Patta lands from March 11, 2020. They will also verify the details of property marks issued for the transport of timber. The investigating teams have been told to submit a final report by June 22. Flying squad DFO, Thiruvananthapuram, Shanavas will lead the team probing Kasaragod, Kannur and Wayanad districts. Meanwhile, Kozhikode sub-zonal unit of ED has sought the details of Muttil tree felling case including copies of FIR and mahasar from the Meppadi forest range officer. ED sought details ‘to examine the violation and scope of recording Prevention of Money Laundering Act case’. Meanwhile, key accused Roji Augustine alleged in an interview to a news channel that he had given bribes to the tune of Rs 25 lakh to forest officials in connection with the felling of rosewood trees from assigned land in Muttil. He claimed that he hadn’t violated laws and had felled trees after complying with all legal formalities. In another development, south Wayanad forest division has taken steps to attach the seized rosewood trees (202 cu m) and notices have been served to 20 land owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muttil-scam-forest-dept-begins-probe/articleshow/83411728.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: This doctor quit a private job to be a Covid team volunteer||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A few days ago, Dr Muhammad Yazin and his team at the Covid control room run by Vattiyoorkavu MLA V K Prasanth broke into a house. Their intentions, however, were honourable. A call had come from a 55-year-old Covid positive woman and she had fallen so sick that she couldn’t even open the door eventually leaving the medical team with no other option that breaking the door open. “We could save two patients, the woman and her 95-year-old mother. They were shifted to ICU at the medical college hospital, we hope they will recover,” says Yazin who has so many similar experiences to recount, including dealing with a snake in the house of a Covid patient. The 26-year-old doctor, a former student of the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, was working at a private hospital in Coorg till recently. He quit the job to work with the medical team without any remuneration. This is not his first time he is volunteering. During the 2018 floods, he had joined the same medical team as a student. That was just the beginning. Later in 2019, when many people were buried alive in a massive landslide at Kavalappara near Nilambur, Dr Yazin was there with the medical team. Also, he was among the volunteers when Cyclone Ockhi hit the coast in Thiruvananthapuram. Besides volunteers and nurses, there are four doctors in the medical team of the Covid cell at Vattiyoorkavu. “We provide tele-consultation for the patients. Medicines are sent through the volunteers of the rapid response team. Our team consisting of a doctor, a nurse, and a volunteer also visit patients needing home care. We would shift them to hospitals if required. Our schedule is not at all hectic. We usually work for eight hours,” Dr Yazin adds. “I had tested Covid positive while working in Coorg. After getting cured, I rejoined duty and resigned two days after knowing about this initiative. After having worked together during the flood and now, the team has become just like a family,” he says. In the future, Dr Yazin is expecting to be a part of the medical team of Vattiyoorkavu Youth Brigade, an initiative of MLA Prasanth. The plan is to focus on the economically weaker sections. How about earning something to live? “Well, I plan to work in a private clinic and side by side find time for voluntary medical service,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/this-doc-quit-a-private-job-to-be-a-covid-team-volunteer/articleshow/83413977.cms||---

This directive came during the review meeting on pre-monsoon works with the civic officials recently. Kulkarni said around 80% of the pre-monsoon works like cleaning of nullahs, roadside drainage lines, chambers, stormwater lines, manholes etc have been completed. But 20% of the pre-monsoon works are yet to be completed even though the monsoon has already arrived. He instructed the officials to study the places in the city where waterlogging take place during the monsoon. He asked the officials to take measures to ensure there is no waterlogging in the city. Nashik city engineer S Ghuge said most of the pre-monsoon works have already been completed and few remaining works are in progress. Those will be completed shortly. The civic officials also expressed the need to buy more robotic machines to clean nullahs and three tributaries of the river Godavari. The mayor said two robotic machines will be bought and a financial provision of Rs 10 crore will be made in the budget of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) for the current financial year 2021-22. Additional financial provision of Rs 25 crore will be made for the construction of new stormwater lines in the city in NMC’s budget, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/complete-remaining-pre-monsoon-works-nashik-city-mayor/articleshow/83409094.cms||---

The government is also exploring the possibility of permitting private establishments and industries to restart operation with minimal workforce to unlock the economy. There was a suggestion too about reopening Tasmac (liquor) outlets in select districts. Chief minister M K Stalin would make a formal announcement on Friday. On Thursday, Stalin convened a review meeting with officials on the outcome of the three-week-long intense lockdown. Chief secretary V Irai Anbu and DGP J K Tripathy were present during the review meeting. The health sector got a breather with daily cases falling to 16,813 on Thursday, which is “comparatively low” than the situation in the month of May. The total number of vacant oxygen, non-oxygen and ICU beds were 47,568. The daily cases recorded on May 21 were 36,184. The state is keen on containing the spread in 11 districts in the western and eastern regions. Health minister Ma Subramanian said the pandemic has been brought under control in 25 districts. The minister said nine districts needed special attention. Four others districts showed fluctuation in numbers. The industries department had recommended to the state about reopening industries with minimal workforce following several representations from the sector. The state government has so far allowed continuous process industries and industries manufacturing essential commodities to function. Export units that have commitments or orders and their vendor units were also permitted to function with 50% workforce in all districts, except Coimbatore, Tirupur, Salem, Karur, Erode, Namakkal, Trichy and Madurai. “There have been representations from the manufacturing sector to open the units with 50% workforce. The government is considering such an option in districts where the caseload is low,” said a source. Last week, the CII-Tamil Nadu members met the industries minister and demanded that the government intervene since the continuous shutting down of units across the state would impact supplies. Citing the drastic fall in caseload in several districts, the industrialists made a strong case for reopening all the units. “The state has to take a lenient approach. Otherwise, economic growth will be hampered. As of now, markets are doing good. Whether consumer goods or textiles, spinning mills or cement, there is a good aggregate demand in the market. Indefinite lockdown will lead to supply-side issues,” said CII Tamil Nadu former chairman Hari K Thiagarajan, who batted for “a localised approach” in lockdown measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-lockdown-to-be-extended-by-a-week-with-more-easing/articleshow/83414036.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Kochi||Kerala: Non-Covid treatment in major government hospitals to resume in 2 weeks||KOCHI: Health department in the district is planning to open the non-Covid treatment in major government hospitals in the district within a fortnight. According to the review conducted by the health department, the test positivity rate (TPR) and number of Covid-19 cases in the district can be brought down significantly within a week. The TPR of the district in the past few days is less than 15. Even while Covid-19 cases in districts like Malappuram, where the cases had been high, record steep decrease now, the pace of fall in the number of cases in Ernakulam district is not so fast. The number of fresh Covid cases on Wednesday was above 2,000 while it is 1,596 on Thursday. “It is a fact that the number of Covid cases continues to be high in Ernakulam compared to that in other districts. This is because we conduct more tests. The strategy was to identify as many patients as possible at the earliest and provide treatment for them. However, the TPR can be brought down to below 10 within a week’s time,” an official with the health department said. The number of cases in the district will be very low within a fortnight, officials claim. “So, we are changing our strategy accordingly. Non-Covid treatment will be resumed in the major hospitals in the district within two weeks. While a portion of ICUs and ventilators in the hospitals like Government Medical College will be earmarked for Covid treatment, non-Covid wings will be opened in these hospitals,” sources said. “The new centres which we started in the past one or two months will be the main Covid treatment centres by the end of the month. The Covid treatment facilities with oxygen beds, including the ones at BPCL Kochi Refinery, Adlux and Samudrika Hall in Cochin Port Trust, will be used for accommodating maximum Covid patients,” sources said. Non-Covid patients had been suffering as almost all the major hospitals in the district were dedicated for Covid treatment only. As the number of Covid cases increased almost two months ago, the district authorities asked the managements of private hospitals also to earmark beds for Covid treatment. As of now, there are 6,307 beds earmarked in the district for the treatment of Covid patients. Of these, 3,922 are vacant and 2,385 patients are admitted in various hospitals now. There are 13 Covid first-line treatment centres (CFLTCs) with a bed capacity of 930 in the district while there are 15 Covid second-line treatment centres (CSLTCs) which together offer facilities to treat 877 patients. Besides these, there are 76 domiciliary care centres (DCCs) with a total bed capacity of 3,121.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/non-covid-treatment-in-major-govt-hosps-to-resume-in-2-wks/articleshow/83414015.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

He is currently the top leader of both his party and India,” said Raut. Raut was in Nashik on Thursday. Raut’s comment came after being asked about his take on the RSS saying that Narendra Modi’s pictures should not be used during meetings. Raut, however, said Modi should not forget that he is the PM of the entire country and not of any particular party. “Whosever is the prime minister, it is important that they should not campaign for their political party. He should be campaigning for the country,” he said. BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil had said that if PM Modi says, his party would even shake hands with the ‘tiger’ (the Shiv Sena’ symbol). To this, Raut responded by saying that “Nobody befriends the tiger, but the latter calls the shots.” “It is the ‘tiger’ who decides for himself who to have friendship with,” Raut said. “I will be meeting the leaders in Dhule, Nandurbar and Jalgaon in the next two days,” he said. About electoral preparations, Raut said, “We are preparing for corporation, zilla parishad, parliamentary and assembly polls.

---||Delhi||BJP slams Delhi for not implementing one nation, one ration card scheme||New Delhi: Amid chaos and crowds milling in front of schools in Delhi to gather free foodgrain, BJP on Friday slammed the Arvind Kejriwal government for not implementing the one nation-one ration card scheme. Senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said instead of implementing the one-nation-one-ration-card scheme which would have enabled migrant workers to access PDS ration, the AAP government was trying to orchestrate a swindle in the guise of "door-to-door ration delivery”. "Why has the Centre's one-nation-one-ration card scheme not been implemented in the national capital? The Narendra Modi government sends 37,573 tonnes of foodgrain for 73 lakh people of Delhi, spending crores as subsidy. The roots of the ration mafia are so strong that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had to cancel e-PoS authentication after 4 lakh ration cards were seized in Delhi,” Prasad said and added that the Kejriwal government was now totally in control of the ration mafia. The attack came in the wake of migrant workers and those without ration cards returning empty handed from food distribution points set up by Delhi government after having to wait for hours, and coincided with Delhi government's assertion in the Supreme Court that it had already implemented PDS portability in the capital. Separately, food ministry officials rejected the Delhi government’s claim of having implemented the scheme, citing that only 42 e-PoS machines out of around 2,000 were operational at fair price shops (FPS) in the capital. All FPS must have operational e-PoS machines for the one nation-one ration card scheme, which enables beneficiaries to get foodgrain from any FPS of their choice, by completing the biometric authentication. Ministry sources said Delhi government has installed around 2,000 e-PoS machines, but only a pilot has been carried out in Seemapuri area in east Delhi using the 42 e-PoS machines to see the technical feasibility. They added that in 2018, when the government had made e-PoS machines operational, the distribution of subsidised foodgrain had touched 98%, the authentication of beneficiaries was only 79%. “Between January and April 2018, around four lakh bogus or duplicate ration cards were deleted from the system,” said an official. Prasad asked when 34 states (UTs included) had successfully implemented the one nation-one ration card scheme, why was it not being implemented in Delhi. “After seizing 4 lakh fake ration cards in four months in Delhi in 2018, why has the Arvind Kejriwal government stopped the e-PoS authentication system in Delhi? When will the Arvind Kejriwal government start e-PoS authentication of ration cards which has been put on hold in Delhi since 2018?” he asked. The BJP member said Kejriwal should stop playing politics and send a new proposal to the central government. “If you have any good scheme, send it to the central government, which will provide ration at cheap rates for the benefit of people of Delhi,” he added.

---||Nagpur||All Vidarbha districts may be in level 1 of unlock today||NAGPUR: June 11 will be the first Friday when all districts in Maharashtra will review the Covid-19 unlock situation and decide which level they have reached. Currently, Nagpur, Chandrapur, Gondia and Yavatmal are at level 1 for districts having less than 5% positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy of less than 25%. Almost all the remaining seven districts are most likely to upgrade to level 1, thanks to their good show in the last week. Every district, especially Bhandara, Gondia and Amravati are conducting high number of tests. Nagpur has maintained the average 10,000 tests per day despite low positivity rate. The overall test positivity rate of all districts in Vidarbha is comfortably less than 5%. Second important parameter is the oxygen bed availability in districts. On Thursday, 11,522 patients were under treatment in the region. Majority of them are in home isolation. On June 10, Amravati was the only district to have more than 2,500 patients under treatment. Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli and even Buldhana have less than 500 patients each under treatment. This indicates that most districts will qualify even on the oxygen bed parameter. On Thursday, the region reported 667 new cases, lowest in the second wave, even as more than 40,000 tests were conducted. The recoveries (1,966) were near three times of new cases. The region’s recovery rate has surged to 97%. The region’s cumulative toll crossed 20,000 after death of 25 patients on Thursday. The last 1,000 deaths were reported in 17 days – the longest period in the second wave. During peak, more than 5,600 deaths were reported in 30 days of April. Even May reported 5,000+ deaths. June has seen a big relief so far. Still, case fatality rate is more than 1.8% in Vidarbha. Amravati: A spike of 126 cases and four deaths took the district's caseload to 94,750 and toll to 1,516 respectively on Thursday. With 288 cases getting discharged, the recoveries reached 90,698. This left 2,536 active cases under treatment. Yavatmal: The district recorded 2 deaths on Thursday which took the toll to 1,786. The administration has received 2895 test reports of which 30 (20 men and 10 women) were found positive. Currently there are 622 active positive patients of whom 192 are admitted in the hospitals and 430 are in home quarantine. Of 72,504 positive patients 70,099 including 75 on Thursday have recovered and discharged on Thursday. The test positivity rate is 11% and the death rate is 2.46%. Wardha: No deaths were reported in the district on Thursday. Out of 1,792 reports 60 patients tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total to 48,962. Meanwhile, 120 patients were discharged and recoveries increased to 47,135, leaving 499 active positive on Thursday. New cases were reported from Wardha (33), Deoli (14), Hinganghat (8), Ashti (2), Selu (1) and other districts (2). Toll remained at 1,310. Chandrapur: There were 88 new cases, while 177 patients were discharged on Thursday leaving 1,179 active patients under treatment. Two deaths were registered during the day taking the toll to 1,490. Covid caseload has climbed to 83,965, while total recoveries amount to 81,296. Bhandara: For the seventh consecutive day, Bhandara’s test positivity rate was below 3%. On Thursday, out of 1,575 tests, only four came positive, which means test positivity of less than 0.5%. With only 467 patients under treatment, and majority of them under home isolation, Bhandara has less than 10% of its oxygen beds occupied. This means, more relaxations are likely in this district from Monday. Gondia: The district, which is already in level 1 of unlock, has improved on both parameters – test positivity rate and O2 bed availability. Out of 3,864 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, only 19 came positive which means test positivity of 0.49%. The district also has 859 oxygen beds. Of th 264 patients under treatment, 210 are in home isolation. No death was reported on Thursday. Gadchiroli: Out of more than 1,000 tests conducted in last 24 hours, 51 came positive. The positivity rate is going down but not steadily like other districts in Nagpur division. The district is in level 3 of unlock and likely to get an upgrade on Friday. Two deaths were reported on Thursday. Now, the district’s cumulative toll is 731 and 430 patients are under treatment. Akola: Daily testing count is still limited in Akola as compared to other districts of Amravati division. Of the 1,770 tests conducted in the last 24 hours, 81 came positive. Akola is presently at level 3 and likely to move up. Now, 1,929 patients are under treatment. One death was reported on Thursday which took the toll to 1,106. Buldhana: The district conducted 4,020 tests and 42 of them came positive. Buldhana was in level 3 of unlock and is most likely to upgrade to level 1 on Friday as the test positivity was constantly less than 5% in the last seven days. With 339 patients recovered in a day, Buldhana has less than 500 patients under treatment, which means the district will also qualify in O2 bed parameter. Washim: The district reported 75 new cases, 110 recoveries and three deaths on Thursday. Now, of the 40,901 patients reported so far, 3,9530 have recovered while 596 have succumbed to Covid-19. Now, 774 patients are under treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-vidarbha-districts-may-be-in-level-1-of-unlock-today/articleshow/83411801.cms||Balwant Dhage

---||Nashik||Nashik: Man shows magnetic power, no link to vax: health teams||NASHIK: Health officials in Nashik said that the incidents of metal objects sticking to a man’s body had no connection with the second dose of Covid vaccine he had received a couple of days ago. They said that senior health officials would be giving further guidance in the matter. Nashik Municipal Corporation medical officer Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje said health teams were sent to the residence of Arvind Sonar, residing in Shivaji Chowk area of Cidco, following reports of coins and other metal pieces getting attached to Sonar’s torso. They confirmed that this phenomena was indeed occurring. The health team found that Sonar’s health parameters were normal. “The person received the second dose of vaccine three days back, but this incident has no correlation to the vaccination so far,” Dr Nagargoje said. Nashik civic surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat also said that there was no correlation has been found between the vaccine and the magnetic properties. “There is no correlation between the vaccine and the incident so far. We have called for a detailed report and will send it to the state health department. We will follow the instructions they give to us,” he said. Arvind Sonar, who runs a ‘Samosa Centre’ at Cidco, told TOI that he took the second dose of vaccine three days back. He could not say if the magnetic properties were there before or have only emerged after the vaccination. “We have no claims. We don’t know whether it was before or only after vaccination. It is just that when I saw some videos going viral about such ‘magnetic properties’ after vaccines on Wednesday night, I checked it on my father and mother who received the vaccine. The things actually stuck to his body and not to my mother. Even we are surprised,” Sonar’s son Jayant said. Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti activist Krishna Chandgude, who visited Sonar’s house, said, “This is no superstition or miracle. However, there may be some reasons that can be found out only after detailed research by appropriate experts.” Associate professor of physics department, RYK College, Pravin Joshi, said he would not comment on this matter unless proper examination is sone. “It is difficult to comment about existence of such properties in the body of a person with or without vaccine. We will have to study thoroughly before arriving at a conclusion,” Joshi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/man-shows-magnetic-power-no-link-to-vax-health-teams/articleshow/83409130.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Negligent authorities cause breach of protocol at Medical College Hospital||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a serious breach of Covid-19 prevention protocol, scores of candidates turned up and milled around the Medical College Hospital (MCH) on Thursday for the interview scheduled for the post of cleaning staff. District disaster management authority (DDMA) meeting held after the incident has mooted the need to issue a strong advisory for the MCH — the major Covid hospital in the district — on maintaining Covid-19 protocol. Health Minister Veena George blatantly condemned the incident and said that it was a mistake to have scheduled an interview during lockdown. She directed the health secretary to probe the lapses and file a report. Amidst tall claims by the district administration, city police and health department on the need to ensure Covid preventive measures, the authorities threw caution to the wind and made hundreds of people wait for hours without being able to adhere to social distancing norms. The interview was apparently held for 30 vacancies for cleaning staff in the wake of upgradation of critical care facilities at the MCH. The sudden crowding in front of the hospital also blocked the way of ambulances which were headed towards casualty with patients requiring emergency medical care. Some of the candidates told the media that they were told that the interview would be held at 11am but authorities started issuing tokens since early morning. The incident also caught the city police unawares since the police were not intimated about the interview. The police received information from intelligence around the breach of lockdown protocol by around 10.30am. The manpower had to be redeployed from adjacent vehicle checking points to the MCH and the situation was managed within 30 minutes. The police have sent notices to several people who violated social distancing norms. Earlier similar crowding had happened at Jimmy George Stadium during the vaccination drive and both the health team and district administration officials found themselves in a spot of bother. A tired police force being forced to take up crowd and queue management due to the negligent attitude of MCH authorities and district administration has infuriated the police officers. After waiting for long hours and being exposed to possible risk of contracting Covid-19, the candidates were told that only those who received tokens may stay back and others could leave. With the crowding at the MCH turning into a contentious issue, the authorities, who had till then remained insensitive to the risks and the candidates who were put through so much misery, suddenly called off the interview and said new dates will be announced later. The sectoral magistrates apparently deployed to regulate such situations were not known to have intervened in the issue. The collectorate also did not issue any statement despite such a risky situation arising in the city where lockdown has been extended. MCH authorities did not comment on the issue. Principal Sara Varghese and superintendent Sharmad did not respond to calls. A statement issued by the Medical College said that an interview was held earlier however none of the candidates turned up for the job following which another interview was scheduled on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/negligent-authorities-cause-breach-of-protocol-at-mch/articleshow/83414097.cms||---
---||Delhi||Doorstep delivery on hold, fair price shops to manually distribute ration for June||New Delhi: In the wake of the doorstep delivery of ration being put on hold, the food supplies department has ordered distribution of ration under National Food Security Act and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana for June in a phased manner. The distribution will be done manually at all fair price shops except Seemapuri where it will take place through e-PoS on biometric authentication. The distribution was to be done from June through doorstep delivery that the AAP government had planned to help the 70 lakh beneficiaries attached to 17 lakh ration cards. The delivery project was to be launched early June, but it could not get the lieutenant governor’s approval. He had returned the file saying as the scheme sought to change the method of ration distribution, it would mandatorily require the prior approval of the central government under National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013. A tussle has broken out between the AAP government and the Centre over doorstep delivery of ration and AAP has claimed that the Centre stopped the scheme because the ration mafia is well connected to the power. Under NFSA, beneficiaries will get 4 kg wheat and 1 kg rice per member, and under PMGKAY, another 4 kg wheat and 1 kg rice. All these food articles will be provided for free. The department’s order has reiterated that the fair price shops must follow all Covid-19 guidelines during the distribution of ration. Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh’s secretary, Saurabh Gupta, said the distribution of ration usually started from the beginning of the month, but it had been getting late due to delay in supplies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doorstep-delivery-on-hold-fair-price-shops-to-manually-distribute-ration-for-june/articleshow/83446617.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Education officer flees after parents grill him over action on school||NAGPUR: Education officer Chintaman Wanjari ran away after parents confronted him on the issue of “exorbitant fees” allegedly charged by one of the leading schools in the city. The aggrieved parents recently approached him after ‘School of Scholars’ (SOS) cancelled admissions of over 40 students as they failed to pay the fees. Earlier, they had protested at Bal Bharti Bhawan where Wanjari assured to help them out by asking the school to withdraw Transfer Certificate (TC) handed over their wards and take action against the management. Next day, however, he issued a simple letter appealing to the school to reconsider the parents’ request. The unhappy parents then went to meet him and grilled him on why no action was taken against the school for illegally removing the students of ninth and tenth standards. They also asked the reason behind the department softening the stand against the school, which failed to refund Rs1.44 crore to the parents, as per its own audit. In February, the department had asked the school run by ‘Nagar Yuvak Shikshan Sanstha’ to refund this amount to the parents after conducting an audit of the last three years, where it was found that an excess amount of Rs1.44 crore was charged from the parents. Initially, Wanjari tried to defend his action and even dared the parents to lodge a police complaint against him. He also asked the security guards to take out the agitating parents. Finally, he got out of his chair and started walking even as the parents kept asking their queries and also video shooting the conversation. He failed to respond to TOI’s numerous calls and text messages. Earlier also, TOI had tried to call him over similar issues related to schools, but he never answered. “We’re fighting against the school management on the fees issue for the last two years. They’ve illegally formed the Parents-Teachers Association (PTA) without informing all parents and fixed the fees as per their wishes. Since 2014, they have hiked the charges by 140%. It seems the Education Department officials work on the rolls of private schools,” Amit Hoshing, a parent, told TOI. SOS defends move to remove students While categorically refuting all allegations, the SOS management led by Sagar Meghe defended the move to handover TCs to the students, who failed to pay the fees. “We’ve acted against 30-32 students from over 40,000 enrolled with our various branches across Vidarbha. All of them haven’t deposited the fees since the last two years, which is before the Covid-19 pandemic. We had issued them several reminders and letters to complete the formalities. We also allowed them to complete their online classes and appear in examinations. It was only after the declaration of their results that we took a call to remove them.” He added that they acted as per high court’s orders that those failing to pay the fees for two years can be handed over TCs. “Our fees haven’t changed since the last three years, as our proposal to revise it is pending with the Fee Regulation Authority (FRA). These fees are fixed in consultation with the PTA at that time. We even offered 15-20% discount to the students, who paid initial instalments, considering the pandemic situation,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/edu-officer-flees-after-parents-grill-him-over-action-on-school/articleshow/83414089.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Water stress in Delhi: Recycling, design changes way out||NEW DELHI: With the rapid increase in Delhi’s population, the water demand in the already water-stressed city is likely to reach 1,455 million gallons per day (MGD) by 2041. City planners aim to reduce the per capita water consumption from the existing 60 gallons per capita per day (GPCD) to 50 by, among many measures, introducing mandatory water-saving plumbing fixtures, promoting wastewater reuse and water-sensitive urban designs in open spaces to ensure maximum stormwater retention. The per capita supply in land pooling areas will likely be even lower at 40 GPCD. The draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 says water conservation features will have to be inbuilt in layout and building designs. MPD41 notes that Delhi is steadily moving towards water scarcity and achieving water security will require the replanning of the current supply-oriented water management approach. The city has an installed capacity of 935 MGD against a demand of 1,140 MGD. This demand is estimated to rise to 1,746 MGD by 2031 with water-saving interventions, if successfully implemented, limiting the demand to 1,455 MGD. TimesViewDelhi has always been a water scarce city. Several colonies suffer from acute shortage, especially in the summer. In any case, water supply isn’t infinitely stretchable and cannot forever match the growth of population. Countries like Israel, Singapore and Kuwait have shown the way through water recycling. India, especially Delhi, should learn. The Master Plan must be proactively put into practice.The draft plan states that due to the limited availability of raw water, Delhi Jal Board wishes to rationalise and progressively reduce per capita demand by 10 gallons per day and supplement raw water with treated recycled water for non-potable purposes to be able to supply enough water to Delhi’s estimated 29.1 million population in 2041. All areas developed under the land-pooling schemes should have conservation features built into the layout and building design, while demand in green development areas planned on the city’s outskirts will be met mostly with treated wastewater. MPD41 clearly states that regeneration schemes and transit-oriented development projects will not receive more water than the existing requirement. An important agenda is 100% wastewater treatment and reuse. MPD41 says, “Dual piping and wastewater reuse is to be mandatory in new development projects with consumption beyond a fixed minimum level.” In the dual piping system, fresh water and treated wastewater for non-potable uses are supplied separately. DJB has stated that plumbing infrastructure for dual piping is too costly for implementation in existing buildings, so only future projects will have such provisions. Low water consumption plumbing will also be made mandatory for all new projects and all existing government and commercial buildings. Another key focus of water policy is resilience to flooding and maximising the capture of stormwater. MPD41 endorses aquifer recharge ponds and lakes in the Yamuna floodplain, greenways along natural drains and lakes for using treated wastewater for groundwater recharge, all projects that have moved at glacial pace in the past several years. There’s now a need for large storage facilities to collect rainwater along with water-sensitive designs, such as swales, in parks and open areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-stress-recycling-design-changes-way-out/articleshow/83414118.cms||Paras Singh

The 110-year-old Sultan-ul-Madaris (madrassa), which is still functional, is located on this land. In his letter sent to the CM on Wednesday, Jawad said the madrassa on the land was established by his ancestors and was captured by the British after the 1857 mutiny. “In 1911, the British government returned the land to Shias for educational purposes on a lease of 100 years,” said Jawad. After the lease got over, the land came under the jurisdiction of district administration. Meanwhile, Shia Markazi Chand Committee president Maulana Saif Abbas has accused LMC of encroachment on an empty land owned by Husainabad & Allied Trust (HAT) in Hata Sitara Begum area of old Lucknow. Additional municipal commissioner Amit Kumar, however, said, LMC does not undertake any construction on a land which is not under its jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jawad-writes-to-cm-seeks-return-of-madrassa-land/articleshow/83415489.cms||---

Search for his aide, another teacher of the same school, is on. DSP Raju Ram Choudhary said that a hunt had been launched for both the absconding teachers and the main accused Surjaram was arrested on Thursday night. It may be noted that Surjaram, a teacher at Government Upper Primary School in Baba ki Nimbadi in Mokamgarh of Shergarh sub-division, had allegedly raped a Class VI girl in March in school itself three to four times, while another teacher Sahi Ram stood guard outside the room. They had also threatened the girl not to disclose the incident to anyone. After learning about the incident a few days back, when girl had a stomach pain and was taken to the hospital for check-up, father had filed a complaint with the police against both the teachers, who were absconding since then. During check-up, she was suspected to be pregnant. Police had taken the girl to the hospital for medical examination after filing the case under POCSO Act, where sonogrpahy had also been conducted. The report has confirmed a 3 months’ pregnancy. On the other hand, taking a cognisance of the incident, the education department has suspended both the teachers and has initiated a department investigation against both of them. The investigation report has been directed to be submitted in a week. Chairperson of the commission Sangeeta Beniwal said that every possible support to the victim and her family would be provided on every level. “Besides this, we have also written to the DGP urging him to take serious note of such incidents in the state, so that accused could be brought to the book immediately and a strong message could be given,” she said. Considering the seriousness of the incident, a team of State Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited the survivor in the hospital and talked to the girl and her family. The team also inquired from her if there was any other victim of similar crime in the school. On the other hand, there was a strong public outrage in the village over the incident and concern for the safety of the girls going to school. The villagers submitted a memorandum to the IGP Jodhpur demanding arrest of both the teachers.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Journalist, cops help worker reach home||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The timely intervention of a woman journalist has helped 45-year-old Prakash, a labourer hailing from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, who was abandoned by his colleagues near Kazhakkoottam a few days ago, find a way to reach his home. Prakash had been going through a harrowing time ever since he was ditched by his colleagues till he was met by a vernacular journalist, Ancy, on Wednesday night at Kaniyapuram. On Thursday, the police officers of Mangalapuram sent him back to his city in a train spending money from their own pocket. According to Prakash, he had recently secured a job as a cleaner in an interstate goods truck that set out from Vijayawada a week ago. The other two staff, including a driver and a cleaner, hailed from Punjab. Since, Prakash did not have sufficient money to buy his own food, the other two men cleverly abandoned him after stopping for food near Kazhakkoottam five days ago. He did not have the courage to go to the police for help. Language barrier prevented him from asking for help from the local people too. Thus, he had to spend the days suffering from starvation. That was when he met Ancy, who was returning after duty on Wednesday night. Since he did not appear like a destitute, she took sympathy on him and took him to the Mangalapuram police station. There, one of the officers, who had experience in working in Andhra Pradesh, talked to him in Hindi and broken Telugu and took his personal details. On Thursday morning, they contacted his family and verified the information he had given. “Then we contacted our colleagues in the government railway police wing and requested them to book a ticket to Andhra Pradesh. Since Prakash did not have his identity card with him, I produced my ID card before the railway staff to book the ticket,” said Mangalapuram station house officer inspector Tomson K P. The officers also gave some money to Prakash as travel expenses. Ancy, who works as a news anchor in a prominent vernacular channel, had also reached Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station in the morning to see off Prakash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/journo-cops-help-worker-reach-home/articleshow/83414166.cms||---

Police have arrested the neighbour and registered a case of murder and attempt to murder. The neighbour’s son, a minor, was also apprehended. The deceased was identified as Shiv Yadav, while Vikas Yadav and Rattan Lal were his injured brother and cousin, respectively. Police said they received a call at 10.23pm about a quarrel between neighbours in Budh Vihar in Badarpur. A team reached at the spot and found that two neighbours had a fight over parking of a Scooty during which three people were injured and rushed to Apollo Hospital. “The doctors said stab injury on the chest led to Yadav’s death, Vikas suffered injury in the stomach and Rattan Lal was being treated for minor injuries,” police said. During inquiry, it was found that in the morning, an argument broke out between the neighbour’s wife and Shiv Yadav over the parking. On this, the woman complained about Yadav to her husband, who told his sons about the same. “The two sons then picked up a fight with Yadav. Then, one of them stabbed him in the chest. When Vikas and Rattan Lal intervened, they, too, were attacked,” police said. The cops added that people from both the groups sustained injuries. “The accused’s second son, a major, is currently in the hospital,” the cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-stabbed-over-parking-brawl-minor-among-2-held/articleshow/83446663.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Unwise antibiotic use may be behind black fungus||Have you had diarrhoea after taking antibiotics like ampicillin or tetracycline. Have you wondered why? It is basically because these antibiotics kill the normal bacteria in the gut and allow some bad but normal commensals (Clostridium difficile) to grow which lead to diarrhoea. This is a very common example of what can go wrong when using antibiotics. Normal pathogenic organisms get an unfair chance to grow because normal gut flora was killed by antibiotics. These infections are called opportunistic infections. Mucormycosis or black fungus is a fungal infection. The causative organism is ubiquitous in nature and may also be present in normal skin and nasal mucosa living in balance with other good organisms. It generally does not produce an infection, being kept in check by immunity and other microorganisms normally present. It is said that with a fall in immunity due to diabetes or steroid use, the infection supervenes. But AIDS, which has severe immune deficiency, hardly ever presents with mucormycosis. We rheumatologists and nephrologists use very high dose of steroids and immunosuppressants but we hardly ever see mucormycosis. Mucor is a commensal, which under the right conditions, would produce an infection. Coronavirus infection is a viral infection and has two phases in the human body. First is the phase of viral replication where it produces the corona symptoms of fever, cough, cold, and breathlessness due to involvement of the lung. However, this phase ends in 7-10 days. This phase is followed by the immune hyperinflammation phase that has features of immune mediated pneumonia, interstitial lung fibrosis, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, increased CRP, IL6, D dimer and Ferritin, all markers of severe inflammation. Increase in D dimer also indicates activation of coagulation process resulting in increased chances of coagulation and thrombosis and vascular events. There is no treatment for phase 1 except to take care of symptoms with paracetamol, aspirin and such drugs. For phase 2, corticosteroids are most helpful hence high dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressives (eg Tocilizumab) are used. The picture in phase 2 is very much like a bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. In some patients, bacterial pneumonia and sepsis do occur. Treatment for bacterial infections is the use of antibiotics. What is happening? The presumptive treatment for corona being prescribed contains two antibiotics: Doxycycline and Azithromycin. Once the patient develops breathlessness and features of pneumonia, the patient is prescribed high-end antibiotics to control the presumed bacterial infection. If one antibiotic is not sufficient, two or even three are given. Generally, the hyperimmune response comes down slowly over an extended period of time, leaving behind damaged lungs. Depending on the degree of lung damage, post-Covid oxygen demand remains. All antibiotics, particularly high-end ones, kill many normal commensals that prevent opportunistic infections. Thus, indiscriminate use of antibiotics may be responsible for this epidemic of mucormycosis. (The writer is a retired professor of medicine and founder and head of rheumatology department, KGMU.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Nine months on, teacher accused of murdering wife declared proclaimed offender||CHANDIGARH: The UT district and sessions court, on Thursday, declared government teacher Mandeep Singh a proclaimed offender (PO) in the case of murder of his wife. Mandeep has been on the run since September 15, 2020, the day he killed his wife Jyoti—who too was a government teacher—at their house in Sector 23.  After the murder, he, along with his sons Ishmeet, 13, and Jasandeep, 9, fled in his car towards Ludhiana. Later, he allegedly tried to kill Ishmeet by pushing him in a Ludhiana canal, but locals and police rescued him. Police took the boy to his Sector 23 house and found Jyoti dead. By then, Mandeep, along with Jasandeep, had escaped from Ludhiana. Police have, so far, failed to trace him and his son Jasandeep. Sector 17 police had registered a murder case against Mandeep. Police said Mandeep’s car was recovered from the parking lot of Golden Temple. He was also caught on the gurdwara and other CCTV cameras in Amritsar on September 15 last. But nowhere was he seen with Jasandeep. The footage showed Mandeep stayed on the gurdwara premises for about an hour, ate food at a dhaba in Amritsar, and then hired a rickshaw to a bus stand. “After that, he was not seen anywhere, as there are no CCTVs at the Amritsar bus stand,” said a cop. Police suspect Mandeep might have killed Jasandeep before reaching Amritsar.  Even as UT police looked for Mandeep in gurdwaras of Delhi, Bihar and Punjab, they found no clue. He had switched off his cellphone in Sector 22 after the murder and never used it again. After murdering his wife at their house in Sector 23, Mandeep left with his sons and told them their mother was in isolation due to Covid-19. The murder came to light when Ludhiana police reached the couple’s house with Ishmeet and found the house locked. They then contacted Sector 17 police and broke open the door. The cops found the body wrapped in a bedsheet on the night of September 16. Both Mandeep and his wife were government teachers with the UT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/9-mths-on-teacher-accused-of-murdering-wife-declared-po/articleshow/83411882.cms||Pawan Tiwari

In fact, the state’s GER exceeds the National Education Policy’s target of 50% to be achieved in the year 2030. The state’s GER has increased from 32.9% in 2010-11 to 51.4% in 2019-20. The state has 2,610 colleges, which works out to 38 colleges per one lakh population. Accross the country, enrolment in IT and computer courses registered a growth of 4.2% over the last five-years. In 2019-20, a total of 9,26,490 students in the 18-23 age group enrolled in universities in the state. Around 12.5% of the students have opted for distance education. “It is a great achievement. The GER of the state is more than double the national average. It is almost equal to the world average. One of the main reasons is that both the DMK and AIADMK governments opened government colleges even in remote areas In the last 15 years,” said E Balagurusamy, former vice-chancellor of Anna University. He, however, sounded a note of caution. As a result of vast expansion, the quality of education has deteriorated. The governments did not concentrate on correspondingly improving the quality. The number of graduates coming out in TN may be more, but the quality of graduates has come down due to various reasons including lack of faculty members and infrastructure,” Balagurusamy said. The state should concentrate on the quality of the graduates instead of further expansion, he added. “It’s a phenomenal achievement by TN,” said Madras university former vice-chancellor S P Thyagarajan. “Through performancelinked grants, the Government of India may consider strengthening state universities to promote high quality research,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/at-51-4-tn-students-enrolling-in-colleges-is-twice-national-avg/articleshow/83414151.cms||A Ragu Raman
---||Mumbai||Maha Vikas Aghadi government will finish full term, do well in polls, says Sharad Pawar||MUMBAI: Dismissing suspicions over the stability of the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi government (MVA) led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday said it will complete the five-year tenure and even perform well in the ensuing elections. “Doubts have been expressed in certain quarters over the stability of the MVA government, but I am confident that there is no threat to the government. It will complete five years and MVA’s performance in the Lok Sabha and state assembly polls will be impressive,” Pawar told senior party leaders on the occasion of the NCP’s 22nd foundation day. Pawar said he never thought that the NCP would form the government in the state with Shiv Sena, in view of their diagonally opposite ideologies. “We have formed a government of different thoughts and ideologies...and the people of Maharashtra have accepted the MVA government. Significantly, leaders of the three parties are moving in the right direction and for the cause of the people.” Pawar, the architect of the MVA, said initially even the media had expressed doubts over the state government’s stability and had speculated that it would not last beyond a few days or months, but now the MVA is completing nearly two years. Referring to the meeting between MVA leaders and PM Narendra Modi, the NCP chief said. “After the delegation met the PM, the CM had a separate meeting with him. Ag-ain there were speculations in the media. In my opinion, there will be no adverse imp-act on the stability of the MVA government; we should ignore such speculations.” Recalling how late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray supported Congress and did not contest a single seat in the state assembly elections, Pawar said, “After the Janata Party came to power at the Centre and Congress was completely routed, Shiv Sena was the only party that came to its aid. Balasaheb Thackeray promised Indira Gandhi not to field a single candidate in the state assembly elections and fulfilled his promise. Under such circumstances, I do not think that the Shiv Sena will take a different stand in the current political situation.” He lauded the efforts of the public health department for effective tackling of the pandemic and the food and civil supplies department for providing free food to the needy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mva-will-complete-full-term-do-well-in-ensuing-polls-in-mumbai-pawar/articleshow/83415667.cms||---

It isn’t a political prank, but the coming together of a peculiarly named couple. The wedding invitation has drawn the attention of many on social media. The groom is A M Socialism, son of A Mohan who belongs to a traditional CPI family, while the bride is Mamta Banerjee, daughter of K Palanisamy-P Neelambal couple from a Congress family. Socialism has two brothers named Communism and Leninism. “I named my sons Communism, Leninism and Socialism after many noted that communism died following the collapse of the Soviet Union. My grandson is called Marxism,” says Mohan, district CPI secretary. He had contested from Veerapandi assembly segment in the 2016 election on behalf of the People’s Welfare Alliance. Communism is a practising lawyer, while his siblings run a silver anklet manufacturing unit. While his name is certainly unique, not all attention it drew was good, says Socialism. “Not just me, my brothers too faced a lot of humiliation because of our names during our school days. In college, however, it attracted many and the reactions were more positive.” But Socialism is happy that his bride has a peculiar name too. “Her parents are Congress sympathisers and named their daughter after Mamata Banerjee (now Trinamool Congress leader and West Bengal chief minister), who worked hard for the Congress more than 20 years ago. I am happy that my bride’s name is also peculiar.” Mohan said CPI state secretary R Mutharasan would participate in the marriage function.

Activists of the Thadagam valley mineral wealth protection committee had alerted the collector and revenue officers about 20 trucks carrying bricks from Thadagam, Nanjundapuram and Veerapandi, passing through the Thadagam and Kovilmedu check posts on Thursday morning. The collector ordered north revenue divisional officer (RDO) and deputy superintendent of police to check if bricks were being transported from sealed kilns, violating orders of the Madras high court and the collector. The RDO stopped three lorries carrying bricks. Revenue officials inspected all the 186 sealed brick kilns to check if bricks were smuggled out of the units. But they did not find any vehicle there. The kilns were sealed in March. “However, they flouted the orders several times in the last two-and-a-half month by operating after nightfall, trying to sell and transport existing stock and even continued mining,” said convenor of the committee S Ganesh. Brick kiln owners who have appealed to the court for a stay order on the sealing process, said they are in deep debt and sought permission to sell existing stock and raw materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/3-trucks-carrying-bricks-seized/articleshow/83414172.cms||---

The initial deadline for the project was June, but was delayed due to the second wave of Covid-19. Rai, who inspected the construction site of smog tower on Thursday, said, “The cost of this tower, which is around 25m high, is Rs 20 crore. It has a capacity of air purification of 1,000 cubic metres per second. Delhi Pollution Control Committee of Delhi government is the nodal authority of this tower. However, IIT Mumbai, NBCC and Tata Project are also working jointly with the government to build it.” The minister added that he has directed the officials to escalate the construction work. “We are making this tower on a pilot-basis and experts will study its outcome. Based on its success, we will build more such towers across the capital,” he said. Claiming that the technology of smog tower under construction at Connaught Place is different from the ones in China, Rai said, “The towers of China take the polluted air from the bottom and emits the purified air from the top. But this tower has around 40 wings that will emit the purified air at 10m above the ground. The effect of this purified air will be till 1 sq km. The tower will also help to get rid of PM10 and PM2.5.” Apart from this, Central Pollution Control Board is constructing another smog tower at Anand Vihar terminus.

---||Nagpur||Mega Covid scam in Nagpur Municipal Corporation, claims NCP’s Abha Pande||NAGPUR: Nationalist Congress Party’s state general secretary and independent corporator Abha Pande has alleged financial irregularities by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) in procurement of medical equipment and other logistics for the treatment of coronavirus patients. Documents obtained by Pande showed that the NMC paid over Rs11,990 each for an infrared thermometer from one firm, while it procured similar equipment for Rs1,680 per piece. “The NMC purchased pulse oximeters for Rs5,000, Rs1,445, Rs1,792 and Rs2,400 each though it could get it for just Rs595,” alleged Pande. Civic chief Radhakrishnan B said a detailed inquiry will be carried out in the allegations levelled by Pande. Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Pande claimed to have exposed irregularities in the NMC’s health department (medical) while spending money received under State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) and National Health Mission (NHM) funds. The department provided information only regarding Rs5.28 crore expenditure. “Of this, I have figured out embezzlement of Rs1.50 crore. This could just be the tip of the iceberg while the magnitude of irregularities could possibly be much higher,” she claimed. “The civic body procured PPE kits at Rs840 apiece, whereas private hospitals in the city procured the same for Rs500,” Pande said and added that each time the civic body purchased PPE kits, the rates were different. Citing an example, Pande claimed that for one bill of PPE kits, payments were made from both SDRF (Rs98,000) and NHM funds (Rs57.48 lakh). Three pharmacists in NMC’s store department failed to provide details about whom they had supplied the infrared thermometers and pulse oximeters, she said. Pande claimed that though she sought information about funds (received from both NHM and SDRF) spent for Covid-19 management, the health department did not provide her with the entire information. During the first wave of Covid-19 in November 2020, the NMC had received 998 vials of Remdesivir injections from the government. Then, none of the NMC-run hospitals were treating Covid-19 patients. But the hospitals have no record of these vials, pointing out to a possible scam, said Pande. For procuring medicines, the NMC followed high-rate contracts of Jalna, Bhandara and Amravati municipal corporations and ignored the committee formed (to oversee quality and other mandatory rules to be taken into consideration) by the then municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe. All the proposals and work orders for procuring medical equipment and medicines pertaining to Covid-19 treatment were prepared without mentioning any dates, Pande alleged. The NMC also misused the terms and conditions of the funds allotted by the government. “Instead of spending money on Covid-19 management, the civic body spent it on purchasing anti-rabies injections, show the documents,” said Pande. She also wondered as to how despite being on sick leave, NMC’s then chief medical officer Yogendra Savai signed documents pertaining to procurement of medical equipment. She further blamed the municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B for turning a blind eye to this irregularity. Pande has also submitted a memorandum to Radhakrishnan demanding inquiry. If he fails to act in a fortnight, Pande said, she will approach the state government and will also seek legal redressal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mega-covid-scam-in-nmc-claims-ncps-pande/articleshow/83414160.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The actor has arranged for the infant’s surgery in Mumbai. The infant, who is struggling to breathe ever since she was born on June 1, was diagnosed with a hole in her heart and abnormalities in her blood vessels near the heart in Jalore town. Since her father, who works as a welder, earns a meagre Rs 12,000 per month, some people tweeted about the infant’s condition to actor Sonu Sood on June 6. On Thursday, a team of the actor reached Jalore and took the girl in an ambulance to Mumbai, where her operation has been fixed for Friday. The girl has now been named ‘Sonu’ by her mother Dhara Devi and father Bhagaram, to honour the actor’s gesture. Yogesh Joshi, a businessman from Jalore, came to know that Dhara Devi had given birth to a girlchild on June 1 and that since her birth, the baby had breathing issues and was on oxygen support. “Though their neighbour who is a boy pursuing chartered accountancy, I came to know about the medical condition of the girl. Since the family is poor, I tweeted to Sonu sir and his team members including Hitesh Jain,” said Joshi while talking to TOI on Thursday. After the tweet, the actor’s team verified the request and sought the medical papers of the girl from her family, which were provided by Joshi. “After verification, an ambulance was sent on Thursday and the girl has now been taken to Mumbai for further treatment. Sonu sir has once again proved that he is a saviour,” Joshi added. It may be recalled that Joshi’s daugthers Mahi and Pratha had sent Rs 16,530 from their piggy bank to Sonu Sood some days ago. When contacted, Dilip Solanki, uncle of the girl, said, “Ishwar sun Prarthana hai chori theek ho jaave, Sonu ji to bhagwan hain (I pray to god that the girl recovers, Sonu ji is god).” In the afternoon, the actor also tweeted that he has arranged for an ambulance and fixed her surgery at a private hospital in Mumbai. The actor also spoke to the family over phone when he was informed that they have named the girl, who is 10 days old, on Thursday as ‘Sonu’. “Bahut achcha lag raha hai, Rajasthan aaunga aur aapke saath khana khaunga (I am feeling great. I shall come to Rajasthan and shall have a meal with you,” the actor said through a video call.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/actor-sood-arranges-for-jalore-infants-surgery/articleshow/83415566.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Thiruvananthapuram||No takers yet for corp’s Gift a Smile plan||Thiruvananthapuram: ‘Gift a Smile’, the city corporation’s initiative to source smartphones from citizens to be given to deserving children for their online education, has so far drawn a blank. As per data with the education department, there are 1,209 such students within the city. With no one coming forward, the corporation is now planning to appeal to various departments and Technopark-based companies to support the initiative. “MLAs within the city are also trying to get help,” said Arya Rajendran, Mayor of city corporation. There are also plans to rope-in leading retail chains in the city to contribute smartphones for the children. Owing to extended lockdown in the city, business has been dull for the shopkeepers and it has been a key factor in the poor response to the corporation’s Gift a Smile campaign. Arya Rajendran said that focus needs to be given on children from backward communities. “We are specially focusing on children from backward communities. A proper system to ensure contribution from retail chains is being considered. We are also getting some false requests for help and we are trying our best to ensure that help reaches only the most eligible,” she said. The corporation is also planning to get special sanction from the state government to utilize own funds for the purchase of smartphones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-takers-yet-for-corps-gift-a-smile-plan/articleshow/83414243.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Forest cover grows by 1,050 hectares||COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore forest division has become bigger by 1,049.7 hectares, with district collector S Nagarajan declaring the parcels of revenue department land abutting the reserve forest in Mettupalayam, Anaimalai and Pollachi taluks as the reserve land. With this, the forest cover in the Coimbatore division has increased to 1,23,264.87 hectares from 1,22,215.13 hectares. Forest minister K Ramachandran has appreciated the collector and forest officials for increasing the forest cover in the division to protect the passage of wild animals. Earlier, district forest officer (DFO) D Venkatesh and team had collected details of the revenue department land adjacent to the reserve forest at Kemmampalayam, Karamadai, Tholampalayam and Maruthur in Mettupalayam taluk, Odayakulam in Anaimalai taluk, and Zamin Uthukuli in Pollachi taluk and submitted the same before the district collector a few days ago with a request to declare them as the reserve land. “They had identified 1,049.7 hectares, of which just 2.02 hectares belonged to the forest department and the remaining to the revenue department,” a source privy to the development said. The collector subsequently declared the 1,049.7 hectares as the reserve land under Section 26 of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882, on Tuesday. Of the 1,049.7 hectares, 817 hectares is located at Maruthur village in Mettupalayam taluk. It is the single largest land parcel to be declared as the reserve land. The DFO said, “People cannot cut trees from the reserve land. Poaching animals is also prohibited and those involve in the offence will be booked under the wildlife protection act.” Pointing out that they had booked a few people for using country made explosives (avuttukkai) to hunt wild animals in Kattanjimalai area, he said such incidents would be prevented, as the place now falls under the reserve land, where regular patrolling would be done. Venkatesh said the collector had also declared 50.8 hectares of private land in the Kallar elephant corridor as the private forest under the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forest Act, 1949, on Tuesday. “This is the first elephant corridor in the state to be brought under the Private Forest Act. The move will help preserve the most critical elephant corridor in the state. The landowner can enjoy the property, but cannot undertake any development work without obtaining permission from the forest department. The landowner also cannot fell the trees,” the DFO said. D Boominathan, landscape coordinator, district chapter of WWF-India, welcomed the move. “Kallar is a crucial elephant corridor, as it is the only link between the southern Coimbatore and the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. The corridor is connected by private lands, which are subject to development. Recognizing the area as sensitive and providing it legal protection will do a lot of good.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/forest-cover-grows-by-1050-hectares/articleshow/83414253.cms||A Subburaj

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Private hospitals roll out capped vaccine rates||KOLKATA: All private Covid vaccination centres (CVC)s started implementing the newly capped vaccine price uniformly from Thursday. State health officials during a meet on Wednesday told private hospital representatives they had the option of implementing the new regime from June 21 but it would be good if they could do it at the earliest. The Centre on Monday had capped the service charge by private vaccination facilities at Rs 150 a dose for all the three vaccines—Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. The Russian jab is yet to be available commercially. “We have started charging the revised rates at our hospital centre. We are thankful to the state government for allowing the value-added charges at off-site camps. Vaccination is a community service and we will go by the same speed,” said Fortis Healthcare chief of strategy and operations Richa Singh Debgupta. “The uniformed pricing for all hospitals is a good move and we started implementing it from Wednesday,” said Belle Vue Clinic CEO Pradip Tondon. In addition to its own vaccine centres at its three hospitals in Kolkata, the AMRI group has decided to charge the capped rate at its special camps, like the drive-by vaccination launched with Kolkata Police, as well. “The drive-by campaign is for the common man and not for corporates. So, we will charge Rs 780 for a dose there camp as well even if it is an off-site drive,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua. Woodlands scaled up its target to 5,000 doses across 14 locations in and around the city on Thursday, against 3,303 on Wednesday. “The charges at our two hospital centres, one for Covishield and another for Covaxin, have been rectified in the portal, according to the capped price,” said Rupali Basu, managing director, Woodlands. CMRI, too, started the capped amount from Wednesday at its hospital but decided to charge Rs 1,000 a dose at off-site camps till June 21 or till further clarification. “We have also submitted a requisition for 10,000 Covishield doses through the state. We are ready to scale up our operation if the supply chain becomes seamless,” said CK Birla Hospital CMRI COO Simmardeep Gill. RN Tangore Hospital has been charging only the Covishield cost of Rs 630 at its hospital centre since the very first day and Rs 750 at outside camps. “Even when we get the two other vaccines, we will not take any service charge at our hospital centre,” said Narayana Health zonal director (East) R Venkatesh. Many hospitals have started sending their requisition for vaccine to the government and they are hopeful of getting regular supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-roll-out-capped-vax-rates/articleshow/83414323.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The man was standing in the balcony when one of the bullets hit him in the waist, leaving him dead. Police are trying to identify and arrest the suspects. The deceased, Satish Kumar, a Delhi government employee, is survived by his wife and three children, including two sons. According to police, the incident was reported to them around 1am. A team reached the spot and found the victim was already rushed to Jag Pravesh Chandra (JPC) Hospital. “From the hospital we found that the man was dead. His body was sent for postmortem and a detailed inspection of the crime scene was carried out by a forensics team. A case of murder and under Arms Act was also registered,” police said. During initial probe, police found that the assailants could be known to Kumar’s son Sunil. “There is a possibility of Sunil having some dispute with a group of men. It looks like they opened fire to threaten Sunil, but his father got hit,” the officer said. DCP (North East) Sanjay Kumar Sain said multiple teams were checking CCTV footage from the area to identify the killers. “We have identified a few of them and raids are on to nab them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unidentified-men-rain-bullets-on-57-year-old/articleshow/83414277.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Man abuses, threatens to kill woman dalit panchayat president||COIMBATORE: A woman dalit panchayat president from a village near Annur in Coimbatore district has alleged that a non-dalit man had referred to her caste and verbally abused her after she insisted on following the rule while levying house tax for the latter’s newly built house. The panchayat chief had alleged that the man had also threatened to kill her if she delayed the process of levying house tax for the new structure as the tax receipt is a vital document often shown as proof of ownership. Police received a complaint on Thursday from S Chithra, president of Kanchapalli panchayat near Annur, and commenced inquiries. In her complaint, Chitra said she was seated in her office on Thursday morning when Guruprasad, son of Suresh Kumar of Alagapuri Nagar from Kanchapalli came to the office. He sought to know about the status of his application for levying house tax. Chithra stated in the complaint that she told Guruprasad that she would visit the house, inspect it and then process his application for levying house tax. “Immediately, Guruprasad got furious and started abusing me mentioning my caste name,’’ Chithra said. She alleged that he used derogatory terms and threatened that the house tax should be levied by that evening. “If I fail to do so, he threatened to murder me as well as my family members,’’ she alleged in the complaint. Chithra alleged that Guruprasad also attempted to assault her. But panchayat staff and villagers guarded her from him, she said appealing police to act against Guruprasad. Police said that they have launched a probe and would act if the allegations were to be true. Meanwhile, social activists have demanded immediate arrest of Guruprasad and give protection to Chithra. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-abuses-threatens-to-kill-woman-dalit-panchayat-prez/articleshow/83414233.cms||---
---||Delhi||CBSE Class 12 result 2021: Sisodia suggests result formula to Centre||NEW DELHI: For the final Class XII results, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has suggested a weightage formula of 20 marks to classes X and XI results, 30 marks to internal Class XII results and the rest to practicals taken by schools. In a letter to the Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Sisodia has also proposed that the moderation range be increased to +/-5 in case of Class XII results instead of +/-2 being followed for Class X. For some Schools of Excellence (SOE), English-medium institutes under Delhi government for which this would have been the first board examination, Sisodia has suggested an alternative in the absence of any historical reference. For these schools, the historical reference of the closest SOE should be used, he has proposed. “First of all, our principle for evaluation should be that whatever method we adopt, it should be inclined towards the interest of the children,” Sisodia, who is also the education minister of Delhi government, wrote. Urging all to rise above traditional principles and processes, he said, “The past year has been very challenging for children and their parents. Children have not been given proper and equal opportunities to read and learn, so we should not have any objection if the result of the children is much better due to the proposed new evaluation process.” On taking the marks of Class X, Sisodia has suggested that it should be on the basis of the subject in which the student had scored the highest marks in Class X. “This is necessary because the subjects studied in Class X are very different from what are studied in Class XII.” Regarding his suggestion on moderation, the minister said the scheme prescribed by Central Board of Secondary Education for the 10th marking scheme in terms of moderation, the reference point would be decided on the basis of the results of the last three years of the school and moderation of +/-2 would be allowed. “For the 12th results, I suggest that the moderation range should be increased to plus or minus 5,” he added. Sisodia has also reiterated the need for the ministry and other stakeholders to decide how the next year’s board exams will be conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-suggests-class-xii-result-formula-to-centre/articleshow/83458203.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Those trapped were screaming for help’||Mumbai: The illegal three-storey building that collapsed in Malad’s Malwani locality on Wednesday night was constructed around 8 years ago. CM Uddhav Thackeray announced an ex-gratia sum of Rs 5 lakh each to families of the deceased. PM Narendra Modi also announced Rs 2 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund for the kin of the dead, and Rs 50,000 each for grievously injured victims. The CM, along with his son, tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray, mayor Kishori Pednekar and BMC commissioner I S Chahal visited Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli, where the injured have been admitted. Additional police commissioner Dilip Sawant said, “The structure was constructed illegally. It developed a visible crack during the recent cyclone and collapsed on Wednesday. We registered a case against the two and arrested Ramzan Shaikh on Thursday.” An adjoining three-storey building appeared shaky and was evacuated. The collector’s office and BMC blamed each other for not having demolished the illegal structure. It was built on the collector’s plot, whereas the BMC is the planning authority. Wednesday night’s collapse followed a day of torrential rain. Horrified neighbours heard a loud thud and saw the building go down. They rushed to rescue survivors from the debris before the fire brigade arrived, whose officials then took over the task. Through the night, rescuers pulled out 18 people who were rushed to Shatabdi Hospital. Only seven managed to survive. Of them Marikumari Hirangana, 30, was in critical condition. The body of one victim, a milk shop owner who had his ship in the illegal building, was found at 5.30 pm on Thursday. He, along his son, had tried to escape when the structure tilted a few seconds before it came down. While the son sustained serious injuries in the leg and is in hospital, he told police his father may have got trapped in the debris. Ten of the victims were from the illegal building, while the other two were from the structure it crashed on. Of the 12 killed, eight were minors, with the youngest being 1.5 years old. The video of a child being pulled out from the ruins went viral and showed rescuers trying to remove mud from her body. Soyat Shaikh and his mother Rubina were having dinner when the three-storey collapsed onto their house. They were trapped inside. He said, “Nothing was visible. Somehow, we pushed the door open and managed to come out. We then pulled out others who were living on upper floors.” Sangram, who was hanging about with his friends, said, “The trapped people were screaming for help. We rushed and began to remove the rubble. Through the bricks, I saw the hair of a woman and pulled her out. I lifted her on my shoulders to the main road, where people shifted her to hospital in a rickshaw. I feel happy to learn that she survived.” Officials said save for the ground floor, the upper storeys were illegal and built without a care for structural stability. The BMC said the structure came under the collector’s land and so did not figure on its list of dilapidated buildings. A fire brigade officer said rescue operations were hampered as it was not possible to take heavy machinery through the narrow alley. “But by Thursday morning, we cleared the rubble and have accounted for all survivors,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-those-trapped-were-screaming-for-help/articleshow/83414293.cms||Vijay V Singh

The inauguration and Holy Eucharistic Adoration will be held from 3pm to 5pm. The programmes will be broadcast live on Malankara Catholic TV. As per the history of the parish, the original building of the church was a movie theatre called Pompadour. Archbishop Mar Ivanios bought it and restructured it into a church in 1933. The church building was thatched with tin sheets, and hence, it was called ‘thakarappalli’ for many years. The church was blessed and named in honour of the Mother of God by Archbishop Mar Ivanios on March 11, 1933. The Apostolic Constitution, Christo Pastorum Principi (11 June 1932), of Pope Pius XI established the Syro-Malankara Catholic Hierarchy comprising the metropolitan Eparchy of Trivandrum and the Eparchy of Thiruvalla. It was officially proclaimed and executed in this church in 1933 by the Rt Rev Aloysius Maria Benziger, the delegate of the Holy See and the Bishop of Quilon (Kollam). The First Holy Mass was celebrated in this church on March 12, 1933 by Archbishop Mar Ivanios along with the Most Rev Jacob Mar Theophilos, the Bishop of Thiruvalla, the Rt Rev Philipose Cheppad Remban and the Rt Rev Joseph Pulikottil Remban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/major-archdiocese-of-trivandrum-begins-90th-year-celebrations-today/articleshow/83414275.cms||---

Due to heavy vehicle flow, the animals are forced to wait to cross the road, causing man-animal conflict. Wild animals should not be disturbed. So, we want the forest department to construct an overpass for about 2km from Kallar bridge to the second hairpin bend,” he said. In November 2014, former Coimbatore collector Archana Patnaik and forest department officials inspected Kallar with the aim to construct an overpass. Officials said that the overpass would cross private lands and require land acquisition. The government would spend Rs 160 crore for the project, they said. But there was no further development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/construct-overpass-to-check-human-elephant-conflict-says-wwf/articleshow/83414261.cms||---

The officials identified the accused as Johny, a resident of Erakkonam near Kattakkada. His accomplice, identified as Vishnu, managed to escape. According to Excise officials, the catch was made during a raid conducted late on Wednesday night near Valiyavila Lakshamveedu Colony near Aryanad. The accused had setup a liquor brewing unit on the bank of a stream that flowed between two rubber plantations here. The officials have also seized 18 litres of hooch from the spot. Aryanad Excise Range inspector SB Adarsh, who led the team that made the catch, said that Johny was a daily wages labourer by profession. His wife hails from Valiyavila Lakshamveedu Colony. Vishnu happens to be a relative of Johny’s wife. “Vishnu is a known brewer among the tipplers here. Though we were also aware of his activities, he always managed to evade arrest,” Adarsh said, adding that Vishnu’s father was also arrested several times in the past for the same offence. After the current lockdown commenced, Johny also joined Vishnu’s activities. The duo had been selling the hooch to tipplers in the locality at prices ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 per bottle. A search is on to track down Vishnu and arrest him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/excise-arrests-one-person-for-brewing-illicit-liquor/articleshow/83414301.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: City hospital saves underweight baby with heart defect||COIMBATORE: Cardiologists and neonatal specialists at the city-based Sri Ramakrishna Hospital have performed a procedure to fix and widen the pulmonary valve of a three-month-old premature baby girl weighing just 860g. The procedure - Balloon Valvuloplasty - that was performed through pinhole surgery, involved inserting a long thin tube right up to her heart through the neck, and inflating a balloon fixed to its tip. This improved the valve to an extent that it now has only a minor narrowing. The baby, now weighing 1.42kg, was discharged on June 4. The hospital says there is no medical literature so far on the procedure being performed on a baby weighing lesser than 1.2kg. In a press release, the hospital said a woman in Erode had to deliver her twins on the 26th week of pregnancy due to an emergency complication in January-end. “While one baby died, the other was diagnosed with the heart defect, critical pulmonary stenosis. The valve sending blood to the baby’s lungs was almost closed.” The baby was shifted to the Ramakrishna Hospital in a neonatal transport ambulance in March first week. The critically-ill premature baby also developed multiple complications like pneumonia, sepsis, hypoglycemia, low platelets and blood transfusions, and was put on ventilation for many days. “While all this was being handled, her valve block was becoming more severe and the heart failure was leading to low blood oxygen levels,” said paediatric cardiologist, Dr S Devaprasath. Finally, on April 26, when the baby completed 90 days, a team of doctors performed the Balloon Pulmonary Valvuloplasty, which was risky considering the baby’s tiny size. “The baby was then slowly removed from the ventilator support, provided heart failure medication and fed just milk. She began gaining weight rapidly and was discharged on June 4 after we confirmed that she was now healthy and neurologically normal,” the cardiologist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-hospital-saves-underweight-baby-with-heart-defect/articleshow/83414283.cms||---

The demand was raised at a meeting of the examination committee held on a WhatsApp group on Thursday. Teachers of LU and LUACTA were asked to give suggestions to finalize modalities of the examination. As directed by the state government, LU is planning to conduct examinations for the second and the final year by August. “LU should not conduct the undergraduate examination of the second year and final year both as the student strength is huge and it would be difficult to maintain social distancing,” said LUACTA president Manoj Pandey. As not all students have been fully vaccinated so far it will be risky to conduct exams involving so many students.

The parcel was declared as emergency food for Covid-19 with ‘Mountain House 05 days emergency food supply’ written on the box. Cannabis strains are either pure or hybrid varieties of the plant genus cannabis. Many producers crossbreed cannabis plants to develop new strains with specific characteristics. The names are typically chosen by the grower and often reflect properties of the plant such as taste, colour, smell or the origin of the variety. Similar multi-strain buds were found on drug peddlers supplying drugs to late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, an NCB official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncb-seizes-over-2kg-cannabis-sent-from-us-as-covid-relief/articleshow/83415722.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay alumni donate Rs 25 crore for digital healthcare centre||MUMBAI: Two distinct paths emerge after high school. Those wanting to pursue engineering take the PCM (physics, chemistry, math) route and the ones moving towards healthcare follow the PCB (physics, chemistry, biology) road, and never do the twain meet. But the booming digital healthcare space will see the coming together of technology and healthcare at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. Its alumni, Rekha and Rizwan Koita have donated Rs 25 crore for setting up of the ‘Koita Centre for Digital Health’ (KCDH). Under the aegis of the Koita Foundation, KCDH will focus on driving academic programmes, carry out research and deepen industry collaboration in digital health. Improving the quality, accessibility and affordability of healthcare is one of the world’s biggest priorities. “This is a niche area and we are moving out of our zone. We will need hand holding from industry. We will need to hire faculty, we will need doctors and other medical professionals on board. This programme will be a part of the Interdisciplinary Dual Degree programme and students after their BTech can leverage their skills to join this centre,” said IITB director Subhasis Chaudhuri. “At KCDH, we hope to enable seamless cross-functionality across these streams. We hope this new initiative will open up exciting opportunities for our graduates, including spearheading research, launching startups, and more,” he added. TOI had written about IIT-B’s foray into this area on May 10. Following that, the idea matured fast, and with this fund infusion, the tech college is now setting up a full-fledged school in the domain. “Can you book an ICU bed at the click of a button? Similarly, which is the best hospital for cardiac surgery in Mumbai? These matrices are just not collected. Digital healthcare will empower patients to make informed decisions,” said Rizwan. While India may be at a nascent stage in the area of digital healthcare, worldwide, the healthcare informatics market is estimated to be $125 billion. In India too, the launch of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) in 2020 is expected to drive digital health adoption at a national scale. Koita Foundation will work with the new center to help scale its operations and work with digital health partners on joint digital health initiatives like internships and research programs. In addition, Koita Foundation will help the center at IIT-B establish industry relationships in healthcare technology, medical device companies, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-iit-b-alumni-donate-rs-25cr-for-digital-healthcare-centre/articleshow/83416919.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Delhi||Don’t charge property tax on basis of fees: Pvt schools||New Delhi: The Action Committee, an association of private schools, has written to Delhi BJP state president stating that the schools should not be made to pay property tax based on fees charged. According to the letter by general secretary of the committee, Bharat Monu, the property tax being charged from schools was increased last year during the pandemic. “Due to Covid-19, schools in Delhi have been closed since March 19, 2020, due to which the financial condition of many schools is not good. There is little hope of schools opening in this new session. In these times, the property tax rates have been increased, which the schools are finding difficult to pay,” added the letter. With BJP leading the municipal corporations, the letter urged the president to intervene and direct the authorities of north and south Delhi municipal corporations to strike down the increased rate. East Delhi Municipal Corporation has reportedly given exemptions to the schools. Due to the pandemic, the schools for the past one year have only been taking tuition fees. They were prohibited by the government from charging annual and development fees. However, following the case in Delhi High Court, now the schools are being allowed to charge arrears of the annual and development fees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-charge-property-tax-on-basis-of-fees-pvt-schools/articleshow/83446829.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Rules allowing home delivery of liquor in Delhi come into force||NEW DELHI: The amended excise rules, which allow home delivery of liquor in Delhi, will come into force from Friday (June 11). In a gazette notification issued on Thursday, Delhi government appointed June 11 as the date on which the amended provisions of various rules, including Rule 66 that deals with home delivery of liquor, and rules that permit restaurants and pubs to use their extra and open spaces such as terrace, balcony, etc., to serve liquor will come into force. It fuelled speculations that people in Delhi can order liquor online from Friday and get it delivered at their doorstep. However, despite the notification issued by the state finance department with the approval of the lieutenant governor, Anil Baijal, home delivery of liquor cannot start from Friday. The retail vendors will have to apply for an L-13 (Indian Liquor) or L-13F (Foreign Liquor) licence, and as soon as the licence is granted, home delivery of liquor can start. The rules coming into force from Friday also permit restaurants and pubs to have live music like performing bands and DJs. According to the notification, the capital’s microbreweries are now allowed to start takeaway service for draught beer, sell directly to restaurants and pubs and serve in events from Friday. Recently, the government paved the way for home delivery of liquor through mobile applications or web portal by amending the Delhi Excise Rules. Delhiites may have to wait for some time before they can swipe on their phone’s touchscreen to get liquor at their doorstep. While the L-13 licence has been in existence for more than a decade and has now only been amended to allow home delivery through mobile applications or websites, till date, Delhi government hasn’t issued a single licence of this category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rules-allowing-home-delivery-of-liquor-come-into-force/articleshow/83414317.cms||AlokKNMishra

In the next two weeks, AAP is expected to announce an in-charge each for at least 50 assembly seats, giving priority to newly elected zila panchayat members. Two major programmes will be undertaken by the party’s womens’ wing and CYSS, its students’ wing. Party MP and UP in-charge Sanjay Singh said that the women’s wing is set to start a protest against what it has termed the illegal confinement of at least four women linked with the Vikas Dubey incident of 2020, including a minor. On the other hand, CYSS will carry out a padayatra on unemployment. AAP plans to appoint an in-charge for all assembly constituencies within the next two months, a list that is usually indicative of the party’s final candidates for an election going by its Delhi and Punjab model. “Despite contesting on just 50% of the seats in the panchayat polls, AAP got 40 lakh votes or about 8-10% of the total votes for these seats. We were ahead of Congress with 85 zila panchayat members, 350 gram pradhans and 232 block development committee members. Clearly now, AAP has a presence in UP and people have started recognising us. By placing office bearers in all booths from now itself, we will ensure that our people are recognised at the local level,” said Singh Singh said a president will be appointed for each booth and while a sector president will be appointed for every 20 booths. A three-tier system will be set up with a booth president, sector president and a block president. We have divided UP into six zones for better management, which include west, Braj, Kashi, Awadh, Bundelkhand and Purvanchal. “Within the next 20-30 days, we should be able to open party offices in all assemblies. Along with this, a wall writing and missed call campaign will also be started. The wall writing will carry the slogan ‘UP mein bhi Kejriwal’ along with a photo of party president and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and the assembly in-charge. With the missed call campaign, we will try and increase our membership and get people to connect with the party,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/buoyed-by-panchayat-polls-aap-readies-for-2022-battle/articleshow/83415720.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Police said the driver of the offending vehicle had nodded off momentarily, leading to the crushing of the people. The dumper also damaged five cars parked on the side of the road. The deceased have been identified as Ashok, his wife Kiran and their sons, five-year-old Dev and two-year-old Ishant. The couple's younger son was initially being treated at hospital but succumbed to his injuries six hours later. The family was on the way to a temple in Gurgaon for Ishant’s mundan ceremony. The fifth person dead was 93-year-old Jawahar Singh. Santosh Meena, DCP (Dwarka), said, “Police received a call about an accident near Vikas Hospital in Najafgarh at 5.19am. Ashok, 30, his wife Kiran, 27, and their sons Dev and Ishant were hit by a dumper truck. Another person, identified as Jawahar Singh, was also injured. All five of them died in the accident. Jawahar was out for a morning walk while the family was going to a temple to perform the mundan ceremony of their younger son. Five vehicles were also hit.” Meena reported that the accident was caused by the dumper being driven rashly. The driver identified as Rajesh has been arrested. He claimed to the cops that he had fallen asleep while driving. He underwent medical tests, and no trace of alcohol was detected. According to eyewitnesses, Singh was walking in the direction of the truck and was mowed down before the truck hit the couple and the children who were coming from the opposite direction. The dumper then careered into the parked vehicles. The truck was carrying gravel and was going from a village in Haryana to Mundka. Singh lived in the neighbourhood and had survived a month-long battle with Covid. According to the nonagenarian’s kin, he was dedicated to his fitness and yoga and never forwent his morning walk. “Our neighbour came and informed us about the tragedy,” said Singh’s grandson. Ashok was a security guard at Vikas Hospital and lived 100 metres from the accident spot. Pooja, Ashok’s sister-in-law, said “We all live in a joint family. I was not aware that they were going to the temple. They had been planning to go for the mundane earlier too, but couldn’t because of the lockdown.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/4-of-family-crushed-by-dumper/articleshow/83446867.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||South Delhi building collapse incident: Dreams crushed, but who takes the blame?||NEW DELHI: After a building collapse in south Delhi’s Panchsheel Park on Wednesday resulted in the death of 25-year-old Ishan Seth, questions are being raised over the supervision of building norms by the municipalities. Facing criticism for the manner in which illegal additions and constructions cause such accidents, civic officials said on Thursday that the building department mostly relied on information and indemnity bonds submitted by the house owner, architect and structural engineer at the time of sanctioning the building plans. Officials argued that it was impractical to depute staff at all construction sites to check irregularities, which is why documents such as self-declaration to abide by the building bylaws weresought as was an indemnity bond from the house owner, architect and structural engineer overseeing the construction. “The bonds and documents clearly state that strict action, including booking of property and penal action against the owner and architect, will be taken in case of negligence or if any illegality is found at the structure,” said a South Delhi Municipal Corporation official. “At least in planned colonies like Panchsheel Park, there is no scope for irregularities and I don’t think the architect or structural engineer will take risks. Still, if we receive any complaints, we organise a field visit immediately.” Residents, however, insist that the civic bodies hardly act on any complaints they file. “In our colony, several complaints about illegal extension of balconies, building of shacks for labourers, etc were forwarded to the municipal corporation, but no one responded to them,” alleged M K Gupta, of S Block RWA at Panchsheel Park. The SDMC official’s reaction to such charges was, “If someone makes minor structural changes overnight, it is difficult to detect them and book them because our staff can’t be there all the time.” In the Panchsheel Park incident, a building collapsed apparently due to digging work for a basement in the adjacent house. “The contractor had allegedly dug right up to the plinth of my building which weakened the foundation and resulted in a collapse,”’ said Praveen Jain, owner of the affected house. The RWA’s Gupta said, “There earlier was a provision making a 5-6 feet gap mandatory between the boundaries or the basements of adjacent houses. But that norm was also dropped from the building bylaws.” The preliminary probe by police did indicate that the basement was being dug too close to the residential apartment. “Some gap should have been maintained. The earth remover makes a lot of vibrations, which can lead to a collapse, as it did in this case,” a police officer said. Atul Sethi, the father of the deceased youth, said, “I hope no one goes through the tragedy of losing a son in an incident like this. I believe the law will take its course and there will be a thorough investigation. Sethi said his son was pursuing his master’s degree in English while also working for an online company. “We are originally from Delhi and lived in Kirti Nagar. But we later decided to move to Mussoorie where I work as a chef,” said Sethi. “My son was staying in a rented accommodation at Panchsheel Park because he wanted to be close to his college. He was in the college magazine editorial team and loved writing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dreams-crushed-but-who-takes-the-blame/articleshow/83414430.cms||---

The Economic Offences Wing has arrested a 51-year-old man for allegedly posing as an Indian Foreign Service officer and duping a businessman of Rs 2.4 crore on the pretext of securing business proposals under the Centre’s Make in India initiative. The accused, Piyush Bandopadhyay, used to hold his meetings in five-star hotels and come in a beacon-fitted vehicle to impress his targets. “To give an impression about his coveted status, he would get the phones of all visitors and clients deposited beforehand. He would also drop names of senior government officials during business conversations while highlighting recent central government initiatives as if he had played an important role in policymaking,” additional commissioner (EOW) R K Singh said. Bandopadhyay has been sent to judicial custody. In another case, east Delhi Police and sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested an alleged imposter for posing as an anti-terror cell officer and duping and extorting people. The accused has been identified as Neitak Rawat from Uttarakhand. His father is a retired sub-inspector who was last posted with an intelligence agency. Rawat’s fake ID card claiming him to be an NIA officer has been seized. He did his MBA from Delhi University and had been living in Laxmi Nagar of east Delhi since many years. The NIA had received a complaint from a woman who was targeted by the accused and roped in police to catch the accused. In the third case, a popular singer on social media has been arrested for allegedly duping a 70-year-old man on the pretext of giving him a role in a movie, police said.  The accused has been identified as Jitender Mishra (36). The incident was reported from Rani Bagh in northwest Delhi. The victim, Ramesh Singh (name changed), always wanted to be an actor. As a youth, he had tried to get into movies but couldn’t succeed, and worked in some Punjabi albums and a television serial as a junior artist. Due to family pressure, Singh later started working for the railways. But even after retirement, he couldn’t forget his dream and used to surf the net for an acting opportunity.  It was not long before he got conned of his savings by Mishra who posed as a casting director. In February 2020, Singh saw a post on Facebook regarding castings for a movie producing company and posted his resume.  Some time later, he received a call from the “casting manager” who informed him that his resume had been selected for further audition. Singh was duped of around Rs 4.8 lakh on the pretext of being given the lead role in a movie where an aged man falls in love with a young girl. The caller said he needed to have an Artist Card and had to pay Rs 16,000 for it. On different pretexts, Singh was made to shell out around Rs 4.8 lakh following which the accused had disappeared. The accused told the cops that he had been duped by a stranger years ago in a similar fashion after which he decided to con others. He has a YouTube channel and a Facebook page in the name of Deepu Pandit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-conmen-held-singer-ifs-officer-nia-man/articleshow/83446937.cms||---

The list, prepared by Silicon India, a publication focusing on startups, is based on inputs from technology experts, venture capitalists, CXOs (chief experience officers) and researchers. Krishika was started in May last year during lockdown and has 18 outlets in central and east UP. It plans to increase the number to 25 by August. “One of the biggest challenges that farmers face is the availability of farm inputs at reasonable price. We provide them good quality inputs like seeds, fertilizer and agro-chemicals at affordable rates. We will also encourage farmers to take up organic farming,” said Anshumali Dwivedi, the founder of Krishika. The outlets are functional in Lucknow, Sitapur, Barabanki, Ayodhya, Rae Bareli, Basti, Gonda, Deoria, Gorakhpur and Bahraich. Agri experts at Krishika provide guidance to farmers and also make farm visits. “We recruit those who are graduates in agricultural science and train them. We appoint people who are aware of local dialect, language, agricultural issues and weather,” said Dwivedi. Both social media and traditional means of promotion, like leaflets, are used to connect with farmers. The startup appoints ‘kisaan sarathi’ who are mostly local youth to connect with farmers. It also has a mobile app and helpline. Dwivedi is the former CEO of Port of Algoma, Ontario, Canada. He is a member of the board at Northern Ontario Angels, one of the largest angel networks in North America. He holds an honours degree in economics from Delhi University and an MBA from the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade. Krishika’s co-founder Pramod Rao is an MBA from IIM Calcutta and the former CFO of Port of Algoma. He sits on the board of multiple companies in Canada and India. Dwivedi quit his job in Canada and relocated to India in 2019 to do something meaningful. Krishika has provided training and employment to 60 agriculture experts in a short span of time. The startup organises outreach programmes to guide and educate farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices. It has reached out to over 25,000 farmers and plans to set up more physical marts in northern and central India. The team is also working to create a solution to process satellite images to monitor seasonal problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-agri-startup-offers-hope-and-tech-aid-to-farmers/articleshow/83415754.cms||---
---||India||Moderna offers to sell booster shots from January; indemnity-waiver talks on||New Delhi: US vaccine maker Moderna has offered to sell booster doses of its Covid vaccine to India from January 2022 even as the government continues to hold negotiations with Moderna and J&J on the indemnity waiver. At present, the talks involve the sale of almost 200 million doses. They include 50 million from Pfizer, 70 million from J&J (since J&J has a single-dose vaccine, that translates to vaccines for 140 million people) and another 50 million from Moderna. The discussions, however, point to supply of vaccines at a future date, which would mean that the shots may have little impact on India’s budget for anti-Covid shots that is currently estimated at Rs 45,000-50,000 crore. The latest US offer that envisages around 8 crore shots for India would also be useful if it is delivered soon as domestic production is expected to rise steadily from August. The MEA spokesperson said he is still awaiting details of how many vaccines would be donated by the US in the first tranche of 25 million. According to US officials, these would be either Pfizer, Moderna or J&J. The MEA official said that Bharat Biotech had sought emergency use listing (EUL) from the WHO for Covaxin, as has the Russian vaccine maker of Sputnik. Questioned about Indians who had been vaccinated with Covaxin are reportedly facing hurdles in foreign countries, the spokesperson said the ministry “was working to protect the interests of Indians abroad.

---||Goa||Goa: Adverse weather, Covid surge dampens cashew feni industry||PANAJI: For the second successive year, the cashew liquor industry in the state has taken a hit due to various factors. While cashew farmers and feni distillers were unable to reap profits last year owing to the lockdown that was enforced from March-end, 2021 hasn’t been any better, as adverse weather conditions affected precious productive months of the season. Distillers and ‘bhatikars’, who are traditionally involved in feni making, as well as stakeholders in the industry were forced to give up production a month before the season ended in May. “This season, the cashew produce was 40% less than the usual production due to unfavourable weather conditions. Many wound up their operations in April itself. Also, it was difficult to function after the state witnessed a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases,” said Gurudatta Bhakta, president, Goa Cashew Feni and Distillers’ and Bottlers’ Association. “Though the cashew season started on a bright note in February-March, feni manufacturers had a hard time procuring cashew apples due to less yield. “Initially, flowering held a promising season, but bad weather conditions in the following months disturbed the fruiting pattern, thus leading to loss of crop,” said Bhakta. Some places also received heavy unseasonal rainfall. “Overall, the yield was low, and the fruit gathering activity was comparatively less. This led to an overall rise in production costs,” Sanad Bharne, team leader at Madame Rosa Distillery said. For some traders, production was affected due to lack of people who gather cashew apples and transport these to processing sites. “We shut down our operations mid-April as some of our workers tested positive. I also contracted the virus, so it was not possible to monitor the production. Hence, we wound up earlier than usual,” said Tukaram Haldankar, director of Haldankar Cashew industries. He pointed out that there were numerous hurdles that discouraged traders this season, with the main problem being unfavourable climatic conditions that had a direct bearing on the yield. Cashew season usually takes off by mid-February and continues till the end of May. But this time, the month of May was a washout due to Cyclone Tauktae. “Cashew crop was destroyed in the cyclone, compelling traders to discontinue their operations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/adverse-weather-covid-surge-dampens-cashew-feni-industry/articleshow/83414472.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Outsider entry creates ripples in BJP||LUCKNOW: The induction of Congress turncoat Jitin Prasada into BJP has come just ahead of the scheduled elections for four seats in the UP legislative council on July 5, in what has created fresh ripples in the state unit of the saffron party. The four seats which will fall vacant in the upper house are all represented by SP legislators -- Sri Ram Singh Yadav, Lilawati Kushwaha, Ram Vraksh Yadav and Jitendra Yadav. Given the strength of BJP in the UP assembly, it would be able to win all four seats. As a matter of fact, the BJP leadership seeks to project Prasada as the party's Brahmin face to consolidate the upper caste community -- which accounts for 12% of the voting population -- in the UP assembly elections due next year. A section of the community has been raising the issue of dominance of Thakurs in the present Yogi Adityanath-led government. Read AlsoDay after Jitin Prasada joins BJP, UP CM Yogi Adityanath meets Amit Shah in DelhiUttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath is on a visit to the national capital where he is likely to meet top BJP leaders, including Union home minister Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda, sources said on Thursday. During his visit, Adityanath is also expected to meet Prime Minister NarendraEven as Prasada's chances of getting a role in BJP's central organisational setup remains uncertain, the party sources do not rule out the possibility of him being propped up at the state level and being routed to the legislative council. Party sources said that this could potentially dent the prospects of a senior UP BJP organisational leader who has been nursing the ambition of getting a seat in the upper house.

Sharma happens to be a Bhumihar from east UP. Read AlsoIf loyalists don't believe in Rahul Gandhi, why will Indians?Jitin Prasada's entry is less a gain for the BJP, and more a blow to the Congress, Rahul Gandhi specificallyWhile top BJP leaders refused to comment, sources said that the state unit was squarely averse to the very idea of party para-dropping an outsider as a key contender for a seat in council. "This will further set the narrative of insider versus outsider within the BJP," said a senior party leader. Notably, Prasada, who was a Union minister in the previous Congress-led UPA government, had been facing a severe political crisis since 2014 when the BJP started its juggernaut under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. Prasada not only lost his traditional Dhaurahra in 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections to Rekha Verma but managed to secure a little over 16% and 15% vote share. He also faced a defeat at the hands of BJP's Roshan Lal Verma from Tilhar assembly seat in 2017 UP assembly elections despite Congress cobbling up a pre-poll tie up with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party.

---||Nagpur||Chargesheets in political offences bolstered with electronic evidence: Nagpur city Police||NAGPUR: City police chief Amitesh Kumar has laid out a system that stresses on filing chargesheets, including in political cases, reinforced with electronic evidence. The city police have registered 307 cases against 26 political parties and some other outfits for staging protests and agitations since March 22 last year, in violation of Covid pandemic rules under various provisions. Out of 307, chargesheets have been filed in 134 cases. Maximum cases were filed against BJP (124), followed by Congress (35), NCP (15) and Shiv Sena (eight). CP Kumar said inclusion of electronic evidence in every chargesheet, including in political offences, has been made a thumb rule now. “The police station staffers, including their intelligence (khufiya) wing, record protests and agitations in their cameras and we also procure CCTV footages from cameras installed at public places as strong electronic evidence for using them logically in the chargesheets,” said the top cop. “Every chargesheet is being filed after legal scrutiny,” he said. BJP state spokesperson panellist Chandan Goswami had earlier said they had to launch stirs in the interest of the people when government did not keep it’s promises like reducing power tariff and recoveries. He had also said police dealt with their party more sternly despite their following Covid norms. The top cop refuted the allegations, saying cops followed universal and impartial strategy of registering offences against all violations of prohibitory orders. “We can vouch for the fact that not a single agitation was spared, irrespective of the party or banner or their affiliations,” said Kumar. Kumar also refused to admit that there was no fear of law among politicians as the legal enactments lacked teeth. “Every case goes through a certain procedure in the criminal justice system which takes it’s own course before reaching a logical conclusion. Taking action itself is deterrence,” he said. Congress state spokesperson Atul Londhe said their party had to agitate for vaccine policy and other issues, including unemployment and price rise. “Offences were registered against even Mahatma Gandhi for protests,” he said. “It was only after our agitation that vaccine policy in the country became liberal,” said Londhe. NCP corporator Duneshwar Pethe said his party mostly followed the democratic and constitutional framework during protest. Shiv Sena’s city president Nitin Tiwari too said the offences were political in nature and got registered only for their action to help the masses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chargesheets-in-political-offences-bolstered-with-electronic-evidence-cp/articleshow/83414450.cms||Soumitra Bose

A video of the operative identified as Rashid Zafar also went viral on social media. However, Tihar authorities denied such allegations and stated that he banged his head in the window after he returned from a medical check-up. A senior official also stated that Zafar even tried to enter another ward of the prison. A mobile phone has also been seized from his cell. The accused was taken for a medical check-up when he tried to enter another ward. Zafar incidentally hit his head in the window and tried to harm himself. Zafar had allegedly recorded a video, which went viral on social media. In the video, Zafar stated that he was beaten up in the jail and forced to chant slogans. The accused was arrested in 2018 on the allegations of being member of an ISIS-inspired group that were planning suicide attacks and serial blasts, targeting politicians as also government installations in Delhi and other parts of north India. He was arrested along with nine others after National Investigation Agency carried out searches at six places in Jafrabad and Seelampur in Delhi, and 11 places in UP — six in Amroha, two in Lucknow, two in Hapur and two in Meerut.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-jail-officials-claim-injuries-of-is-man-self-inflicted/articleshow/83414456.cms||---
---||Delhi||Gang that went on robbery spree busted||New Delhi: A gang, which went on a robbery spree in Delhi on Tuesday, has been busted. Three people were arrested after CCTV footage clearly showed the faces of the accused drinking in Bharola village. The gang had committed two robberies and attempted two more in four districts in the capital within an hour. The accused men first shot a truck driver and then robbed him in west Delhi, following which they tried to steal the battery of an e-rickshaw in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh. The gang then targeted a man on an auto near IP Estate in central Delhi and finally a man near BRT in south Delhi. The gang was unsuccessful in Shalimar Bagh and south Delhi. Police have found that the accused are battery thieves but were desperate for money. One of the accused who was driving the stolen car is currently absconding. Police have recovered the car which the accused had set on fire to destroy evidence. The arrested men have been identified as Rizwan (28), previously involved in a drugs case and arms act, Shamshad (29) and Nasir (20), all residents of Loni in Ghaziabad. Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani said that during investigation, a police team analysed CCTV cameras in the areas of Shalimar Bagh, Adarsh Nagar and Mahindra Park and tracked the reverse route i.e. the side from which the offenders had came to Shalimar Bagh. “We found that the suspected vehicle was parked in Mahendra Park area for two hours and 3-4 men were also spotted with suspicious activities. Local intelligence revealed that the suspects might be Irshad and his associates. After establishing the identity of the suspected persons, and using technical surveillance, all the suspects were arrested from Garhmukteshwar, UP following a raid,” the DCP said. During interrogation, the accused persons have confessed their involvement in the cases of Shalimar Bagh, Punjabi Bagh, IP Estate and Defence Colony. “Rizwan also disclosed that after committing the crimes, they had burnt the Santro car in Baghpat, UP. The car has been recovered at his instance. During investigation, it was further found that they were using fake number plates in the car,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-that-went-on-robbery-spree-busted/articleshow/83446960.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Army wants 2 Indian cadets out of IMA over scuffle, action against 8 others, 6 of them from Tajikistan||DEHRADUN: Two `gentlemen cadets’ (GCs) of the prestigious Indian Military Academy (IMA) here have been boarded out, while disciplinary action has also been taken against two other Indian cadets and six from Tajikistan after a violent clash between them in March which left a few of them hospitalized. In the latest development on Thursday, the armed forces tribunal (AFT) stayed the boarding out of the two Indian GCs, who as jawans had been selected for the training at IMA to become officers, after they filed petitions against their removal from the academy. AFT ordered the Army to maintain the status quo till the next date of hearing. Apart from the disciplinary action ranging from relegation or demotion by a term to boarding out against the four Indian and six Tajik GCs after the Army court of inquiry (CoI), a show-cause notice for award of censure was also issued to a Colonel and a few other officers at the academy for failing to appreciate the gravity of the situation and taking timely action. An Army spokesperson confirmed to TOI that “strict disciplinary actions have been taken against six foreign GCs and four Indian GCs for violating instructions concerning discipline in the academy.” “The disciplinary actions are well considered and proportionate to the act of indiscipline by these GCs,” added the spokesperson, without divulging details about the exact quantum of punishment awarded to the cadets involved. A fight had broken out between Indian cadets and their peers from Tajikistan at IMA on the intervening night of March 3-4, leaving many injured, as was earlier reported by TOI. “The authorities took severe note of this breach of discipline and an inquiry was promptly instituted. Since the incident involved certain GCs from a friendly foreign country, the process was progressed ensuring uniform policy yardsticks for all trainees. Associated facts and pinpointed culpability on those involved were clearly established,” said the spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/army-wants-2-indian-cadets-out-of-ima-over-scuffle-action-against-8-others-6-of-them-tajiks/articleshow/83409703.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||SSC results to be final, no re-evaluation: Maharashtra board||MUMBAI: This year, SSC students will not be able to take the re-evaluation route if they are not satisfied with their marks. The results announced by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) will be final. “Revaluation and photocopies of answersheets were possible when exams were conducted and marks were tabulated by the board,” said MSBSHSE secretary Ashok Bhosale. SSC exams were cancelled this year owing to the pandemic and students are being marked on a 50:50 formula based on their Class 9 and 10 scores. In an online guidance to principals and teachers on the marking process for Class 10 students on Thursday, Bhosale said that as the marking process is being done by schools based on the Class 9 and 10 scores, the marks obtained in the results will be treated as final. Students unhappy with their scores can take the two offline class improvement exams being planned depending on the Covid situation. The board allows Class 10 and 12 students to apply for re-evaluation in subjects they had expected more marks after results are declared. “Only 3 to 4 students per school go for revaluation in a subject or two,” said a principal. Revaluation applications are sent through schools. The board, on receiving the application, sends a photocopy of the paper to the subject teacher of the student’s school—the original answer paper is corrected by an examiner not known to either the student or the school. The schoolteacher re-examines the answer paper. Any error in correction by the examiner is circled and returned to the board that makes the changes and informs the student of his/her new marks. The scores can either remain the same or go up. The student will not get marks lesser than that he/she had before sending for revaluation. A teacher said that doing away with revaluation would only put more pressure on schools to up the markings of students. But Bhosale pointed out that as all markings will be done by schools, it will be assumed that all precautions will be taken to ensure that the students get the right marks. Schools have been asked to keep the records of Class 10 students (used to tabulate their marks) for 18 months. The tabulation and uploading of marks on the board’s system have to be done by June 30. The board will set up vigilance teams that will visit schools found to have indulged in malpractices while tabulating marks. The state has already given more preference to a Common Entrance Test (CET) over SSC results for FYJC admissions. The results are expected to be out by mid-July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ssc-results-to-be-final-no-re-evaluation-board/articleshow/83415769.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Kolkata||Ramp up infrastructure, child care for possible 3rd wave, maintain Covid beds: West Bengal's Panel||KOLKATA: Bengal’s Global Advisory Board (GAB) for Covid-19 response held a meting on Thursday to work out a strategy in case a third wave of the novel coronavirus hits the state. Hospital preparedness, ramping up paediatric care, speeding up of vaccination and scaling up testing and genomic surveillance of the delta variant were among the topics discussed. With the number of Covid cases registering a drop ever since restrictions were imposed, hospitals currently have occupancy of less than 50% in corona general wards and 80% in critical care units. But the board members felt the Covid care beds should still be maintained, to be prepared for a third wave, which is feared to strike India by November or December. “These beds should remain as a continued preparedness. Since the paediatric population is feared to be disproportionately infected, we need to ramp up paediatric Covid care facilities. The state has already started on it while not losing focus on the adult population,” said SSKM hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, a member of the GAB. “By the month-end, the vaccine supply is expected to be more regular and voluminous. As vaccine hesitancy is no more a problem, we should scale up our vaccination drive further.” Set up by the Mamata Banerjee government during the first wave in April last year, the panel has Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee on board. Banerjee, along with Chowdhury, senior physician Sukumar Mukherjee and Bengal’s principal health secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam attended the meeting. “No doubt, Covid cases as well as mortality are on the wane after the calibrated lockdown controlled the infection rate. This may be the descending of the second wave but we have to keep in mind the possibility of a third wave. We cannot be taking an abrupt decision in converting Covid beds into non-Covid beds right now. Also, with the supply of vaccines improved, we need to target to inoculate at least about 60% of the population by December,” said Mukherjee. Bengal recorded 5,274 new Covid cases on Thursday, while death count was 87. But many on the global advisory board felt the need for testing more. The state is currently testing between 60,000 and 70,000 people a day. “There is also the need for better surveillance of the delta variant in Bengal and ramping up of facilities, like testing in rural Bengal,” said Mukherjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ramp-up-infra-child-care-for-possible-3rd-wave-maintain-cov-beds-panel/articleshow/83414465.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The seat fell vacant after the death of BJP MLA Gopal Rawat in April end. Tirath Singh Rawat took charge as CM on March 10 and needs to get elected to the assembly before September 10. Gangotri is an important constituency for both Congress and the BJP, as there is a widespread belief in Uttarakhand that the party winning here forms the government. Even though it would be a bypoll, a win here will play a crucial role in deciding the mood of the people before the 2022 state polls. Congress won the seat in 2002 and 2012, whereas BJP’s Gopal Rawat won it in 2007 and 2017. The seats that have been reportedly offered to the CM by MLAs are Kotdwar by forest minister Harak Singh Rawat, Lansdowne by Dilip Rawat, Yamkeshwar by Ritu Khanduri, Badrinath by Mahendra Bhatt, Dharampur by Vinod Chamoli and Bhimtal by independent MLA Ram Singh Kaida. Out of the six seats, four are from CM’s home district of Pauri, whereas others are from Dehradun and Nainital districts. In 2012, Tirath Rawat had won from Chaubattakhal constituency, which he had to leave in 2017 in favour of Satpal Maharaj.

However, his act of bravery was short-lived as Vaghela soon himself became a victim to the high voltage wires. Seeing the pigeon vainly flutter in the 11KV wires trying to escape the death-like grip, Vaghela climbed the 50-ft high pole with a stick in hand in his attempt to free the bird. Soon, people gathered in large numbers and tried to dissuade him from his dangerous attempt. They tried to bring him down thrice, but an adamant Vaghela climbed up the fourth time but met his fate when a massive recoil of the current threw him to his death 50 feet below on the ground.

Pandemic came into this family’s life much earlier than the virulent strike — it came as Meet alais Nishith, their first born’s death, in the fire that snuffed 22 lives in Takshashila Arcade on May 24, 2019. Life came to a halt for Dilip Sanghani, 42, a garment businessman and his wife Chandan, 41. But, they went on living — seeking justice for their 17-year-old son and so many other young lives lost on that fateful day. But fate had its own surprise plans too. While recovering from the loss, the duo went for surrogacy while planning for another child and two years later became parents to another son in August 2020. For the first time, nine-month-old Meet, named after his elder brother, was taken out from his home for the first time for a long trip to his native village to offer the traditional first prayer to the family’s deity in Jamnagar district. “We came to our native place with my son for the first time. We went to our family’s deity to pray for the wellbeing of all of us,” said Dilip, adding that everybody the family calls their son by the name of the elder son, out of love. “Meet was our only son and considering the wishes of our family members, we planned for a second child,” Sanghani added. “We go to Takshashila Arcade every year. This year, our son accompanied us to pay homage to his brother and all those who died that day,” said Meet’s mother, adding that they prayed that no such calamity befalls anyone ever again. Deceased Meet was a Class XII science student preparing for admission in interior design course and had joined the coaching class on the fourth floor of the building. An offence of death due to negligence and other sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered and police have arrested 14 accused till now including government officers and developers of the building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/takshashila-victims-family-finds-reason-to-live-fight-on/articleshow/83412408.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

All the fireworks units in the district, the hub of the industry, have been closed since May 10. P Vadivelu, 54, a resident of Vishwanatham village near Sivakasi, said the units were closed for several months last year while this year they have been shut for the past 30 days. Employees have been facing difficulties in meeting their daily needs. He said the government could permit fireworks units to function with 50% employees by imposing strict conditions on following Covid-19 protocol, just as it permitted safety match units to operate. Another employee, T Anand, 36, a resident of Vetrilaiurani village near Sattur, said they are unable to look for alternate employment though some employees have started to work in MGNREGA scheme. “Last year, fireworks manufacturers distributed rice and other essential commodities to workers. But, due to loss of business for the second consecutive year, no such relief was provided this year,” he said. CITU district secretary P N Deva said that the state government had provided monetary aid and essential commodities to all across the state last year. This apart, Rs 1,000 was also distributed to employees of fireworks and safety matches industry, but no such relief came this year. Apart from allowing fireworks units to work with certain restrictions, workers should be given monetary aid for the closed period, he said. A representation was submitted in this regard to the district administration recently on behalf of Fireworks and Matches Workers Association affiliated to CITU, he added. Congress MP B Manickam Tagore has also urged the government to permit the functioning of fireworks units taking into account the declining Covid-19 cases in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cracker-unit-workers-seek-nod-to-function-with-curbs/articleshow/83414457.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A police constable, deployed in the security of a murder convict, shot one to death in Vibhuti Khand, Lucknow, on Wednesday. Similarly, last week, three cops were booked in Sultanpur for the murder of a dalit in custody. Earlier, two policemen were booked in Unnao for the murder of an 18-year-old vegetable vendor. Last month, eight cops were booked for a custodial death in Ambedkarnagar . Four cops were also booked in Mathura on charges of attempt to murder in March, while a case was recently registered against an inspector for assaulting hospital staff in Pratapgarh. In Etah, three cops were arrested for framing 10 people over payment of food bill in March-end. Likewise, three policemen, including a sub-inspector, were booked in Badaun for releasing arrested youths for Rs 90,000. They were charged with prevention of corruption act in the last week of May. In Lucknow police commissionerate, a CB-CID probe revealed that two sub-inspectors and two constables framed a hotelier on fake charges. All these four cops were booked under the charges of public servant disobeying law, public servant framing incorrect record, punishment for wrongful confinement and arms act in the first week of April. A senior officer at the DGP Headquarters said, all the district police chiefs have been instructed to take strict action if any ‘man in khaki’ is found to be indulging in crime and lawlessness. “UP police force is the most disciplined and we have done maximum dismissals of personnel than any other government department against all those who were caught on the wrong side of the law,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rogues-gallery-29-cops-slapped-with-criminal-cases-in-3-months/articleshow/83415763.cms||---

The party would not oppose the release of these convicts if a decision is taken to release all prisoners who have completed their life sentences, he told mediapersons here on Thursday after inspecting works carried out in a safety matches unit. “While the court has decided that they had committed an offence, why should special treatment be given to only these seven just because they have political backing and support from people in England and France. Are only these seven people Tamilians? Though they are Tamil people, few are from Sri Lanka. Are the others who are in jail not Tamil people?” he asked. Manickam Tagore said Congress president Sonia Gandhi had saved the convicts from the gallows as it was based on her request that the then President reduced their sentence to life imprisonment. Though Rahul Gandhi as an individual who lost his father has said he has no objection to their release, the grassroots Congress cadres believe that their release would set a wrong precedent. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-cong-stand-on-rajiv-case-convicts-release-unchanged/articleshow/83414460.cms||---

U Sabarinathan, 37, a part-time art teacher at Government Higher Secondary School, Gujiliamparai in Dindigul district, has many awards to his credit. A staunch DMK supporter, he said that he had always been impressed by the oratorical skills of Kalaignar and his mastery in Tamil. Twenty-five of Kalaignar’s famous statements, such as ‘Naan (I) nee (you) endru sonnal, uthadugal ottathu, Naam, endru solavendum’ (Ones lips will not come together if you say I or you, but will come together to say ‘Name’ which means we), ‘Veeran savadillai (hero never dies), Kolai vazhvathillai (a coward does not live), Thendralai theendiyathillai (have not disturbed the breeze), and Theeyai thaandi irukkiren (have crossed the fire)’ have been featured on the drawings, with each sentenced appearing five times. “I used a black pen and a red pen, to write the miniature letters on an A3 size white chart paper. The letters are visible only under a magnifying glass,” he said. After drawing an outline of the two leaders using a pencil, he filled it with the quotes and anecdotes. With schools closed and livelihood affected, Sabarinathan says that he was impressed by the functioning of the chief minister as soon as he assumed charge. He said that he plans to laminate his drawings and present them to the chief minister if he gets a chance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/art-teacher-uses-mks-golden-words-to-draw-his-and-stalins-portraits/articleshow/83414468.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy gave this direction while resuming the hearing in a PIL based on a TOI report that highlighted the plight of Golconda and Qutb Shahi tombs, which are lying in a state of neglect and nearing dilapidation.

On a request from senior counsel L Ravichander, who brought to the notice of the court the expertise Agha Khan Foundation had in protection and renovation of monuments, the high court had made this foundation also a part of the committee. State’s special counsel Harender Pershad informed the bench that the committee met twice and prepared a renovation and development plan for Golconda Fort and Qutb Shahi Tombs. Archaeological Survey of India too approved the plan. “For the remaining 25 monuments, we need six months time to prepare a renovation plan,” he said. The bench has made it clear that the newly-constituted committee has to approve it. The bench also refused to give longer time to the state. First, conduct a joint field-level survey with the relevant departments and committee and draw a comprehensive redevelopment plan, the bench said.

The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation filed by secretary of the Athikesava Bhaktharkal Seva Trust, seeking to refurbish the old kalasams removed at the time of renovation and to install the same during forthcoming maha kumbhabhisekam which is proposed to be conducted. The trust had apprehended that the original kalasams will not be preserved and there is a likelihood of them being misplaced. However, the standing counsel for the joint commissioner of Kanyakumari Devaswom Board submitted that the kalasams have been placed in the HR and CE safe vault in Padmanabhapuram Palace, which has got 24 hours security. He submitted that after the renovation and restoration works are completed at the temple, the kalasams will be reinstalled on top of the tower of the temple and thereafter only kumbhabhisekam will be performed. Recording the submissions, a division bench of justices T S Sivagnanam and S Ananthi observed that steps shall be taken by the authorities to restore and preserve the original kalasams. If they are in good condition, then the same shall be restored and kumbhabhisekam performed. The judges observed that however, if the experts and aghamic scholars are of the view that they cannot be restored for some reasons, then the ones which have been removed, shall be kept in safe custody within the temple premises and exhibited in an appropriate manner, so that the worshipping public can view it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/preserve-kalasams-of-adikesava-perumal-temple-in-kanyakumari-district-says-hc/articleshow/83414463.cms||---

We have also collected ashes from the site where the mahant was cremated for DNA test and we have also collected his writing samples and sent it to a handwriting expert for analysis,” Meena said. Police have also seized CCTV footage from the ashram. On Tuesday, Rajkot police had lodged a complaint against three persons in connection with the suicide of the mahant, who died on June 1 at his ashram in Rajkot city. FIR was lodged against Alpesh Solanki, a resident of Pedhavada village of Kodinar taluka, Hitesh Jadav, a resident of Prashnavada village in Sutrapada taluka, and Vikram Sohla, a resident of Gandhigram area of Rajkot city. Sadhu Jayramdas Bapu was found dead in his room at the ashram in Kagadadi village near Rajkot on June 1 evening. Initially, his followers thought that he died of cardiac arrest and cremated him the following day. But two days after his death, the mahant’s followers found a 20-page suicide note which mentioned names of the accused while cleaning his room. The suicide note also had details about how he was being blackmailed by the accused using a video which showed him with a woman. Police sources said that Alpesh and Hitesh had reportedly extorted Rs 20 lakh from Sadhu over the last one and a half year by blackmailing him. After the suicide note surfaced, trustees of Shree Khodiyar dham Ashram education and charitable trust approached police and lodged a complaint against accused. Police are also searching two women who had been filmed with Mahant by the accused allegedly to extract money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/police-form-4-teams-to-probe-mahants-suicide/articleshow/83409906.cms||---

While the base plinth will be laid with 4 lakhs cubic feet of stones from Mirzapur, the elegant spires will be built with 1 lakh cubic feet of pink standstone sourced from Bansi Paharpur forest in Rajasthan, which recently legalized stone mining to circumvent wildlife norms. The nature and quality of stones for erecting the periphery walls is still being debated and the final call will be taken by the temple Trust’s construction committee chairman, Nripendra Mishra, who’s scheduled to hold a two-day crucial meeting at Faizabad circuit house from Sunday. Reiterating that the temple will be complete by 2024, temple Trust secretary Champat Rai said, six layers of the foundation have already been laid. “We have to roll out 45 more layers and the process is expected to be completed by October-end. Round-the-clock work at the temple site will enable us to meet the deadline,” he said. Reacting to the possibility of devotees taking part in kar sewa, Rai said, “Devotees can do symbolic kar sewa in their villages as the crisis triggered by the pandemic is yet to blow over.” Trust members will meet on Sunday at the Faizabad Circuit House for the crucial meeting of the construction committee to be chaired by Nripendra Mishra. He’s expected to inspect the ongoing construction work, weed out hurdles and chalk out ways to expedite construction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mirzapur-bansi-paharpur-stones-to-firm-up-plinth-secure-spires/articleshow/83415778.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Kolkata||Jab figures: 18-44 group pips 60+ in Kolkata||KOLKATA: The 18-44 years age group might be the latest entrant to the Covid vaccination programme, but the number of recipients from this category has already overtaken those in the 60+ age group in Kolkata. According to the record on Wednesday, 5,62,078 younger people and 5,34,318 senior citizens have received their shots so far. The younger crowd overtook the elderly a couple of days ago as even on June 5, the number of doses administered on 18-44 group was 4,42,439 against 5,17,688 on 60-plus one. While the phase-III drive for the 18-44 age group started on May 1 nationwide, inoculation for 60-plus rolled out on March 1. In Kolkata, the 18-44 drive took off on May 4 from a corporate hospital. The government rolled out phase-III on May 11 from limited camps. “The response from the young brigade has been overwhelming. We have been inoculating the 18-44-year-old people exclusively at our hospital since May 4. There has been not a single dropout and many have not been getting slots,” said Rupali Basu, managing director at Woodlands. According to experts, apart from eagerness among the younger population, there are a few reasons for them overtaking senior citizens. First of all, the younger population in India was bigger in size than the older one, said an expert. Secondly, the priority groups in the 18-44 category, including vendors, hawkers, transgender community, government staff, lawyers, journalists and sex workers, pushed up the number of recipients. Also, when the drive started for senior citizens in March, there was a lot of vaccine hesitancy, but when the programme was launched for the younger crowd, the second wave was at its peak and everyone wanted a shot, he said. Like Woodlands, now most corporate hospitals have taken their drive to corporate houses, housing societies, clubs and associates, where the majority of recipients are in the 18-44 age group. “Many getting inoculated in off-site camps are in this category. They need the vaccine as they have to be out on economic activities,” said Rupak Barua, group CEO, AMRI Hospitals. AMRI has administered around 80,000 doses in a month, 80% of whom were in the priority group. “About 80% recipients here is aged 18-44 years. We hope we keep getting seamless supply of vials,” said Simmardeep Gill, COO, CK Biral Hospitals CMRI. The state is restricting the doses only to priority groups in this age category but is expanding the list. “With the supply expected to go up by June, we will add more people on the priority list,” said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jab-figures-18-44-group-pips-60/articleshow/83414579.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Two of his friends, who had also consumed the solution, are undergoing treatment in a government hospital. The deceased was identified as Elangovan, from Mela Agraharam in Ariyalur district. According to the police, Elangovan was upset for the last few days as he was unable to get liquor. While the Tasmac outlets are closed since the first week of May, he went to his friends, Mohan, 37, and Saravanan, 30, seeking liquor. The trio decided to consume hand sanitizers after learning that it contains alcohol. They consumed it on Monday and returned to their homes. Elangovan started developing health issues on the same evening and was rushed to the hospital for treatment. While the trio was treated in the Ariyalur government hospital, Elangovan was referred to Thanjavur government medical college after his condition worsened. However, he died on Thursday. Mohan and Saravanan are undergoing treatment in Ariyalur hospital. Unlike consumable liquor which has 5-40 % alcohol content, hand sanitizers have 60-95% alcohol to kill the virus. There has been lack of awareness in the rural areas regarding this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/man-35-dies-after-drinking-hand-sanitizer/articleshow/83414490.cms||---

PWD assistant engineer Nadkarni told TOI that the road repair work would be completed by the end of this week. He said that soling has been undertaken at patches, which has made the road motorable. However, asphalting work would be done post monsoon, for which an estimate will be prepared, he added. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had directed PWD to immediately draw up the estimates for the task following a memorandum submitted in this regard by former Sanguem MLA Subhash Phal Dessai. Phal Dessai had highlighted that the road constructed eight years ago had washed out, rendering it non-motorable and dangerous for the villagers, and urged Sawant take up hotmixing before the monsoon. Last year, Kadamba transport officials had threatened to withdraw the only bus plying in the village after drivers expressed difficulty in negotiating the treacherous road which poses a risk to their safety as well as of commuters. Saljini villagers had even threatened to boycott the civic elections in 2019 over the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pwd-begins-repair-work-of-saljini-road/articleshow/83414544.cms||---

Reviewing the pace of immunisation programme, the Chief Minister said: “The target is to expand the daily vaccination capacity to 10 lakh from July. To achieve the goal, it is important to intensify the exercise... Therefore, the current speed should be ramped up and taken to 5-6 lakh jabs per day.” According to CoWin portal, the total number of people vaccinated in the 18-plus group reached 52,82,400 in the state. This includes health and frontline workers, who were covered in the first and second phase of the vaccination drive.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No full-time ward officer in populous belt since February||MUMBAI: The BMC’s P-North ward, which includes Malad, is Mumbai’s most populous administrative ward but has not had a full-time assistant municipal commissioner or ward officer since February 2021. In fact, BMC’s Zone IV under which P-North ward falls doesn’t even have a full-time deputy municipal commissioner (DMC). TimesViewHow many more lives will it cost for the government to realise that its housing policy has failed? The tragic building collapse in Malwani, which claimed mostly children, is a grim reminder of the acute shelter problem in this teeming metropolis. Over decades, successive state governments have been unable to create a large stock of affordable and rental homes for the working class.The BJP has been demanding that BMC appoint a full-time ward officer but so far, the civic administration hasn’t done so. The earlier AMC Sanjog Kabre was promoted as DMC in February, and since then, AMC Santosh Dhonde of P-South ward has been holding charge for P-North ward too. Right now, DMC Bharat Marathe of Zone V is holding additional charge of Zone IV. So the ward neither has a full-time ward officer nor a full-time DMC. “This is why illegal constructions are rampant. We have written several letters to municipal commissioner I S Chahal asking him to appoint a full-time ward officer, but to no avail. We even held dharnas outside his office. The BMC is responsible for this crash,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra.  Last year, the most populous ward was to be split into two, the urban development department had said. But no timeframe was specified. 70% of the 9.7 lakh population in the ward lives in slums. P-North has some of the city’s biggest slum pockets: Malwani in Malad (W) and Kurar village and Appa Pada in Malad (E).BMC chief I S Chahal told TOI, “We are short of five ward officers, so five wards do not have regular ward officers. The MPSC is in the process of recruitment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-full-time-ward-officer-in-populous-belt-since-february/articleshow/83414551.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Ahmedabad||Covid-19: Thwarting third wave, Ahmedabad cops clamp down on mask offences||AHMEDABAD: Over the past year, it was generally observed that the rise and fall of Covid cases were reflected in the mask fines collected. But now that will no more be the case. In anticipation of the third wave, the city police have ramped up their surveillance and are tightening the noose around mask offenders. More offences are being registered now. Senior police officers said that novel coronavirus cases will shoot up again, if people flouted precautions, and so they got a mandate to implement the mask rule strictly. Cops had gone soft on mask offenders during election month — February 2021, when the mask violation cases ranged around 327 per day and and even dropped to just four cases — on the day of election on February 21. As the election got over, and there were no more political rallies, police became stringent, and coronavirus cases also began soaring in March and April. Police gradually increased the registering of mask cases in March when cops registered on an average 600 cases per day. In the month of April, the frequency of registering mask rule violations increased as did the number of Covid infections. On April 1, cops in the city registered 772 cases of mask violations which increased to 2,050 cases on April 31. In April, the cops registered on an average 2,000 cases of mask rule violations in the city, and Covid cases also went to their peak in the same month. On April 25, the city registered the highest, 5,790 Covid-19 cases when police registered 2,278 cases of mask violations. The city police personnel continued to register on an average 2,000 cases in the months of May and June. Police officers said that they are apprehensive of the third wave now, and they will continue the action on people roaming without masks. A cop deployed on PCR van duty said people usually remove their masks when they meet others. It seems that they wear it to save themselves from cops and not from the coronavirus, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/thwarting-3rd-wave-cops-clamp-down-on-mask-offences/articleshow/83414557.cms||---

Dr Latha Rani, the siddha medical officer of the Valayankulam PHC, who was in charge of this centre along with Dr Nalini, the siddha medical officer of the Pothumbu government rural dispensary, said that the CCC was a different experience for them too. “We started the day with asanas and yoga sessions and then the evenings were like community gatherings where the patients were allowed to display their individual talents or talk about a topic they liked,” she said. They were guided by the district siddha medical officer, Dr Mariappan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-than-300-discharged-from-madurai-siddha-centre/articleshow/83414515.cms||---
---||Trichy||Tamil Nadu: Sub-inspector and team give mentally ill a haircut, bath in Trichy||TRICHY: They had done it during the first wave of Covid-19 unmindful of the risk involved and they continue to do so now. Sub-inspector (SI) of police D Nagaraj of Thiruvembur station and volunteers Alex P Mathew, A Johnson Rajkumar and R Anbarasan have been picking up untidy people with mental illness roaming in the streets and giving them a haircut and bath. The team spent the whole of Wednesday searching for such people and found four of them in Thiruverumbur. Nagaraj said the idea was to clean them up as they had overgrown hair and beard. “Being mentally ill, they roam around. As they look untidy, others stay away from them. There are apprehensions among people whether such people are infected with Covid-19. Hence, we decided to clean them up and provide them medical attention if needed,” he told TOI. Hair-dresser Rajendran also joined the team and put in a lot of efforts to tonsure the heads of the four as they were not cooperative. The team brought a water tank mounted on a four-wheeler to make them bath after the tonsuring. The SI also provided them a T-shirt, lungi, towel and masks besides biscuits. “I will make a request to the government hospital here to conduct RT-PCR tests on them and vaccinate them,” said Nagaraj. Since some more such people are also roaming in the area, the team plans to make this service a weekly or monthly affair whenever they have time. Nagaraj and his volunteers had fed street dogs also a couple of weeks ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/si-and-team-give-mentally-ill-a-haircut-bath/articleshow/83414531.cms||Gokul Rajendran

The meagre increase from Rs 1,868 to Rs 1,940 per quintal by the Centre is tantamount to belittling the farming community, said district secretary of Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers’ protection association, S Vimalanathan. “The CM’s visit would be an appropriate occasion to fulfil his promise to declare MSP of Rs 2,500 per quintal of paddy, as the Centre has let us down,” he said. Given the skyrocketing price of petrol and diesel, cost of all inputs for cultivation will go up, said the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/declare-paddy-msp-of-rs-2500/quintal-farmers-urge-cm/articleshow/83414518.cms||Gokul Rajendran
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Farmers can take crop loans up to Rs 3L with no interest||Mumbai: Farmers in Maharashtra will now be able to avail of crop loans of upto Rs 3 lakh with zero interest if they repay the loan on time. As announced in its budget, the state cabinet decided on Thursday to hike its interest subsidy on these loans to enable them to be interest-free. The decision is expected to benefit 44 lakh farmers and cost the state exchequer Rs 96 crore. Crop loans are availed by farmers at the beginning of the cropping season to finance inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and labour. Those who default on payments, are not eligible for fresh loans. In his budget speech, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said the move was aimed at freeing farmers from the interest burden of crop loans. This would help them repay loans on time and keep them from turning defaulters, keeping them eligible for fresh loans, he said. “This decision will also act as an incentive for farmers to repay crop loans on time,” said Arvind Kumar, additional chief secretary cooperation department. Officials said that banks will also be able to recover their money as a result of the scheme since farmers will want to repay loans on time. Crop loans attract 6% interest. The Centre provides a 3% interest subsidy on crop loans of upto Rs 3 lakh if repaid on time. The state government provided a 3% interest subsidy on crop loans of upto Rs 1 lakh which are repaid on time and a 1% interest subsidy on crop loans of Rs 1-3 lakh which are repaid on time. The state will now hike its interest subsidy to 3% for the latter category. The subsidy is part of the Punjabrao Deshmukh scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-farmers-can-take-crop-loans-up-to-rs-3l-with-no-interest/articleshow/83415817.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

In the Maldevta area of Dehradun, a landslide triggered by a downpour occurred following heavy rainfall causing damage to shops situated on Dwara-Maldevta Road. Debris also entered houses and hotels and blocked the road connecting Tehri, Dhanaulti and Kaddukhal with Dehradun. Local villagers, whose houses were damaged by the debris, were forced to spend the night outside. “There was road cutting work going on in the hill area and the entire debris dumped there came gushing down with water after heavy rainfall,” said a local resident, whose house was also damaged. Dehradun received 60mm rainfall in the early hours of Thursday, according to the rain data released by the regional meteorological centre.  Jakholi in Rudraprayag district was lashed by maximum 130mm rainfall while Pithoragarh received 60mm rainfall, followed by 50mm shower in Nainital. The Met centre has predicted more rains in Uttarakhand in the next few days. An orange and yellow alert has been issued of heavy rainfall in Pithoragarh, Bageshwar, Pauri, Rudraprayag, Dehradun, Nainital and Champawat districts on June 11.

A Raja, the autodriver, has decided to spend the money on helping people. It was Covid that brought Raja, a mechanic working at a shipyard in Singapore, back to Madurai. Without his well paying job, Raja bought an autorickshaw to make a living and transported covid patients to the hospital. During the peak of the disease, he got a job as a multi-purpose worker in the covid ward at the Government Rajaji Hospital. On reading about his service in the Times Of India, a native of Madurai working in Dubai sent him Rs 10,000 appreciating his service. “This was a gift and I decided to use it to help more people who were really suffering during this lockdown, after having lost jobs,” he said. He identified six families that were in dire straits and finding it difficult to get a proper meal. He gave each of the families a 5kg rice bag, vegetables and grocerie using the money. He also bought bananas and biscuits for the monkeys on Alagarkoil hills, which usually depend on food given by devotees. “As the temples there are closed, the monkeys would be starving. So I fed the animals,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/good-samaritan-auto-driver-gets-aid-from-abroad-he-uses-it-to-help-people/articleshow/83414534.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu’s child brides trapped in cycle of poverty, patriarchy||CHENNAI: The cry for help came from a 16-year-old girl in Coimbatore last year who was being forced into marriage by her parents. She reached out to Childline, officials intervened, and the marriage was averted. After counselling, the parents agreed to focus on their daughter’s education. Two weeks ago, officials got to know that the girl had been married off. “We got to know of it after the wedding. Since the groom is 24 years old, we have filed a case and he has been remanded into custody. The girl has gone back to her parents’ house,” says P Thangamani, district social welfare officer, Coimbatore. This, in a nutshell, is the plight of child brides of Tamil Nadu. Forced into marriage by parents who see them as a liability, they are pushed into domesticity and early motherhood. Or, like the 16-year-old, their fate hangs in the balance, caught between homes where they are not wanted and society that shuns them. The numbers of such children have soared during the pandemic when schools are closed, monitoring by officials is limited and parents are struggling to eke out a livelihood. “From January to December 2020, 92 child marriage cases were reported in Coimbatore. We managed to stop 63,” says Thangamani. “This year till May end there were 57 cases, of which around 27 were stopped. Of the rest, some turned out to be false complaints.” In the Nilgiris district, while six cases of child marriages were reported in 2020, this year it is already 13; five were stopped by district authorities. The practice of conducting child marriages has its roots in cultural traditions. “I was married at the age of 14 to my mother’s brother. I was happy on my wedding day as I got to wear nice clothes and jewellery, but had no idea what was awaiting me,” says a 38-year-old, who works as a cook in Mylapore. “Only when I came to Chennai from my village in Tiruvannamalai did I realise that my husband, who was 14 years older, was an alcoholic. He beat me regularly. By 20, I had three daughters and then he committed suicide. Since then, I have been struggling to raise my children.” While she never thought of seeking help, the situation has changed with more awareness, monitoring and access to resources. According to a report by Child Rights and You (CRY), there has been a 40% rise in child marriages in May 2020, with 318 cases recorded from the operational areas of CRY in Salem, Dharmapuri, Ramnad and Kodaikanal — covering 10 blocks and 72 tribal hamlets. Authorities fear, in 2021, with Covid-19 raging more furiously, children are likely to be more vulnerable. “Whenever schools are shut, children are pushed to work, or marriage or are trafficked,” says John Roberts, general manager, development support, CRY. In a patriarchal society, where girls are seen as a liability, child marriages do go up when there is a pressure on resources. “If a family has two or three daughters then it’s one less mouth to feed. Conducting these marriages have also become easier — it’s less expensive as you don’t need to throw a feast, the couple and the parents go to a temple and solemnise the marriage. With lockdowns, monitoring is difficult and sometimes neighbours and relatives don’t get to know of it,” says M Jeyam, founder of Salem People Trust. Usually, the social welfare department, child welfare committees (CWC), police, Childline and NGOs work together to prevent child marriages. “If I get an intimation, I tell the social welfare department, and they check it out,” says B Pandiaraja, member, Madurai CWC. “They prevent the marriage, or if it has been conducted, file a complaint and produce the child before the CWC. If the girl says she has been forced, and expresses an interest in studying, she can stay at a government recognised children’s home till she is 18. After that, she can be at the after care centre till the age of 21. Last year, we prevented the marriage of a Class X girl after she called ‘1098’. When her parents tried marrying her off again, she decided to stay at the home and continue her education.” If the child decides to stay with the parents, they have to give it in writing, he says. “They also have to produce the child before the CWC till she is 18 and as when she is summoned.” Social welfare authorities also usually check on the child, but monitoring has become a challenge during the pandemic. “Some time ago, a volunteer informed police when a 14-year-old was being forced into marriage. They stopped the wedding and kept a watch on the girl for a month, but she was married off later. When we got to know the girl was pregnant,” says Jeyam. Taking cognizance of the issue, the state’s social welfare and women empowerment department is all set to crack down on child marriages. Recently, minister P Geetha Jeevan instructed officials to book families and relatives of victims of child marriages. But the plight of the child bride is often pitiable even when authorities crack down. “Usually, the groom is also booked under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, which places the girl in a vulnerable position. It is assumed that she has had sex, and to establish it she would be subjected to a medical examination. And many of these girls are not informed that they have the right to refuse it. The reliance on medical evidence is also worrying as it does not absolutely establish sexual activity and with a particular person,” says Vidya Reddy, founder, TULIR – Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse. “Moreover, the girl won’t be welcome back in her family or that of the groom as they would feel she has brought bad luck,” she says. That’s why social evils need more than just legal intervention, says advocate Sudha Ramalingam. “Law is only one instrument for social change. Social evils can’t be stopped without a change in people’s attitude. In the pandemic, parents feel if something happens to them then their daughter will have some security. In their own circles, the parents are seen as being responsible,” she says. “It is the larger societal approval within the community that is driving them to do this. Unless we empower women and educate people, the law is not the only panacea for social evils.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tns-child-brides-trapped-in-cycle-of-poverty-patriarchy/articleshow/83412583.cms||Priya Menon
---||Mumbai||ED may include Choksi’s wife in supplementary chargesheet||Mumbai: Enforcement Directorate (ED) may include Mehul Choksi’s wife Priti Choksi’s name in its supplementary chargesheet in the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank scam. ED has been investigating Priti, alias Priti Pradyotkumar Kothari, since last year and had summoned her twice, but she didn’t turn up. Source said Priti was the ultimate beneficial holder of Hillingdon Holdings, incorporated in Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai and was the sole shareholder of Goldhawk DMCC. Several companies of Choksi including DMCC were created for the beneficial interest of Choksi, sources said. ED also found a money trail linking Hillingdon and a Gitanjali group company, owned by Choksi, running into crores. ED said that the amounts were part of the proceeds of crime. Goldhawk DMCC owned three properties in Almas Tower, Dubai, that ED had attached in 2019. The ED had collected details from US, the UK, UAE, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong along with a few more countries about Choksi’s dummy companies, their accounts and properties he purchased. Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi had defrauded Rs 13,000 crore from the PNB through a forged Letter of Undertaking (LOU) and Foreign Letter of Credit (FLCs). They fled the country in 2018, before the CBI registered cheating cases against them for defrauding the PNB. The ED also registered a money laundering case against the two accused and, earlier, had attached properties worth more than Rs 2,550 crore in the case. The details of Priti’s role in the case came out after she alleged that there was an attempt made to bring her husband to India through a honey trap with the help of a lady, Barbara. Recently Mehul Choksi who is wanted by the ED and CBI in the PNB case, disappeared from Antigua and was found in Dominica.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ed-may-include-choksis-wife-in-supplementary-chargesheet/articleshow/83415867.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Now, death by drowning eligible for ‘disaster aid’||LUCKNOW: The state government has listed death by drowning as a disaster and the victim’s family will be eligible for compensation of Rs 4 lakh under the state disaster relief fund (SDRF). Death by suicide will not be considered for compensation. The order issued by additional chief secretary (revenue) Renuka Kumar says that in addition to nine situations considered disasters under the SDRF, death by drowning in a well, river, lake, pond, canal, pit and puddle will also be considered as a disaster from now on. The district magistrate where the death takes place will be the authority to determine whether the death was an accident or suicide as the family of suicide victims will not be eligible for state assistance. To ensure this, a panchnama of the victim will have to be carried out compulsorily. For the release of funds under any category of disaster, the SDM will have to verify the claim of the family. This step is being taken, said an official, to ensure that no fraudulent claims are made. “If the death takes place due to suicide or due to a criminal act, then the family will not be eligible for compensation. This will be confirmed by the SDM,” the notice says. In 2018, the government had added four categories of death to the list of disasters. These were snake bite, boat tragedy, death while cleaning sewer or gas leak and man-animal conflict. An official had said that snake bite had been included especially as there were several cases of it, particularly in flooded areas, during monsoon. The categories already listed under SDRF before 2018 included death due to unseasonal rain or heavy rainfall, lightning, storm, loo and falling into a borewell. The directions come in the light of a central government order which had asked the state to formally list state-specific disasters within the local context for inclusion in SDRF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-death-by-drowning-eligible-for-disaster-aid/articleshow/83415806.cms||---

Meanwhile, SOT of LB Nagar arrested G Manish, 23, a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) student from SVTK Apartment in Mithila Nagar of Pragati Nagar in Kukatpally, and recovered five vials of amphotericin-B injection from his possession on Wednesday afternoon. During the investigation, police found out that Manish obtained the injection vials from a friend, Arun, a medical representative. “Manish’s father runs a medical shop in Kukatpally and because of his father’s business, Manish came in contact with one Arun. We are yet to trace Arun,” Saroornagar inspector K Seetharam said. In a related development, SOT sleuths of Balanagar arrested Rekha, a contract nurse working at Gandhi Hospital along with her associates, Mahesh, Raju and Prakash for indulging in illegal sale of amphotericin-B injections.

---||India||Vaccine policy causing avertable deaths: BMJ||London: The Indian government’s Covid vaccination drive has inappropriately prioritised many, causing huge numbers of avertable deaths, warn a team of nine experts from research institutes in the UK and India. The government’s current approach to vaccination — focusing on younger age groups — “is causing huge numbers of avertable deaths and is deeply inequitable, both between age groups and within them”, argue researchers in a commentary published in British medical journal BMJ on Wednesday. From May 3 to June 5, 2021, more first doses were administered to people under 45 than over 60, even though at least 77 million people aged 60 remain unvaccinated, they wrote, urging the government to reallocate doses to older people. Authors suggest the move to make vaccines free for those aged 18-45 could increase focus on youths, rather than those aged 45-plus. “...access is mainly determined by socioeconomic status, with very low coverage in rural areas and among disadvantaged,” they wrote. Many are “resorting to private purchases... especially unaffordable for older people,” they added. The researchers are from University of East Anglia, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, King’s College London, University of Aberdeen from the UK; TISS in Mumbai, and Alagappa University in Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vaccine-policy-causing-avertable-deaths-bmj/articleshow/83419971.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Martin Joseph had a history of violence, deviant behaviour||THRISSUR: The family of Martin Joseph Pulikottil, the accused in the sexual abuse case in a flat in Kochi, had a humble origin. In fact, Martin’s father, Joseph Pulikottil, was brought up in an orphanage at Pavaratty after his father’s death. Joseph’s family was originally located at Chittattukara but they are now staying at Puttekkara near Mundur. Joseph, who is now 55, had worked at the Ashram of Mother Theresa at Kolkata, and has also worked as an auto driver. Interestingly, his auto was named after Mother Theresa. Joseph had studied Carnatic music and had also worked as music teacher in a school in Bengaluru. He had also worked in Bahrain for some time. While his wife is a homemaker, Joseph’s younger son is engaged in stock trading and is located in Thrissur. Joseph’s economic status shot up after he started lending drums. Joseph and his family have been deeply disturbed over the deviant behaviour of his son for quite some years. “On most occasions Martin used to be very docile and a decently behaved person. But sometimes he was seen acting in an irrationally violent way,” Joseph said. Martin had studied up to Plus Two in a government school and had joined for degree course in a college in Thrissur. Joseph feels Martin’s undesirable associations during the education days must have triggered the traits of deviant behaviour in him, and he must have started using drinks and narcotic substances since then. “He did not complete his degree course, and went somewhere remaining contactless with the family, especially me,” Joseph said. He became a completely transformed person after he went to the Gulf, and was passionately in touch with us all. But he returned from the Gulf, within a year and a half, and subsequently, he tried to start a real estate business, which did not take off. “I had given him Rs 25 lakh for that venture but he did not return it even after receiving it back from his business partners,” he said. “Martin had become violent when he came to know that I had mentioned to one of his friends about this money. He came home with an iron rod and evidently under the influence of some intoxicants, smashed everything at home, including furniture, doors, windowpanes, telephone, television, bike and car. We were also warned that we will be finished if we complain to the police,” he added. “We persuaded him to marry some other girl when he quarrelled earlier with the living partner, who has given the torture complaint against him, he flatly refused to do so and said he had lived with her for about one and half year and cannot abandon her just on the basis of some trifle quarrel. He said he will wait for her return. However, there must have been some serious misunderstanding between them and his cruel violence to her is totally unjustified,” Joseph said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/martin-had-a-history-of-violence-deviant-behaviour/articleshow/83412660.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Dead man ‘fully vaccinated’ in Deesa||AHMEDABAD: The Suthar family at Deesa town in Banaskantha (BK), a large rural district in Gujarat, is reeling from Covid-19 vaccination bloopers. These include a deceased grandfather being pronounced ‘fully vaccinated’, the mother having had her vaccine dose without actually getting the jab and last but not the least, the phone numbers of their sons being registered on the CoWIN application in the name of random women. The biggest shocker for the family was their grandfather Raghanath Suthar getting fully vaccinated recently on June 8, a good 18 days after he died of old-age related complications on March 20. “We got an alert about my grandfather getting his first vaccine dose on March 8, but we did not pay much attention to it as Dadaji was bedridden with a fracture and other complications,” says Dilip Suthar, an ME civil engineering student. “We got apprehensive about some mistake or irregularity only when we received the message about him being fully vaccinated after his death. There is surely some irregularity in the system somewhere,” says Suthar. This is not the first time the Gujarat administration has vaccinated dead citizens. Recently, the family members of Hardas Karingiya, who had died in 2018, got an SMS saying he was vaccinated on May 3, nearly three years after his death. In another case, Dahod-resident Naresh Desai recently got an SMS from CoWIN saying his father Natwarlal Desai has been vaccinated against Covid-19. His father passed away back in 2011. Meanwhile, for the Suthar family, the errors continue to shock. Dilip says he and his brother Vinod got the vaccine on May 1, the day India opened vaccination to the 18-44 age group, as walk-ins. “The urban health centre staff called us saying that many 45 plus candidates who booked slots had not come, resulting in surplus vaccines that would get wasted,” he says. Now, when Dilip tries to check his vaccination status, his phone number opens the registration on CoWIN in the name of one Meena Chamunda Suthar! “I am apprehensive that this may mar my access to a vaccination certificate which will be required to prove one’s vaccination status,” says Suthar. His cousin Praveen’s phone number is also registered in the name of another woman, Meena Mistry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dead-man-fully-vaccinated-in-deesa/articleshow/83414559.cms||Ashish Chauhan

---||Rajkot||Nikhil Donga fled Bhuj jail to ‘kill’ ex-MLA: Cops||RAJKOT: A sessions court in Bhuj rejected the bail application of gangster Nikhil Donga and six others on Thursday after the police, in its affidavit opposing the bail plea, stated that the gangster escaped from the jail with an aim to kill former Gondal MLA Jayrajsinh Jadeja. Donga has been in jail since April 1, when he was arrested from Nainital after escaping from Palar jail in Bhuj in March. The six other accused have been charged under various sections for helping Donga escape from jail. Additional sessions judge M M Patel junked the bail plea of the gangster. Deputy superintendent of police J N Panchal, who is also the investigation officer of the case, filed the affidavit opposing the bail application of the gangster which stated that Donga wanted to kill Jadeja, whose wife Geetaba is the incumbent BJP MLA from Gondal constituency. Donga wanted to eliminate former Gondal MLA and BJP leader Jayrajsinh Jadeja and therefore, he and his assistants had escaped from the jail, the affidavit stated. Initially, Donga’s gang planned his escape when the gangster was being taken to Jetpur court from the jail. But the plan didn’t work out due to Covid-19 situation. So, they changed their plan and Donga escaped from the prison ward of the hospital, the affidavit added. Bhuj Police had arrested 13 accused, including five cops, for helping Donga escape from Bhuj’s G K General Hospital’s Prison ward in March this year. He was later arrested from Uttarakhand’s Nainital on April 1 in a joint operation carried out by Local Crime Branch of Bhuj and Rajkot Rural police and Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), Ahmedabad. Donga, a history-sheeter, had been lodged in Bhuj’s Palara jail since October last year. He was arrested after it came to light that he hosted a ‘dinner’ for his aides inside the Gondal sub-jail in Rajkot district. Donga, who has 117 cases registered against him, was running an extortion racket from inside Gondal jail. He was booked under Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GujCTOC) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/nikhil-donga-fled-jail-to-kill-ex-mla-cops/articleshow/83410080.cms||---

The SIT reportedly called Babu, who was the BJP candidate at Wadakkanchery in the last assembly elections, to clarify the information received by them that Dharmarajan had contacted him after the looting incident. Later, talking to reporters, Babu denied that he had contacted or met Dharmarajan after the incident. He alleged that the police were hunting the BJP in the highway heist case. Meanwhile, the complainants in the case, Dharmarajan and Sunil Naik, filed separate petitions before the Irinjalakuda magistrate demanding that the amount recovered by the police so far should be returned to them. Shamjeer, who is the owner of the car involved in the heist, has demanded that the car be released to him from police custody. Earlier, they had filed a joint petition, but the magistrate returned the petition citing that the complainants have to file separate applications as the reliefs sought by them are different. Dinesh R Shenoy, the counsel for the petitioners, said Dharmarajan would be able to establish his ownership to the looted money, and would be filing claim petitions, if more recoveries are made. Shenoy said Dharmarajan’s money was meant for his business purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/heist-case-sit-quizzes-bjp-dist-secy/articleshow/83412700.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath in Delhi, meets Amit Shah to discuss poll roadmap||NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW: Ruling out the possibility of any change of guard in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the BJP leaders on Thursday started drawing roadmap for the state assembly polls as home minister Amit Shah had a long meeting with state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the two leaders were joined by the alliance partner Anupriya Patel, the president of Apna Dal. The UP CM called on Shah a day before his scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president JP Nadda, giving signals about possible expansion of the Union cabinet as well as the state, an exercise seen as politically imperative in view of the upcoming assembly polls in the most populous state next year. The meeting gained further significance when Mirzapur MP and former Union minister Anupriya Patel joined the two BJP leaders at Shah’s residence here. Patel was a junior minister in Modi-1 but didn’t join the government in 2019 even as she contested the Lok sabha polls and also the 2017 assembly polls as an NDA partner. Patel is daughter of veteran Kurmi leader the late Sonelal Patel and holds sway over Kurmi voters in eastern UP including regions like Varanasi and Sultanpur. Sources said the expansion of the central cabinet is imminent with vacancies lying and many leaders waiting for responsibilities at Centre for months. These include Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sarbanand Sonowal, Sushil Modi and Patel, whose inclusion is also seen as a foregone conclusion before assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. When Yogi and Shah were havig their meeting, Nadda called on PM Modi on the day of a series of meetings, giving indications about the possibility of the expansion at the Centre, which has been delayed due to Covid infections. Representation from UP in the central ministry is also likely to increase to balance caste arithmetic before state polls. Besides, there are speculations about expansion of the state ministry as well as changes in the party organisation in the state, which is also said to be discussed among the top party leaders. Inviting Adityanath for the crucial meetings in the national capital is seen as a strong message to his detractors as the party top brass and the RSS are said to have a consensus that the assembly polls will be contested under Yogi and on the performance of his government. Party general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh was on a two-day visit to the state during which he held meetings with the party leaders including a few aspirants, considered to be unhappy with the Adityanath dispensation, who are also seen responsible for floating speculative reports about change of guard in the state. Significantly, Modi, while addressing health workers in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi, had highlighted Adityanath's success in taming encephalitis, endemic to eastern UP and the bordering regions of Bihar and Nepal, as an example of what could be achieved by a leadership which is clear-eyed and focused on objectives. "Only six months are left for the poll process to start. The party has to focus on planning the roadmap. Rumours about leadership change are baseless," a senior BJP leader told TOI. Adityanath reached the national capital a day after the high profile joining of Jitin Prasada, who called on the Uttar Pradesh chief minister as well as another senior leader from the state, defence minister Rajnath Singh. On Friday Yogi is expected to brief the PM and BJP chief about the measures taken by his government – including speedy vaccination -- to tackle the second wave and steps initiated to battle the possible third wave of Covid, which, experts fear, could potentially affect the children. Nevertheless, the development set the political corridors abuzz with fresh speculations about the changes in his government. CM Yogi, during an interview with TOI, has categorically scotched speculations about BJP leadership asserting itself on the UP government and had termed it not more than a fig of media imagination. The BJP leadership has been keenly assessing the possible impact of pandemic on the electoral fortunes of the party in the poll bound states. Significantly, the party had rolled out its organisational machinery to provide relief to the pandmeic stricken people under its ambitious `Sewa Hi Sangathan' programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-in-delhi-meets-shah-to-discuss-poll-roadmap/articleshow/83415863.cms||Pankaj Shah

The court said these films have neither been portrayed as biopics nor factual narrations of what transpired in his life. “Posthumous privacy right is not permissible,” the high court said in its interim order on a plea by Rajput’s father to restrain such films from release. “The artistic freedom to create fictional works cannot be controlled, limited, or confined within set boundaries… An artist’s inspiration can come from any source, and the court cannot filter real-life events.

The state conducted only 18,260 tests on Thursday which is the lowest daily test done in the last 66 days. The number of tests have been reduced for the past two weeks, says health watchers. According to health department data, the state conducted over 10 lakh Covid tests in May while in the first 10 days of June, the tests have declined to 2 lakh. Even the weekly tests have reduced in the last two weeks. Only Haridwar and Dehradun districts are doing tests with an average of 5,000 samples per day. The nine hill districts have conducted an average of less than 1,000 tests a day per district during the last one week, according to the health department. “When the tests are reduced, the message goes to the society that Covid has reduced or is over. Its direct impact is visible on the Covid behaviour of the public of Uttarakhand. There is a dire need for the government to be in super alert and super active mode regarding Covid for the next six to seven months,” said Anoop Nautiyal, member of Social Development for Communities Foundation. Meanwhile, 94 tested positive in Dehradun in the last 24 hours followed by 60 in Nainital, 56 in Haridwar, 30 in Udham Singh Nagar, 28 in Chamoli, 24 in Almora, 22 in Rudraprayag, 15 in Bageshwar, 14 each in Pauri, Pithoragarh and Champawat, 10 in Uttarkashi and seven in Tehri. Also, 12 among the 13 districts have reported less than 5% infection rate. In Almora district, the infection rate is more than 8% due to less sample testing. While the infection rate of Bageshwar district was recorded the lowest at 1.16%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-cases-decline-in-ukhand-number-of-tests-too/articleshow/83410094.cms||Ishita Mishra

A division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar on Thursday adjourned the hearing on the case till June 23 after public prosecutor Tehsin Mirza and Uke sought time to reply on the application. The former chief minister moved the application through counsel Atharva Manohar contending that Uke has made false, baseless, scurrilous and mala fide allegations against him. “It’s necessary to grant the applicant a chance of explaining and repudiating the allegations made against him,” his counsel said. According to Fadnavis, the petitioner, along with Sameer Sheikh, had issued a press note and held a media conference while continuing their “malicious and defamatory” allegations against him on March 19, 2021 in Mumbai. He had filed a criminal complaint (punishable under Section 499 read with Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code) before the Mumbai metropolitan magistrate against Uke.

Accounts of people and evidence from the district suggests there are serious irregularities with even dead persons shown as vaccinated. The latest in this has come from Madal village in Lakhani taluka of Banaskantha, where two men who died in April were shown as fully vaccinated on Wednesday. Raychand Kalani, 63, died on April 3 in Madal village but a message from the CoWIN app showed that he was vaccinated on Wednesday. Bharat Makwana, the son of sarpanch Hemi Makwana, said he received messages on his phone that Kalani was vaccinated. Kalani’s family had given Bharat’s number earlier to get some government benefits. Kanji Makwana, 70, who had taken his first dose of the vaccine on April 2, died on April 22 due to asthama and other age-related problems. His son, Hira Makwana, said, “I got a message that my father who died two months ago, was vaccinated at 4.45 pm on Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-other-dead-men-vaccinated/articleshow/83414567.cms||---
---||Chennai||Look what the sea brought in||CHENNAI: You’ve heard of the Fiddler on the Roof, but what about the fiddler on the coast — the flamboyant fighter who lives by the sea and loves to flaunt his claws? The new pocket guide on coastal fauna by the Madras Naturalists Society can introduce you to the blue-yellow resident of Chennai’s shoreline, along with more than 127 other creatures of the sea. “The purpose of the study was to assess the health of coastal ecosystem,” says Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, a second year chemical engineering student and among those in charge of the eight-month long project that began last September. The group created a repository of the fauna in five important hotspots in Chennai and its neighbouring areas. Pulicat lagoon, Adyar Estuary, Kovalam creek, Mudaliarkuppam backwaters and Yedaiyanthittu Estuary were among biodiverse locations chosen. The region has a range of coastal habitats including sand dunes and beaches, mangroves, backwaters, mud flats, estuaries, oyster reefs and sea-grass beds. “This is part of a comprehensive study of the 1,076km Tamil Nadu coastline from Pazhaverkadu to Manakudy to document its biodiversity, threats, fisherfolk livelihoods and conservation status,” says G Vijay Kumar, honorary secretary, MNS. “Coastal ecosystems are among the most threatened habitats due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances.” The booklet, says Vikas, aims to familiarise the public with life found along the city’s shoreline and create interest in conserving and studying coastal ecosystems. “There are 913 species that have been recorded over decades. In these eight months we managed to find 709 of them,” he says. The group also spoke to the fisherfolk to understand more about the species. “We have retained most of the local names as well.” So the pansy shell is called the ‘kadal thattai’ (sea disc) because of its flat shape and the Japanese bonnet is ‘thoppi sangu’ or hat conch. “We hope this guide sparks interest and encourages public participation and collaboration to increase scientific knowledge,” says Vijay Kumar. Through an iNaturalist project, ‘Biodiversity of Chennai’, nearly 600 observers have helped document more than 2,600 species within the city. “Join the tribe,” he says. The free booklet is available online at blackbuck.org.in.

Under the package, the government will provide Rs 5,000 for 50,000 people associated with tourism and Rs 10,000 each for registered tour and rafting guides and adventure tour operators. “The financial help given is not good enough to even last for a month. The government needs to search for some pragmatic solutions which will help us get back on our feet,” said a tourism professional. According to industry estimates, Uttarakhand tourism lost close to Rs 1500 crores in 2020 due to the pandemic. Elaborating further, president of the Rafting Association, Dinesh Bhatt told TOI, “Government announced it will waive off one-year fee of rafting companies and give some cash to river guides, as per media reports but it is not enough. We have asked the government to waive off the fee for five years and change the policy to renew the license every year. Government is not taking the rafting industry seriously due to which many are now planning to leave the business.” Meanwhile, tour operators also are not happy with the government’s decision. Rishikesh based tour operator Sumit Shree Kunj said, “We demanded tax relaxation for at least two years but the government is not taking our demand seriously. We faced huge economic losses due to Covid pandemic and we have no money to give salaries to our workers and return bank loans.” A fund of Rs 28.99 crore was approved by the Uttarakhand cabinet on Wednesday for the people associated with the tourism sector. Half a lakh people associated with the tourism industry would be given R 2,500 per month for a total of two months taking the total amount to Rs 5,000 per beneficiary. A total of 352 registered tour operators would be given Rs 10,000 each through direct bank transfer and it would cost Rs 35.20 lakh for the state government. Similarly, 303 adventure tour operators would be given a financial assistance of Rs 10,000 each. For people who had taken loan for homestays under Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali Yojna, the state government has waived off interest from April 1 to September 30, 2021. An amount of Rs 10,000 each would be given to 631 registered rafting guides in the state. The cabinet has also decided to waive off the annual registration fee for rafting, aero-sports and others involved with the sector. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “The cabinet took the decision to help all those people who are linked with the tourism industry and have suffered losses this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tourism-professionals-unhappy-with-govts-relief-package/articleshow/83410077.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Hit hard by pandemic, state to auction unutilised land parcels||HYDERABAD: Hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and loss of revenue since the 2020 coronavirus outbreak, the Telangana government has decided to auction unutilized prime land parcels to raise money. Four committees have been constituted by the government, with a steering committee headed by chief secretary Somesh Kumar for smooth conduct of land auctions. A standard operation procedure was also released by the government (GO 13) on Thursday. The state government was planning to auction unutilized government land, including assigned land for the past couple of years mainly to mobilize funds for various developmental works, including irrigation projects. Authorities said they need some Rs 20,000 crore required in the current financial year. Some land parcels have already been identified for selling under the HMDA’s jurisdiction. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in his earlier review meetings said the state had lost about Rs 50,000 crore in revenue during the first wave of Covid 19 lockdown and pending arrears from the Centre and another Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 crore in the second wave. But the state has more financial commitments such as payment under rythu bandhu to farmers this agriculture season, additional financial burden due to hike in salaries to the state government employees and salary arrears. The government requires more funds to enhance health department budget for infrastructure facilities in hospitals and construction of super-speciality hospitals in Hyderabad and Warangal and completion of irrigation projects such as Palamuru-Ranga Reddy Lift Irrigation Scheme. The Industries and Commerce department, which released the GO on land auction, said that the concerned district collectors should ensure the lands are litigation free for e-auction and clear demarcation of lands be done. The respective committee and officials has to ensure time bound approval and change of land use of the identified land and declare the lands as “multipurpose use” and notify under appropriate zoning. Nodal departments would be delegated powers to approve the special terms and conditions and tentative schedule for conduct of e-Auction which will also be given powers of fixing of upset price considering the prevailing market rates. A committee will be constituted at nodal department under the concerned principal secretary to government to finalise bids and approve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hit-hard-by-pandemic-state-to-auction-unutilised-land-parcels/articleshow/83412721.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Rajkot||Rajkot offers Amul 100 acre land near highway for second largest plant||RAJKOT: The district administration has identified 100 acre land near Aandanpar village that can be allocated to Gujarat co-operative milk marketing federation (GCMMF) to set up an advanced state of art milk processing plant. A decision in this regard was taken in September 2020 in a board meeting of GCMMF to set up its unit somewhere on the Jamnagar road. The GCMMF, which markets brand Amul, had been demanding the government to provide land at a token rate. In line with its biggest milk processing plant in Gandhinagar that has a capacity of 50 lakh litre per day, the federation was planning a plant with a capacity of 30 lakh litre per day at the cost of Rs 200 crore near Rajkot to facilitate milk producers of Saurashtra and Kutch. On Thursday, Rajkot district collector Remya Mohan said, “We have identified a plot of land near Anandpar Navagam village on Rajkot-Ahmedabad highway in the outskirts of the city that could be allocated to the GCMMF for its milk plant. If the milk processing plant comes at at the site, it will be a good news for the dairy farmers of entire Saurashtra.” Collector office sources said that the land belongs to two villages — Anandpar Navagam and Sokhda. The diary giant has already paid one percent amount of Jantri value, which is a requirement as per law to initiate the process of identifying government land. In the second stage, the valuation committee headed by the collector will finalize the value of the land as per market rate and send a report to the state government. The cabinet will take a final decision on the land price. Vice-chairman of GCMMF, Valmji Humbal said that the federation already met CM Vijay Rupani last week and requested land for free or at best a token rate. “The government also had provided Gandhinagar land at a token rate. This plant will save milk farmers Rs 30 lakh on transportation cost every day,” he added. At present, 10 milk unions in Saurashtra and Kutch collect around 30 lakh litre milk per day and utilize half the amount to produce milk, buttermilk, curd and ghee. The remaining 15 lakh litre is sent to Gandhinagar which GCMMF utilizes to produce milk products like srikhand, ice cream, chocolate, cheese, butter and skimmed milk powder under the brand name of Amul. Anandpar has a strategic advantage Milk to the proposed plant at Anandpar will come from entire Saurashtra and Kutch and owing to its strategic location, milk trucks can reach it directly without entering into the city area. While those vehicles coming from Jamnagar, Dwarka, Morbi and Kutch can reach it using Maliyasan road, those from Junagadh, Gir Somnath and Amreli can access the bypass to reach its destination. Again, a third Ring Road proposes to connect the traffic of Jamnagar and Junagadh to Ahmedabad in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rajkot-offers-amul-100-acre-land-near-highway-for-30l-litre-plant/articleshow/83410130.cms||---

Two of them sustained bullet injuries. Police also seized some meat from their car. The arrested men, police claimed, have confessed to slaughtering stray cattle and ferrying them to Rampur and Moradabad for sale. Speaking with TOI, Rampur superintendent of police Shaghun Gautam said all those arrested were wanted in a case registered under the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act registered at Milak police station on June 6. Those arrested were identified as Tausif Qureshi alias Bhai Bhedia, Akram , Faiz Danish , Nadeem and Khalid. The SSP said the encounter took place when a police team at the Ratonda road check post hailed a car coming at high speed to stop for inspection. On seeing the policemen, the men in the car allegedly opened fire at the team. The latter retaliated. Then, they tried to abandon the car and flee. In the shootout, Tauseef Qureshi and Akram sustained bullet injuries on their legs. Both have been referred to Meerut Medical College, SSP Gautam said.

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Districts to check for vaccine overpricing in private hospitals||RANCHI: The state department of health, medical education and family welfare on Thursday said the administrations of all 24 districts have been directed to keep an eye on the fees charged by private hospitals for Covid-19 vaccines and ensure that no one pays more than the prescribed amount for shots at these healthcare facilities. “We have records of the number of Covid vaccines procured by private hospitals. Any complaint of hospitals charging more than the prescribed amount will be dealt with legally,” Siddarth Tripathy, nodal officer of the department’s IEC wing, said. Notably, in a letter to the chief secretaries and health secretaries on June 8, the Union ministry of health, medical education and family welfare laid out separate rates for one dose of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccines to be levied by private hospitals. As per the rates, they can charge up to Rs 780 for one dose of Covishield, Rs 1,410 for a dose of Covaxin and Rs 1,145 for a jab of Sputnik V. The charges include price per dose as declared by the manufacturers (Rs 600 for Covishield, Rs 1,200 for Covaxin and Rs 948 for Sputnik V), a service charge of Rs 150 and GST between Rs 30 and Rs 60. Even though the Centre will provide free vaccines for all age groups from June 21, vaccine makers can sell 25% of their monthly production to private hospitals and healthcare providers for paid vaccination drive. At present, two private hospitals in Jharkhand (one in Ranchi and another in Bokaro) are providing paid jabs to age groups between 18-44 years. The department has also asked the district administrations to facilitate the vaccination of beneficaries who are due for international travel. On Wednesday, the Centre relaxed the gap between two doses of Covishield for international travelers to four weeks from 12. The department on Thursday also said that all Covid hospitals in Jharkhand have been directed to conduct regular fire safety audit, procure no objection certificates from the fire department and appoint one fire safety nodal officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/districts-to-check-for-vax-overpricing-in-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/83414299.cms||---

Among them, six have lost both their parents while the 125 lost either their mother or father. In a survey conducted by the district administration, it found that the overwhelming majority of the 131 children are girls (106). The survey was launched on June 3 and is on the verge of completion. Seraikela-Kharsawan DC Arava Rajkamal has asked the district social welfare officer (DSWO) Sandhya Rani and district child protection officer (DCPO) S K Thakurto ensure the orphans receive all the government sponsored welfare schemes they are entitled to on a priority basis. He has also asked the officials to ensure single parents receive the benefits of government schemes for the welfare and development of the orphan child. Notably, as per state government data, Seraikela-Kharsawan district has reported 67 Covid deaths so far, including 50 deaths in the second wave. Adding that several orphans are siblings, Thakur said, “How many lost mother and how many father will be known once the data compilation gets over.” Under the sponsorship scheme, the custodian of a child, who lost both his parents, will get Rs 2,000 a month as aid from the government to help with the upbringing. The government will also ensure the child enjoys free education and healthcare. In the case of single parent who lacks good earning, the administration will help provide additional source of earnings so that the child's development is not compromised with. "The house-to-house survey is going on to identify the needy ones for the sponsorship scheme," Rani said, adding that 12 children in dire need of government support have been identified so far. “Of the 12 needy orphans, six have lost both their parents and the remaining have lost one parent. The work on compiling the data of the single parents is in the last leg. We will soon have complete data of the orphans who lost their father,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/seraikela-admin-identifies-131-kids-who-lost-at-least-1-parent-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/83414218.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Health department to conduct special vaccine drive for Tana Bhagats||RANCHI: After state health minister Banna Gupta's directive, the state health department has decided to launched a special vaccination drive to inoculate over 22,000 Tana Bhagats, who are spread over Ranchi and Lohardaga district. In a letter on Thursday, Gupta had directed the additional chief secretary (health) Arun Kumar Singh to make special arrangements to vaccinate the followers of Mahatma Gandhi at the earliest. He had also made an announcement in this regard while paying obeisance to tribal icon, Birsa Munda, on his death anniversary on Wednesday. Talking to TOI, Gupta said, “The community of Tana Bhagats are of immense importance to our society as they are like living heritage for our state and our government is committed towards their well-being. It is also good news for all of us that not a single member from the community has been infected from Covid-19 so far and it is the result of their lifestyle. To keep them in the best of health, I have directed the officials to start a special vaccination drive for the community.” In his letter, the minister also directed the authorities concerned that Tana Bhagats should not face any difficulty during the special drive and ensure that the sessions sites should be set up near their houses. "We have mobile vaccination vans across the state and these vehicles will also assist in inoculating the Tana Baghats at their doorsteps," he added. Reacting to Gupta's order, the health secretary said, "We will start vaccination of the Tana Bhagats soon and apart from identifying and establishing suitable session sites, our Covid vaccination mobile teams will also be deployed to inoculate the community.” According to the state government records, there are 3,600 households of the community with a total population of over 22,000 are mainly residents of Ranchi and Lohardaga districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-to-conduct-spl-vax-drive-for-tana-bhagats/articleshow/83414345.cms||Gaurav Pandey

The residents of Mali Mohalla in the locality claimed that a woman who had taken ill in the area due to contaminated water died. The residents had rushed to the ward office alleging that several persons in the locality were ill and a woman had died due to contaminated water. They ransacked the office and broke some glass of the office. A team of police personnel rushed to the office and brought the situation under control. The VMC did not file an offence regarding the incident. According to VMC officials, arrangements to provide water with a tanker were made immediately. They claimed that it took time to identify the fault that had led to the contamination. “We have found the fault in the Kothi area and the problem will be resolved,” said in-charge deputy municipal commissioner S K Naik. Officials, however, did not confirm if the death of a woman in the area had taken place due to contaminated water. “The residents say that the woman was hospitalized after she fell ill due to the water and died later,” said former corporator from the area Farid Lakhajiwala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/residents-allege-water-contamination-killed-a-woman-in-nagarwada-area/articleshow/83411038.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab economists describe MSP hike as just peanuts||CHANDIGARH: Punjab-based economists say that central government’s hike in the minimum support price (MSP) of crops for the Kharif season marketing season 2021-22 is meagre and going by the MS Swaminathan commission formula, there should have been at least 34% more MSP on paddy and 30% more on maize. These economists are also of the view that despite tall claims, the central government has failed to implement the MS Swaminathan commission report but at the same time the formula to calculate the MSP needs a serious review. Ranjit Singh Ghuman, professor of economics in the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) at Chandigarh, says, “As per my calculation, the MSP should at least be 34% more on paddy going by the MS Swaminathan formula. Similarly, in the case of maize, the MSP should be at least 30% higher than what the government has announced.” Whereas the Centre has increased the MSP of paddy by just 3.85% and that of the maize by 1.08%, he added. There are nearly 10.8 lakh farmers in Punjab. Professor Ghuman calculated the total quantity of paddy and wheat procured by the government agencies in Punjab in 2019-20 by applying the actual government MSP and also as per the Swaminathan MSP. “I found that farmers in Punjab got Rs 14,296 crore less for wheat and paddy in 2019-20 as per the government MSP as compared to the Swaminathan MSP formula,” he said while refuting tall claims of the government of implementing the Swaminathan formula. The hike in MSP of paddy is not even peanuts looking into the increase in the cost of production as the labour cost has increased during the Covid pandemic, says Satish Verma, RBI chair professor (economics) at CRRID. “This will push agriculture towards non-viability,” he added. Prof Verma said that the cost of diesel is witnessing continuous increase and even if the diesel component may be 1/20th of the cost of production, the so-called increased MSP is not going to even recover that cost. In terms of the increased labour cost, since big farmers are shifting to mechanisation, the small and marginal farmers would be at the bigger loss, he added. How can maize replace paddy? Maize which got a 5.1% increase in its MSP last year has just got a 1.08% hike this year. So, it is not favouring diversification and it shows that the government is not serious in promoting maize, says Prof Ghuman. This is also the result of our research mainly biased towards wheat and paddy to focus on the nation’s food security needs, he added. Similarly, Prof Verma said, “We project maize as an alternative to paddy in Punjab. Leave aside the increase in its MSP this year, when its MSP was Rs 1,850 per quintal last year, it was sold anywhere between Rs 700 and Rs 1,200 per quintal in Punjab.” Prof Ghuman says that from 2010 onwards, the central government has been pushing for reducing the areas under water-guzzling paddy but there are no efforts on the ground, which shows that these are mere sermons. “The Punjab government is time and again writing to the Centre to permit it to prepare Ethanol from maize but the required permission is still awaited,” he added. Need to change MSP calculation formula The economists also feel that the formula to calculate the MSP needs a serious review as per the Ramesh Chand committee report submitted to the central government in 2015 which said while calculating the cost of crop rearing, at least head of the family should be valued at skilled worker wage rate and management cost should also be there. “But this issue has not been addressed by the central government till date,” says Prof Ghuman. This ‘so-called’ Swaminathan MSP of A2 + FL x 50% is much below the comprehensive cost of C2+50% being demanded by the farmers, he added. There are so many factors that play their role since the sowing of the crop till its harvest such as the hike in the cost of diesel, fertilisers, pesticides, machinery and labour besides many unforeseen circumstances like the weather conditions which increase the cost of production. Focus on pulses, oilseeds In last year’s Kharif policy, it has been specifically written that Punjab should shift to the production of pulses and oilseeds. “We spent a lot in terms of foreign exchange for the import of pulses and oilseeds. But to save that, the government should incentivise the production of pulses and oilseed through price policy intervention, research and development,” said Prof Ghuman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-economists-describe-msp-hike-as-just-peanuts/articleshow/83416712.cms||Sanjeev Verma

The two Indian origin British residents told Caribbean news outlet Writeups24 on Wednesday that they had never met or seen Choksi or were connected to his alleged girlfriend Barbara Jarabica. The news portal quoted Gurjit Bhandal as saying he was a resident of Midlands, the UK, and had come to Antigua with his friend Gurmit Singh on May 23 and sailed the same day to reach Dominica at night. He said his customs clearance certificate was proof of his departure time. He said the they had booked the yacht online before their arrival. The captain of ‘Calliope of Arne’ yacht had two days ago made a similar statement, disputing claims made by Choksi’s lawyers that he was abducted and brought by ‘Calliope of Arne’ to Dominica. Another news outlet claimed Choksi was declared a ‘prohibited person’ by the Dominican ministry of national security. A letter dated May 25, addressed to Choksi and signed by minister for national security Rayburn Blackmoore, said Choksi was declared a prohibited immigrant. “You are not permitted to enter Dominica and the chief of police has been instructed to take all necessary actions to have you repatriated,” the letter said. Writeups24 had earlier quoted an aide of Choksi, Govin, as saying that he had heard from the diamantaire about the latter’s plan to go to Cuba where he allegedly owned a safe house. Govin, according to the site, claimed that Choksi had citizenship of another Caribbean country. Meanwhile, the British police have opened an investigation into allegations that Choksi was kidnapped in Antigua and tortured there and en route to Dominica where he is being held in detention. The UK police took up the matter as four of the group that Choksi claims abducted him in Antigua, which include Barbara Jabarica, reside in the UK. Barbara and one of the other alleged abductors lives in London, TOI understands, and two of the men live in Birmingham. Of the alleged three male abductors, one is a UK national, one an Indian national and one is a St Kitts and Nevis national, sources said. ED may charge Choksi’s wifeED may include Mehul Choksi’s wife Priti Choksi’s name in its supplementary chargesheet in the PNB scam, reports Vijay V Singh. ED has been investigating Priti since last year and had summoned her twice, but she didn’t turn up. Source said Priti was the ultimate beneficial holder of Hillingdon Holdings, incorporated in Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai and was the sole shareholder of Goldhawk DMCC. Several firms of Choksi including DMCC were created for the beneficial interest of Choksi, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/never-met-him-2-uk-desis-refute-choksis-claim-of-abduction/articleshow/83419993.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Sagar allegedly murdered his younger brother Prabhakar, 41, on Tuesday evening, police said, after a petty scuffle broke out between the siblings. Ponda DySP Nelson Albuquerque said the accused had confessed to the crime. It may be recalled that in 2012, Sagar was convicted for murdering his elder brother. He was released in 2016 after undergoing imprisonment for the same. The recent case came to fore after Sagar's wife reached home in the evening to find her brother-in-law Prabhakar in a pool of blood. She called 100 and informed the police. A team, led by DySP Albuquerque rushed to the spot and found Prabhakar’s body with his face smashed. The weapon used in the murder was not been found, until late Wednesday, police said. The EMRI (108) ambulance medical attendant declared Prabhakar dead on the spot. The police officer said the accused, who was also injured, had been arrested after being discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. A case of murder has been registered under section 302 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/accused-remanded-in-ponda-fratricide-case/articleshow/83383244.cms||---

He said the government had not enforced strict lockdown and a lot of people had not complied with lockdown guidelines. “It is like rolling out a red carpet to coronavirus,” Ramadoss said in a statement. Citing the Madras high court order expressing disappointment over the non-implementation of strict lockdown, the PMK leader said the number of Covid-19 cases had dropped to around 17,000 cases a day from the peak when the state recorded around 35,000 cases. Though the number of cases declined, it was not the time to let the guard down, he said. The neighbouring states like Karnataka and Kerala were continuing strict lockdowns though the number of cases was less than Tamil Nadu, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pmk-leader-s-ramadoss-calls-for-strict-enforcement-of-lockdown-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/83420082.cms||---
---||Business||GST Council to decide on O2, concentrators tax tomorrow||NEW DELHI: The all-powerful GST Council, chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, will meet on June 12 to decide on a GST rate cut for several goods related to combating Covid, amid indications that states are no longer interested in pressing for a revision in the levy on vaccines. The change in states’ posture comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to rework the vaccine policy, with the Centre now procuring 75% of the production, which will be transferred to the states. After protesting on the issue, states seem to have abandoned their opposition since it no longer impacts their purchases. The other recommendations of the group of ministers (GoM) set up by the GST Council will, however, figure on the agenda. The panel, which submitted its report earlier this week, has recommended a cut in levies for several products, but has refrained from either waiving GST completely or reducing it to a bare minimum, something that the Opposition-led states were demanding. From oxygen concentrators to medical grade oxygen and testing kits, the panel is said to have recommended a 5% levy as a temporary measure. The demand from some of the states include cutting GST on PPE kits, masks and hand sanitisers. UP FM Suresh Kumar Khanna, who is also a member of the GoM, had on Wednesday said the state is in favour of cutting taxes on Covid essentials to facilitate patients, but will accept the decision of the GST Council on tax rates. The Council’s decision to set up a ministerial panel had faced flak from the Opposition, which wanted an immediate cut, and had also called the Centre “heartless”, a charge that Sitharaman suggested was not justified, given that the panel is a permanent body, which had decided to go by a formula of revenue-neutral rates at the time of the GST launch four years ago to protect revenue. Recent meetings of the Council have witnessed Opposition states joining hands and trying to put the blame on the Centre. While Saturday’s meeting is expected to be largely confined to discussing the report of the GoM, some states are also expected to raise the issue of compensation. They are demanding that the compensation period should be extended by another five years, beyond the July 22 deadline. Some states are also demanding that the borrowing limits need to be raised to 5% of GSDP (gross state domestic product), without any conditions to enable them to raise funds to deal with the impact of cyclones and other natural calamities. The meeting is also likely to deliberate on Punjab FM Manpreet Badal’s demand for discussion in the GST Council for the need to obtain Council’s approval for decisions taken by the GST Implementation committee, as it does not have the powers to make rules. There is a view among states that the Council’s authority is being eroded and some states are likely to raise the issue forcefully during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-council-to-decide-on-o2-concentrators-tax-tomorrow/articleshow/83420084.cms||---
---||Business||Companies offer freebies to boost vax drive||NEW DELHI: Businesses ranging from Celio and McDonald’s to UCO Bank and Reliance General Insurance have jumped on the national effort to vaccinate the domestic population by offering freebies, including loyalty points, discounts and higher rates of interest on fixed deposits. While over 24 crore people across India or around 22% of the population have already received the vaccine against Covid-19 as of June 10, showed government data, these companies are aiming to lure those who are still hesitant to get the jab. “Vaccination is a marketing opportunity, as it will dominate the imagination of consumers for a long time to come,” said Harish Bijoor, brand expert and founder at Harish Bijoor Consults. It is still unclear, however, whether a 20% discount on a burger or loyalty points added to a card by a retailer is enticing enough for a person to get vaccinated. On Monday, for instance, South Delhi resident Ram received a text message from Celio that said the French clothing company will add 300 points to his loyalty ID if he gets vaccinated. Ram, 32, is still waiting for his first dose. Similarly, banks such as UCO Bank and Central Bank have launched schemes related to vaccination. Reliance General Insurance, too, is offering a 5% discount on a product to encourage vaccination. “We are optimistic that a mass vaccination drive will play a pivotal role in ensuring public safety at large and thereby in reviving businesses,” Rajeev Ranjan, COO at Connaught Plaza Restaurants that operates McDonald’s restaurants in North and East India, told TOI. And while welfare organisations in a village in Tamil Nadu are holding a lucky draw for people to get vaccinated, offering winners biryani, washing machines and two-wheelers, Kochi’s Malabar Gold & Diamonds has earmarked Rs 8 crore for one lakh free Covid-19 vaccines for those who are facing difficulty in accessing them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-offer-freebies-to-boost-vax-drive/articleshow/83420119.cms||John Sarkar

A rapid adoption of cloud, as people continue to work remotely and companies adopt a hybrid work model, is also expected to help IT service providers who have been assisting clients shift from on-premise IT infrastructure. “These initiatives together will result in a significant technological transformation across multiple industries which gives us long term visibility in the overall demand environment and we are gearing up for that,” Gopinathan said at the second virtual annual general meeting of TCS on Thursday. Such transformation, Gopinathan added, helped TCS boost its total contract value last fiscal by 17% to $31.6 billion. While 97% of the employees globally continue to work from home, the company said going ahead the nature of the work place will be hybrid. “Hybrid will be the new normal. There is no definite answer where the world will go. People need to meet people; it’s a social necessity. There will be a shift towards moving people to work when the pandemic gets over,” said chairman N Chandrasekaran, adding that while office space will be needed, occupancy levels will be down. 5% of the company’s 488,000 employees were down with Covid, of whom 80% have recovered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/multi-year-tech-upgrades-to-benefit-tcs/articleshow/83420125.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Panel report tells how to end Punjab Congress factionalism||CHANDIGARH: The three-member AICC panel led by Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, set up to end factionalism in the Punjab Congress, submitted its report to party chief Sonia Gandhi on Thursday based on feedback from party MLAs, MPs and other party leaders in the state. Sources said where the panel has made a case for suitably accommodating former cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, along with strengthening of the organisational structure ahead of the next assembly elections, besides fair representation in the party and government positions to the Sikhs, Hindus and the Dalits. More political appointments as heads of boards and corporations, more representation to various communities and a new PPCC too have been recommended, said the sources. However, it is learnt that the panel has not suggested any change in leadership in the state and that Amarinder should continue at the helm. Sidhu’s nature of political rehabilitation left to SoniaThe panel has left the nature of political rehabilitation of Sidhu to Sonia Gandhi, said the sources. The panel is also believed to have taken note of Amarinder’s defence against his detractors, including that inaccessibility was not an issue during the Covid-19 crisis. It is believed that a section of the party MLAs in the state had conveyed to the panel various shortcomings in the functioning of their own party’s government, including the influence of the bureaucracy and the overall style of functioning of the leadership. “It would be a tough call on Sidhu. The CM has been against making him the PPCC chief. But there could be other options such as head of the campaign committee,” said a party leader. The panel has also underlined the need for effective steps to bring a sense of closure on the emotive sacrilege cases, said the sources. Earlier in the day, Congress in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat told media persons that the panel had submitted a partial report to Sonia Gandhi and the draft report is ready. The remaining report addressing specific issues is also being submitted, he said. A section of Cabinet ministers too has also dithered in supporting Amarinder in wake of the latter’s verbal spat with Sidhu. This has even prompted the Amarinder camp to launch a campaign #CaptFor2022 to support him. Rawat had been advocating the need to bring Sidhu back to the fore, especially in view of the Punjab elections being around the corner. Meanwhile, there has been talk of creating a post of deputy CM, changes in the Cabinet and the possibility of appointing working presidents. However, the decision will be taken by Sonia Gandhi, said party leaders. Rahul Gandhi had himself spoken to a dozen party MLAs, the first-hand feedback that he got would also be crucial when the party high command decides on the recommendations of the panel, they added. Rahul had called up the MLAs on ‘Telegram’ before the panel launched the feedback exercise last week. It is believed that three Cabinet ministers again met panel member Harish Rawat on Tuesday and flagged some more issues that had contributed to the party’s negative perception.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/panel-report-tells-how-to-end-punjab-congress-factionalism/articleshow/83420124.cms||---
---||Chennai||At this rate, it will take three years to vaccinate all the adults in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: At the present speed of vaccination, Tamil Nadu will take at least three years to complete vaccinating its adult population. Tamil Nadu has 5.8 crore adults, who will require 11.6 doses of the vaccine (two doses each). Between June 1 and June 9, the state has vaccinated an average of 92,000 people a day. This means, if vaccine supplies do not improve, the state will take 1,149 days to vaccinate people above 18 years. The number of people vaccinated is proportional to the number of vaccines available, said Dr K Vinay Kumar, joint director (immunisation). “We have vaccinated more than 3 lakh people in a day. This week we vaccinated 2.8 lakh people. But when supplies dwindled, it came down to just 12,000,” he said. Almost 96% of the vaccines supplied have been used in the state. Until June 9, 18% of target doses were administered to people above 45 years and 2.38% of people in 18-44 years of age. Senior virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore said 'hyper-immunising' people with available vaccines can result in very high immunity (both antibody and T-cell immunity). “That will enlarge the umbrella of protection against the current variants and even new variants. It is the best tool we have now to prevent subsequent waves,” he said. The percentage of people fully covered with the vaccine varied in different districts. For instance, nearly 45% of people above 45 years in Chennai and 48% in Nilgiris have taken the vaccine. In health units such as Cheyyar and Tiruvannamalai it’s 8%. A combination of factors including hesitancy and availability played a role in the rate of vaccination, say health officials. What has worried experts is not just low levels of vaccinations, but also health department interpretation of existing data. Over the last ten days, the state has been adding the 32% of people who tested positive for antibodies in phase 1 of the sero survey with 17% of vaccination coverage to show that 49% have protection against the virus. But experts say this could lead to gross underestimation of people who are still susceptible to the infection. “Seropositivity rates and vaccination rates cannot be added because some seropositive individuals would have been vaccinated. Even with high levels of seropositivity and vaccination, we still have a large population that is unprotected. Increase in vaccine coverage will reduce the number of unprotected people over time,” said microbiologist Dr Gagandeep Kang.

The state government also told the court that it is in the process of installing and commissioning plants at the Goa Medical College, North Goa district hospital and ESI hospital. A 2,000 LPM PSA oxygen plant has been installed at GMC and a trial run done. “The same has not been connected to the oxygen line. The decision on the location of the connection will be made once the patient load in GMC is reduced,” undersecretary health Gautami Parmekar told the high court on Thursday. Getting on trackDuring the last hearing, the court was told that Goa Medical College would have to shut down one whole floor for optimum utilisation of the PSA oxygen plant, which will be done when the situation improves. Similarly, 1,000 LPM PSA oxygen plants have been delivered to the North Goa district hospital and ESI hospital and are in the process of being installed and commissioned. The government has stated that an oxygen plant is not proposed to be taken up at this stage at the Ponda sub-district hospital in the light of space constraints. The petitioners in the case had pointed out that the Prime Minister’s citizens assistance and relief in emergency situations (PM Care’s Fund Trust), a charitable trust, allocated Rs 201.58 crore for setting up of 162 PSA medical oxygen generation plants inside public health facilities in the country. It was submitted to the high court that two plants were sanctioned for Goa on January 5 and that these hadn’t been set up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/o2-plants-at-gmc-esi-and-north-hosp-ready-for-commissioning-state-to-hc/articleshow/83413844.cms||---

The e-commerce pioneer is offering unlimited medical insurance for its full-time employees, an updated policy covering all medical expenses and cost of hospitalisation, without employees having to pay any premium for it. Flipkart employs over 15,000 full-time employees in India. The new policy will continue even in the post-pandemic world. Coronavirus: Live updatesThe family support policy is for bereaved employees, and the benefit will be implemented with retrospective effect from April last year, irrespective of the reason of death. The family of the deceased employee will be provided with a life cover to the value of five times of the employee’s CTC, along with a notice period settlement as per their contracts. It also supports the education needs of up to two children of deceased employees with Rs 1.2 lakh per annum per child. This support will be extended until the children turn 22. Flipkart will sponsor and extend the current medical insurance cover for the family for a period of 60 months. Krishna Raghavan, chief people officer at Flipkart, said, “Since the onset of the pandemic, we have gained valuable insights from the voices of our employees and a deep understanding of their priorities. We are keen to use these learnings to design and create policies that put employees at the centre stage.” Flipkart told TOI that the unlimited medical insurance is extended to only full-time employees and covers all health-related issues that require medical treatment irrespective of the cost of treatment. The insurance policy also includes mental wellbeing cover for all treatments, enhanced maternity limits, advanced procedures including robotic surgeries, IVF treatment, and non-medical and critical illness cover with lump sum payment. The company has also enabled an accelerated ESOP (employee stock option plan) vesting and future repurchase opportunity during liquidity events. It will also facilitate professional and independent planners to support the family of the deceased employee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/flipkart-staff-get-unlimited-health-cover/articleshow/83420142.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: PSC readies for group-I interviews from June 17||VIJAYAWADA: Notwithstanding controversies surrounding the group-I examination process, the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) has decided to conduct interviews of candidates who have cleared the mains examination from June 17. The group-I examination process has been steeped in controversy this time. In 2018, APPSC came out with a notification to fill 165 posts under the group-I cadre. The preliminary examinations were held in 2019 and 8,400 candidates cleared the exams. However, following the declaration of results for the preliminary examinations, a number of candidates moved the Andhra Pradesh high court alleging that there were incorrect questions on the question paper. Acting on the high court’s verdict, the public service commission cleared another 1,200 applicants to take the mains exam. A total of 6,700 candidates appeared for the group-I (mains) in December 2020. Subsequently, making a sweeping change, APPSC decided to switch to digital evaluation of the group-I mains exam by hiring services of a third party. A section of candidates was unhappy over the change and nearly 500 of them moved the high court raising serious concerns about the digital evaluation mode adopted by APPSC. In their petition to the high court, candidates alleged that APPSC has not taken the experiences of Karnataka, Manipur and other states into consideration before switching to digital evaluation. They claimed that the adoption of digital evaluation has led to controversies. According to one of the candidates who moved court, Karnataka public service commission implemented digital evaluation with prior information in the notification, but APPSC did not mention anything of the sort. “We would have played a different ball game like answering all questions of one subject and only then starting on questions of new subjects in the answer booklet had APPSC mentioned digital evaluation in the notification,” the candidate said. Candidates said that the examination conducted by Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) for recruitment of gazetted probationary officers (group A and B) has also run into controversy after several candidates filed petitions in the high court seeking a CBI probe into the digital evaluation after KPSC reportedly refused to share information about marks obtained by successful candidates. The Karnataka HC has taken up the case. Candidates further argued that the CBI has been directed to probe the Manipur civil service examination after the state recruitment board switched to digital evaluation in 2019. The Manipur high court suspended the examination before handing over the case to the CBI. Taking the apprehensions of candidates into consideration, the Andhra Pradesh high court has directed APPSC to file a detailed affidavit by June 14. Meanwhile, TDP national general secretary and MLC Nara Lokesh has demanded a CBI investigation into the digital evaluation. Lokesh interacted with several group-I candidates virtually on Thursday and extended his support. “The government should release the details of marks and answer sheets of selected candidates to come clean,” said Lokesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/psc-readies-for-group-i-interviews-from-june-17/articleshow/83411550.cms||Samdani MN

The deceased was identified as Chirumamilla Mahankali. Tadepalli police said he was depressed that both his wives were unable to bear children for him, and that could be the reason behind his taking the extreme step. Locals saw him jumping into the river in the morning and tried to rescue him but it was too late by the time he could be pulled out. He was identified on the basis of his cell phone which he had left behind before jumping into Krishna. The deceased was the son of Chirumamilla Kumari, who works with Guntur municipal corporation. Mahankali first got married two years ago and after all efforts to conceive a child failed, he took his first wife’s permission and married another woman. However, she too couldn’t conceive, which led to Mahankali gradually slipping into depression.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/man-jumps-into-krishna-after-wives-fail-to-conceive/articleshow/83411595.cms||---

As per her complaint, she got married to a man working in a private consultancy firm in Vijayawada on April 4. Her family agreed to the alliance and paid around Rs 10 lakh in dowry as the man said he planned to pursue higher studies in Canada and later settle down there with their daughter. After she moved to her in-laws’ place, she came to know that her husband was impotent. The next day, while the groom’s family was making arrangements for the reception in Vijayawada, the girl informed her parents about it who then confronted the groom’s family members and returned home with their newly-wed daughter when a consensus on the issue could not be reached. Police said the groom’s family members demanded Rs 8 lakh which they spent for the reception in Vijayawada which was eventually cancelled. His relatives also visited the girl’s village in Pinapadu where heated arguments took a violent turn resulting in physical assault of her parents. The woman then lodged a police complaint following which a case was registered against the groom and his family members, who have been summoned to the police station for questioning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/newly-wed-files-harassment-plaint-against-her-in-laws/articleshow/83411653.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Deputy collectors to verify documents of travellers seeking 2nd jab||PANAJI: The state government has designated deputy collectors as competent authorities to verify the urgency for reducing the gap between vaccine doses from 84 days to 28 days for those travelling internationally for work, education and the Olympics. State immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar told TOI that those who have to travel urgently under these categories will have to get themselves qualified by the deputy collectors by producing proof of documents. Borkar said that there are only around 27,000 doses left from the 18-44 quota.“But second doses after 28 days cannot start until the portal is updated. They will have to wait until the portal opens for these groups. Only then will they be permitted to get vaccinated earlier. It has not opened yet and could open any time,” Borkar told TOI. Presently, only those in priority groups with required documentation in the 18-44 age group can get vaccinated. These include lactating mothers, parents of children up to the age of 15, persons with disabilities, those with comorbidities, auto rickshaw and taxi drivers and motorcycle pilots and seafarers. Undersecretary health II Gautami Parmekar submitted to the HC on Thursday that, due to the vaccine shortage for the priority groups in the 18-44 category, the government is utilising the quota of doses meant for the 45-plus group. As against the 5 lakh doses of Covishield that the state govt sought to procure, it has received only 60,460 doses in two batches. Borkar said that there are only around 27,000 doses left from the 18-44 quota. The government, in its affidavit, stated that to ensure maximum utilisation of doses supplied for the 45+, sessions for health care workers, frontline workers and other 45+ beneficiaries are being held on all days at government health centres. “Sessions are being conducted at workplaces, near houses through panchayat and tika utsav, for beneficiaries without ID cards and old age homes,” Parmekar stated. The government has undertaken vaccination of inmates at Colvale jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dy-collectors-to-verify-docus-of-travellers-seeking-2nd-jab/articleshow/83413903.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Pesticides in fields turn killers for sarus cranes||AHMEDABAD: Feeding grounds of sarus crane, a threatened species in India and vulnerable across the world as per International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are most likely turning into their killing fields, researchers studying the cause for their dwindling have found. Sarus cranes live close to human habitation and depend on food grains as their primary food source. However, pesticides used in fields pose a major threat to the birds by either killing them or affecting their calcium metabolism and making the shells of their eggs very fragile, according to researchers of the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON). The SACON recently carried out a study ‘Assessment of status, distribution and threats to the population of threatened Sarus Crane Antigone in Gujarat’. “It was observed that chlorpyrifos (one of the most widely used active ingredients in agricultural insect control products) showed strong relation with eggshell thickness. However, due to lack of published information on the role of chlorpyrifos in eggshell thinning, we are unable to make any interpretation. Nevertheless, the presence of chlorpyrifos residue in the eggs is a matter of concern since its metabolite is a proven reproductive toxicant,” the study stated. ‘Pesticides interfere with calcium supply’SMuralidharan, the incharge director of SACON, said, “Use of certain pesticides results in reduced calcium metabolism. It interferes with supply of calcium that is essential for eggshell formation. If the eggshell is thin, it will be crushed as soon as the mother sits on it for hatching and will definitely reduce the population of sarus cranes.” Muralidharan, who was also the principal investigator in the study, said that pesticides also result in the death of the birds. The study said that it could indirectly harm the already endangered bird by reducing its food base. “It is a fact that birds have the tendency to skip breeding if they do not perceive food security to raise chicks,”it said. Also, there is a huge possibility that it ingests pesticides while feeding on treated seeds. Of the 15 species of cranes found in the world, six are found in India. Only sarus crane (Grus Antigone) is a resident species. The highest numbers of observations of sarus crane were recorded in the districts of Ahmedabad (39%) followed by Anand (36%), and Kheda (11%). The study states that the calculated population was estimated to be around1,788. The study states that “tissues of seven birds collected from three districts for toxicological investigations. The presence of chlorpyrifos, HCH, DDT, endosulfan and heptachlor were detected frequently. While endosulfan and heptachlor were the least-detected pesticides, chlorpyrifos was detected more frequently in the tissues.” A total of 179 food samples of sarus crane comprising rice paddy, wheat, fish, and insects were collected and 42 pooled samples were analyzed for pesticide residue. Among the 67 pesticides analyzed, 12 pesticides were detected and of these chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected pesticide followed by thiamethoxam. While 104 samples of soil were collected from nesting and congregation sites, 60 pooled samples were analyzed for residues of pesticides. Of the 67 pesticides for which analysis was done, 23 pesticides were found at varying levels. The study suggested, “It is adequately clear that problems due to pesticides exist at varying magnitudes in the state. Advising complete halt on chemicals might be the easiest recommendation, but practice may not be possible at once.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-pesticides-in-fields-turn-killers-for-sarus-cranes/articleshow/83420146.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

He made the comments during a conference preceding G7 summit, which starts on Friday. The WHO conducted an inquiry this year into the origins of the virus, which first appeared Wuhan in late 2019. The study concluded that “introduction through a lab incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway” but was widely seen as incomplete because of China’s limited cooperation. Last month, Biden ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the origins, an indication that the US was taking seriously the possibility that the virus had accidentally leaked. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, highlighted that “investigators need complete access to information and to sites” to “develop the right tools to make sure this will never happen again.” In Britain’s parliament, UK health minister Matt Hancock said there needs to be a fully independent probe that is allowed to take place without interference in China. “P- art of the reforms that we need is to make sure we can properly find answers.” NYT & REUTERS||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/eu-uk-leaders-join-calls-for-full-probe-into-covid-origins/articleshow/83420161.cms||---

The bench of justices K Vijaya Lakshmi and D Ramesh said it will seek reports from joint collectors across the state for not vaccinating senior citizens who have taken shelter at various old-age homes. Amicus curiae YV Ravi Prasad submitted to the court — which was hearing a PIL filed by some social activists and advocates seeking directions to the government to take necessary measures to contain Covid-19 and black fungus cases in the state — that senior citizens can’t wait in long queues to get Aadhaar cards and urged the court to give directions for their vaccination. Special government pleader C Suman submitted that the Union health ministry has issued guidelines permitting submission of one of six identity proofs other than Aadhaar. He also told the court that inmates of old-age homes would be vaccinated soon. On black fungus, assistant solicitor general N Harinadh informed the court that 3,91,060 vials of Amphotericin-B injection have been allocated to various states by the Centre, out of which 34,010 vials were allocated to AP for treatment of mucormycosis. The AP government submitted that 1,350 black fungus patients are getting treatment while 110 patients died from mucormycosis-related complications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vaccinate-senior-citizens-living-in-old-age-homes-on-priority-hc/articleshow/83411706.cms||Venu Lanka

It has filed an affidavit to this effect after the high court sought details about making the hospital fully functional for a possible third wave of Covid-19 and in view of the extreme shortage of beds witnessed earlier at the premier medical institution that treats the most critical of Covid-19 patients. “So far, 550 beds are put on all the floors of the superspecialty block, except for first and eighth floors which are earmarked as the administrative blocks,” under-secretary health II, Gautami Parmekar, stated. The block has over 230 Covid-19 patients under treatment. The GMC is currently treating 15 mucormycosis patients too. The Centre has allocated 520 vials of amphotericin to Goa for the purpose, of which 517 vials have been received till June 9. “Looking at the rise in the cases of mucormycosis in GMC, a further requisition of 800 vials of amphotericin is being made to the FDA director,” Parmekar stated. Regarding fire safety, the government stated that it is carrying out an electrical audit of equipment at hospitals and care centres. Right now the audit is taking place at the GMC while the same will be conducted shortly at the stadiums in Taleigao, Fatorda and Pernem. It also submitted that it has approved in-principle the recommendations of the expert panel made at a meeting on May 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-floors-of-superspecialty-commissioned-says-govt/articleshow/83413935.cms||---

In a response to allegations by opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami that people were losing financial benefits/compensations from the centre and state because of underreporting of Covid-19 cases, Subramaniam said the state diligently follows the “Guidance for appropriate recording of Covid-19 related deaths in India” issued by the ICMR- National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research. “Patients come to the hospital nearly two weeks after onset of symptoms when they are breathless. They are positive on admission and later die of cardiac arrest or lung failure. When they die they are tested negative for the viral infection. This is how the state declared deaths in the first wave,” he said, citing examples of playback singer SP Balasubrahmanyam and MP H Vasanth Kumar. “Both of them were admitted for treatment of Covid-19. SPB’s last rites took place amidst state honours after he was declared negative. Vasanth Kumar also died after he tested negative,” he said. But senior doctors and ICMR officials say not reporting such deaths accurately could lead to gross underreporting. The ICMR guidelines detail how Covid-19 deaths should be recorded and reported along with example scenarios. The forms 4 and 4a asks the treating doctors to write down the underlying cause, contributing/ antecedent factors and immediate cause. “While a cardiac arrest may be the mode of death, lung failure would have caused it. If the underlying cause for lung failure is Covid-19, then death should be recorded as due to Covid” said ICMR-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research Director Dr Prashant Mathur. “Also, the National Covid treatment guidelines do not recommend repeating covid RTPCR tests during Covid treatment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/deaths-will-not-be-counted-as-covid-if-patients-test-negative-says-tamil-nadu-health-minister-ma-subramanian/articleshow/83420192.cms||---

ERC said that purchases during December, 2020 and January, 2021 caused an unnecessary burden of Rs 48 crore to the firms. ERC said that it analysed power purchases by the discoms during the two months and concluded that they have not purchased power available at lower prices. “The discoms have failed to purchase and dispatch about 1,036 million units of power at lower prices available in power exchanges resulting in a loss of savings to the tune of Rs 48 crore,” said ERC in its notice to the discoms. It said that it was violation of the permissions granted in retail purchase order issued by the ERC for 2020-21. “It said that had the above energy of 1036.03 MU been dispatched during the period from 17.12.2020 to 15.01.2021, the weighted average variable cost of which is lesser than the weighted average landed cost of energy from the exchanges, there could have been a potential saving of Rs 48.14 crore to the discoms,” said ERC. It directed the discoms to submit the reasons for not dispatching power at lower variable cost to the extent of full capacities before June, 30. It said that discoms should not procure purchase at higher than the prescribed costs without prior permission from the commission. It directed the discoms not to purchase over and above the quantum allowed against each station/source unless otherwise approved by the commission. Meanwhile, CMDs of discoms in a statement clarified that the discoms have actually saved Rs 22.7 crore during the said period owing to market purchases. They said that absolutely there is no loss of Rs 48 crore as assessed by APERC and the issue would be taken to the notice of the ERC. They said that ERC erred in calculating availability of energy from the approved sources. “The Commission ought to have considered real time availability as declared by the approved sources. Instead, it considered normative approved availability given in the Retail Supply Tariff Order. Commission has erroneously calculated hypothetical loss comparing to energy from power plants which was unavailable at that time,” they said. The statement said that the average price of market purchases for the above period was Rs 3.38 per kWh while the average price of alternate power available during that period from the approved sources was Rs 3.68 per kWh. It explained that there was a savings of Rs 0.3 per kWh, which accounts to total saving of Rs 22.7 crore. “The discoms have failed to purchase and dispatch about 1,036 million units of power at lower prices available in power exchanges resulting in a loss of savings to the tune of Rs 48 crore,” said Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission in its notice to the discoms||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/aperc-issues-notices-to-discoms-for-buying-power-at-higher-price/articleshow/83411881.cms||Samdani MN

---||Vijayawada||Farmers urged to grow popular paddy varieties in Andhra Pradesh||AMARAVATI: Civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar made an appeal to farmers not to cultivate paddy varieties that are not consumed in the state. He said farmers should follow the agriculture department’s guidelines on preferred varieties to be sowed in order to reap rich dividends. He said farmers should approach officials at nearest Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) for guidance. Speaking to the media here on Thursday, Sasidhar said that production of non-saleable varieties would only create slump in the market and force farmers to distress sale. He said the state government is procuring every grain of paddy during the ongoing rabi season to bail them out of the market crisis induced by Covid-19. He said the state government has set a record in paddy procurement during rabi with a purchase of 25.25 lakh metric tonnes. “This is a new record during rabi. Our field level staff braved all odds to help farmers and purchased massive quantum of paddy,” said Sasidhar. He said they would be procuring nearly 45 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in the next two months. He said it was almost 110 per cent increase in procurement since 2015 when the government procured around 20 lakh MT. He said they have launched procurement operations through 7,706 Rythu Bharosa Kendras and 3,936 paddy procurement centres. He said that they were picking up the stock right from the farmers’ field once they approached the RBK with the sample. He said that moisture and sample grain testing would be done at the RBK and stock would be lifted from the field. “We will continue the procurement operations till the purchase of the last grain. No farmer is required to sell their stock less than the MSP either to middlemen or rice mills,” said Sasidhar. He said that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the finance department to clear the dues without waiting for remittances from the Centre. He said the Centre is yet to clear Rs 3,299 crore toward paddy procurement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/farmers-urged-to-grow-popular-paddy-varieties/articleshow/83411924.cms||Samdani MN

A sessions court in Surat permitted NRI Zakir Patel from Bharuch, who holds a UK citizenship, to extend his stay in Britain for one more year after he cited that India was put on the Red List by the UK government and he is advised not to travel. This is the second extension granted to Patel on grounds of the Covid-19 pandemic. Patel faces a trial in Surat for possessing fake currency after he was booked in a criminal case by the Surat crime branch on his trip to India in 2017. Patel along with others was allegedly found in possession of fake currency. Patel is a teacher and runs coaching classes in London. When he was granted bail in 2017, the court in Surat imposed various restrictions including a ban on travel outside Gujarat and to deposit his passport with the court. However, later the court permitted him to go back to the UK and pursue his livelihood for a certain period. He was supposed to return to India and deposit his passport back. However, he filed an application in December 2020 and sought extension in his stay in the UK on the ground of Covid-19 pandemic. He was granted permission to stay for six more months in the UK. As his UK stay permission was expiring, he filed another application through advocate Rafik Lokhandwala and submitted that due to the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic at global level and in the UK, the UK government has imposed restrictions on movements of the citizens and their travelling abroad. Therefore, it would be practically impossible for him to visit India by following the last court order and seeking permission to stay further in the UK for two more years. Patel also produced a document to show that India has been placed in the Red List and argued that he has been advised not to travel. After perusal of documents, additional sessions judge B A Tailor said on Wednesday, “The say of the applicant is well corroborated by the documentary evidence produced on record.” Granting another extension to stay in the UK on the ground of the prevalent pandemic situation, the court also observed that except the contention of causing delay in trial, nothing adverse has come on record against Patel from the prosecution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-helps-nri-facing-trial-in-gujarat-stay-put-in-uk/articleshow/83420190.cms||Saeed Khan

The deceased was identified as Lakshmi (25). Visannapeta sub-inspector P Kishore said the incident happened on Wednesday night during a heated argument between Lakshmi and her husband Durga Rao, who reportedly was suspecting her fidelity for the past few months. Tempers flared and in an impulsive move, Rao took a kitchen knife and stabbed his wife to death. When he realised the gravity of the crime, Rao fled from the spot. Neighbours, who rushed to the spot after hearing her cries, found her dead and immediately informed the police. Preliminary inquiry revealed that Rao and Lakshmi fell in love and got married last year on June 10. Sadly, she never got to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Cops sent Lakshmi’s body to a local government hospital in Tiruvuru town for post-mortem. A case has been registered under section 302 of IPC (murder) against Durga Rao at Visannapeta police station. A manhunt has been launched to track down Rao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/man-stabs-wife-to-death-a-day-before-first-anniv/articleshow/83411963.cms||---

The initial charter led to the United Nations and Nato. The new one looks to defend “enduring values” and is aimed at the challenge posed by countries like China and Russia with its promises to promote free trade, human rights and a rules-based international order, and to counter “those who seek to undermine our alliances and institutions.” “The PM and President concurred that the revitalised Atlantic Charter published today was a fitting testament to the sheer breadth and depth of the cooperation between our countries,” a Downing Street spokesperson said. “They resolved to take this cooperation further by expanding trade and progression towards a future UK-US Free Trade Agreement. They covered a number of foreign policy issues, including Afghanistan, China, Iran and Russia. They also agreed that the UK-US partnership was more important than ever as we tackle shared challenges like climate change and the coronavirus pandemic.” After their first in-person discussion, Johnson said: “The talks were great... it’s a breath of fresh air.” Biden called the talks "productive”.

Punjab’s last seven-day average of tests per million population has slipped below the national average after staying ahead for long. However, it continues to be better than the neighbouring states of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Punjab was holding on to the fifth spot till June 5 among the worst-hit states by conducting 2,164 tests per million against the all-India seven-day average of 1,951. As the number of daily tests dropped a few notches in the first week of June, Punjab's seven-day average of tests per million fell to 2,038 while the national average went up to 2,271 on June 9. During the second wave of the infection, the state government ramped up daily testing and conducted 42,977 tests on average per day in April, and increased it to 65,635 tests per day in May, the month which witnessed the highest number of cases and deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. The average daily count of tests has come down to 63,093 in the first nine days of June. During this period, 49,156 samples were examined on June 7, the lowest number of daily tests in 44 days. Punjab is using both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen test for detecting Covid. Testing is considered the most important factor in controlling the spread of the virus by identifying infected people early and isolating them. Explaining the reasons for less testing, Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said that besides routine testing, the health department had launched a campaign to screen suspected patients or patients showing symptoms. The people showing symptoms were tested using RAT. He further added that the exercise is now over as a result there has been a slight drop in the number of daily testing. "Despite that, the daily average test count is over 60,000, which is much better than many states," he added. So far, Punjab has conducted 32,901 tests per lakh population. For every lakh people in Punjab, 32,901 samples have been tested while 32,760 tests per lakh were carried out in Haryana, and 28,482 per lakh in Himachal Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-testing-falls-below-national-average-better-than-haryana-himachal-pradesh/articleshow/83420184.cms||Vinod Kumar
